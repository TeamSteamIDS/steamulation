												I must say I never played a Castlevania game before, so forgive me when I lack some background for a proper comparison to the previous installments. Overall this game is fairly good. It has some problems like the strange hitboxes which seem a bit off sometimes (you can get hit even though the enemy's attack actually didn't reach you and things like these), but this happens rarely. The other negative point is the static camera which sometimes positions not very idealy, preventing you from viewing parts of the screen and sometimes missing hidden areas. In terms of art direction this game is gorgeous. Mercury Steam really had some talent working on the world design of this game. If you like gothic european fantasy art styles, this game delivered in my opinion. Art direction is stunning at times and I even stopped for a few seconds here and there to eyeball the scenery. It's a very pretty looking game.The voice acting is also of decent quality. Story might not be god tier like, but it's still remains interesting with a few surprising plot twists in the second half of the game.What needs to be said is: The game takes a lot of time to get really started. The first levels are basically tutorials where you gain new equipment and movesets. It gets more interesting after the 3rd or 4th chapter.The combat is a bit comparable to God of War's. Your weapon is a whip-like chain that lets you perform direct attacks to center on single enemies or areal attacks for groups of enemies. You can mix these attacks and also learn new movesets and combos the more experience points you gather. These combos and attacks can be combined with the light and shadow powers you receive throughout the game. That way you pile up a nice plethora of combos and movesets at your disposal which gives the combat system enough depth to not get boring. Not Devil May Cry-tier but still nice.In short: Do you love european medieval gothic art styles and are looking for an action game with nice visuals and somewhat meaty combat system? Try it. Also try the demo first. Just know that the demo only represents the very beginning of the game and is not really a good indictation of how fleshed out the game gets.			"

												As someone who has never played the old Castlevania games I went blind to Lords of Shadow. I didn’t knew anything about the story other than that it involved vampires. The only thing that made me buy the game in the first place was the huge amount of positive reviews. And, like I usually do, I waited until I got the other two Castlevania games on Steam to start playing the first one. A few hours into the game, I was having a blast.From top notch music to gorgeous and memorable locations such as forests, gothic castles, desert lands and ruins from an old civilization, this game has it all. Combined witha fast paced action combat (with tons of unlockable combos) this made for quite the epic experience. Although enemy variety was somewhat lacking, certain locaitons had a specific set of enemies assigned to it, thus making it harder to forget those zones. As for the gameplay itself, as I mentioned before, it is quite fast paced. You have to adapt to changes in the enemy behavior, aswell as bosses, and use a variety of attacks to effectively defeat your foes. The game itself is rather long, taking around 20-22 hours to play it through, which was rather a surprise for me. Of course, for all the completionists and collectible hunters out there, Lords of Shadow also has something in store for you. The game is divided in 12 chapters (+2 chapters corresponding to the DLC included in the Ultimate Edition), and each of those chapters is subsequently divided into several stages. It is in these stages that you’ll be able to explore and collect scrolls containing letters from fallen brethren of the Brootherhood of Light, and you’ll also be able to find gems that enhance your abilities. And if you’re into bigger challenges, you can try completing Trials for said stages which, I believe, reward you with an achievement. So yeah, not only the game is a blast on its foundations, but it also rewards exploration, which, in my book, is always a plus.Now, enough talking about all the good things this game has, and lets talk about my only gripe with the game, the controls, or perhaps my terrible skills at precision platforming in a 3D game. I swear that sometimes the game just made me want to shove the controller through my monitor (anger issues perhaps?). Very rare were these situations, but they were infuriating when they occurred. I honestly can’t tell you if it was an issue with the controls, like the inability to control with precisio where you want to land or if I’m just really bad at jumping from platform to platform in a 3D game.That said, I can’t recommend this game enough. It is an epic journey through some amazing landscapes and it has one of the most insane and thrilling soundtracks I’ve ever heard on a videogame. Please, do yourself a favour and do not keep Lords of Shadow on your backlog.I hope these words accomplish my intended goal, which was raising awareness for a series that I feel that went under the radar for alot of PC gamers. Or perhaps that is just me, afterall, I have never played the old Castlevania games and I only played this one three years after its release, maybe that’s why.PS: Sorry for the wall of text.			"

												As I long time fan of the Castlevania series, I was exstatic to see it come to PC!  However, much to my disappointment I found this game lacking and I would not recommend it.  Stubbornly, I finished the game.The good?  Great voice acting, extremely beautiful environments, good music, and a fair story.The bad?  Well, everything else.  My number one gripe is the fixed camera.  As you navigate through the levels, the camera arbitarily positions itself.  You have no control over it whatsoever.  As a result exploring the levels, or pitching the camera to get an ideal vantage point for battle or movement is completely prohibited.  The game almost feels like 2.5D.There is none of the exploration or freedom you feel in games like Symphony of the Night.  Levels are extremely linear.  They are no alternate routes, like Dishonored, and there are ton of invisible walls.Combat is a mixed bag.  I used my Xbox 360 controller, which I don't mind at all.  Sometimes combat is fun, but there's a lot to control towards the middle-end game.  Double tap an analog controller to sprint?!?  Crazy bad game design there.There's also a ton of quick time events, a la the action is paused and you have to hit a button at a precious moment.  Really takes you out of the action.I guess I was hoping for something between Dark Souls and Darksiders, but this game was far too restrictive in the controls for my tastes.  I'd rate it a 5/10, and highly suggest people try the demo before buying!UPDATE: I'm puzzled why people would consider my review anything other than my opinion subject to my own preferences and playstyle.  Of course my view is subjective, I bare no responsibility to review the game objectively as would a professional journalist.  If you find Castlevania: LoS to your liking, then my opinion should have no baring on your enjoyment of the game.  However, your opinion does not invalidate my own opinion, it's just that it's your opinion.I think strong comparisons could be made to this game with Darksiders.  They have similar combat systems, incentives to revisit levels to unlock more upgrades, and similar settings.  Personally, I thought Darksiders did a much better job executing an action/adventure game.  The first big win is a positional camera.  The second would be just the way you explore the world, while not an open world it just feels like you have more freedom to choose your path than Castlevania.  Castlevania also suffers from a lot of invisible walls unlike Darksiders, where a lot of the platforming is nearly risk free.Again, if you haven't purchased the game yet, I strongly suggest trying the demo first.  I have not played Devil May Cry or Metalgear Rising, which may serve as a more fair comparison.  Maybe this game does very well satisfying gamers who find that type of game appealing.  Again, as I haven't played them I don't know how Castlevania compares.The game was good enough to complete, but not good enough for me to recommend.			"

												[This is a no spoilers review]Oof, this game, I really have mixed feelings about it. It has some incredible visuals and the soundtrack is also pretty nice. The story is decent, but not particularly noteworthy - although the general lore is interesting, if you like arthurian legend and vampires.But in the end, everything in this game is a mix of ups and downs. It almost feels like they didn't really know how to make games, but tried their hands on it anyway, just to get a format for their ideas. So many rules are broken, design inconsistencies, introducing mechanics to people then suddenly they work differently ""just because."" It can be a really frustrating experience, and most of the game is absolutely riddled with invisible walls (every single level will have you go ""wait, I can't go there?""), plus the fact that you have no control over the camera. There's platforms and jumping puzzles all over the place, but all of it is completely on rails. For example: You can't jump out from a wall, if there's nothing to jump out to and grab. This is a sign of lazy design, where instead of working on adequately communicating when the users SHOULD jump, they just don't let them jump at all, if there's nothing to jump to. It might not sound like much, but it feels incredibly restrictive, with absolutely no illusion of freedom at all.You can find a lot of general inspirations in this game, but it's almost like it has no idea if what it wants to be. It's all brooding and dark, but then there's the occassional joke they crack up, completely out of context, leaving you feeling very awkward afterwards. Unfortunately, lacking narrative and mechanical identity, means that it never does anything but visuals and music properly. In here, you'll see strains of Devil May Cry mostly, with the occassional ""Shadow of the Colossus"" moments, which are often very poorly implemented, lengthy and frustrating.I usually play DMC with the difficulty all the way up, because it feels rewarding to progress, thanks to the fact that its rules of play are consistent. But for this game, I ended up turning down the difficulty; because Lords of Shadow is really hard, but in a very frustrating way, by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all over its own rules from time to time. It takes all sense of user responsibility away, leaving you with no feeling of ""ouch that was my own fault, need to get better,"" but instead an ocean of ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!"" With ultimate edition especially, with the final boss in the extra chapters, they just end up going full retard, by telling you to ""watch the moves of the boss to avoid its attacks,"" while simultaneously forcing you to jump into the air where you can't dodge. There's about a fraction of a second for you to react, but if you're in a wrong position, you can get screwed hard and even stun-locked until you're dead. Not a nice experience.On the upside, at least, it is a pretty long game. If you want to stroll around and take in the environmental design, you'll be pleased to see just how varied the landscapes are.For the 25 euro asking price, I can't recommend it. However, if you ever see it on sale and want a lengthy, decently interesting experience, you should probably give this game a look. Just don't expect a very polished experience.[Edit]: Oh yeah, just thought that I'd add the fact, that despite the really stupid moments this game has, the rest of it still made well enough up for it, for me to sit through nearly 20 hours and completing the story. It's not a terrible game, but it's not amazing either. It just has content from both ends of the spectrum.Oh and for god's sake Gabriel, there is such a thing as too many dramatic pauses when you speak!			"

												When I first played this for Xbox 360 back in 2011, I fell in love instantly.  The gameplay, graphics, and music meshes together perfectly.  The soundtrack is one of  the best I've ever heard for any game.  Big thumbs up to Oscar Araujo for it.  There is incredible detail put into every level!  The game is decently long too.  It doesn't feel like it gets old either.  The levels are refreshing and there are a ton of boss fights.  There isn't really any ingenuity in the gameplay- I've seen it all elsewhere, but that's fine with me.  As long as it doesn't fail-  which it does not.I honestly think this game should've gotten Game of the Year back in 2011, instead of Skyrim.  I was extremely excited to re-purchase this for PC and cannot wait for the sequel!Rating: 5/5			"

												Fantastic game.Excellent voice acting, soundtrack and the overall sound design is meaty.Visuals are nothing but stunning, some of the best looking set pieces to be had. The fixed camera positioning can be annoying at times but most of the time it will not hinder any game play.The combat is very satisfying with a large number of combos and items which all can be combined with Light and Dark magic to aid you versus your foes.Rather than having tons of enemies attacking you at once there are fewer and stronger enemies compared to other games of the genre.The overall difficulty can be pretty tough at times, so be prepared to die a couple of times at the higher difficulties.This is especially true for the DLC's that are included.All in all this is a gem of a game.

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadows is an action adventure game, developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami Digital Entertainment. Releasing in August 2013 on PC, Xbox 360 and PS3. The game is set in South Europe during the Middle ages. This was a reboot of the Castlevania series, where you play as Gabriel and you follow his quest to revive his wife. Gameplay is played from a third person perspective. Your main weapon consists of a retractable chain, and you can learn up to forty different combos to use in the hack and slash combat system. As you progress through the story mode, you will learn new abilities along the way, as well as picking up new unique pieces of equipment which boast uses in both combat and non-combat situations. Gabriel will learn how to muster magical powers of light and dark. Light powers enable the player to heal any damage taken in fights by hitting enemies, whilst dark allows the player to deal extra damage. You are able to renew these magic powers by hitting a high string of attacks together without being interrupted, which will release magic orbs for you to collect. You will encounter tons of different types of enemies, from trolls, zombies, and spider’s right the way up to gigantic titans. Each enemy has their own strength and weakness which you will be able to use to your advantage. The boss fights throughout the game are some of the most intense scenes I have played in a game. Each boss has multiple different phases of fight, each requiring you to act in a different way. The titan boss fights are long processes which normally also require an element of platforming. These can become a little bit of a pain when you first start out the game as you are still learning how to use all of the mechanics but by the last titan boss fight, it shouldn’t pose any problems for a veteran titan killing machine.  Whilst the game does have an element of platforming in a few boss fights, the game also has small amounts of platforming included throughout the story mode too. Of course jumping puzzles are always going to be my biggest enemy, and sadly they also make an appearance and are as frustrating as usual. Graphically, Lords of Shadows is stunning; it is difficult to think that this game was released in 2013. It looks gorgeous. The cut scenes are almost a step down in graphical fidelity compared to the in game graphics. There is a huge different in how the game looks on PC compared to the consoles though. Animations throughout the game are all fluid and perfectly designed too. The sound effects are spot on, with some brilliant voice acting to be heard also from the likes of Patrick Stuart. The game has various levels of difficulty, and you can also change them on the fly. The easy mode is essentially just a way to see the story as the combat poses no real threat. Paladin mode is the game’s hard-core mode, where enemies are more dangerous and Gabriel is significantly weaker than usual. This will add an extra layer of replay ability to a game that already boasts over twenty five hours of content. On top of the lengthy story mode, each stage also has a “trial” for you to complete as well, these can be simple tasks such as completing the stage in less than a specified amount of time, or more challenging such as not being able to use your magic’s throughout the stage.  I initially thought I would be able to play the game on 4k resolution given the age of the title, but unfortunately, I was not able to, not because my rig was not powerful enough, but because when setting the resolution to anything over 1080p, the screen in game began to flicker violently – this required a hard reboot of my system before I was able to get back into the game to change the settings back to 1080p. I would also strongly recommend people play this game on a controller; it plays perfectly on an Xbox controller and the keyboard controls would just become a huge chore to anyone regardless of their skill. Overall, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is an underrated title that is definitely well worth your time in checking out. The game’s price tag of £19.99 is perfectly matched at the game’s length and production values. Fans of the series will be pleased with the amount of lore and plenty of tributes to older instalments in the franchise.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												I highly recommend this game. Many people say this is not a Castlevaia game. Well they have no Idea of what Castlevania is or never played SOTN or Castlevania IV. This game has the most amazing setpieces I have seen in a game ever!! Yes it has elements of games like GOD and DMC but the game is totally different. I think it borrowed but it did extremely well creating an original game. The story is amazing and one of the longest games I have played. The score is beautiful. Finally no techno and classical metal with catchy tunes. No, this game has a full orchestra playing beautiful Music. Not one level repeats itself and you always discover something new and different. It's full of hidden items and unforgivingly hard Trials that give the game great replay value. I have been playing over 60 hours and not even once have I been bored. The game is very hard specially if you start on Hardened and then go back to do the trials. Be prepared to die ALOT since at the beginning your character is  very weak. But isn't that what we want? A hardcore difficult game were it actually takes skill to get to the next stage. The puzzles can be really challenging but that is fine with me. I must truly say I have enjoyed this more than god of war, darksiders and Dmc. Maybe I am wrong but after 2 hours of those games I just felt bored. This game has kept me going and I am now on my second playtrough.Best game I bought last year and now in my top ten games in my library.If you truly love Castlevania and the theme of the older Castlevaia games, you wont be let down.I give this game 10/10			"

												NOTE: Two primary complaints people have is that this game was either 1. ""Not old school and therefor not a real Castlevania game"" or 2. ""God of War Clone"". I have played only one other Castlevania game (Symphony of the Night) and have never played any God of War title therefore I'm reviewing this BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE.INTRODUCTION:Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a reboot of the classic Castlevania series. Originally released back in 2010 on the consoles. It finally made its way to the PC 3 YEARS later. This version includes all the previous DLC releases.You play as Gabriel Belmont, a member of the Brotherhood of Light who is on a quest to end the reign of darkness and avenge the murder of his wife Marie. In your struggle against the Lords of Shadow, will Gabriel fall victim to the very evil he seeks to destroy?PROS:+ Sound: -This game has some of the best musical score I have heard in a video game. As a bonus, the game also boasts superior voice acting from the cast. Robert Carlyle's Scottish accent gives Gabriel Belmot a unique and awesome voice. Sir Patrick Stewart brings his top notch signature voice playing as Belmont's friend and senior.+ Graphics: -The 1080p support for the PC does wonders for the game. It looks much sharper than the console counter part with very detailed and high quality textures, followed by a breath taking world and scenery. Animation quality is fluid and enemy variation is plenty. My only complaint is that the graphics option and customization is severely lacking.+ Story: -I like the story, easy enough to understand, complex enough to not be boring. Like a TV series, the end of a chapter makes me want to know whats going to happen next.+ Puzzles: -The puzzles in this game are either stupid or smart. Luckily for us, the smart puzzles are challenging and satisfying to solve specially without the help of guides. I do hate the fact that the game will allow you to spend experience points to automatically solve the puzzle for you.CONS:- Camera: -This game has the WORST camera I have ever experienced, a camera so determined to make you look at the scenery rather than the combat. 75% of my deaths came from falling off the edge during the platforming sections because I can't see where I'm supposed to jump, or unseen enemies lurking behind the FIXED camera angle who you won't be able to dodge or block because they are outside your effective sight range.- Auto-targeting: -Aside from the camera, this game also has one bad auto-targeting system. Your character will end up having the tendency to attack pottery or statues, rather than the three warewolves that are biting your face off, all because the pottery was the closest target from you.CONCLUSION:GOOD GAME AND A GOOD BUY. Definitely worth your time specially if you're looking for a narrative driven story. Although I'm sure some of the hardcore and die hard old school Castlevania fans disagree. For me, who likes, but is not an avid fan of the original games, find Castlevania: Lords of Shadow to be a very good game in its own right.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Do not mistake your CHARACTER for being this games' protagonist - that role clearly belongs to your METAL CHAIN WHIP!Remember that good ol' Castlevania feeling from WHIPPING (and Throwing Dagger'ing and Holy Water'ing) your way through werewolves and vampire monsters by pale moonlight? This game builds on that and you will chuckle many a time as you try out new combos and fun powers to experiment with.I had a great time playing through the whole thing. Sure, it's a long game, maybe too long for some, but for me it was just about right.Except for one annoying instance that took me many tries to beat, the game felt very balanced when shifting between medium (warrior) and easy (squire). And believe me when I say you should play it on either of those two difficulties, if you'd like to preserve your sanity. You may play for challenges if you wish, but they are not mandatory, so even the non-masochistic players can enjoy their METAL CHAIN WHIPPING game. QTE's are never great, but I didn't find them too annoying here. Cut scenes break up some of the game, but it's still very enjoyable.Oh, and the art is mostly DROP DEAD GORGEOUS - I want these artists to decorate my house if they ever get tired of pouring their HEART and SOULS into games like this.You can do some combat parts by button-mashing, but you should learn to counter, block and time your hits after some time. BUT FEAR NOT, because this is both fun and super-satisfying - the blood party starts for real when you pull something awesome off with your METAL CHAIN WHI...(okay, you got it), and the game goes into slow-motion as you smack your enemies around, consuming leftover dark and light energy orbs from their corpses, to fuel your powers for another round of METAL CHAIN WHIP (sorry, it's just the best weapon ever) carnage.My playing it for all those hours should tell you one thing - to buy this game as soon as you get the chance.

												I really, really wanted to like this game, but I don't. The best word I can come up with to describe this game is 'tedious.' Everything in this game is tedious. It has all of the makings of a good game, but something comes off in a way that makes it feel off, just a bit. The weapons lack any 'punch' and it doesn't feel like your attacks have any effect on enemies. The platforming is almost fine, but there are inconsistencies with how far Gabriel can jump, what ledges he can grab, etc. Tedious. Dying leads to three confirmation screens about respawning, which quickly gets aggrivating.The graphics and the story were fine, but this was seriously a chore to play. I can't think of a game in recent memory that I didn't want to play as much as this one.I played the majority of the game on hard, so that may have lent to some of my frustration with it.			"

												Funny thing is that when I first tried this game on its release date is that I liked the gameplay and story setting but was unable to fully enjoy it because the static camera bugged me a lot so I gave up. Later, for reasons unknown, I decided that this game deserves a second chance (mostly because I heard that Hideo Kojima was on the project. Take that Konami!). I'm so glad I did that ^^ Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow is now without a doubt, one of the best action adventure games that I have ever played and definitely in my top 5, maybe even top 3 (haven't really gave it that much thought) of the most beautiful and artistic games I ever saw! Just browse through my screenshots and you will see what I mean. I sometimes finished a session with over 20 screens that I just HAD to take, unable to resist the call of f12 because the game looks so f***in amazing! Every scene in this game is polished to the max with so many beautiful details and every 3rd scene is breathtaking and calls for a screenshot. If you like eyecandy, that's reason enough to play this game but there is so much more to it. The beautiful scenery and fixed camera angle really made me start loving that fixed camera and continue playing with enjoyment.- As for the gameplay, its simply brilliant. This is one fine example of console games that the PC audience has the privilege to play. Its action packed with varieties of different enemies and by variety I mean around 40 different enemy types if I'm not mistaken that are all quite unique both in appearance(and by that I don't mean just retexture of the same model) and required combat approach but, fear not, they have the numbers but you have the combos. There are so many combos that you can master and use to battle these creatures and the game actually encourages you to learn and master all of these by incorporating a combo gauge system that fills up and rewards you with magical orbs the longer you combo, the more diversity you use in your battles and as long as you do not take any damage. And if that isn't enough for you, you have two unique alternate stances that give unique finishers and damage properties to your existing moves as well as 4 types of gadgets at your disposal. Pretty hardcore, right :)- Once you take down a pack of werewolves or grind to dust a band of skeletons warriors that just refuse to die and keep respawning, you will frequently find yourself solving all kinds of puzzles. Now, this is a 50-50. Some people will love it, I know I did, but then again, some people will hate it and to those who don't like the puzzle and adventure aspect and prefer to focus mainly on combat, I strongly suggest getting Devil May Cry or Metal Gear Revengence instead. From what I understand, puzzle solving has always been a part of Castlevania games and I am really glad that they decided to keep that gameplay aspect. Puzzles are not really challenging but will sway your thought off of monsters and challenge your mind a bit, rather than reflexes. It feels natural to have this aspect in a game with a theme as this one, but I know that people will be split in two groups when it comes to this so consider yourselves warned puzzle haters.- Last but not least (somehow I write that in pretty much every review) we have these amazing boss battles. I left them as the last topic since they incorporate all of the above. Bosses are like puzzles that you have to battle. Big, massive, challenging and beautifully thought and designed puzzle/battles(I'm sure older gamers will know what I mean). It is not a simple matter of beating them senseless, you will have to figure out how and when to hurt them. Some stages will require you to do environmental interactions or provoke a boss to strike at a specific spot so you can... well, do stuff to them. I don't wanna go into too many details since its kind of a spoiler but, rest assured that these are super cool and very memorable. *Anyone familiar with the game Shadow of Colossus will find a coupe of these battles to look very similar to some of the Colossus(If you have no idea what I just said, I am really sorry for you and the best comfort I can offer is the insight that Shadow of Colossus works great on PCSX2. Don't wait, don't think, just play it and thank me later)*- There is also one more thing worth mentioning. Its a Complete Edition meaning that it has a DLC and extra stuff added. The DLC is not that great but its not bad, I'm just saying that compared to the main game, it doesn't seem that well thought and balanced and my guess is that they made it hastily just so that they can open the gates for the sequel to follow(which I am playing as I write this and all I can say for now is: Holy sh*it this game is awesome!)Also, let me just compare it to Darksiders 1 and the original Devil May Cry 1(save for the backtracking, there's none in Castlevania since its a linear, level based progression system), its very similar to those games and chances are, if you liked those, you will most likely like Castlevania: Lords of Shadow too. As for my recommendation, its already pretty clear. Go for it!			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow Ultimate Edition came to PC after a successful debut on Xbox 360 and PS3. Although a re-release, this version is special in a few ways that make it a good buy. However, there was a specific purpose that was in mind with this edition.The story follows Gabriel Belmont, a member of the Brotherhood of Light, in his quest to revive his murdered wife. With the help of the mythical God, Pan, Gabriel journeys through various lands to kill the Lords of Shadow; three powerful demons responsible for a spell that has cut off God's connection to the world. After defeating each member of the Lords of Shadow and some lesser bosses, Gabriel gains various armours and medallions that grant extra moves and powers while also upgrading his Combat Cross, a weaponized chain whip – the main weapon. There are twists and turns with plenty of cinematics and dialogue which keep Castlevania very much story orientated. Gameplay is very similar to titles such as God of War and Dante's Inferno, with a third person view and jumping, dodging, blocking and parrying, grabs and button mashing and timing grapples, all playing their respective roles in combat and level progression that is smooth and intense. Base enemies vary in difficulty and tactics, with each enemy type having their own signature moves and fighting styles so there is no 'upgraded bad guy with the same moves as the last one' going on. Each area has its own minions who will not likely appear anywhere else, so combat is kept fresh. There are lots of combos that can be learned, some of which can only be used when certain extra abilities are activated. These combos also help to keep things fresh as many enemies will not be affected the same way by the same combo or move; where as one is stunned by a ground-pound, another will shrug it off. There are such a large number of combos and moves that a player will likely find the few they like the most and stick to those. A complaint from some, the large volume of moves at least gives wiggle room for alternative play styles.Boss fights focus on a cinematic approach rather than straight forward smash 'n slash beat downs. As with the previously mentioned titles, the aim is to take down a small amount of health with standard fighting then, when the boss becomes vulnerable, tired, or fooled into running headlong in to a wall, must be grabbed or will recover most, if not all, of the health that had been taken away. When grabbed, a series of timed inputs, or rapid mashing, will take the player through a preset sequence of blows and recapitulates that, if successful, will break down the boss bit by bit until, finally, a longer and more engrossing sequence will play out for the ending death blows. These sequences are well planned out and show some imaginative choreography, however, the player will most likely miss many of the subtleties in these sequences as the inputs will be the main focus. Environment design is an important part in the immersion of any visual art. Castlevania has some of the best level and environment design out at the moment. Large, sweeping castles, forests, tundras, and canyons, titantic towers, spires, mountains, cliffs, huge and dilapidated stone warriors strewn about in aimless deaths, all and more immerse the player in a world of gigantic beings and powers. The sheer size of many places shows the great feats that Gabriel will have to overcome both physically and mentally if he is to succeed.Castlevania also demands the player climb and jump through the level in order to progress. Many, if not all, of the environments have obstacles and areas that can only be surpassed and reached, respectively, by climbing. Ledges, of course, are the primary mode of this form of transportation. The Combat Cross also comes in to play as convenient branches of wood and stone, embedded rungs in walls, and broken turrets can be latched on to and used as an anchor to ascend, descend, and swing on.Set in to the level design is the regular appearance of puzzles that must be solved in order to continue. These puzzles are usually story relevant with only a rare few being put simply to confound the player with abstract riddle. These puzzles can be simple manoeuvring challenges which rely on the players quick and nimble controller movements, to logical conundrums and riddles that must be understood first before the pieces may be moved in to their correct places. There is a wide variety of these puzzles that occur on a regular basis and whose completion gains experience. These puzzles can be solved instantly if a scroll on which a hint and description of the puzzle is found. The side-stepped puzzle does not give out an experience bonus, though, so the challenges are well worth the time they take while also giving an out for the particularly stubborn ones.What this re-release offers as extras in its Ultimate Edition is reason enough to buy. Lords of Shadow is now soaked in magnificent drawn and painted representations of every enemy type, boss, and character. Once met, a notification will show and the games menu will direct the player to the amazingly detailed pencil portraits depicting the enemy or friendly along with a description and a visual representation of its defences and weaknesses, where applicable. Points can also be saved and spent in an Extras menu in which concept art, storyboards, and painted level designs can be accessed after the completion of their respective chapter. These drawings and paintings are indeed works of art and any fans of the Castlevania series, dev team, or any aspiring and established artists will find these pieces both beautiful and technically sound.The jewel of the proverbial crown, however, is the DLC. Reverie and Redemption, two extra chapters that lead through the aftermath of the Lords of Shadow storyline, take us to the desolate castle of the defeated vampiric Lord of Shadow where more events unfold that inevitably set up the story for Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2. This Ultimate Edition does not just give what was already given, but adds to it with upgraded graphics and beautiful and interesting additional content. The foundation of such a strong revamp of a classic series to the modern action-adventure genre quiets most complaints and comments right off the bat. Those who have played or are interested in Lords of Shadow know what they will be getting. If one was looking forward to the sequel, this Ultimate Edition brings the player up to speed all for one price. On a personal note, I very much enjoyed this Castlevania and am looking forward to finishing the next one!Highly Recommended "

												The Ultimate Edition of 2010's Castlevania: Lords of Shadow packages the complete game with both DLC packs and greatly improved visuals, all for a stellar price.Players jump into the red robes of a holy warrior named Gabriel Belmont, who is a member of the Brotherhood of Light, a group of protectors who keep the civilians safe from the supernatural infestation that goes on in the world of Castlevania.Gabriel is armed with the Combat Cross, a holy cross with a deadly embedded whip that acts suspiciously similar to Kratos’ Blades of Chaos/Athena.  Gabriel has access to various moves that work the use of heavy and light attacks to chain together combos.The beginning of the game is an awful demonstration for Lords of Shadow’s combat as it starts by offering the player the most basic moves. It’s not until a few hours in, where you’re pulling enemies in and pulling off ridiculous combos combined with Gabriel’s magic that you appreciate the diversity on offer with the combat. It’s not on par with something specialised like Bayonetta, but the game offers deep and varied enough combat that it feels satisfying for the people that want to do just more than mash a few buttons.Magic is very important in Lords of Shadow and early in the game you’re given your first taste of it through the light magic, which when activated and used in combat will gradually refill Gabriel’s health bar with each hit of the Combat Cross. Later in the game the shadow magic becomes available, adding extra strength to each attack.What I really love about Lords of Shadow is how the developers have incorporated the weapons and magic into the game’s platforming and puzzle solving. Nearly every tool is used at points throughout the game. The ability to double jump is worked in by having longer jump sections, which are often mixed with the use of the sprinting boots that allow Gabriel to jump greater distances. The gauntlet is used to punch objects to move them across areas or to activate switches, shadow magic is used with a shoulder charge to smash through weak walls, and the hidden chain in the Combat Cross is used to cut down stone obstacles.Lords of Shadow also looks mighty impressive on the PC.The amazing character models, comprehensive texture work and environmental artistry by the team at MercurySteam are on full display. Textures are sharp, extremely detailed and really help make the Gothic nature of Lords of Shadow come out at its fullest, even holding up well for PC standards.If you’re a PC gamer who has never played Castlevania: Lords of Shadow or a hardcore fan that is looking to replay the game you should certainly pick up the PC version.

												Castlevania name, a forsaken world in darkness, creatures of vampires, werewolves and countless undeads, gothic castles and horrific landscapes.What could possibly go wrong for such a game?Well, everyting except for a few, for this game. This game is a shining example of how not to do an action adventure game.First, I will give the pros. Voices and some good, gothic landscapes, occasionally the music. I am not good at this kind of beat'em up games, I've to admit. Though I completed many similar games, like God of War series, I even completed the Bayonetta! Gameplay mechanics of this game is a piece of crap compared to those games. Dark side and light side magic activation is a huge failure. You beat up the creatures, you get some orbs and you choose which magic to fuel up. Fueling up the magic is incredibly slow while consuming is incredibly fast. Besides why do I have two kinds of magic? Why not combine them? Why it takes soooo long to fuel them up? Bad design. Very bad design.Skill combos are poorly selected and they have the worst key combination I have ever seen in such a game. God damn it, even a million times complex Bayonetta has more plain key combinations for combos! Double tap the analog to run fast. Have you lost your mind? What kind of gameplay design is this? Developers have serious issues here...Combat. You play an action adventure, which is actually a beat'em up game. Combat gotta be brutal, right? See God of War? You shake the bones of your enemies, rip them apart. But in this game, you feel like you are tickling enemies with your chaines. Your blows do INCREDIBLE low damage. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!? You grab an enemy, you WAIT for a f-word button sequence to complete the action sequence. Why not auto-execute immediately like other games? Why force the player to wait in the middle of the combat? Combining the poorly implemented combos, combat is miserable for a game in this genre.Ridiculous puzzles. Well, not all of them are ridiculous. But some of them are so bad, you think like ""What the hell am I doing by playing this game?"". See the scarecrow puzzle and music box puzzle, which are played sequentially. RIDICULOUS is not enough to describe them. F. this game.We got Soul Reaver series back in the time. Those were the games. Proper action adventures. Not this technologically advanced piece of crap. I highly NOT recommend this game. You should stay away from this abomination. If you like action adventure games, Darksiders 1 and Darksiders 2 are on the Steam. Those are fantastic games, and it will be a shame if I compare them to this game. Whatever this game represents in the negative way for modern action advention genre, Darksiders represent the positive way.2/10  "

												A masterpiece. This is how a polished game should look and feel like. Absolutely superb. I actually took the time to get all the achievements in this game, a feat I've never done with any other game.It is a game that makes you feel like you are growing progressively stronger -- and at the same time, it feels as if actual skill is required on your part. The progressive feeling of mastery is something many games lack and I think this game nails it.The fantastic visuals, enemy design, and beautiful soundtrack make this game a must-own. 10/10 -- simply superb.

												A nice alternate universe of the Castlevania game. The story is amazing and voice actting is a huge plus! Fun puzzles, story and a nice variety of enemies. Combat is fun for the most part. My only gripe is that there were too few moves that you could do in the game. Around 30-40 moves. Doesn't take away from the gameplay at all. Just would've been nice :D			"

												A standard high budget in depth game, but ultimately not worth the time.Gameplay:A large plethora of abilities, mounts and mini-games, in the end amounting to tedium. Some great enemies you need to learn to beat; a few good bosses, but several repetitive and unimaginitive ones.Climbing structures lacked grace and enjoyment (delayed actions and no fluidity); path was on strict rails, sometimes being able to grapple hundreds of meters, sometimes 5. Best way was to let the game steer you in the direction it wanted. Going off the path to explore generally resulted in invisible barriers or death.Story:Above average, but not outstanding. Some good voice acting, and Patrick Stewart (whose character looks like Sean Connery) was a nice addition. It was enough to keep me playing when I wanted to uninstall the game.Summary:I would recommend playing any of the soul reaver series or even darksiders instead. Not a complete waste of time, but be ready for some anger management.			"

												The naysayers will tell you that this game is just another ripoff of God of War.  What it is, in reality, is a masterpiece which combines some of the best elements of the Castlevania series with an improved version of the fantastic combat system pioneered in God of War.  The combat system is simple in premise, but complicated to master; challenging, but not unfair.  The addition of a magic system (which later God of War games attempted to replicate) for extra damage or health corrects the irritating lack of healing in God of War without making the combat any easier.  The story is remarkably compelling, the voice acting is superb, and the majority of the characters have considerable depth.  If you're a fan of Castlevania, you'll love the visuals and the new way to fight old enemies.  If you're a fan of God of War, you'll love the more nuanced combat system and the new enemies.  If you're not a fan of either, you might well be after playing this game.			"

												Old Castlevania player here, started on NES/SNES.I played almost all of them. I was sceptical to try my first ""3D"" Castlevania.I started it a day I was bored, got it on sale. After a while, my reaction seeing all those combos was  ""Oh no, another typical 3d buttons smashing game"", didn't feel at all like any other castlevania I played, and i stopped playing after half hour.Then, months after, I decided to give a second try to it (also because I was tempted from sales about LoS2).And after I got used that this game is actually different from the Castlevania I used to know - I started appreciating it. Because this game is simply beautifully crafted. The music, the voice acting, the extreme details they put in every level, the wide different range of mobs and bosses, the characters, the story - everything merges in a perfectly balanced cocktail of elements, making this game a must-to-play for every Castlevania fans and not. I have now 40 hours gameplay and still at chapter 5 (ok, i lost pretty much time because I wanted to complete all level at 100% - but the challange was too tedious for me to enjoy the game properly on the first play time) - and greatly enjoying the story and levels that are really unique and different each other.Would buy again even at full price  ;)			"

												I've played this game from start to finish three times now, and I still am awed several times while playing. This is a work of art. The 2d backgrounds are breathtaking, and the implementation into the 3d world makes them even more majestic. Add in one of the best soundtracks in games, and pretty durned good gameplay, and you've got a classic. It doesn't even need to be a good game with the looks and sounds it has, but it's fortunate that it is.			"

												Gabriel is a member of Brotherhood of Light who recently went through sad events - his wife was murdered. As there must be some big evil behind it, he journeys through the world to kill three lords of shadow, to kill everything evil with his holy battle cross, and to steal powers of each lord. That's all you need to know about the story, which is poor. If you read through all notes and background texts in the game, you'll be looking forward to see the depth of the unusual fantasy world on Earth (many years after our civilization has fallen), but in the real action the story just lets you cringe, as things only happen to move the plot forward without proper explanation or sense. In the end, it's all about killing evil things and keeping the decreasing faith to God.It's a typical hack'n'slash console game (released on 2010 for consoles) with purely linear gameplay - the whole game is split into chapters and levels. While there are some parts where you can choose a path, there aren't many of those, so you'll mostly be just walking forward through corridors or climbing and jumping on the ledges (with only one right path) like in Tomb Raider series. Many people hate the game for the fact that you can't control the camera. Every place has static camera that feels annoying and may cause some problems with controls (when you move between two scenes where the camera angle change), but I felt it's important for Castlevania's level design, as there are many secrets based on you trying to explore places where the camera isn't showing you can go, many secrets are located behind the camera. Other secrets are usually made in a way that you can't get to them in your first playthrough, as they require some late-game core item. Replayability is also encouraged by various bonus objectives, which you can see after your first playthrough of each level. The action gameplay is enhanced with ability to mount big enemies, which is usually mandatory to move forward - e.g. you have to mount a huge spider to let him make a spider web bridge for you, or you have to mount a big troll to destroy a stone wall. Otherwise there's nothing unexpected or extra original, the game's offering classic hack'n'slash combo system with unlockable skills. Besides health, you'll be working with light and dark magic - light magic makes your attacks heal you, dark magic boosts your damage; and that's all.There are totally 4 difficulty options, I played on the second one (similar to ""normal"") and the base game, 12 chapters, felt easy. The final two chapters (which are DLC content on consoles) has much bigger difficulty, especially with the final boss that took me 3 hours to beat him. Boss fights can take more than 10 minutes, but you don't have to be afraid of repeating the whole battle - there are always few checkpoints.The game, for a console port, is optimized fine, I haven't met any critical problem through my play. Graphics are pretty for a 2010 game, there are many beautiful sceneries which motivated me to make many screenshots; there are also nice details that you'll usually see thanks to the static camera. The soundtrack is good, to describe it I'd say it's classic fantasy melodies which definitely improve the atmosphere.Conclusion:If you keep your expectations low, ignore the story and just enjoy the linear hack'n'slash gameplay, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a fine game that can offer you about 20 hours of entertainment for a single playthrough - and if that won't be enough for you, there are more difficulty settings and many secrets.

 “This night a warrior will come. A knight in shining armor with death at his side. He comes for you, creatures of the night!” Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a great action-adventure experience with a mature and deep storytelling. The immersive atmosphere profits on the one hand from the beautiful soundtrack and top-notch voice acting, and on the other hand from the inspiring level and monster design. Another strength is the balance between combat and puzzle sections that leave no room for boredom.Originally released for consoles in fall 2010 this game has two shortcomings in form of a fixed camera and bad auto-targeting system, that results in a lot of problems during combat stages and explorative sections. Trivia: This game is actually a reboot to the Castlevania franchise, as the original title was released for the Nintendo Gaming System in 1987.

												If you don't expect something similar to the 2D-Castlevania games, you're getting a great ton of fun for your money here. The levels are quite linear with a few sideways for exploration, the action is fast and intense - as long as you agree on doing some quick-time-events from time to time.Story is ok, graphics are nice, voice-over is top-notch and the value is pretty good. I spent a total of 26 hours untill I finished the whole game including both DLCs and I've never been bored.If you fancy some good old God of War Action based on a fantasy mid-age setting, this is definately worth a look.

												Been a huge Castlevania fan for years and figured I'd finally give this one a go since I heard it has a pretty decent story, but although I tried hard to enjoy it, I simply couldn't. That said, I still finished the game because I wanted to experience said story, but this will be the first and last time I ever play this game.Boss battles are way too gimmicky and often rely on you climbing around and sh*t rather than actually fighting.The climbing itself is also kinda badly implemented, with the character just ignoring grapple commands every so often, ending up in me falling to my death.Oh, and the developer seem to really enjoy the concept of having the player actively pull a crank only to be interrupted by enemies when you're 80% done so you have to beat them and then do everything over again. That's happened 10-or-so times.The biggest issue by far though is the camera. Who in their right mind uses preset camera angles in a third person game nowadays rather than giving the players control of it? There's a reason most developers have moved on from that formula.There are also some pretty annoying bugs in the game, and if you keep reading, I'll give you an example.(minor spoilers ahead)I was searching for the last fairy in chapter 3 for quite a while (managed to miss that I could use the crank on a second gate), found it and went back to the ground floor to open up the fairy door. As usual, the gates before it had closed, so I turned the crank, some werewolves ambushed me and destroyed it, and then after I beat them, all my fairies were gone and I had to collect them all again.Unless you're a diehard Castlevania fan who wants to play this game for the story, don't waste your money and time on it.

												It's a nice take on the Castlevania series. It's nice to get back into that universe, the lore is nice, the abilities are fine, the levels are okay .... It's just a shame that this game suffers so much from the Devil May Cry syndrome : cameras are always badly placed, and switching from camera to camera will make your controls feel broken and make you completely unable to aim properly. If you're okay with enduring that, then the game will surely be fine for you.			"

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. Unfortunately, this could function as a case study on what's wrong with modern AAA action games. It's a tedious, boring, borderline insulting mess. It's a prime example of style over substance and spectacle over gameplay, which felt more like a standardized test than a game.To give credit where credit is due, much of the artwork is beautiful and some of the voice acting is solid, particularly with Patrick Stewart. Which just makes it sadder that everything else is so awful.This game is absolutely infested with quicktime events. They're everywhere. Apparently they'd rather not have those pesky players get in the way of their flashy spectacle. So instead of making, you know, gameplay, they'll just tell us when to press what button.The combat is a dull experience. There's a system of earning points which you can spend special attacks made up of arbitrary button combinations, none of which are worth your time to commit to memory. Fights are boring and time consuming.Camera angles are always fixed, there's no looking where you want to look or aligning your view to make platforming or combat more practical. The game just sort of herds you from one section to the next with the camera. There's nothing wrong with linear games, but this feels less like a linear path, and more like the a series of check boxes.The story is mostly delivered through exposition dumps, and it isn't very interesting. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters.The keyboard controls are poor, and I don't just mean the default bindings are bad, though they most assuredly are. I mean things like the game more than once expecting you to mimic the rotation of an analog stick with the directional keys, or the fact that the jump button won't work if you're moving diagonally by holding two directional keys. Controller support is sketchy, despite the description of ""full controller support"". Mine wouldn't work at all.The whole thing is just such a tedious chore of a game. Don't waste your time, not even if it's on sale for cheap.			"

												This game is pure awesome! I played thru it on xbox and again now on PC (going thru DLC now, so far awesome).Combat is fast and furious and challenging on normal or above. (normal gets easy after u get used to it so u can change it anytime to be harder) One recommendation i will make for playing is to limit the use secondary weapons. like daggers, fairies, holy water, and esp the demon crystals. on Hard mode these items are a saving grace and really needed for some situations. On normal tho i felt like the game provided WAY to much secondary weapons. The pink demon crystals are way overpowered for normal mode unless you are in a swarm of enemies or you want to soften up a strong boss. otherwise they make the game to easy and create a feeling of ""thats it"".  Holy water may be an exception to this when used in combo with light magic as it provides a good shield without wiping the screen of enemies in a split second. While the game works fine for keyboard and mouse i do recommended and prefer a gamepad for the fast paced combat and  navigating the platforming of the game. Overall this isa fantastic game with a lot of variety of weapons and enemies and amazing environment and level design. The art and style of the game shines greatly as well.for me its a 10/10			"

												Pretty difficult game. Also pretty fun. Feels good to smash little gremlins with the combos, and so far all the bosses have been impressive. Some bosses seem to me ripped straight from Shadow of the Colossus, you climb up them and stab some weak point while they try to shake you off. Still enjoyable and definitely cool to scale an enemy about 1000 times as big as your character.Never played other games like this really but I recommend if you like Dark Souls. The decision to roll or block/parry will be familiar to you (and maybe reduce learning curve), although this game is much faster paced and less open with exploration.			"

												Wow... What a beautiful game! It has all of the elements of the series retelling the story starting with Gabriel Belmont. At first glance, you would think, ""Where is this going?"" It has a story to tell as you traverse the landscape visiting areas such as Veros Woods (Castlevania 2 NES) Plently of puizzles to solve and a very unbique but incredible combat style. The mouse and keyboard can prove tricky in getting through, soI would recommend utilizing an XBOX 360 controller. Any controller will do, but this works best until Steams controller becomes available!I was surprised by the enemies and the complexity of some of the battles but I was more in awe of the cutscenes and its world. I would highly recommend this game to anyone! Please take a look at my screenshots but please be aware of spoilers contained in the shots!			"

												Where to start? This game has problems. It's not that it's riddled with bugs or anything. I just truly didn't enjoy the overall gameplay experience of Lords of Shadow. Everything felt tedious, monotonous, and/or adding artificial length to the game through grueling repetition. For example: The Chupacabra enemy is in my opinion a completely unnecessary addition in what is already a linear game. It will steal your 'gear' and force you to chase it into a section of the level in order to get it back - and serve no other purpose.3d Vision - Required a patch from Helix Mod for acceptable 3d presentation. However, it's worth noting that this rejuvenated the last quarter of the game for me. I wouldn't have finished it were it not for a third party gimmick.Gameplay - The gameplay is a mixed bag for Castevania: LOS. While combat isn't necessarily hard (or varied) - it's often plagued with problems stemming from either the camera. The camera is locked in place and limits your view. This usually means you're going to be hit by an enemy who wasn't in frame by either an unblockable attack or an attack that's too quick for you to have dodged in reasonable time.  This sounds manageable, however, the high damage from the lowliest of monsters quickly turns that notion on it's head.The puzzles, while plentiful and occasionaly good, are tedious and unforgiving. The developers had enough foresight to include a ""skip puzzle"" function at the price of exp points you would normally gain from completion. Sadly, this does not in fact skip the puzzle. Rather, it shows you the solution to the puzzle you did not want to do - forcing you to still trudge through it. The platforming is sloppy. I was frequently left with no idea where to go because it wasn't clearly defined in some fashion and simply suffered loss of life or death for it.Graphics - Pretty. Environments are skillfully crafted with lovely architecture you probably won't be able to enjoy because you can't move the camera. Everything is stylized in a kind of neoclassical gothic amalgam that turns out quite lovely. Character models do look a bit over stylized, though (long necks for example).Story - Really liked it.... um... until the last part. It felt very tacked on (as many sections of the game feel) in order to make the playtime longer. Otherwise a good fun story for the setting.Conclusion - Playing this game felt like I was doing homework so I could go play outside. It was just plain boring and took forever. Watching it would have been a much better experience. So, if it's on sale and you really really want to see if you can power through the game... Well, I still have to recommend you don't. Wow. Watch someone else play it.			"

												Damn is this game awesome. I really like the story, including the somewhat predictable twist, the combat was awesome, and the design was really solid. The mechanics were great, the level design never got too frustrating like many fighting games, and it all just works. If you like the world of castlevania, fighting games, or mythology, this game is totally up your alley.			"

Posted: April 22, 2016
												First off, I'm a huge fan of the Castlevania series.   So that foundation may color my opinion of this game and it's ensuing interquel and sequel (which I'm currently in the midst of).  Something about medieval through Enlightment era Europe with a heavy gothic/baroque aesthetic, corrupted through dark forces that threaten the world?  Awesome.  Tons of monsters pulling on a multitude of inspiration from the myth cycles of antiquity through the modern Universal monsters?  Yes, please.  Konami struck gold initially by creating these dark adventures that took a quite serious tone for the early Nintendo systems, offering a beefy challenge of vintage Nintendo difficulty through several increasingly impressive platformer games.  They then evolved into the famed Metroidvanias with the release of Symphony of the Night on the Playstation - trading a bit of the reflex-intensive difficulty for massive sprawling environments that took forever to explore and fully unlock - and followed this formula with several excellent installments on Nintendo's handhelds where they found their most sustainable home and success through the late 2000's.  Then Konami, sensing the increasingly stagnant nature of the series as it became mired in repeated iterations of SotN's sprawling platformer/RPG hybrid, started searching for a way to revitalize the series again, just as SotN ignited a sort of Golden Age for the series.As the winds throughout the greater video game market were blowing increasingly towards epic, story-based RPGs, Spanish-based developer MercurySteam was contracted to take the series in a new direction (probably due to Konami's increasing focus upon more purely profitable directions, such as the Japanese gambling market).  MercurySteam, for their part, took a pretty bold new direction though this was not without its share of controversy.  The good came from a heavy focus upon story and aesthetic.  Gabriel Belmont, who apparently becomes the progenitor of the famed vampire-slaying family in this continuity, is dispatched by the human agency, the Brotherhood of Light to confront and destroy the eponymous Lords of Shadow who have become a blight over the world of humanity, separating the Earth from the Heavens and unleashing demonic horrors upon the hapless human kingdoms and villages.  Interestingly, this game devotes a lot of exposition to the powers of good as well.  Traditionally, Castlevania always had an air of horror and darkness, though maybe not a sense of supreme evil.  LoS heavily invokes God, Satan, and, to a lesser extent, Christ and the church.  The old games had less direct references though they were still there with Judeo-Christian enemies as well as religiously themed environments (though due to the setting, Baroque Europe, this is hardly surprising).  LoS made the series simultaneously more and less personal.  Gabriel is on this quest in the hopes of reviving his dead wife, Marie and we spend a great deal of time getting to know him through his terse interactions with the allies and enemies he encounters in his quest.  On the other hand, the game focuses much more of the scale of humanity as a whole.  The powers of Heaven and Hell are very real in the LoS universe and they are actively vying for the souls of men.  Say what you will about the old 'vanias, they were great but while Dracula might wreak havoc on the world, he generally wasn't portrayed as damning his victims souls to an eternity in hell.  That however is the stakes for LoS.  MercurySteam went all out, bringing back narrative cutscenes, securing an A-list voiceover cast, and threw in a few Shadows of the Colossus style battles for variety.  The gameplay itself is a departure from the old series as it is a third person 3D platformer/adventure game.  Combat draws heavy influence from God of War leading some detractors to label the continuity God-of-Vania.  Given the Belmonts are famed whip users throughout the series (even non-Belmonts like John Morris and Nathan Graves got in on the whip action!), I'm fine with that decision.  The only annoying aspect of it is the volume of endurance heavy enemies.  I get it, I'm using a whip which isn't the most devastating of medieval weaponry (even if it is made out of holy-blessed metal) against creatures with inhuman carapace, hide and endurance.  It just gets a bit tedious at times is all I'm saying.  The whip combat is fun and creative though it could stand to be a bit more visceral.  Hits just don't feel like they have a ton of impact which makes bashing endurance-heavy enemies feel like a chore instead of exciting.  The game does offer an array of other options though to keep things fresh with the ability to infuse the Vampire Killer with Light and Shadow magic as well as several subweapons including classic staples like throwing knives and holy water.  The environments are big, winding, and varied and have a lot of detail invested in them, even if they aren't overwhelmingly interactive (though there are a number of destructible props placed about to makes combat a bit more tangible).  Being sort of a platformer, there's loads of obstacle courses and climbing sections to navigate that will break up your time between fights and give you a chance to cool down.  This generally works in that when you start to tire of combat, the game gives you a navigation section.  When you get tired of climbing around enormous walls and platforms, the game will throw a dozen monsters at you to slay.  In short, things in this world are huge, in terms of scale.  The shortcomings of the game tend to focus around repeating enemies (enemy variety has always been a staple of the series), the heavy God of War influence (though any departure from Koji Igarashi's metroidvania genre would have received a similar outcry), and the almost minimal touchstones of being a Castlevania.  By this last one, I'm referring to limited focus on the Belmont family, settings outside Dracula's castle, and chief antagonists other than Dracula.  These are complaints of taste in my opinion and while Lords of Shadow doesn't scratch those particular itches very well, it wouldn't be the first to break any of these commandments.  Bloodlines, Circle of the Moon, Aria and Dawn of Sorrow, and Order of Ecclesia all had non-Belmont protagonists and didn't really ever bring the Belmonts into the plot in a major way.  Gabriel, being the first to take the surname, simply doesn't really have a family history to call upon like the later Belmonts do in their increasingly storied feud with Dracula, never mind that Dracula doesn't exist in LoS1 as the Lords of Shadow are the antagonists.  Bloodlines had you gallavanting all around World War I era Europe with only the first level in Dracula's castle.  Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow - some of the highest regarded games of the metroidvania era - feature a focus on non-Belmont Soma Cruz and feature primary antagonists who aren't Dracula.  Don't get me wrong, I understand the complaints and can empathize why longtime fans might feel alienated by the new direction and perceive the genre shift as pandering to younger markets (particularly the God of War style combat).  But I think the things it does well; story, atmosphere, music, symbolism, intensity, and variety make up for the departures.  It's an alternative continuity that freshened the series up and gives gamers of other genres and option to get interested in the series and the lore.  For that, I think it's a good thing.  Or it would be if Konami ever developed its IP franchises.  But alas, ""Mobile is where the future of gaming lies."" according to Konami's current CEO.  For shame, Konami!			"

												You might be surprised to read this, but I don't particularly like writing negative reviews. Critics are supposed to love writing them, because it gives them the opportunity to throw out all these zingers and sound really clever. I'm not clever, heck I'm not even smart. In fact if I knew anything at all I wouldn't have subjected myself to the entirety of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. By now we're all familiar with Gabriel and his quest to rid the world of evil. He has a cross that behaves like a whip, control over the powers of light and dark, and a really thick neck. He meets a variety of unusual characters, fights the same 4 or 5 monsters, and all the women he talks to don't have shoes. In the 17+ hours I spent with this game, I put together a list of everything I hated about it.One of the first stages you explore is a SWAMP. This what I like to call unforgivable game-design. It's not uncommon to see swamps in a fantasy-adventure game, they're spooky places with potential for grotesque abominations. However, a swamp is not what you want to introduce your game with, particularly if it includes sections where you have to slowly make your way through the mud. The controls lack finesse. Gabriel moves well enough, but he's incapable of those subtle movements. For those times when you just want to move a foot to hit a switch. Instead you have to make several steps and go up up down down lef..errh..It's just a bunch of unnecessary motions to accomplish the same task. Balancing act. For whatever reason, LoS has a ton of high beams. These narrow sections force Gabe to keep his balance as he crosses. I hate this glitch-ridden garbage. If you don't approach the beam at the right angle, you might end up getting stuck. There are even times where you'll mash the analog stick around like Gabriel was caught in a spider-web, just so he'll cross the beam. Chupacabra? More like chu ca suck ya? Nevermind. There are a few run-ins with this little joker. He steals all of your powers, and you have to waste time getting them back. This adds nothing but padding to the game.A plethora of puzzles to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. Lords of Shadow has a LOT of puzzles. Action-adventure games (like God of War) have puzzles, so it's natural to expect a few in this game. However, smart-puzzle design is incorporating elements of the game, and knowing when and where to place them. Most of the puzzles in LoS are based entirely off of the kind we're overly familiar with. At one point some kinda chess game has to be played, there's a sliding-block puzzle, Something where you make light go through maze, some other puzzle where you make blood go through a maze. There's also the sliding block that goes through a maze, and the maze itself has sliding pieces, and THERE ARE PORTALS TOO?!!?!?! All these puzzles are simply mind-numbing. Oft-times the solutions are easy, and you can buy the solution if you don't mind losing out on experience rewards, but you can't actually skip them, even when you replay the stage. If it's pointless and doesn't add anything of quality to the game, it must be padding.A combat system that you can never appreciate. In God of War, Kratos learned a ton of different moves and acquired a handful of weapons. However, most of these techniques were ineffective in actual combat. For the most part combat was using the weak attacks to chip away at enemies, and then following up with the shockwave. The handful of stylish moves didn't see much use, because Kratos was always on the defensive. Lords of Shadow suffers from the same issue. A lot of interesting moves can be purchased, but you'll probably never get the opporunity to use them in battle. The lack of decent hit-stun and functional mechanics make fights more tedious than challenging. A number of fights suffer from bad camera-angles. I'll file this under nit-picking, since it's something even the best 3D Action games have trouble with.A total lack of variety in terms of enemy-design. Claw-swipe, weapon-swing, dash-attack, shockwave, trail of fire, swinging a weapon twice. What does all this mean? That's the move-set of almost every fiend in Lords of Shadow. There are exceptions, but everyone in this game fights as if they're just some evil guy with a weapon. Imagine if you were to fight Medusa. Let's say she can whip you with her tail, use her petrifying gaze, and throw snakes. It sounds sensible enough doesn't it? Now let's throw all that out the window, and give Medusa a sword and shield instead. Suddenly she's nowhere near as interesting an enemy to fight. This is just shockingly uncreative. Mercurysteam had the entire Castlevania play-book at their disposal. This is a franchise with hundreds of different monsters, tons of bosses, and all sorts of potential for creating some really impressive and unique encounters. Instead you get this: Claw-swipe, weapon-swing, dash-attack, shockwave, trail of fire, swinging a weapon twice. Why?What this game isn't lacking in is game-play segments designed to make you angry. This isn't like flicking a switch and suddenly you're drowning in various bodily fluids. It's a process that encorporates every bad element in a game. Everything comes together and you're given something that is just plain balls. SPOILER ALERT:Enter the Forgotten One. This is the true final boss in Lords of Shadow. In the console version he was part of a DLC quest, but lucky(?) for us he's included in the PC version. Reaching this final boss-fight involves a lava-rising segment, a gloriously stupid moment where Gabriel has to hide from TFO by crawling around a pillar (in-game it looks like some Bugs Bunny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t), moving platform shenanigins, and my personal favorite: balance beams over rising lava. After all that mess you get to the actual fight, and the game doesn't even grant you the courtesy of a health & magic re-fill. As with the rest of the game, if you come to a fight with low health and die, all you'll get when you retry is half. TFO's weakpoint is on his arm, shoulder, and then head. You have to jump to hit these spots. This is easier said than done when most of his attacks are keep-away stuff like shockwaves. After a certain amount of damage is done, TFO pulls off some gimmick. The gimmick is something you'll likely not figure out the first time. After messing up, you're force to bring his health back down so he'll repeat the gimmick, and hopefully you can move to the next phase. There are two moments to attack it, when it slides a ball & chain across the ground, or when it summons missiles from the sky. The only reason I, you, or most anyone else is going to defeat this boss is through the checkpoints after each phase. This isn't a fun battle, it isn't even tolerable, it's just a brick-wall built to house a black hole of entertainment. The Forgotten One fight is one of the worst I've played in a game. This is a fight that would bury a good game, let alone this one.But I did it, and for what? Just to say I did? I'd say I lost a lot more than I gained from playing through Lords of Shadow. I actually tried this game back when it was only available on consoles. I didn't care for it then, but I gave it another chance, and now I just feel horrible. The worst part is, as much as my review indicates otherwise, this isn't a completely miserable game. It does just enough....just enough right to keep you playing. Maybe it was Avery Bullock's dreamy narration that kept me playing Lords of Shadow, because my idiot brain can't come up with any other reason.			"

												I'm going to cautiously reccomend this game to the curious, both the long time 'Vania fans or fans of this style of gameplay.  This is a reboot, and as such, it takes a lot of liberty in the source material that might make the long time fans who prefer the old continuity to look away and not give the game a fair shot, but the story here is decent. Here's my main opinion on different parts of the game:-The fact you cannot change your camera angle here can be a real pain, resulting in many unnecessary hits coming from the bottom of the screen (which is a real problem on the higher difficulties) and can hinder exploration of certain areas because you cant focus your camera on what you want to check out.  -The combat is usually pretty satisfying, but I just can't agree with being hit by an enemy who is receiving a steel chain across the face (should be stun locked, but that's just my opinion), but other than that, the attack variety and satisfying whip sounds make combat rather fun and can usually avoid being tedious.-Most of the puzzles are pretty lame, and while they break up the combat and exploration, they're usually just not that fun to solve.  Thankfully, you're  given the option to learn their solution instantly at the cost of not getting an exp bonus, so this complaint is slightly null from that.-The music is now going to win any one over.  I don't feel it lives up to a long line of catchy music that Castlevania has produced, but at least has a good tune here and there.  At the very least, the music fits the feel of the game.- Graphically, this game is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.  I'm rarely ever wowed by graphics these days, but I was constantly wowed by the gorgeous locales the game renders, and some of the really cool enemy designs.So tl;dr. if you've been on the fence about trying this, wait for a sale and give it a try.  I don't regret my time spent with LoS, and I feel like there's a game in here that really shines sometimes but is often held down by some questionable design choices.  I know LoS2 will let you control the camera, so I'm hoping to see other improvements made in the game play and shine where its predecessor could have but didnt.  Action oriented people may enjoy the combat, and long time CV fans may enjoy the whip-based combat and exploration, along with the reimagining of Dracula.			"

												To be honest, this Castlevania felt like a Homestuck of games for me - extremely boring at the start and a pretty interesting experience closer to the middle/end in both gameplay (more abilities you collect - better it gets) and plot sides. You either drop it after first bunch of levels, or you keep playing. In my case i actually forced myself to play past first chapters after dropping it a couple of times just because i wanted to play Mirror of Fate (which is your classic side scrolling sequel for Lords of Shadow) with a full knowledge of plot.Plays completely different from original Castlevania games (at least these i played), but still is good, i guess.If you aren't sure about spending money on it i'd recommend to wait for a sale, but i think it's current price (in my country at least) is fair.+ personally haven't encountered any bugs + no issues with wired xbox 360 controller for me+ plot+ amazing soundtrack and voicing+ good combat system+ amazing and fair boss fights that require nothing but skill to beat+ really good and interesting puzzles+ levels actually have some replay value for collectibles that can only be picked once you get certain abilities later in game and challenges that are only available if you beat levels at least once+ amazing artworks/concept-arts that you can buy in game for these who's interested in that stuff. Like me.- a very, VERY slow start- biggest and hugest nope goes to the final boss in the dlc. While all boss fights in the main game were amazing, this one was hard, tedious, annoying and unsatisfying. And don't git gud at me, there's a difference between a good and a bad boss design, that's all.- graphics might seem a bit outdated but still looks good- repetetive not memorable levels with invisible walls and points of no return (which sucks when you run into one of two similar looking corridors and accidentally lock yourself from picking a collectible in the end of another one. Whoops)- sountrack is amazing but some pieces seemed to be kind of...out of place with what was going on the screen?- no level exploration. It fits fine with the game itself but we're talking about Castlevania series here.- no camera control at all. Wasn't much of a problem but in a bunch of places. Controls/direction change during forced camera angle change was more of a pain, especially in timed levels.			"

												I am 5 hours in (ish) and its just starting to pick up. It looks like its going to get much better from here. The story is basically incomprehensible, but in an ok way (think Bayonetta). Come to think of it the combat is very reminicant of Bayonetta also, with a bit of DMC (new one) thrown in. The Game itself moves along at a nice clip (after that first five hours oof) through the small explorable arenas that make up each chapter. You are obviously expected to do several runthroughs as each level has areas that cant be accessed untill you unlock your new evil spiked cross or whatever. Happily though this menu is easy to navagate and as the story is a pile of jibberish you wont feel youre missing anything by retreading old ground. I hear it gets better after the hump that took me a few days, Ill report back, at this point I would say hold off for 4.99 unless you enjoy that Bayonetta flashy action type of experience. Dont go into this one thinking God of War. Its not. Its totally different, you will only have the wrong bar set too high and make those first five hours miserable.			"

Posted: February 9, 2014
												So as this game goes on sale I hope to give you an informative review of this game. While it was gifted to me during the Christmas steam sale, I have played through it several times and I still cannot justify owning or purchasing this game. As a diehard fanatic of the series from the very beginning this game lacks everything that made the series fantastic. This is not to say the game is bad, however, it is completely mediocre . The potential for greatness IS there, however, it fails to truly deliver. For every stunning visual scene in the game it has twice as many glaring, disgusting bland LEVELS that serve no absolutely no purpose. In fact, the game feels lopsided when it comes to level count. The second chapter has by far the most levels in the game and yet the two chapters afterward only have two apiece to them. I fail to see the logic behind this besides trying to fit a familiar theme, however, this only makes chapter 2 a daunting, boring, trial to complete. There is no  FLOW to this game. It stops and goes at its own pace, and it feels disgustingly rushed. The gameplay is a mashed together blend of several popular action games ranging from God of War to Shadow of Colossus that fails to deliver any of the finer points of any of those games. Combat is simple, yet, frustrating from the lack of meat behind it. The 'whip' (I'm more akin to call it the blades of chaos but I'll bite) is better described as a wet noodle. Enemies have very little to not hit registration so it makes it feel like all of your blows either do nothing or bounce off of them with little to no visible effect. Enemies are not chained, nor can you combo properly in most cases making it more of a game of unleashing a flurry of attacks, and then either parrying them to stun them for one second or dodging past them if you cannot. This is all there is to combat, there is very little variety between enemy types and their attack. Each enemy may seem differently, but the majority of them have three same attacks. The types of attacks are as follows: a quick jab, a slower stronger attack, and a shockwave. I have successfully described 99% of the attacks you'll be dealing with in this game. To try and amplify Gabriel's abilities he comes across a small selection of subweapons and magic to try increase variety in combat.  These fail to do anything but be useless or completely trivialize encounters all together. Take for example the earliest subweapon you get, the silver daggers. You are given ten of them near the start of the game and are given enough refills to completely destroy any werewolf type enemy in a single hit, aside from heavier lycans. This is the equivalent of having an 'I win' button which should never be the case in any brawler. Yet alone you are purposefully given an ability soon after that lets you oneshot any small enemy with a simple QTE regardless by tapping the right trigger/R2 button. You cannot be harmed during this, and you can chain this quite easily, leaving only the big, burly enemies, whose attacks I've already described, to easily be dealt with. In fact, the only time combat is truly challenging in Lords of Shadow is during engagements with multiple big enemies, which are few and far between, or when the camera forces itself lodged into a wall. I've have many a moment where the camera simply refused to show me the enemies, leaving me to guess blindly in the dark where they could be attacking from. This is simply unacceptable in any game in my opinion. The absence of good in my mind is not bad, it is average. Lords of Shadow is the definition of an average game. It functions, most of the time, within acceptable limits, but, does not excel at anything. I cannot recommend Lords of Shadow to someone who enjoys the series, since it is simply not a Castlevania game outside of name alone. It's a mediocre, bland, boring brawler that does its best to rip off other successful franchises but fails to capture any of its own rich history that spans twenty years in the making. This is what infuriates me the most as a fan of the series. This was truly a game franchise that I loved, that I avidly looked forward to whenever I heard it announced. Yet, despite playing through this game nearly three times at this point, I cannot excuse the ball of mediocrity that is Lords of Shadow. No matter the console, no matter how well done the port is, I cannot recommend this game, and I am sad to say that I’ve wasted too much time trying to force myself to love something that is not only undeserving of it, but also a failure to the series name that this should be abortion tries to live up to.

												This is one Truly Superb game. It's one of the few games i've played that excells in every area, and has little flaws in it. I've enjoyed other castlevania games, but Lords Of Shadow i'd say is the one i've enjoyed the most since Rondo Of Blood.The Story follows Gabriel Belmont, who is part of the Brotherhood of light ( A group that basically fights werewolves,vampires,etc). Before the adventure starts, Gabriel's wife is killed and seeks out an artifact called the God Mask(which has the power to bring back the dead). There are these beings called lords of shadows(some of which are recognizable to castlevania fans), which 3 of them has a piece of the god mask. Gabriel must find all 3 pieces, so that he can restore life to his wife. Now the story starts off weak, but it gets way better later on and not only that, it also becomes one of the most incredible stories you'll ever experience in the game. The characters are so well written and you genuinely care for them, due to the great dialogue that's in store. Now this is a reboot of the castlevania series, so it doesn't share the same continuity with the old games, it is it's own thing and I do like the direction MercurySteam went for the game. I would talk more, but Spoilers do not apply.The gameplay of Lords of shadow is a mixture of Hack n slash,platforming, and Puzzles. The combat has a lot of weight and impact to it, and there is plenty of moves to do to keep each battle fresh and exciting. There is the typical regular and area attack, but there is also a counter system which when you block an enemies attack at just the right time, you'll be able to attack them back. There is also some qtes, however these are more timing based, which I do like. you have some secondary weapons like daggers,fairies, and holy water, each of these is very effective depending on the enemy you face and it offers more strategy to the already superb combat. Later in the game, you'll get light magic(hitting an enemy will replenish your health and dark magic(more damage to the enemies), which like the counter attacks and QTE make it a unique experience. There is also a Dark gauntlet, which adds another demension to combat and it's also quite effective like the combat cross. You progressively get a new upgrade from each lords of shadow like super jumping and sprinting. People would say ""oh it's just a god of war rip-off"" when it really isn't, since it does several mechanics to make it stand out from the crowd(and also God of war Ripped off Rygar and Devil may cry so ha).The platforming is similar to the uncharted games, which not only is fluent, but also gives a break from the combat. there is also puzzles, which are all different. These are all fun and challenging, and if you're lost just buy the solution to it Literally. Level design is more linear, but there is exploration to find upgrades to your health and magic, which is reccomended to returning levels.The game is no cake wake, the game is geuinely challenging, Especially with the boss fights. The boss fights are usually a lot of fun to fight and require memorization, now the worst bosses are the ones where it's like shadow of the colossus. Why is that? well all it's just climbing then hold QTE(which is the only qte that annoyed me) and then repeatidly smash weakpoint, thankfully there is only 3 of them so no big deal.  Is there any flaws? yes, like some levels felt padded and it got a bit dull in some places. Other than that the game is really enjoyable as a result, and it's really lengthy up to 25-30 hours.The visuals in this game, still hold up even 4 years later. It's art direction I think is quite Unique for the series, and goes for a more mideval setting than past games. The texture work is generally rather solid with tons of deatail put into them, with the occasional odd texture. The animations are fluent and are fun to watch.  The sound is Stellar. The voice acting is up with the finest Quality, With voice talents of Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle doing a Swell job. Sound effects have a lot of weight to them, and the music, While different from past games, is Really good and is atmospheric. Now does it feel like a castlevania game? I Think so yes, it gives off the same rewarding adventure you have in the NES days, unlike the metroidvania games. In Short, I highly Reccomend the game, it's Really fun,looks great,sounds great, and just overall great.9/10 One of the best Action Adventure games you can get your hands on.			"

												TL;DR: Solid hack-and-slash, but a bit generic. 6.5/10, buy if it's on sale.PROS:- Solid combat and platforming- Good story- Good voice acting- Patrick Stewart- Very well optimized port (runs at somewhere around 250 FPS on my rig with vsync off)CONS:- Generic- Prerendered cutscenes look like♥♥♥♥♥br>- Cheesy narration- Overly reliant on trick bossesLet's get this out of the way up front: This isn't Castlevania as you know it. That doesn't make it a bad game, but it does mean that if you're expecting to be up to your eyeballs in gothic architecture you'll be in for a disappointment. The atmosphere here feels a bit disjointed, like they had a few really good settings and just mashed them together. Unfortunately, without that trademark flavor, the rest of the game doesn't do much to distinguish itself. I'm reminded a bit of the talk around Darksiders when it first came out. That title had a lot written about how it played like a sort of mish-mash of other, better known games. But where Darksiders managed to pick out a bunch of elements that worked and fuse them into a cohesive whole, Lords of Shadow mostly reminds me how good Devil May Cry, Assassin's Creed, God of War, and Shadow of the Colossus were and how I really ought to replay them one of these days. Now, even though it's generic, the game is still pretty fun once you get into it. Combat is fast and frenetic, heavily favoring an aggressive and ultra-mobile style while still forcing you to master timed parries. While it can get a bit mashy, the better encounters are quite memorable. The game has a good learning curve, but the better boss fights in it will require you to master the system - Cornell in particular is a standout here, and while it's controller-shatteringly difficult, that boss fight alone is worth the sale price. The rest, unfortunately, fall into the standard formula of ""Wait for the boss to do something stupid, punish, repeat,"" which is aggravated by the game being a bit too fond of quick time events. There are also three ""titan"" boss fights, which are straight ripoffs of Shadow of the Colossus.Overall, this is a decent way to kill an afternoon or two. Wouldn't recommend you pay full price, but it's worth adding to your collection if it's on sale.			"

												It's really a good game, but has flaws. Yeah some of them can be too frustrating for some but for me it delivers!So I can only urge anyone to just try it.Pros:- Graphic & Sound design are really nice even now (2015)- Beautiful vistas, lots of locations- Nice platforming levels- Combos, upgrades, fighting system- Different kind of enemies- Epic boss battles - The best for me is the Butcher ;)Cons:- Fixed camera angle (which can be pain in the♥♥♥♥♥sometimes)- QTE's from which 2 are ridiculous (but there's a solution using autohotkey)- Story, yeah some elements of it are not so great, but meh, what is perfect?

												Probably the best game in my library. This game gots almost everything you require from genere. The only thing that could be improved is a solution from devil may cry series which is punishing player from doing same combos over and over again. Besides that you get what you pay for. Don't bother listening to the ones who says its a bad thing to have fixed camera or no open world. In my opinion it's even better that you don't have to worry about your camera angle during fights and and the 2nd complain is just stupid. The game is long for nowadays standards and in addition on each level you can try doing trial which means you have to beat the level once more with a special conditions - so much for demanding challenge players. Castlevania is of course worth steam price but it could be lower. If you don't mind paying that much, well the game is for you.			"

												A functional and mediocre game with an unhealthy obsession for taking control away from the player. As a simple rule: don't use a cutscene to do something that can be done with the player still in control of the character. If you think the player may need to notice something, like the path forward, then map a button to ""focus"" so they won't get lost. Spending 10-20 seconds or more out of every minute pointing me in the direction that I'm already going is just wasting my time and kind of insulting. Repeatedly taking my abilities away to force me to play another time wasting, irritating hide & seek mini-game is doubly so.Reccomendation: Play Asura's Wrath or Devil May Cry or Tomb Raider or any of dozens of other action/adventure games.

												This game is cool as ♥♥♥♥. Yeah it's got problems, sometimes it's annoying and can be tedious, but the adventure is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ oddysey of gothic mysticism; immensely rich with a slew of dark-age themed settings and enemies to experience. It boasts stunning visuals, downright fun fight mechanics, loveable characters in an all around epic quest. Like the originals I found myself raging at the difficulties and inconvenient mechanics, but it's all worth it once you immerse yourself into the adventure and realise what a masterpiece of graphics  and conceptual gameplay you have at your fingertips.

												A delightful mix of exploration, puzzle solving, cinematics, story telling, mini games, 3D platforming and combat with some huge epic boss fights. Lots of content here I'm less than half finished and have about 16 hours in. Borrows alot of gameplay mechanics from classics like Prince of Persia, Tomb Raider, Assassins Creed but with a gothic narrative. Top notch voice acting from many famous actors and celebs along with a great musical score add alot to the gameplay. A gamepad or controller is highly recommended though, I'm not sure this game would work well with mouse and keyboard. The lesser combat can feel like a bit of a button mash at times but the tougher enemies and bosses require thought, planning and tactics making victories feel satisfying.			"

												This one is amazing, if you like lineair fixed camera 3rd person action adventure AND it's also Castlevania.. then you'll love this one. They went all out for this game. The graphics are still good, the story is awesome and the combat is just really cool to look at. It feels very long (finished in about 20 hours tho), it just keeps going on and on, but in a good way. Every chapter has a different setting, it doesn't get boring, but can get a bit tedious with some of the puzzles which feel like a useless task. But I really enjoyed this game.			"

												This is a great game for any castlevania fans. Full keyboard control with lots of key combos, magic use, lots of object interaction. Its the classic difficult castlevania with fixed camera persepective 3d style. There are sections of puzzles and such that will drive you mad. The bosses are sadistic. Super fun if you need that genre added to your library though. 10/10 would recommend to anyone that doesn't mind a superiorly precise and difficult game.			"

												A great game from start to finish. Excellent combat, a lot of depth to the combos, interesting story, great graphics, tight controls. The base game is incredible.Don't bother with the DLC, its garbage. The first one isnt so bad, but its more puzzle oriented. The second DLC is combat focused but its broken. Block will no longer work when it should, hit detection is all over the place, dodging rarely works. It feels like 2nd DLC was made by an entirely separate company, the combat is trash, the boss is a cheap damage sponge with some really awful hit detection and move sets. Hes also about 2 stories tall, can only be hit in certain spots and you can't block or dodge in air. Have fun!Highly recommend the base game. Do not recommend the DLC, even on sale.			"

												If you are a Castlevania fan, then this game will not disappoint you. After playing the 30 minute demo I was sold on it. The game play is fantastic and the storyline as usual is amazing. It's not a short game so you do get your money's worth. Sticking true to the 2d version, you play in a 3d realm with new combo combat moves and techniques to keep the game play interesting. Puzzle's have to be solve along the way but in general, this is a great game to own. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, the graphics and landscapes are just stunning. You want to just walk around a bit and just enjoy the scenery, it's that good. BONUS points with PATRICK STWART as the Narrator, and ROBERT CARLISLE as Gabrielle, it gives the game a touch of class that just feels right. I am thoroughly impressed and have I don't know what else to say except, play the demo and see for yourself.I had Deleted my first review of this game (done 2 years ago before this one) and looking back, it didn't it justice.

												This game is almost flawless, it oozes quality, every single pixel has been precicely placed and every mechanic works with fluidity and precision. The combat is very satisfying and the camera is clever and sharp (forget the negative comments on the camera, it works perfectly). During boss fights, the way the camera positions itself really adds to both scale and intensity depending on the type of boss fight. In my opinion the boss fights in this are more exhilirating than god of war's, and also more varied and challenging. This game is genuinely challenging which is a very good thing, bosses can take time to kill as you will have to ""learn"" how to kill them, the puzzles are not obvious either and require actual brain power to complete! A breath of fresh air in my opinion as I was tired of pushing blocks onto switches etc.The story is engrosing and enjoyable, I's helped along by brilliant voice acting by the likes of Sir Patrick Stuart and Robert Carlisle. The chapters are pretty long. Each chapter has between 2 and 7 levels within them. They each build up nicely and you are never in a place to fill time, it's all leading toward a short term or long term goal so I havent got bored. Upon completing each level you get a summery screen and the story is carried forward by narration. You are presented with a world map so you can see where you have been and where you are going next, which is helpful and also means you can choose to leave the game before taking on the next chapter. I've thought of this game almost being like reading a book, you can play a chapter, then put it down for a while and you feel youve made progres. Because places and scenery is always diferent you cant wait to get back into the game and see where it takes you, Just like a book.I'm not going to talk too much about graphics because if you do decide to make a purchase then they will speak for themselves. To say the art style is beautiful does'nt do it justice. It's jaw on floor time and easily gives Kratos a run for his money.The soundtrack to Castlevania is also brilliant, it's eerie and peaceful at the right times and epic, dramatic and energetic at others. It adds to the game in all the right ways, making the castles and woods feel spooky and grim and battle/dramatic events exhilirating and atmospheric. The game does borrow heavily from other games, for example the music is very similar to that of Oblivion's, a bad thing?? Not at all in my eyes. It also borrows from god of war but again builds on it rather than doing waht Dante's Inferno did and just carbon copy the mechanics. I'm not going to go into detail about where they have borrowed because it will spoil some of the surprise, but I will say that it is not just copying, the developers have put their own mark on the gameplay and the quality is of such a caliber that it's a compliment to the inventors.To sum up, as I have said in the title, this game is the real deal. It's a high budget and extremely high quality piece of software. The story is fantastic and you get the feeling you are playing a very special game that has taken a lot of time and care to create. I knew Kojima would'nt put his name to a sub-par game and I'm very glad I made a purchase. Full credit to Mercurysteam for making a genuinely awesome game and I hope we see many more games like this. It's not all about open world maps and multiplayer, other developers/publishers would do well to remember this.10/10 Epic...			"

												If you're expecting or want a metoridvania experience then this isn't it, it's a action/adventure more a kin to God of War than SOTN.  It begins quite slow fighting Goblins and lycanthropes reminiscent of Lord of the rings not Castlevania, however around 6-7 hours in the game shifts and becomes darker, you quickly forget the lush forest scenes that you travelled through previously and embrace a more familiar settings a eerie town, a abbey and of course a castle. Good points+Music - It's not your typical chip tuney cheese of old castlevania but instead well composed pieces with a lot of depth, not to everyone's taste if your not willing to forego your nostalgia +Art - The settings are incredible, the graphics are good but it's the art and the art direction that make the game stand out they get the most out of it by locking the camera in place+Combat - Alot of variety and generally really fun switching between differnt ""stances"" Neutral, Light and dark and then there's other items that enhance your abilities beyond that+Story - I really enjoyed it, it's dark fairy tale reminiscent of something like the brothers grim.  Good doesn't always triumph evil Bad Points-Combat - Variety yes, however it could be more tighter, Example Air combat yes you can launch enemies into the air but you quickly realise that being in the air is dangerous with no air block/air dodge you sort of hover in the air for unattended times open to enemy attacks, there is a stomp move that brings you down quicker but really should have taken a page out of bayonetta book here, -Oh the camera, I understand why they did it (I previously mentioned beautifull scenary) but the camera in combat can get stupid, it fixed so depending on the angle of the player and the enemy there can be times were you get punished cheaply from attacks off screen, not good.Would I recommend it yes, if you enjoy GoW combat, willing to give it 5-6 hours to get to the good bits (it's fairly lengthy game at around 20-30 hours) and not looking for the next SOTN.  I can't wait for the sequel			"

The textures have been given a massive update and everything plays smooth. The story is starts out simple enough, but gets better and better as you go. The boss battles are quite epic and the world design is just amazing to look at (Always makes me wonder, ""In this world, who built all this stuff!?"") *lol*That ending...That ending is so great! If you're considering this game, do not look at the trailers for part 2. ;)Use a controller! This game doesn't have a camera that rotates so there is no mouse, and keyboard is just a bit hard for this type of game. This is an outstanding reboot to the Castlevania universe.			"

												08-Jul-2016 : Finished main story + extrasEquipment : MSI GT80-2QE NotebookREVIEW :I really enjoy this game. The graphics are a little bit outdated but still good enough for a 6-year old game (originally released in 2010 for console). The music soundtracks are great and really captures the dark victorian atmosphere, The characters and storytelling are interesting with good voice acting, The locations are varied from chapter to chapter with great artistic level design. The puzzles are great and challenging but not too hard so they won't distract the player from the quest and story pacing. The puzzles also have in-game solutions so player can choose to bypass them if necessary. The boss fights are great and epic. I had a hard time putting down this game before I finished it because I really felt like I'm in an epic quest. Things I dislike, let see... the fixed camera system. Some platforming parts were really frustrating because of that. And then there's the story itself. Although I like the storytelling, some parts of the plot were silly and the ending was badly written. I don't want to spoil anything here, so you just have to start your own quest for glory. CONCLUSION :Recommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.			"

												Greatest compliment one can give to Lords of Shadow is that it's a very wholesome game which hits all the notes needed to be great, although some with varying degrees of success. It avoids this all too common modern trap of being single-minded by varying up the gameplay whenever it gets the chance; combat remains bread and butter of the game, but it's clear puzzles pull their own weight along with welcome snippets of lore for a complete package, all wrapped together with great graphics and amazing voice acting (MercurySteam decided not to pull a Bethesda and made good use of Patrick Stewart). Especially worth noting is the game's style which gives it its own visual identity through standout location and monster designs.That's not to say the game is without its problems, of course. Minor pacing issues rear their ugly head as you meander through early chapters and return once more at the very end of the game by hitting the breaks with a pair of dragged out puzzles when you should instead be getting pumped for the upcoming finale. Fortunately, none of these are big enough to be an unavoidable issue. What is unavoidable though, is that absolutely hackneyed story ending that comes out of nowhere for absolutely no reason whatsoever AND is punctuated even further by the game's final cinematic which makes even less sense unless you play through the DLC as well which brings some clarity to events. Speaking of DLC, and because it continues the story, it's worth mentioning that it is decent, especially the final boss which may be an exercise in patience. Maybe.High production values and developers who clearly put their hearts into making the game are evident and it's most definitely worth playing despite some minor blemishes here and there. Sequel is highly anticipated.			"

A storm is coming. Mankind faces ruin and despair. The world is changing, yet hope remains in the hearts of the people. We go about our daily lives never knowing the forces that can change our destinies forever; we are oblivious, ignorant like sheep to the slaughter. This night in the year of our Lord 1047, marks the beginning of our journey together; a journey into darkness, into madness. I watch him from the shadows. Is he the one? He has come far already but he will be tested; tested to the very limits of human endurance… and beyond. This night he rides looking for the old gods, armed with an amulet that has led him here; tonight he will begin his journey into oblivion.Castlevania:LoS is a hack & slash, very similar to the god of war series. You play as a member of the brotherhood of light, a man named Gabriel on his quest to fulfill a prophecy, and to bring his dead wife back to life. The game takes you through all sorts of environments, from lycan infested forests, old decrepit castles, mountains and valleys, and eventually hell. All of which are narrated by Patrick Stewart. Throughout the entire game there’s a foreboding feeling of things to come. With each location that Gabriel passes through, it takes its toll on him, one that is shown and felt through the great writing and character development, and even gameplay.The gameplay itself again is similar to the god of war series, combat being driven by combos, magic powers, relics, equipment, QTE’s and so forth. All of which can be upgraded with experience points, which you gain by completing puzzles and killing enemies. Some combos and abilities are intertwined with each other, and inaccessible until you upgrade a few or all abilities completely. The combat is really fun and fairly simple. Your main weapon is the combat cross, a chain weapon able to attack multiple enemies at once and dish out all sorts of pain, which can be seamlessly linked with any other tool in your arsenal, making the combat very fast paced and fun. Mixing up your combos, using differently abilities and not spamming the same stuff over and over is rewarded via focus. Focus is a bar that fills up as you fight, giving you more focus for preforming different abilities in conjunction, and generally being stylish. Once the bar is filled, your attacks start draining orbs from enemies, which can be absorbed into either light or shadow magic, used to power attacks and abilities in either form. Being hit once however will completely drain your focus, so it’s good idea to keep on the move, or get good at parrying(Of which, gives you full focus upon a successful parry) The light and shadow magic is an interesting system, both have meters that drain when you make successful attacks or preform magic in either stance. Light magic heals you upon successfully hitting an enemy, shadow magic makes your attacks deal more damage. Both have an array of unique abilities that can be used, and you can switch between them seamlessly.The graphics are decent but this is one time where the game actually looks better on consoles. The game makes use of blur and depth of field, of which on consoles, running at 720p hid some of the muddy textures and blocky meshes very well.  Again they’re not bad, but I remember when I first played this on the 360 I was blown away by how good it looked, and this was in comparison to games like Crysis, battlefield and heavily modded skyrim.  However, the environments are pretty stunning at times, presenting you with gorgeous vistas and locations with beautiful  and varied architecture. The animations are pretty damn good too, Gabriel moves, jumps and his attacks flow fluidly, as well as all of the creatures and enemies you encounter.One of the game’s strong points is the music. You’ll get beautiful orchestra music as you traverse levels, and brutal, tense scores in battles. The actual implementation of the music being perfectly timed as well, tempos kicking up during pivotal moments in combat and as you approach vistas and panoramas. Also, Belmont’s Theme. THAT’S ALL I NEED TO SAY.All in all, Lords of shadow is a very fun and superbly made, albeit sad tale. I don’t want to spoil much but Gabriel loses much, if not everything during his quest. Being a reboot, It sets up the series pretty nicely in creating probably the most prominent figure in the series. I got a good 15 hours or so out of the story, not counting the dlc which I haven’t started yet.Combat is amazing fun, brutal and addicting, flowing between combos, magic and abilities is fluid and satisfying.The story is well written and emotionally provoking, which surprised the hell out of me when I first played the game, didn’t expect such from a castlevania game.PATRICK FREAKING STEWART NARRATES THE GAME AND IS THE VOICE OF A MAJOR CHARACTER.BELMONT’S THEMEOkay this is getting way tldr.At $30 I’d buy it, but I was lucky enough to nab it on sale during the winter sale. If you like castlevania I recommend this, if you like Devil May Cry, God of War or other third person action/adventure games I recommend it. If you like Patrick Stewart I recommend it.Protip: avoid all media/videos/pics, information or any posts about Lords Of Shadow 2. It’ll spoil this entire game.And so it begins, the necromancer’s abyss lies at his feet. He is dark and terrible and the cries of the dead follow him wherever he goes. There is nothing but hate in his heart. Hate for those who have taken his beloved. Who have made him do terrible things. Who have taken his humanity. Now reap the whirlwind, scions of death, for comes the Prince of Darkness. "

												Very good third-person action-adventure game. It have a fascinating scenario, scoring of game characters by real actors, epic surroundings and music. Levels design was really highly developed, sometimes you saw on it and just forget what you must do.Scripted cut-scenes based on the game engine looks great.Actors voice make any game character looks like a living person.Scenario of the game is surprisingly not become bored through 12 chapters.It's really seems that executive producer of the original game was Hideo Kojima, which i cannot say same about final DLC...Most biggest minuse of game is the Reverie and Resurrection DLC (just my opinion). Cut-scenes based on drawing scetches, scenario of DLC leave only questions than giving answers, Patrick Stewart as Narrator was replaced. And most important final two chapters have a really pain in a*s difficulty, especially the final boss: he have all area attacks, they cannot be blocked or eluded with help of holy shield. This final guy absolute immune to crystal/fairy's/holy water. But somehow i kicked his a*s.Tip: FOR REFILL HEALTH/MAGIC USE CHAPTER 5-7.For All WHO WANT GET 100% ACHIVEMENTS i recommend youtube channel of On3ManCr3w. This guy rocks!			"

												  Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a video game time capsule for the year 2010. Although the Castlevania series is about as classic as it gets, the previous attempts to modernize the games into a 3D space had been... iffy. So rather than reinvent the wheel to directly translate the Belmont's 2D action/platforming, MecurySteam took a long look at what was already out there and popular and generously borrowed elements from proven sources; the platforming is Prince of Persia, the combat is God of War, the puzzles are... pretty standard puzzles. Even some of the monster designs are ripped straight out of another property that shares the “Lord of” title... Throw some Zelda and Portal in there for good measure, and you've got Lords of Shadow.  Even though you can't accuse the game of being original, it's still excellent. A surprisingly epic and involved story has the protagonist, Gabriel Belmont, on a quest to bring his deceased lover back to life. Told through highly produced and sometimes a little too long cutscenes (chock full of quick times events. Another mid-to-late 2000s staple.), you make your way through spooky forests infested with goblins and werewolves, dark caves, Frankenstein's booby trapped electric lab, hellish dreamscapes with shifting geometry, and a misleadingly minor stop at a vampire's castle. The rouge's gallery of Universal monsters and mishmash of creeps and haunts are well represented here. Even if the scarcity of classic gothic architecture is noticeable, it looks incredibly atmospheric and iconic when you're allowed to play in it.  Fighting back the creatures of the night is enjoyable if a little shallow. You use your whip to strike either directly at an enemy or in an arc, and use experience points awarded throughout the game to unlock more advanced moves and combos. While the pages of upgrades looks intimidating and impressive, I didn't find much need to commit any complex combos to memory beside specific moves needed to manipulate the environment and progress the game. You're fine just focusing on timing rather than fancy buttonwork, dodging and blocking as necessary and parrying and getting damage in when you have a window. Getting hit usually drains an alarming portion of your healthbar, but you can regain some of it back by activating one of your two gauntlets (the other one increases damage) and striking back. It's certainly competent, though I don't think the system ever really hits it's stride and the difficulty tends to be all over the place.  Navigating the sprawling levels is a highlight. There are secrets hidden everywhere, some of which you'll have to get to on a replay once your abilities have been upgraded. It's light Metroidvania, which is expected because of the later half of that genre. None of the backtracking is required, it's just bonus content for completionists or buffs if you're having trouble progressing straight through. The camera is fixed, which predictably leads to both beautiful shots and frustrating movement problems. The environments are almost uniformly gorgeous in a dark fantasy kind of way, although the proliferation of invisible walls can dampen your curiosity. You'll also be blocked by many puzzles which vary from gameplay mechanics quizzes, adventure game-type static screens, and a variation of chess. A few of them seem a bit too complex and involved, forcing you to completely stop for long stretches and shift gears to an entirely different genre, but they are satisfying to tinker with. There is also the option to basically skip them with a massive hint, which will forfeit your experience rewards for solving them.  Lords of Shadow is an all around solid game, a massive old school single player adventure that puts it's massive budget on the screen. It is a bit of an odd duck with it's nebulous genre hopping and shifts in tone, but the upshot to that is you're never doing the same thing for long. If you value variety, Lords of Shadow won't disappoint. The only truly negative things I have to say is about the DLC included in the “Ultimate Edition”; it's clearly much lower budget than the main game with unfinished “motion comic” story boards replacing the previous beautiful cinematics. And the last boss is absurdly difficult; a multi-stage nightmare that will remind you why you avoided aerial combat before and curse some poorly placed checkpoints and the game's refusal to refill your life after each chapter. Oh, and those chupacabras... probably the worst enemy to disgrace any game I've ever played. Not only do they steal all of your relics (temporarily to the point of it being useless but still annoying), but they're some awful failed attempt at comic relief in an otherwise deadly serious and straightfaced game. They'll taunt you with an obnoxiously high pitched, grating voice as you hunt them down and they don't stop. And you can't kill them. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ those things.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow takes elements from Devil May Cry, Shadow of the Colossus and Prince of Persia and merges everything together into one epic story.The game follows Gabriel Belmont, a knight of the Order of Light, on his quest to revive his wife Marie, while saving the world abandoned by God.Lords of Shadow is a very solid game offering you a long, well written story narrated by the talented Patrick Stewart.The gameplay is a mixture of hack-n-slash, platforming and puzzles, while none of these elements are outstanding alone, they are mixed well together to give you a great experience.This game is a must buy if you are a fan of the games mentioned before.But be prepared! This game is hard as nails, even on normal difficulty!PROS:- Great looking visuals.- Lengthy campaign with a good story, with lots of replay value.- Amazing soundtrack!- Outstanding voice acting from Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle- Simple, but satisfying combat system.- Lots of variety in landscapes/maps and creatures.- Epic boss fights.- The game is hard, but it's extremely satisfying after completing segments that seem impossible at first.- Performance wise it's a solid port.CONS:- Control wise it's not a great port. While mouse + keyboard work well most of the time, some parts of the game is unbeatable without macro or a gamepad.- Fixed camera can be annoying sometimes.			"

												At my first playthrough I was amazed how much Mercury Stream could mix up the castlevania universe in a single and solid storyline, with great combat and amazing bosses (except for the first two).On the second time I felt tired every time I had to face mechanics that forced me to run around in circles just to extend the playthrough or pass through chapters that were there just to fill space. They doesn't add nothing to characters, nor give you new moves.I still recomend this game because i loved it the first time i played it, but i assure you won't need to beat it uo more than once.			"

												I dunno, as much as i love the castlevania series as a whole, this game feels like the creators forgot how to make games fun. If your idea of fun is walking down hallways with an ALWAYS FACING FORWARD CAMERA you cannot control, and absurdly long and unintuitive fights then i guess this could be your thing. I usually play all my 3d fighters games (god of war/dmc/bayonetta/darksiders/kingdoms of amaulr/ect) on hard mode and usually enjoy the challenge it provides. And while the game provides challenges... it didn't feel fun. It was a series of short combo and dodging a very obvious attack. You can never actually do attack combo's long enough to do the cool combo's in the game before an enemy is about to strike (you cannot interrupt them from attacking you) so you're never actually ever able to do anything than a few short strikes and repeat. Fairly simple, but since enemies have SO much health it quickly loses an appeal and becomes a chore. After becoming bored with this, i put the game difficulty down to easy just so i could blaze through and still... it was more or less the same feeling, only now i didn't take dmg when i got hit. As for the platforming /exploration, its garbage. There are some secrets in levels that you have to get upgrades down the line and come back to, but its not like typical backtracking in metroidvania type games, you have to pick the stage and run through the linear halls to simply get back to where that thing was. It doesn't feel like you're making intelligent choices on how to use your upgrades, its just remembering where the item was and walking down those same hallways again to use the item on the door. It's not much but really the aspect of exploring is non existent and it makes a huge impact on how you as a player view the world. I got through probably around 25% of the game and quit because i just wasn't having fun with this.  And as many things they do right (voice acting/ visuals / story /ect/ some bosses were kinda cool) the core gameplay fails to entertain and thus the whole experience falls flat.			"

												        Another one of my personal favourites this generation! The reboot to the Castlevania series - this game originally did not start out as such - it was aptly titles ""Lords of Shadow"" before it got slapped on with the Castlevania name and sold as such, personally, I didn't mind the series being rebooted as the later 'Vania games were starting to get a little stale and this game refreshed my undying love for the franchise after the spectularly mediocre 'Harmony of Despair"".        The game stars Gabriel Belmont, a man from ""the Order"" sent on a mission to find and kill that which is harming the world whom intently does so after the death of his wife. While on his journey, he is watched by a man by the name of Zobek (Narrator & NPC) as Gabriel makes his journey to fight the Lords of Shadow.        Visually speaking, this game is a treat - the PC port itself was given a few touch ups from the console version and the difference is pretty noticeable - the game itself is still a spectacle. Not one area from the game is inherently repeated unless it's a backtracking section and the sights you see along the way change very drastically and occasionally - almost a bit too fast for my tastes since you're not likely to see the same stage more than twice, some even for a brief minute before the games moves you along. The character models have amazing textures to them, but the anatomy looks a bit silly. Gabriel himself looks like a tank (Gabriel)[hdgamewalls.com] and some characters look a bit off, but I'll gladly just pass it off as an art style as everything looks consistent and very well done. Just about everything in this game (even Gabriel's design) reminds me of Castlevania: Simon's Quest, and it even goes about through the same stage builds, from swamps, to the eventual Castle Halls, so this game has more in common with the older NES/SNES 'Vania titles than the more recent ones.         On to the gameplay! Easily one of the most fun titles I've played in recent history aswell. It has Direct attacks and Area Attacks, and as the game progresses you get to unlock more combinations and things to do, with some combos working better on certain enemies than others. (Personally, I was very fond of the HOLD/Direct combo - a move where the first input you hold down then tap up to 5x as Gabriel slams his weapon, very satisfying and damaging.) As you progress through the story, you'll unlock a variety of upgrades for Gabriel's weapon, and other handy thrown items aswell that are very reminscent of older Vania titles as well (such as Daggers, Holy Water, etc) that will be very useful as enemy types continue to vary through the game (IE - Daggers working better on Werewolves and Holy Water on Vampires). The gameplay is sadly not all that perfect though... Gabriel himself handles a bit clunky and some of his moves don't outright respond perfectly at times, which can lead to mishaps at times and some frustration - the very same goes for the game's multiple climbing sections, which I didn't really find all that fun or engaging personally. Some of the climbing sections have badly marked areas, some even don't tell you which areas you can jump to or from, or can climb to leading to even more mishaps, other than that, the climbing sections where mostly pretty linear so it just wasn't very much fun in the end and mostly served as padding to slow the game down. Without much spoilers, the bosses I think were the absolute best part about this game - the first two titans (battles that feel very much like Shadows of the Colossus) were awesome fights, and the Lords of Shadows themselves felt like intense duels that I occasionally went back to replay just for fun at higher difficulties.          In general, if you loved Castlevania in the past and you enjoy spectacle Action games, then you will probably enjoy this game, I say probably because it definately isn't for everyone. The static camera at first was a turn off for me, but I got used to it, it will undoubtedly varie to how much you enjoy the genre the game is based on. As it stands, it's still one of my better experiences this gen and I was happy it came to PC.			"

												Great presentation mixed with a questionable design choice about a fixed camera and quite frequent QTE.The game's levels are short and linear. The secrets have to be unlocked by returning to the levels later (at least the majority of them). This might count as 'Metrovanian', but the rest of the game certainly isn't. While the fighting feels fluent and the variety of attacks really works well in the game, the frequent use of QTE during almost any fight really got to me. If you like this kind of gameplay the game will be well worth it for you.Just not a game for me as an old school Castlevania player.			"

												This game is quite simply astonishingMost likely the best and closes thing to platforming games such as God of war etc you'll get besides metal gear revengeance I had a huge blast on this game on the ps3 version now the Ultimate edition for this price? Its a steal!. Do yourself a favor and get itYou'll play as Gabriel Belmont who is sent by the chapel of light to retrieve the Lord of shadow power to overcome evil. As you journey you'll face werewolves and vampires and plenty of different and twisted creatures of darkness. The bosses for this game is awsome, the voice acting is Great, HAIL PATRICK STEWART who narrates the game and plays a character. Aka ZOBEK who is the monk you'll meet. The music is also very memorable. Upgrades for your character is fun to pick and the graphic is well done for the pc version. This is a game that will work REALLY well with a controller over a keyboard for preference here. If you're a Castlevania follower since the old days the story to this game will completely twist the entire franchise for you. PLAY IT AND FIND OUT!+Great music and voice acting+Graphic is well done for the pc version+The story will blow your mind if you follow Castlevania+Great choice of combat style+Upgrades are fun and there are a few variety+whip it!+- Odd reason is some people dont like the boss Qte, to each his own I thought they were well done and not too overdone.+- Some of the ol school players refuse to believe this game is good and still love the old retro castlevania over this, they need to move on with thier lives.-Dieing in this game sucks, restarting takes a bit of time and the savepoints could had been done better- Needs a multiplayer- A little bit linear since its action adventure, its straightforward but you'll revisit places as you get power to gain more power- Keyboard felt a bit clunky for me, I used controller and did well with it, up to preference at this part of course			"

												I'd like to start this off by saying I am a big fan of the lore behind Vlad the Impaler, both fantasy and historic, so the story of Dracula that castlevania tells has always held a special place for me.This series of games is a retelling of the Castlevania story and the origins of Dracula for the game, and honestly it's probably the greatest fiction that's been told on it that I've ever had the pleasure of seeing (I will post no spoilers).  With that in mind I HIGHLY recommend playing this game, then immediately jumping into Lord of Shadows 2.  I have no knowledge on mirrors of fate as I have just received it, but those two flow beautifully.Bare in mind I say this knowing full well there are people out there that disagree with me, and that's fine, that's what is beautiful about video games, there are so many countless choices we can all like something and it doesn't have to be for the same reason.  Disagree? Awesome man! And I really mean that, I don't want us to all agree, because then life would be boring!Now that I can stop gushing (probably not) over the story, let's move on to the rest of the shenanigans:The controls in the game are akin to God of War, Quick Time Events and all.  I actually didn't mind several of the 3D Castlevanias so it gets a passing grade here for me.  The movement feels solid enough and didn't have any kind of sluggish feel to it, nothing stuck out to be fantastic but it did the job just fine.  I haven't attempted using keyboard/mouse controls as this is a game I feel best enjoyed on a controller anyway, so with that, your mileage may vary.The graphics are.....well, it's pretty enough.  There are a few spots that do make you go ""Oooooh, Ahhhhh"", but most if it is good enough that it holds emmersion, but not so pretty you want to stop to look at every detail...maybe only a few.  (All video settings set to max with fullscreen 1920x1080)The settings are....abyssmal, there really is nothing to select.  Vsync, AA, full screen/window, resolution, and that's about it.  I'd have liked to see a more enhanced menu in this day and age.  Yes this game has a few years on it, but let's be serious, we all know the settings of a console to pc port when we see them.The audio is fine, my Sonos Playbar and sub handled it quite nicely and it did well to hold the emotion that should have been with the particular scene.  The voice acting was hit or miss sadly....some characters sounded like they fit better than others, by large margins, and it really is a bit unpleasant; however, this is all countered by one fact: Patrick Stewart is narrating the game.  You tell me you don't want this man to read you a bed time story, I dare you.Gameplay: Not to bad actually.  It has a good mix of easy and hard puzzles, and some really well hidden secrets.  There's also some replayability with the backtracking to collect new items as you gain new abilities and the trials modes, as well as harder difficulties.TL;DR:Story: Epic, especially if you combine this game with Lord of Shadows 2 story.  Again, not everyone feels this way, that's ok.Controls: They're fine, there's nothing good/bad about them.Graphics: Eh, pretty enough.Audio: Good enough, sounded pleasant to my ears.Voice Acting: It could have been so much better, it was really super hit or miss.  But remember: Patrick Stewart narrating.Gameplay: Has a few spots of ""What the hell game...."" and ""Oh jesus christ I pressed the jump button right at the edge I should have made that!"" as most all Castlevania games do, but as we all would NEVER admit outloud, we know in our heart of hearts we didn't hit that button at the right time, they game was just better than us that day.Conclusion: Story weighed so heavily for me on this game, and I believe that to be the biggest contributing factor on me recommending this game.  As I've stated a few times, I understand some people may not agree on this. That's. Fine. With. Me.  I truly don't mind that, if you don't believe story is that heavy a weight for you, use the other information to form what you believe you'd like.  Best case scenario though, steam does have refunds now!			"

												Do you like the beat-em-up systems in God of War? And chosing skill chains to improve like Devil May Cry? How about giant mega-bosses ala Shadow of the Colossus? And what about climbing, swinging, jumping and scampering about like in Prince of Persia or the Uncharted series? How about a slightly overwritten origin story for the FIRST BELMONT EVER?!If even a few of those concepts appeal to you, you're likely to really enjoy this game. A version of all those elements from other sources were pretty much lifted and used here, but the whole is really more than the sum of its pilfered parts. Those disparate elements and more modified from other games really come together and shine here in a fun beat-em-up that wil keep you entertained throughout, and likely keep you coming back to complete some of the wacky challenges it throws at you after you beat a stage.It's easy to recommend, and I was surprisingly pleased by this little gem; so many new reboots fail to capture even some of the things that make their source great, but LoS does a fairly decent job in at least some of the boss fights, and by filling in some fun lore plot gaps in a tragic tale of bad decisions made for the right reasons. Also Patrick Stewart is there, so that's a big plus for this nerd.			"

												Cool game, challenging , the combat is nice and the art/production is downright amazing. Sadly, it's is just too long, in a bad way. Took me 18 hours to beat the game, and that's without searching for every secret. They could have made a 12 hour game that flowed perfectly, this starts to feel like a drag sometimes...			"

												Excelent game. The start of the game is slow and could get you bored by the pace killing stages, but it only keeps getting better and better.The game have fixed camera, but it just enhances the visual of the game, showing incredible detailed scenarios.The boss fights are amazing and the combat mechanic is trully great, rewarding skill and precision, where a simple Skeleton can kill you if you play poorly.The best part of the game is the Vampire Castle with the climax being the Vampire Lord boss fight. The game still takes hours to complete.Recommended.			"

												I recommend this game when it's on sale.Castlevania Lord of Shadow is a decent God of War clone. It is sad to see the series getting stamped off as that, especially for someone like me who's been sticking to the series since NES times! It's unlike any other Castlevania game i've played - at best it's Castlevania 64 redone in a good fashion. And this is where credit is due, it's a solid beat-em-up game.Graphics:The graphics are asthetic, Castlevania Lords of Shadow is filled with gorgeous sunsets and panoramic views. The animations are good. Fact is though - this game has a fixed camera. Maybe it was a design choice. It works well most of the time, but yea - you are going to die a couple of times because the controls will blatantly confuse the crap out of you in a directional matter.Sound:Orchestral soundtrack. That says it pretty much i think. In combat the music adapts to the situation (nothing new). Whacking sounds and blood gushing sounds grant some satisfation. Sound is okay.Story:There is a story which manages to chain the levels. It's not very memorable but that doesn't really matter. There is the occasional cutscene and some dialogues. Story is okay.Gameplay:Belmont has about 40 moves which you can buy with experience points gained by killing enemies, you are going to lose track but stick to your favorite moves and it'll be fun to try out new things. The action is very similar to the God of War series. Absolutely no complaint. Belmont also receives many abilities during your playthrough. Hidden permanent Life and Mana upgrades convey exploration. It's your standard run of the mill. You can replay previous levels to reach some of the upgrades that were unreachable before. A lot of 100% stuff to do that grants satisfaction if pursued. The level design - though good looking - is confusing sometimes. In Later game parts there are puzzles to solve, though they won't keep you from sleeping at night, they are fun most of the time. Controls are a bit washy. I seriously recommend a controller.Overall this game is solid but not very memorable. I recommend upping the difficulty to the maximum available and playing with a friend. Controller switches on death had a nice frequency and we had a lot of fun this way. The game isn't really mentally engaging, so you can still chill out and chat. Sometimes the difficulty hits you with a hammer - this is where the game shines, but it never feels unfair.			"

												Brilliant.So brilliant in fact that when I lost my save on the PS3 version 2/3 of the way through...I had to get it on here for the full HD experience and finish it!(don't bother with the DLC - it'll ruin the experience - even the developers said it was a mistake) But there's more than enough to keep you going in the main game!(want to know how to do that tricky puzzle in less than five moves?!? look no further...)

												I've always been a huge fan of the Castlevania games; this is an extremely entertaining iteration in the series. Even if you're just into these types of games (3rd person hack'n-slash) rather than the Castlevania series specifically, I'd still highly recommend it--the combat is fluid (quick to learn/challenging to master), the platforming (IMO) is akin to the Zelda/Darksiders games and challenging. Get the game.			"

												This game actually turned out to be quite lengthier than I thought it was going to be. It is, for the most part, a fun game. Unfortunately, problems lie in some of the wall climbing. If you've played Uncharted, think of that, except take what you know of that game and chuck it out the window. If you want to jump and grab onto another wall while you're already hanging on one, don't push the analog stick in the direction you want to jump. Instead, take your thumb off the joystick and wait until he automatically faces the direction himself, THEN press the jump button. This took me quite a while to get used to and also led to many frustrating deaths just simply due to the mechanics not being as fluid as they should be. Aside from those minor nitpicks, the game is very well optimized and runs at a silky smooth 60fps. The story is surprisingly pretty decent as it does have its own twists at times. There are different combos you can do with the whip, though once you get a few favorites, you might end up repeating those sets throughout the rest of the game. All in all, I highly recommend it and I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel. Hopefully the platforming will be ironed out better by then.			"

												Do you like the beat-em-up systems in God of War? And chosing skill chains to improve like Devil May Cry? How about giant mega-bosses ala Shadow of the Colossus?

												One of the best directed games I have played in a long time! The fightng system is so well designed, games like God of War or even Tekken could learn from the fluid combo mixing in the game! The music is masterful and the voice overs are as good, Patrick Steward! Every frame in the game is a moving painting, a masterpiece of a game with a story as good! I could go on for days on how this game is underrated, we all know ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s like IGN are reporters and not gamers, who only give good scores by how much they are paid. This game is a solid 9.5/10!

Posted: November 26, 2016
												I'd like to start this off by saying I am a big fan of the lore behind Vlad the Impaler, both fantasy and historic, so the story of Dracula that castlevania tells has always held a special place for me.This series of games is a retelling of the Castlevania story and the origins of Dracula for the game, and honestly it's probably the greatest fiction that's been told on it that I've ever had the pleasure of seeing (I will post no spoilers).  With that in mind I HIGHLY recommend playing this game, then immediately jumping into Lord of Shadows 2.  I have no knowledge on mirrors of fate as I have just received it, but those two flow beautifully.Bare in mind I say this knowing full well there are people out there that disagree with me, and that's fine, that's what is beautiful about video games, there are so many countless choices we can all like something and it doesn't have to be for the same reason.  Disagree? Awesome man! And I really mean that, I don't want us to all agree, because then life would be boring!Now that I can stop gushing (probably not) over the story, let's move on to the rest of the shenanigans:The controls in the game are akin to God of War, Quick Time Events and all.  I actually didn't mind several of the 3D Castlevanias so it gets a passing grade here for me.  The movement feels solid enough and didn't have any kind of sluggish feel to it, nothing stuck out to be fantastic but it did the job just fine.  I haven't attempted using keyboard/mouse controls as this is a game I feel best enjoyed on a controller anyway, so with that, your mileage may vary.The graphics are.....well, it's pretty enough.  There are a few spots that do make you go ""Oooooh, Ahhhhh"", but most if it is good enough that it holds emmersion, but not so pretty you want to stop to look at every detail...maybe only a few.  (All video settings set to max with fullscreen 1920x1080)The settings are....abyssmal, there really is nothing to select.  Vsync, AA, full screen/window, resolution, and that's about it.  I'd have liked to see a more enhanced menu in this day and age.  Yes this game has a few years on it, but let's be serious, we all know the settings of a console to pc port when we see them.The audio is fine, my Sonos Playbar and sub handled it quite nicely and it did well to hold the emotion that should have been with the particular scene.  The voice acting was hit or miss sadly....some characters sounded like they fit better than others, by large margins, and it really is a bit unpleasant; however, this is all countered by one fact: Patrick Stewart is narrating the game.  You tell me you don't want this man to read you a bed time story, I dare you.Gameplay: Not to bad actually.  It has a good mix of easy and hard puzzles, and some really well hidden secrets.  There's also some replayability with the backtracking to collect new items as you gain new abilities and the trials modes, as well as harder difficulties.TL;DR:Story: Epic, especially if you combine this game with Lord of Shadows 2 story.  Again, not everyone feels this way, that's ok.Controls: They're fine, there's nothing good/bad about them.Graphics: Eh, pretty enough.Audio: Good enough, sounded pleasant to my ears.Voice Acting: It could have been so much better, it was really super hit or miss.  But remember: Patrick Stewart narrating.Gameplay: Has a few spots of ""What the hell game...."" and ""Oh jesus christ I pressed the jump button right at the edge I should have made that!"" as most all Castlevania games do, but as we all would NEVER admit outloud, we know in our heart of hearts we didn't hit that button at the right time, they game was just better than us that day.Conclusion: Story weighed so heavily for me on this game, and I believe that to be the biggest contributing factor on me recommending this game.  As I've stated a few times, I understand some people may not agree on this. That's. Fine. With. Me.  I truly don't mind that, if you don't believe story is that heavy a weight for you, use the other information to form what you believe you'd like.  Best case scenario though, steam does have refunds now!			"

												I never got into the Castlevania series, really. I've played Symphony of the Night as a kid and well...it remained in my memory as the game with the funny voice acting and the fact that I had a friend whose mom's name was Vania...and she didn't had any castle.Why this little introduction you ask? Because in this case I'll be judging Lords of Shadow alone without using any other Castlevania game into comparison.I like it a lot.The game tells the tale of a man who lost his wife like so many others but while the plot may be not be  original the game does have some ""soul"" attached to it. The scenery of his travels will take him to wonderful places filled with story of an interesting and  world that has something to tell,  as any enemy in the game that have some backstory to them.The gameplay may take some time to get really interesting but once you have access to more ways to get rid of threats it feels like a fun and bloody playground while the boss fights will require your attention to patterns, signals and timing.While it isn't the best on what it does, Castlevania Lords of Shadow is competent and is worth playing for the atmosphere of the multiple places you'll pass by while looking for a way to free Gabriel from his pain. Ah, and I wonder how much people got mad at the Ice Titan.			"

												I haven't played old Castlevania games, so I can't say whether it is true to its origin. I can judge only having played this game, and it is one of the best slasher games on PC.What I look for in games is interesting story with memorable characters. The story in Castlevania starts in a bit cliched way, but then the tone slightly changes, and closer to the end there are a few interesting twists. The ending is great!Graphically the game is stunning even by modern standards. The level design and character models are very well done. The cutscenes (and there are lots of them) are also well directed.The gameplay reminded God of War which in no way is bad. You climb, fight monsters and solve puzzles. And of course there are huge bosses! Every boss fight is an interesting puzzle itself. Everything is very well balanced.The only minor flaw of the PC version is controls. I started playing on keyboard, but then preferred gamepad. All in all, I give this game 10 out of 10. There are a lot of collectibles, trials, artwork. So I will definitely play this game a few more times to get everything!			"

												Castlevania Lords of Shadows supprised me positivily. The story is really awesome and the characters are interesting especially Gabriel, the main character you will be playing with. The story is about Gabriel, member of Brotherhood of Light who is trying to save the world from evil by obtaining powers from the Lords of Shadows. If he can get the powers from Lords of the Shadows, he can also bring back his dead wife, Marie. Gameplay is abit clumsy if you are using keyboard and mouse. If you have Xbox controller it will make the gameplay much more smoother especially in boss fights.I would recommend this game for everyone who is fan of the previous Castlevania games, Gothic world or to anyone seeking really good storytelling, awesome boss fights and good voice acting. And even Patrick Stewart is one of the voice actors in this game! "

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadows is one of those games that was a pleasant surprise. I purchased it months ago in a sale, and never got around to playing it until recently. It truly is a great game. Graphically, it’s beautiful. The cut scenes are amazing, and the story is really enjoyable. The gameplay is a lot like God of War, Dark Siders, Devil May Cry, etc. I personally, did not have any issues with the controls. Keep in mind, this game was never designed to be played with a Mouse and Keyboard. If you try, you will have a bad time. Save yourself some headaches, and use a controller.Now, I don’t have an FPS counter, because I honestly don’t need a number to tell me if I’m enjoying a game or not. All I care about is that the frame rate is smooth, and constant, and for me, it was while playing Castlevania. I have an i7 5820K and an XFX AMD Fury, with a SSD, so just about any game runs great for me.The puzzles are a good challenge, but the game allows you to skip them, if puzzles are not your thing. Some of the boss fights offered a nice challenge as well.Overall, this is the Castlevania game I’ve been waiting for all these years, and I am extremely satisfied with my $8 purchase. I give this game, a solid 8/10.			"

												WOW! Just finished Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Ultimate Edition and I must say ""WOW"". What an Awesome and brilliant game. This is one of the BEST Hack and Slash games that I have played. This is a very long game but it is every money for it. There are 14 very long chapters. 12 chapters in the actual main storyline and 2 extra chapters as a Resurrection – DLC. You play as Gabriel and you follow his quest to revive his dead wife. As you progress throughout the games you will unlock new abilities and picking up new unique pieces of equipment but some of them come at high price.  There is also magical powers to use in combat and non combat situations. This can be upgraded as well during the game.  You will come across different monsters/creatures like trolls, ghouls, zombies, swordmaster, spiders and so on to Bosses and Titans. The Bosses and Titans are not very easy to kill and are very intense but once you figure out what to do, then it should be okay. There are also puzzles to solve in order to proceed which is very cool. Overall, I would rate this game 100 out of 10. Awesome and Brilliant game. Only if Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 was like this but it is not. SPOILERS here. If you ge stuck Youtube is your best friend sometimes for help.

												The first two chapters are, to put it bluntly, boring.  There are too many parts, fourteen acts in total to be exact and my playtime compiled to around six hours.  By the end  of chapter 2 I thought the game over but was astonished to find that there were twelve chapters to come.   If you can make it past the first two chapters then there is quite a journey ahead.    Chapters three through twelve are where the meat sticks to the bone.  Some may critique the game as a God of War clone but that's not necessarily a bad badge to wear.  What's important is the content not the cover and the pages read Castlevania.   From a gaming perspective this portion of Castlevania brings much enjoyment.   A fantastic and lengthy part of the game packed with so much content and beautiful scenery ready to be posted to your desktop. A wonderfully orchestrated score worthy of a night out to the Boston symphony.  Well designed combat based on skills that you can purchase at any time given you have acquired enough of the games currency.  Well designed and animated chapter ending enemies that truly invoke a sense of awe.  A theatre worthy dramatic narrative voiced by Patrick Stewart.   Imaginative puzzles and mini games, but perfectly presented such a way that you will not think of consulting a hint guide.  What Castlevania does best, above all it's wonderful attributes is that the game takes the player on a journey.  Few games have ever communicated such a fantastic sense of journey and the connection made by the game to the player in this respect is remarkable.If it all would of ended with Chapter 12.Apparently, for those unfamiliar with the history behind the production of the dlc, Castlevania Lords of Shadow was a huge success.  So much so that Konami was caught off guard by how well the game sold.  Konami had planned no dlc for Castlevania Lords of Shadow but hurriedly produced chapters thirteen and fourteen to capitalize of the success of the game.   What's wrong with the dlc is that it appears that Konami could of sold the two chapters as one chapter and that they split them into two for profit.  $20 in total at the time of release.  Content that would not approach one chapter of the main game.  As a whole they are short, have annoying plat-forming sequences based on precision not present in the main game.  The dlc incorrectly purports to tie up any loose ends left by the ending put in place by chapter 12.  If you skip the dlc you aren't missing anything.  Further, there are no professionally produced staged intermediary scenes as contained in the main game, only immersion jerking sketches left to tell the story of our hero.   The sketches are so poorly done in places that I could not discern what was happening upon finishing the dlc.Finishing the dlc.  Let us cross that bridge into the ultimate abyss.  The dlc amazingly gets worse.  What awaits you at the end of the dlc is unfortunately a most frustrating experience.   Given that you have traversed such an expansive game and have taken the time to trudge through the cretinous dlc, you may be compelled to try and finish chapter fourteen.  If you so choose then I wish you good luck.Addendum:To supplement my comments, noting that as a matter of record, Konami has called the dlc a mistake and that senior management thought it would be a good idea and the dlc was rushed.http://www.gamespot.com/news/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-dlc-a-mistake-says-konami-6384937 "

												I'm so glad I bought this game. It has a great story, great voice acting, awesome graphics and some of the best enviroments I've ever seen. Also the soundtrack is truly epic! But what about the most important thing in a hack'n slash, the gameplay? It's really good. You have your normal and area attacks, you gain experience for killing enemies and solving puzzles which you spend to buy new combos. Combat is very strategic, you need to know when you're going to block or dodge, when you're going to use your light or shadow magic. It's challenging at times but it pays off in the end. Cannot wait for the sequel!			"

												Super slick graphics, mixed with a cool storyline. This game is quite immersive and will throw some cool animations and mechanics at you that will make it worth buying the game.  Once this game is beat, the sandbox quality drops, would like more expansions as this game is quite linear.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is pretty cool I guess. Now, to get this out of the way. My experience with the actual Castlevania series is about as thin as the condom my parents used on the night of my conception. I played a little bith of Symphony, a little bit of Rondo of blood on an emulator when I was 11  a Super Nintendo, and a little bit of Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin for this magical two screened device I found in the back of a dumpster.  This being said, I do like the series even if I haven't gotten around to playing them. I know who Simon Belmont is, and who Dracula is, and who Trevor Belmont and Richter Belmont are. I know the general lore and backstory behind the games, and I know just how deep and involving the series was, especially Symphony of the Night and onward.http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/castlevania/images/5/51/DracSymph.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080227221523 This is Simon Belmont, right? Anyway.Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a reboot to the long standing and venerated Castlevania series. Set in Southern Europe during events that totally happened. When Earth's ties with Heaven is severed, a bunch of bad things happen such as dead people walking and evil monsters knocking on your door and asking for a donation in human flesh. Knowing that the end of the world is upon us all, the Brotherhood of Light decides to send only their tallest and most handsome knights on a crusade to stop this evil and save the human race.   Seriously, they're all jacked.  But the tallest and most handsome of them all is Gabriel Belmont, a newcomer to the series. Gabriel is seeking atonement for the sins of his past as well as vengeance for a love lost to him. He does this by grabbing what could possibly be one of the coolest weapons in video game history and punching the love of Christ into anything that looks like it came from a Bram Stoker novel. What seperates Kings of Comfortable Shade from other Castlevania games is that it's a hack-n-slash brawler in the same vain like God of War, a big departure for the series but I feel like it did good in this regard, if not better than it's angry Greek man counterpart. All of Gabriel's attacks have this meaty weight to them, the general crunch of his combat cross and the big flashyness of the impact give an impression that hits a little harder than your average human. Take this and add it to a simple yet versatile combo system, and you have room to make your enemies say ""That was sick"" right before their skulls are punched out the back of their heads. But how does it play out? Lords of Shadows is, to my knowledge, the first Castlevania game handled by a studio outside of Japan, though I'm probably wrong. But you can tell that Spanish based Mercury Studios put a lot of love into the world and lore of this game. Lords of Shadow has that advantage that many games of it's calibre lack, and that is that Lords of Shadow isn't afraid of explain things to the player. The way the world works, what does what, who is who, and what I'm punching in the head is all laid out and explained to Gabriel and, in turn, to the player.What does this mean? It means I know that a guy called Gandolfi created the combat cross after playing with a yo yo and thinking ""This could probably hurt somebody."" I know that the more human a vampire looks the more likely it is to go all Sith Lord on you with the lightning hands. I know that the Forgotten One is a huge prick, and I know that there probably aren't any cute lycan girls. They wouldn't date you anyways so it's okay. Should you play Fortressmania: Dukes of flashlight? Is it a good game? I would say so, it does many things better than it's competitors, It's world is unique and interesting enough to make you want to learn more, and Gabriel himself is a pretty cool protagonist for what it is. It also helps that the game's plot is narrated by Patrick Stewart. You can hear his bald, it's amazing. But is it a good Castlevania game? I'm probably not the best person to ask. I like the series, don't get me wrong. It's just that I have never actually gotten around to sitting down with all of them. if you treat it for what it is, a reboot seprated from the main franchise, then you'll probably like it. But if you look at it as another piece in the main adventures of Belmont and pals, then it would probably leave a bad impression with you.  But I, personally, enjoyed the game and have a new respect for murdering the hell out of things with a crucifix. Combat Cross carnage: The reckoning gets 9 cheesy PS1 era dialogue lines out of 10. Vampires can only enter your home if you invite them in. But they'll still feel uncomfortable if you sit on your bed naked with a rose in your mouth. Don't ask how I know that.The curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

												Castlevania Lords of Shadow Part 1,When in decided to drop an few bucks on this game, i was hoping for an ""hack and slash"" game including an decent storyline. and within an hour of playing I was disapointed, very disapointed. First, i could NOT use my mouse, and second, the keyboard layout was terrible. So I spend some time remapping the keyboard layout. The new layout was better but caused my hands to cramp. AND i could not move my point of view. So after an hour i closed the game and went on with my life, dissapointed in a game that could have so mutch potention in being an great game.After an week, I was still thinking aboud the game and how I was going to make it work. So in the end, I went to the store, bought an Xbox ONE controller for 55 euro's (11 times the monney I dropped for this game) linked it with my pc and started playing again. It was an relief. The controls made sence, my hands didn't cramp and the point-of-view problem didn't seem that bad anymore. after i got my controller, 20 more hours were needed to complete the game and I enjoyed most of it to the max. Puzzles were good and solvable without having to use an walktrough all the time. and the story was good enough to keep me intrested all the time. Sadly, to fill time, battles are often way to long, taking up way to mutch time of the game. an boss battle should be 5-10 minutes in an good game, not 15-20 mintes of intensive button mashing in my opinion.Long story short:Pros:Awesome story, lots of different enemys, good graphics, enough attack options.Cons:Controller essential, battles can become to long an boring.So if you are an fan of an good story, linked with good and refreshing puzzles and somhow long battles AND own an controller then this might be an good game for you to pick up.

												Mercury steam reboot of the Castlevania series is a interesting spin of the ip in the realm of spectacle fighting.This first title is also organized in non connected sequential levels which still contains secret to be unlocked with abilities discovered much further in the game story. Instead of backtracking to retrive this secret the player can play again the same level and unlock the secret (as players of Devil May Cry series are already used to). While this decision somehow removes the sense of grand scale typical of Castlevania castles and all, it also allow for some creative choices for the level design.The combat system is solid, strikes have impact force despite being almost all whip based and allow for a decent amount of combination, crowd control and power strikes, but not as much as tytles like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. Mobility during combat is also more limited, you have a dodge roll and a samersoult that can be linked to a reposte attack: they work fine, but they are that. The interesting combat mechanic is the focus mechanic, which builds up a meter for chaining combos and variation of techniques used (as the meter of score for Devil May Cry) and is set back to zero if you are hit. Instead of just being linked to a score rating this focus meter is directly linked to the combat. Once it is filled enemies start giving magic refill, which you can absorb to fill up one of your two magic style (healing/defense style or heavy attack style). Timing your block properly is probably the most efficient way to build up focus meter and create opening to attack even stronger enemies. The sync block mechanic (such is the name of this timing block thing) will create a sort of light explosion which will stagger enemies and slow time for a bit, great visual effect and good for planning your reposte.Enemy variability is high enough both in visuals and in style of combat. Some of the big enemies also have a mechanic of taming, which enables the player to mount them and use them for fighting or accessing various places otherwise inaccessible. The boss fights are either a cheap Shadow of the colossus knock off, or some very interesting and challenging ones. I have no idea why they tried to the first type when they had such interesting ideas and mechanic for the other boss fights.The story is not brilliant but it does its job adding some plot twists and interesting folklore characters.In conclusion, as someone who played too many times Castlevania Symphony of the night and the whole Devil May Cry series I did enjoyed my time playing Castlevania Lord of Shadows, a nice mix of these two type of games. If you also liked these two type of games give it a try.			"

I cannot recomend this game enough, Story starts off a little slow but the excitement of the game builds up pretty quickly to the point where I just gotta finish this game! Lots of conent too, put in a good 10 hours or so and barley got halfway through the game. Ohh and did I mention Patric Stewart is narrating the game? I think thats reason enough to purchase this. :)			"

												This game was an incredible work of art as a Console game, and was enhanced even further as a masterpiece with the PC port. All of the textures are redone in high resolution with extreme detail, and the beautiful backdrops and characters are breathtaking to see with the graphical enhancements. The game also runs at 120 fps with no issue for 120hz monitors, making its fluid animations even more of a pleasure to watch than before.The game controls play very similarly to the God of War or modern Ninja Gaiden series, with a vast array of combos and special moves used in all of the combat scenarios, where you will fight a ton of enemies of varying difficulty, along with a number of mini-boss and boss characters. The game responds very well to button and joystick inputs, although you will need a gamepad to play this game as it was designed with the analog stick in mind (keyboard/mouse has some limitations as a result). The animations and combos feel like a natural extension of your will once you get the hang of them, and the depth of how far you can take the fighting style goes as far as you're willing to take it. The harder difficulties present an intense, but not unfair challenge. A highly skilled player will find the combat challenge to be rewarding.The story of the game is probably one of the most ambitious stories told in the entire series as it tries to explain the origins of the main characters in Castlevania. The story pays tribute to previous Castlevania games and does a good job of trying to be consistent with previous lore, interpreting some of the past events in a way that is believable even when altered slightly. Some of the dialogue is powerful and moving, even in its subtleties, while other parts are a bit over the top dramatic - a mixed bag of writing overall. There are also a few inconsistencies that just don't make a whole lot of sense, but the presentation is so professional and the voice actors are so good that I found myself just enjoying being taken along for the ride.If there is one feature of this game that needs to be brought out into the spotlight for everyone to see, it's the sheer beauty of the game's backdrops and artistic direction. I have never seen a game so beautiful in my life, and because of this, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow has a special place in my heart. There was a great passion put into this game, and it is evident in each and every location you visit. I was blown away in awe when I played the game on the Xbox 360, and then even moreso when it came out on PC.And if the graphical presentation wasn't incredible enough, the musical soundtrack is just as inspiring to experience. A fully orchestrated musical score lends a vast range of emotion to every scene, and there have been countless times where I have just stopped playing the game to listen to the music while taking in the scenery of whatever stage I was playing in.As a final score for Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, I've got to give it a 9 on 10. I'd give it a 10 on 10 because of just how unique an experience it is to play such a artistically beautiful game, both graphically and musically, but the few inconsistencies in the story and the inability to control the camera take away from what would otherwise be a perfect game.Note: The DLC for this game is a joke (bundled as two extra chapters on PC version), and is not reflected in this review. For the record, I give the DLC a 0 on 10 score. It is the worst DLC I've ever played for a game, and deserves its own review section, but I won't get into it here. Fortunately, it's very clear when you've reached the ending for the original game, as you will get the credits roll and are put into the main menu. At this point, the original game is over. Play the DLC at your own risk.			"

												Castlevania Lords of ShadowPOTENTIAL SPOILERS BE WARNEDThis is honestly the best game I have ever played so far, it has all the elements that I love: fantasy, mythology, creatures and really good characters!Unfortunately, nothing is flawless.The controls are pretty f*cked up since Castlevania originally was intended for xbox and playstation. Therefore I managed to play with my ps3 controller instead which helped out a lot (it was overall easier to navigate the character).The other issue is the ""DLC"" in the game, after you are done with the main story, it will continue on as a DLC mission for Gabriel.This mission is awesome until you get to the final. There you will battle a creature that will get on your nerv so much that you unintentionally will eat your fingers in frustration and slam your head in the wall xDNow I had no problem battling that creature.. until I realized that it would take 40 minutes to take down 10% of it´s HP.It was overall frustrating and I think they just could have left off with the final battle in the main story, than just making this s*it up.But Main Story!!! Super Awesome, never been happier, the best boss battles ever (except the DLC) so I recommend it! :) "

												Although it's by no means a Castlevania game in the truest sense, Lords of Shadow is a pretty awesome spectacle fighter that the PC definitely doesn't have enough of.From what I played so far, you can already tell that this is a completely different interpretation of the Castlevania lore, though that really shouldn't prompt you to hit ALT+F4, since the combat is actually quite satisfying, as both the lesser and greater foes in these games are satisfying to kill, and the big guys, although challenging, don't feel like they're designed to sap the fun out the rest of the game. Outside of combat, the control mapping might not make sense, since most games often have you use the light attack button to interact with objects.While some may be put off by the lack of proper keyboard controls, let's be honest: This is a genre designed to be played on a console. Depsite this, the porting quality is actually pretty darn good (though the graphics menu may tell a different story)			"

												I believe it is important to go into this game with a fresh mindset for a fresh game. Do not go in expecting Dawn Of Sorrow, Super Castlevania or any of the past Castlevaina games or else you will be disappointed, this is a total re-invention of the series.First brought out on 360 and PS3 this is a well done port of the consoles' game. Gameplay is for the most part fluid and exciting though the unmovable camera can be cumbersome, however this is not a massive problem for the most part and is unlikely to cause player death. The combat system is a finely tuned version of hack-n-slash with lots of combos to unlock and learn. Despite the large amount of different attacks they combinations are easy to learn and remember. Attacking feels satisfying and fights offer a lot of variety as each different type of enemy has unique attacks and fight styles which encourages learning new fighting methods mid-battle and changing up attacks constantly. An area ‘Lords Of Shadow’ excels at are its environments. Each place Gabriel journeys through hints at unspoken history with snippets of past adventurers fates scattered about. There will be many times you may feel the want to put down your controller and take in the spectacular atmosphere rich scenery. The voice talent in this game is solid with great performances from  Robert Carlyle as Gabriel Belmont and Patrick Stewart as Zobek who convincingly carry the game’s dark plot forward with weight and impact. The story itself is engaging and a great example of character development. I strongly recommend this game for players new to the Castlevania games and to long time fans who have not picked this up yet. For those who owned the game on console, it looks fantastic in 1080p however the cut-scenes have not been up scaled which makes them jarring.  However I would not recommend buying it at full price if you are only interested in the DLC as it is telling that the creators stated they did not want to make any DLC but were pressured into it given the game’s successes.. While ‘Reverie’ plays to the game’s strengths and gives more insight into Gabriel after the main game’s final battle and the child-vampire Laura and turns out as enjoyable and interesting, ‘Resurrection’ is simply an extended platforming section filled with many instant death hazards with a single boss battle at the end which is underwhelming and unfair as it punishes you for using the combat tactics the game has taught you to use during the previous 18+ hours of playing. At least though the end of that DLC gives a little more story that is useful to know going into LOS2.Overall a great game that will satisfy for at least the core experience. There is a lot of re-playability on offer to collect hidden items and power-ups and use abilities found later in the game in earlier areas which should keep completionists happy and the beautiful environments and memorable characters will stay will players for a very long time.

Dracula's Castle, Transylvania, Belmont, Whip, Vampires, Demons, Werewolves, even Zombies, all of those i can remember from those times when the SNES was king and i was playing some game i've never finished, a game called Castlevania: Dracula X, so at the end of 2013 i bought this game to recall those memories and found out what i was missing these years.To start off, I always like to focus in 1 game at the time, 2 max, so i can collect the best experience from them in terms of playability, storyline, visual arts, music and voice talents, my previous to this one was Batman: Arkham City, if you know that game you know that is very fluent in terms of combat and how you explore the map, so anyways i finished that one and embarked into this one, which wasnt very good idea cuz the first thing i noticed was something that bothers most of the guys that did a review on this one, it was the unholy fixed camera, i felt prisoner of the view and sensing that i was missing secret areas and♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you know what? somehow it kinda multiply my curiosity to search here and there for that hidden stuff, also i understand why the camera is fixed, it is to show you those breathtaking sights of the Castlevania world, i found myself stopping on my steps to take several snapshots and later watch them analize all those little details, no matter if you're in the bright forest or in the shadows of a ghotic castle, you're immersed in a beautifully designed piece of art.About the controls and combat system, like other games you start with basic techniques which soon have to be evolved by skill points, but it really depends on the player to be executed properly, for this i used my Xbox controller and felt most of the learned stuff works different on certain types of enemies, its not like you mash buttons like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to win, you have to develop strategy in order to really enjoy kicking♥♥♥♥♥ altho i've mastered most of the combat moves, i felt the sprint move just refuses to work sometimes (must be cuz of the analog stick).. overall the controls are sweet and responsive, you do have jump control but abusing the upgraded wing jump will cause to fail even the simplest plataform navigation.About characters and story. Most of all knows the story of Dracula, some of us knew something about the Belmonts in Castlevania games, lots of people know the idea of a god and its nemesis satan, betrayal, now merge all those in the reimagined mythos of this canon, the more i knew about the tragic story of Gabriel Belmont the more i've wanted to finish the game, his hardest fight against the dark. I have a thing with antiheroes in games, they usually have the lost love cliché but here is portrayed in such desperate quest for truth that i was compelled to fight till the end to reveal IMO one of those ""Luke, i am your father"" twists, at the end i was like, how much pain can a soul endure? or in words from a previous castlevania: what is a man? a miserable little pile of secrets...About the sounds, they are really good but IMO is the weakest part, i mean i love the atmospheric vibe they project upon all the chapters of the game, from ominous darkness to the melancholic ones, but something i really remember from old SNES castlevania was its characteristic music, it would be nice to hear a rendition of Bloody Tears, that song is THE♥♥♥♥♥♥ As to the voice talents, i wasnt quite satisfied either, i mean is good and all but Gabriel sounds irish sometimes when he should be rumanian, or Zobek whose face was asking for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Sean Connery but instead is Patrick Stewart, i mean he did a good work but his voice was this bald space captain in my head, anyways, i guess the rest was ok.Final words, I recommend this game for sure, if you're fan of platforming, adventure, good stories, or Castlevania fan, talking about that last, i remember why i didnt finished that old Castlevania: Dracula X, it's cuz that game was mother♥♥♥♥ing hard as balls, and thinking over, being super hard was a crucial characteristic in this franchise, but to be honest this game was quite easy to complete even in the hardest diff (Paladin), except for the last boss, and i mean that ♥♥♥♥ing final battle... i lost count on how many restarts i had to do in order to defeat that cheap shot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mother ♥♥♥♥♥, if you get there you will hate his guts for all eternity, someday i will beat that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t cheater again, but not tonight nor tomorrow, i curse him to hell and ♥♥♥♥ the guy who programed his devastating stupid area attacks, dont take me wrong, when i finished with that last boss i felt like i really did accomplish something in games, that kind of feeling that you get from deliver the final blow on the hardest final bosses and you find yourself with your heart at full throttle and your arms raised in victory saying YEAH ♥♥♥♥♥ I GOT YOU, DIE FOREVER YOU PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥ lolGood game, looking forward to the 2014 follow up.

												Being a huge fan of the Castlevania franchise I was a bit anxious about playing this one. Many Castlevania die hard ""fans"" claim this to be not a real Castlevania game. Though I could somewhat see where they are coming from, this game is definitely different. A lot of lore isn't there, the game itself is awesome and it's one of if not the best 3D Castlevania games. The story is awesome, the voice acting was an amazing surprise, and the music as always in every Castlevania game is superb. If i had to knock down this game its the controls. For the most part I had no problems with using a keyboard/mouse but there were instances were my attacks were delayed and it wasn't registering with what i was pushing. Also two of the boss fights are absolute B.S. and i doubt i would have ever beaten without using a controller but in terms of controls that was my only gripe. The other problem is the game could feel repetitive for many, it is at its core, a hack and slash which many find repetitive. Though with addons such as shadow and light magic, different secondary weapons, a large amount of different combos and the various amount of enemies kept the game refreshing for me. Also it looks gorgeous. I'm very excited for Lords of Shadow 2 which will be coming out this month.			"

												I can recommend this game for every PC player, who wants to try some hack n slash game, but hate console like me.. perfect GoW style game, with many bossfights, monsters (bestiary included, thats big + for me), and nice fighting system.. theres also some jump section in the game, which are also good, not perfect, but not boring too.. storyline is classic cliche, however, that doesnt have to mean its bad story :)   only bad thing i hate about this game is, that you have only one weapon through the whole game, which is kind a problem when the game is pretty long.. but i havent felt some stereotype in fight section, maybe because of too many monster types :)   oh, and for me, theres one more good thing, which is that, you can skip some annoying puzzles and dont waste time with them.. u wont get reward, however, u wont be frustrated by them.. so thats all I think, i really enjoyed this game from start to the end, and im looking forward for LoS 2 :D (i played only original game, havent played DLC yet, but i think it will be good as main game, because it adds only two more chapters which i think, wont change much in game itself)			"

												I believe it is important to go into this game with a fresh mindset for a fresh game. Do not go in expecting Dawn Of Sorrow, Super Castlevania or any of the past Castlevaina games or else you will be disappointed, this is a total re-invention of the series.First brought out on 360 and PS3 this is a well done port of the consoles' game. Gameplay is for the most part fluid and exciting though the unmovable camera can be cumbersome, however this is not a massive problem for the most part and is unlikely to cause player death. The combat system is a finely tuned version of hack-n-slash with lots of combos to unlock and learn. Despite the large amount of different attacks they combinations are easy to learn and remember. Attacking feels satisfying and fights offer a lot of variety as each different type of enemy has unique attacks and fight styles which encourages learning new fighting methods mid-battle and changing up attacks constantly. An area ‘Lords Of Shadow’ excels at are its environments. Each place Gabriel journeys through hints at unspoken history with snippets of past adventurers fates scattered about. There will be many times you may feel the want to put down your controller and take in the spectacular atmosphere rich scenery. The voice talent in this game is solid with great performances from  Robert Carlyle as Gabriel Belmont and Patrick Stewart as Zobek who convincingly carry the game’s dark plot forward with weight and impact. The story itself is engaging and a great example of character development. I strongly recommend this game for players new to the Castlevania games and to long time fans who have not picked this up yet. For those who owned the game on console, it looks fantastic in 1080p however the cut-scenes have not been up scaled which makes them jarring.  However I would not recommend buying it at full price if you are only interested in the DLC as it is telling that the creators stated they did not want to make any DLC but were pressured into it given the game’s successes.. While ‘Reverie’ plays to the game’s strengths and gives more insight into Gabriel after the main game’s final battle and the child-vampire Laura and turns out as enjoyable and interesting, ‘Resurrection’ is simply an extended platforming section filled with many instant death hazards with a single boss battle at the end which is underwhelming and unfair as it punishes you for using the combat tactics the game has taught you to use during the previous 18+ hours of playing. At least though the end of that DLC gives a little more story that is useful to know going into LOS2.Overall a great game that will satisfy for at least the core experience. There is a lot of re-playability on offer to collect hidden items and power-ups and use abilities found later in the game in earlier areas which should keep completionists happy and the beautiful environments and memorable characters will stay will players for a very long time.

												It's a decent action platformer, but be warned the last boss fight (as part of one of the UE DLC's) is about 50 times harder than anything else in the game for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason.Pros: Great sound track, decent combat, responsive controls, many boss fights have some pretty cool cinematics.Cons: My god the writing...  Plot is kinda nonsensical, hard to understand character motivations, also the camera.  You will fight the camera quite a bit.  Protip, the camera will win 90% of the time.Buy this cheap under $20 bucks and enjoy a game that will probably take you about 25 - 30 hours to finish if you don't care about completion, an amount of time that has been drastically reduced with games in the last two years...

												So, really not terrible.  I wasn't sure what this was going to be when I got it, but i've been a fan of the Castlevania franchise since I was a kid and thought i'd give it a go.  Good story, okay controls, no replayability.  It's like if you took God of War and dropped it into the Castlevania mythos.  Worth a playthrough.Oh, and the large bosses were pretty dope.			"

												Castlevania Lord of Shadows ReviewReloaded, revitalized and repacked with sharp graphics, orchestral music, all-star cast plus a grim & dark fantasy storyline that will grip you on the edge of your seat.  For anyone unfamiliar with the games style format, it is played pretty much like Devil May Cry. The hair is definitely waptastic and sort of killed some of the vibe for me. However, much unlike DMC, Castlevania doesn’t focus so heavily on combos which gives you some room to breathe and whilst still visually stunning at 60FPS. Throw in some elements from God of War, add a dash of final fantasy (hair, hair, hair) plus a little Darksides and you have Castlevania Lord of Shadows. However… This game is completely its own. Castlevania Lord of Shadows is a perfect game for those who are long, long-time fans of the game as well as those new to the series. No need to do your homework as, by the second scene the story & objectives are clear whilst you’re taken through combat & gameplay by appropriately placed tutorials. Although even by hour 2 you’re still learning new things about the game and the tutorials can become a little annoying by this point, it’s merely a dent in the game’s overall campaign, featuring a sizeable number of chapters. You will continue to be surprised through each scene and the first 4-5 hours of the game make it hard to get up and use the bathroom. As your taken through dark forests, spellbinding coves & treacherous roads you way will be filled with a variety of enemies and ‘elite’ (harder) enemies that encourage and sometimes force you to really think about how to play this ‘hack n slash’. It’s worth mentioning at this point that if you don’t have a controller pad, you will likely want to reconfigure the controls for mouse & keyboard as the default option is not only awkward but down right painful sometimes. I spent about 2 hours of time trying the keyboard only configuration already laid out but after death number 785,966 I eventually caved. Note: Hard mode is actually hard & my antique thumbs heavily await paladin mode! Dying in Castlevanaia isn’t such a big deal, there’s no lengthy loading titles or a series of screens reminding you of your failure, instead; you see Gabriel illuminated in slow motion for a few seconds and are magically thrown to the ledge you fell off or entrance to the area you last stepped through, health fully restored. I really liked this about the game as it kept it consistent and didn’t deter me from reaching the end of the area and meant I could re-think my tactics / strategy multiple times without playing like a complete ♥♥♥♥♥. The combat system is fluent and easily learnable so that after a few hours of gameplay you will feel like a seasoned pro. There are 2 primary attacks, both using Gabriel’s ‘Combat Cross’(Like Blades of Chaos); 1 being a singular focused attack and the other being an area of effect based attack dealing significantly less damage. As you would expect you can purchase and upgrade new combos throughout the game as you earn experience points to spend. There are also throwing daggers which are nice to throw in the mix and if you remember you have them you will likely throw 5-10 in quick succession. As well as that there are a number of scenarios / enemies where you can interact with animations to break-up the furious clicking / button smashing. These are actually really cool and with impress you right throughout the game as you find new special abilities and interactions. Similar to The Wicther – You will either be a blocker or a dodger. The action block is very neat and boasts counter abilities to tear your enemies apart for being as foolish as to even dare try to strike you, however getting the timing of it can prove frustrating! Alas, it is not essential and you can use the same key + direction (WASD / Dpad) to roll cleanly out of the way. There is also the addition of both light and dark powers. You first get light powers then dark powers not long between each other somewhere early in chapter 2. Once you learn of the light power enemies will start to drop neutral energy that can be collected by holding a key/button near to the orbs to collect them. This will fill up your light meter and once light power is toggled, hitting enemies will restore your health. Neat! However, enemies will not drop neutral energy orbs while it is active so quickly slash and turn it off just in time for the killing blow! Similarly, but oppositely, dark energy is collected by enemies dropping neutral orbs but holding a different key/button to absorb them. This will then fill the dark energy bar that, once activated will significantly increase damage, however the same rules apply and killing an enemy with Gabriel’s dark power active will mean no neutral orbs will be dropped! That would be just too easy… There’s an element of Darksiders in this game when moving between battles as you’re challenged with stunning areas to move between in which you will need to jump, swing, climb, grapple, rappel, abseil & trudge to reach the next scene. These are more fun than frustrating and provide a dungeon crawl feel to the game only heightening the story and fantasy intensity. Dead soldiers & fallen heroes will line the way and provide you with interesting story notes and secrets to be found as well as useful items. You can also crack open a lot of statues and ornaments to find throwing daggers and other items.  I’ve read a lot of negative reviews about this game and the talk of no adjustable camera really seems to have spoilt it for a lot of people. Personally for me it really wouldn’t make much of a difference as the levels and stages are set out exquisitely, as you would expect from Konami, and it keeps the platformer feel to the series throwing you into scenes of the story as well as areas of the game.  I could never really get into games that are set out in this sort of fashion as they just lacked a bit of a style for me and felt they belonged in an arcade. Castlevania however is its own and really has a lot of replay-ability with an unlockable difficulty to challenge yourself as well as a trials mode featuring as many chapters as the story mode. It’s a shame that this game is the finale but on the same note is a testament to the prestigious game series I first played 20 years ago. No expense has been spared and nothing over looked throughout the game, it is a bountiful experience with real mirth and character that will cement it in our history as a memorable & charming experience. Unquestionably, the game comes with my highest recommendation & at $30RRP is punching well below its weight and should have been a serious contender for game of the year.  Do yourself and your friend a favour by forgetting about that next big game title, and buy 2 copies while saving yourself a bundle. You will not regret it and even on the easiest settings you will find many, many hours of riveting gameplay.10/10  "

CASTLEVANIA REVIEW***UPDATE*** Due to the sequel's release, my metacritic score at the bottom has changed!Welcome to my review of ""Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Ultimate Edition""! I will be giving a brief, spoiler-free (as much as possible) rundown on the pro's and con's of the hit game. Note: The spoiler tag may or may not work in this review. It works in the review, but not on the bottom of the actual store page of the game. You've been warned.CharactersGabriel BelmontVoiced by Robert Carlyle.The main protagonist of the game. He's dramatic and emotional, but has to be the most doubt-filled and least-interesting Castlevania character since Sonia Belmont from ""Castlevania Legends"". Seriously, this guy can't get any worse. WARNING!! SPOILERS!!He goes from doubting God to having faith in kicking Satan's butt to ""WOA IS MEH!!!"" from start to finish. He also ends up turning into a vampire and calling himself ""Dracul"" or ""Dracula"" at the end.END OF SPOILERS!! Great character appearance, wonderful voice actor, but horrible writing.ZobekVoiced by Patrick Stewart.The mysterious aid of Gabriel's from the Brotherhood of Light. He narrates the start of each level, and gives us an interesting view of events on the progress of the main character. WARNING!! SPOILERS!!Turns out to be one of the main villains of the game. Zobek is ""Lords of Shadow""'s version of Death AKA The Grim Reaper from the main series. END OF SPOILERS!! Has great voice acting due, in no small part, to Patrick Stewart.The Lords of ShadowMain villains of the game. Each one was based on random characters from past games. Each one is lord over a division of classic fantasy monsters, with their own story of origin. Despite the creative effort of Mercury Steam's writers, they ended up being a mostly-petty rehash. WARNING!! SPOILERS!!You battle two of them, and the third is revealed at the end of the game.END OF SPOILERS!!Great boss fights, but shameful use of good characters.WARNING!! SPOILERS!!SatanVoiced by Jason Isaacs.The main villain of the game and a first for the franchise. Though a small appearance at the end of the game, he turns out to give us a fairly interesting boss fight and twist of the plot along with getting a major role in the sequel. His appearance is, simply, a half-naked Ozzy Osbourne with a long black staff. And no, that wasn't a sexual joke. Decent voice acting and tough fight, but I felt like something was missing from him.GameplaySingleplayerA fast-paced slaughter of a variaty of creatures with a story that unfolded at a good speed. Has some tough challenges that you'll probably take a few days to do and wonderful graphics to keep you dazzled. Has a good array of combos and the franchise-favorite sub-weapons, some with an interesting spin on the classics. And, due to the DLC's, expands the story much more to set-up the events of the sequels. Sadly, no matter what I did, the game ends up feeling a bit too button-mashy.Replay value4.5/5ConclusionPros+ Great voice acting.+ Good action in both cutscenes and gameplay.+ If you're a believer in The Lord, you'll love the little bits of Christianity scattered about.Cons- If you hate religion, you'll love the ending.- Terrible plot-twists and repeatitive gameplay.- Unbelievable amount of nudity. Almost ""Duke Nukem""-worthy (and that's a bad thing for Castlevania).Game Review Score: 5.9Honestly, you're better off buying ""Castlevania: Judgement"" on the Nintendo Wii. Even that game was more satisfying than this!Series Review Score: 3.2After the release of ""Lords of Shadow 2"", it shows just how horrible of a job Mercury Steam did creating the trilogy. As a true Castlevania fan, I am very disappointed in them and Konami's allowance to create this!AfterwordMy personal name for the game (which might upset some people) is ""Rehashlevania: Lords of Ghetto - Idiot Edition"". My friends also use this term.I'd love to see what IGA (the guy in charge of creating Castlevania games) thinks of ""Lords of Shadow""!Thank you for reading.- Oniell.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a game developed by MercurySteam and ported to the PC by Climax Studios and published by Konami Digital Entertainment (#♥♥♥♥onami) and is a reboot to the classic NES series of the same nameThere is a good story generally with a good combat system which includes a variety of combos and when you die you get to keep your things and you don't have to start all over since there are many checkpointsThere are many skills and good experience points gain and the camera is at a fixed perspective, according to the developers, this was done to give more of an epic game and there are many puzzles that make your brain think and this game let's you think a lot when searching for goodsThere is some really good artwork and a good amount of levels, which are about 50 levels through 12 chapters and there is a good amount of content to read and a good 15-20 hours to play it once and not 100% completing it and about 70 hours to 100% complete itHowever, it is a shame that there are no awards for some bosses in the game and some areas are limited while moving. The absorbing energy system distracts you and is slow to consume. The camera widescreen range is not big enough for combat areas and according to the story you should gain powers but that doesn't happen every time and surprisingly there are some logic flaws in the story But overall, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a great reboot to such a great classic! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												So, what did it think of the game? In short, it... was... beautiful... I was completely taken aback by this game. It blew my expectations out of the water then proceeded to BLOW MY F*****G MIND!This game is EPIC Beyond Belief! It is not only an AWESOME 3D Castlevania, but it’s an AWESOME game PERIOD! It also has one of, if not THE best stories in SERIES HISTORY. The story is AWESOME beyond description. It also has some of the BEST VOICE ACTING I HAVE EVER HEARD IN A VIDEO GAME EVER!It’s not perfect though, not by any standard. It has a few minor issues. It’s an incredible game held back by a slight lack of polish. As such I can't give it a perfect score. It’s STILL one of the best games in the series. So I would give this game 8.9 out of 10.PROS- Beautiful detailed graphics and visuals. The game is a true piece of eye candy.- Incredible art design all around- Some of the best acting to be found in video games.- BEAUTIFUL and epic original music score- Epic and sweeping story unmatched in scope or writing within the series- Identifiable & believable characters- AWESOME and satisfying combat system- AWESOME boss battles- An ending that will tear are your heart open then make you crap your pants in amazement- Roughly 20 Hours of gameplay with loads of replayability- Unforgiving but Fair Difficulty- Linear Gameplay- PATRICK STEWART, MOTHER F****R!!! CONS- Linear gameplay- TONS of OBVIOUS invisible walls- Easy to miss environmental exploration cues- Fixed camera can interfere with control- Barrows a most of its gameplay elements from other games			"

Posted: February 14, 2014
												As a huge fan of combat RPGs like the God of War[en.wikipedia.org], Darksiders and Prince of Persia series' I had great expectations for Castlevania. All the reviews pointed out its favourable similarities to these games. Although Lords of Shadow has elements of those games it falls way short in a number of areas.The Bad1. Very Linear Gameplay - It's actually about as linear as the God of War series where you have no camera control and you follow very tightly defined paths. However, GoW balanced that out by adding hidden areas filled with collectables. So you could explore nooks and crannies to find extras. Castlevania on the other hand is so linear it feels more like an interactive story book with 0 choice in outcome. The collectables are all on the main paths so there's no difficulty in finding them. Smashing objects reveals knives which you often have a full complement of already - making them useless.2. Confusing Story - All the games I mentioned above had rich and detailed stories mixing fascinating myths with new fantasy twists. On the one hand Castle was a mass of cliches (love, dead wife, revenge, etc, etc.) but on the other it was a baffling mess (what am I? who is the narrator that seems to know me? why would being able to resurrect the dead (necromancy) be a good thing?). Some of these questions get answered but far too late for my liking.I was left confused and emotionally detached from the characters and game for far too long. I didn't care about the protagonist or his quest or anyone in the game. 4. Slow To Get Going - I oiriginally wrote this review after playing for 10hrs and was pretty unimpressed. Its gotten slightly better since playing another 3hrs as more of the story has begun to make sense and extra combat moves unloclk. But the fact remains: a game shouldn't take 10hrs of faffing to start making sense and open up enough combat moves to make play fun.4. Main Character's Voice Acting - I can't tell if the voice actor is faking a Scottish accent or its so weak it feels wishy-washy. The dialogue, especially with his wife was horrendously wooden. After she is consumed by some darkness in the afterlife and pledging her love his best reaction is a muted: ""I love you too"". I've heard better acting from circus fleas.The Good1. Combat & 'Vehicles' - the combat as with most combat RPGs is interesting although it takes a while to unlock the best moves. You do get to control a wider variety of beasts including Wargs, trolls and spiders. For much longer than most games - in fact they get as much use as vehicles in famous FPS games.2. Dark & Light Magic - You get Dark and Light magic in this game and you can switch between the two to get different moves and effects. Light will hewal you with every strike and dark will boiost your damage output. Add to that a set of extra moves for each too. It adds a whole new dimension to combat which is pretty refreshing. However, as mentioned previously it takes a while before you even get access to these extra abilities.3. Patrick Stewart - his voice acting as the narrator and Brother (NPC) is the only redeeming feature of the voice acting cast. Adding some much needed gravitas and emotion.ConclusionBuy the game in a sale or at least play a demo to see if you'd like it. Don't be fooled into thinking its like other similar games like God of War, Darksiders, etc. It has similarities but I think its lacking in some key areas.Don't pay full price for this. Thankfully I bought this on sale so I'm not too bothered with the disappointing gameplay. But if I'd paid full price I'd be pretty peeved			"

												This game is great. . . When it comes to the story. The plot is fantastic and I played through to the end because I was so interested in where it was all going; the story literally grabs you and pulls you down, it's presented very well through the narration (patrick ♥♥♥♥ing stewart.)The game play kind of sucks though. The camera is fix and it makes combat kind of wonky. Particularly with the keyboard and mouse it's a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare. The combat itself isn't very difficult and doesn't give too much challenge which is nice if you're someone who would like to play just for the story, but because of the strange camera it does at times get kind of frustrating. I remember one particular area where the camera would switch between two entirely different angles (from top down kind of, to from the side) if you moved to a certain spot while fighting some difficult enemies. It's not a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it definitely was not done as well as it could have and it ♥♥♥♥s the game play to a fair extent.			"

												Masterpiece!!!!!!This is one of those game that at the beginning I regreted to buy. The beggining is some slow for me. Kept it closed for may be years without playing. Decided to give a try just because it was that kind of time when I felt I needed to play something else other than shooters. Long story short I got blasted by the game. It has good story, good sound, good music, good voice very good level design that I would not enjoy so much if it was not for its terryfic 3d compatibilty. It is also very good in eyfinity. I am playing it in both modes combined. If I was younger this would be one of those games that would cause me to sleep only 3 to 5 hours before going to work.			"

												I love this game and can't wait for the sequel next year. I picked up this version after having already beat it twice on console due to the DLC being cheap. Overall, the DLC was a step down from the rest of the game. The first one was mostly puzzle solving and the second one was mostly dying a lot (it's hard). Still, Lords of Shadow was one of my favorite titles from the PS3/Xbox360 era and it looked even better on my PC!			"

Not the Greatest in the Genre but still pretty EpicCastlevania: Lords of Shadow is an epic game though there are a few who would say otherwise. The reasons behind that is people feel - that the game is tough (which it is for the first few hours especially on higher difficulty), the camera sucks or the game's combat is a rip-off of the much acclaimed God of War series. To be honest, there is some degree of truth in these conceptions but that doesn't make this a bad game. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a combination of many good things - new cool & unique ideas and a few good ones from other games, all beautifully delivered in one package. The game doesn't completely steal concepts from other games, but there are strong flavors from games like Shadow of the Colossus, God of War and such but it doesn't compromise the uniqueness and originality of the Castlevania world. Here is a spolier-free review that'll cover a few important areas of the game. It'll be an unbiased review as I have not played any Castlevania games before.STORY - The story sounds simple and not so special at first but it gains considerable momentum and it does a good job in keeping you interested throughout. There are a few surprises from time to time and the ending is nothing short of amazing and it makes you want to purchase the sequel. Just so you know, this game is about Gabriel, a knight belonging to the Order of Brotherhood of Light who is in search for revenge and a solution to bring his wife back to life. The story is dark and centers on dark beings such as Vampires, Werewolves and Necromancers. The story moves at an adequate pace and is nicely delivered. This is quite a big game in terms of game length (around 40hrs if not rushed) and the story never felt off-pace or boring.GAMEPLAY -  Hack and Slash, Intense boss fights, Skill-involved (you simply can't button mash). You gotta observe and learn from the enemies, dodge and block and then make use from a huge variety of combos to defeat your enemies. I would certainly agree on the game being tough and it was a little uninteresting for the first 6 or 7 hours story-wise but the true prize awaits those who actually bite through the first few hours. The game really comes to life after that and soon you are entitled to tons of overpowered gear and things start to scale well. Apart from that the game offers lots of cool puzzles and most importantly BOSS FIGHTS!!! Have to say these are some of the most intense bosses I've fought. And there are lots of them. Tons of enemies and you can even mount and ride trolls, warthogs and what not. Personally, the variety is what makes this game truly epic. Though the levels are pretty much linear, there are tons of things this game throws at you and it never gets repetitive. As for camera being horrible, its not. In my 48 hours of gameplay i hardly cursed the camera for dying. Every game is unique and it is just a matter of getting used to it. The camera was never an annoyance for me. As for controls, a controller is preferred without a doubt. No idea how one can use a keyboard and mouse for this game. Might be doable but I doubt if it'll be enjoyable.SOUND - The voice acting is top notch. The music is amazing and the dialogues are really well written. I really fell for the voice acting/dialogue that I got goosebumps when I came face-to-face with the first boss. I knew from that moment on that this game is going to have a good script.   GRAPHICS - Might seem pretty outdated now (ps3 like graphics) but it looks decent enough for a hack and slash. Never ugly and never eye candy. It lies somewhere in the middle though leaning a bit towards eye candy side.REVIEW IN A NUTSHELLSafe to say this game is not a total rip-off of other games in the genre.Slow and hard start but endure for six hours. It's really worth it after that.So much variety in terms of Gear, Combos, Enemy Units, Puzzles plus things you can do like riding a warthhog, troll etc.Boss Fights are spectacular and good thing is there are tons of 'em.Linear but fun.Camera ain't a pain in the neck as most people say it to be.They have slightly overdone the chupacabras (a funny little ugly mischievous creature). Great voice-acting, music and dialogues.Big game. Expect around 40 hours of gameplay if not rushed.Achievements are real tough. 100%ing the game is a real challenge. Damn near impossible.The DLC involving the Forgotten One is going to test your patience. Keep your gamepad strapped to your hands.Controller is the preferred choice.MY SCORE: 85/100 "

												★★☆☆☆More God of War than Castlevania.Likes:+ Nice Music+ Nice Scenery+ Captain Picard+ Graphics performance+ Interesting Story/Monster Origin+ Menu Book + HUD Art.  For some reason, more and more recent games are using programmer-art as final product HUDs, its nice to see something with artistic effort.  Dislikes:- Linear linear linear- Locked camera angles- No equipment system- Unintuitive level design- Invisible walls everywhere- Slow and inconsistent pacing- Parkour is slow, stiff, and non-dynamic- The loading screen text often seems spoilery- Most collectibles are unrewarding scrolls of text- 'Mounts' are pointless gimmicks to open the next room- Controller layout doesn't feel right, and can't be changed- PreRendered cutscenes, with worse than ingame graphics?- Combat is mindless button mashing and/or quicktime events- Forced replay, of linear levels, to access new collectibles & trials- Magic: Light and Dark mode are simple toggles, and are more like ARPG gear stats- Only 3 enemy types:1.  Trash packs that you spam AoE, or grab+quicktime to 1shot (refill your HP and/or MP)2.  Stagger-proof mini-bosses, dodge roll their attacks (spend MP here)3.  Shadow of the Colossus wanabes, with stiff climbing mechanics, and trial&error phases- ""You cannot carry any more Daggers.""			"

												THis game took me 19 hours to complete. And I felt every last second of that.There are games, that aren't really good but are still worth checking and spending time on to see all the good ideas, all the good things the game may have. And sometimes, even while knowing that overall the game is not good, you will enjoy a game like that. Lords of Shadow is not a game like that, simply because it gives *way* too little for what time and patience it asks in return.It does have an interesting story, an interesting take on the famous series. It does look stylish and pretty, although artistically, not technologically (pretty low res textures and pre-renered movies, rather poor optimization, other small issues). But still - really pretty. It also has a *few* really cool fights, which are inventive, exciting and challenging enough, without feeling unfair or broken.So, that're the good things. There are bad things, like overabundance of QTEs, with very outdated approach to the concept as well - they're used just for the sake of it, and in the unlikeliest moments. Like, say, opening some doors requires timed QTEs, not even God of War-like button mashing.Yet those are also not *that* notable. And this is the main problem with the game - it's a bit of good, a bit of bad and about 80% of boredom. Majority of the game feels like padding, something inserted just for the sake of wasting more of the player's time. In fact, there's even a special enemy/creature in the game, who's sole purpose is to waste player's time and you meet that creature 4 times, even though you will be fed up with it the first time. There's almost never any payoff to anything. You might hear of a cool enemy/location several chapters of 3-5 levels before you finally get to it, and nothing really happens during those levels...And the ex-DLC levels, which give this edition ""Ultimate"" name, are absolutely horrible. Again, there are few nice ideas, but they're so not worth it. The story, which could've been a proper epilogue to the main story, setting up the sequel and ex-portable midquel, is a complete throwaway and degrades into farce in the last two levels, where Gabriel plays hide and seek with a powerful demon set on destroying the world.With the same elements, a much MUCH better game could've been made. And, I'm sure, MercurySteam could've done that. Maybe, the sequel will be that much better game...P.S. It's worth noticing several visual similarities to a classic game called Blade of Darkness, which was developed by another spanish development company, which then dissolved and the majority of it's team created MercurySteam - the developers of this game.

I am so used to playing games where I can look 360 degrees. Once I got past that I have really enjoyed everything about this game. Some people will be picky about lots of aspects of this game but the reality is it has nice graphics and has lots of challenging puzzles to solve.  "

												Magnificent art design and an impressively game Patrick Stewart can't save this otherwise boring brawler. Consider Arkham Asylum/City for your beat 'em up needs instead, or try Darksiders if you want to take the demon-fighting ridiculousness up to 11.More so than anything, the game suffers from excessive scripting. I've never seen such absurd reliance on QTEs - simply activating certain cranks involves 5 timed button presses - but there are likewise a lot of camera takeovers to show off the (admittedly impressive) scenery when you wish you could be playing the game. Platforming segments consist mostly of following the highlighted ledges, with liberal use of invisible walls to screw up any off-center jumps you attempt. And as pretty as the backgrounds are, most levels consist of running through linear narrow canyons, and even your ability to jump 30 feet in the air won't let you clear knee high obstacles. Combat is no better, with the huge variety of moves failing to serve any real purpose in such a simple system.As for the story, it's a dumpster fire. If you somehow didn't think much of Patrick Stewart as an actor, you'll be astonished to see how committed a performance he gives in narrating this trainwreck.			"

												Castlevania: Symphony of the ""meh""*Fair warning, there be some story spoilers.  I have tried to contain them, but spoilers ahoy!*Okay, so first thing first, this isn't a Castlevania game.  The developers have branded this as a reboot of the franchise, but they clearly were making something else and were then told they had to add Castlevania elements to it and call it a Castlevania game.  As far as I'm concerned, Mercury Steam just Michael Bay'd my childhood.  It's a poor God of War with elements of Shadows of the Colossus and DMC.  Very little of what you think of when you think of Castlevania is actually present.  You know things like: Dracula, gothic imagry, cryptic music, stylized baddies.  The gothic feeling of the originals (and especially Symphony of the Night) is completely missing.  There are some sequences in a castle with LoS (and honestly they are the best segments of the game), but that's only a small portion of the game and even that feels very bland and generic.  This game could have been set anywhere.  Gone is the ""Romanian countryside"" of the originals.  Instead we have a game world with generic looking trolls, goblins, and even annoying chupacabras.  With a few exceptions (notably the shambling skeletons and the zombies towards the end), the monsters just didn't feel like they belonged in a Castlevania game.  Where are the headless horsemen, the ghostly dancers, the fish men monsters, the medusa heads, etc?  On a side note: apparently the chupacabra is no longer a blood sucking devil living in the American Southwest.  Now it is an annoying critter that steals your *#$% and mocks you in an annoying voice...  Seriously, who came up with that horrible idea?  Then there were faeries.... Why.. were there faeries?    Why did Pan and the Goblins look like something out of ""Pan's Labrynth""?Then there's the gameplay.  I played this with an xbox controller and the controls combined with the horrible camera angles made me want to strangle a chupacabra  like nobody's business.  Seriously, I felt like the designers were just f'ing with me.  Taking monsters off screen where my camera angle will not show them so that I'm swinging at nothing. Thanks.  Making controls point to awkward jumps just to watch my character jump in the wrong direction.  Again, thanks.  Then there were the horrible puzzles that involved my character jumping then punching a switch on the ground.  Whoever designed those sequences should be drug out into the street and tarred and feathered.  Seriously, my character always managed to land everywhere but where I wanted him to. One of the few positives was the combat.  I enjoyed the exploration and the combat for the most part.  When the camera wasn't making life miserable, the moves list, combos, counters, et all were pretty entertaining.  However, the game spent too much time with the same monsters ad nauseum.  How many times did I need to ride a troll or a spider?  The novelty of those experiences ended shortly into the game.  For that matter, why change the iconic whip of the original Castlevania games?  What is with this weaponized cross that is both whip, pully, and stake? Then there are the bonus weapons.  The holy water was well done, but the daggers and dark crystal seemed useless.  Whenever I used a crystal, I would just watch nothing happen to a boss or the game would just cheat and respawn the monsters.  Then there's the story.  Again, I played the early Castlevania games including 1,2,3, Super Castlevania 4, and Symphony of the Night.  This story had better execution but made no sense.  *potential spoiler* Not only did the developers poorly ape games like God of War, but they decided to ape the antihero tropes as well.  I prefer the Dracula of the orignal series: a clear cut monster / devil.  Not to mention the fact, that, if the game is going to feature Dracula going forward, why would I even want to play?  Dracula was always the villain.  He ""stole men's souls"". Remember?   Just too many design decisions about this game made no sense in terms of ""Castlevania"".  I can hear the meetings of ""wouldn't be cool if we did this.."", but nobody stopped to ask ""does that fit Castlevania?""  The graphics and the music were pretty (beautiful on PC with maxed settings), but it just didn't feel like Castlevania.   The voiceover work was serviceable.  The actress playing Laura was good, but the leads felt like they were merely cashing a check.  Gabriel was supposed to be undergoing this dark metamophasis the entire time, but I never saw it.  Not to mention the redemption ending made no sense considering the immediate departure the character takes.  If this game weren't a Castlevania game, I would give it a 6.5 / 10.  Maybe a 7, but no higher.  But, as a Castlevania game, Lords of Shadow doesn't even rate.  The developers squandered an opportunity.  If this is the direction the series is going, I am done.  This was a 30 hour insult.			"

												It looks gorgeous, and that's about the only enjoyment I'm getting out of it. Let's list the cons:- Levels are linear, but still have hidden items that will require upgrades you don't yet have to collect them. Getting those hidden items will therefore require you to play through certain levels again wile enduring:- Bad combat. Basically God of War, except the enemies don't react a lot to getting hit, they're basically sponges for punishment. Most of the moveset is not that useful. In fact, about half your combat moves are only usable while magic is active, which you don't get a lot of. A lot of attack animations can't be block-canceled out of.- Unpassable chest-high-wall syndrome, or worse, invisible walls over knee-high objects. These make exploring feel bad, and you do want to explore for upgrades.- Tedious climbing. Gabriel moves rather slowly compared to, say, Lara, and as climbables are highlighted, requires no brainpower either. Unless they're obscured by the camera, of course. At least the environments you climb are pretty.- The Camera. It's not under your control, and will too often screw you out of seeing enemies while they're pummeling you, or disorient you when switching between views. It will also often be very zoomed out, making it hard to see enemy attack wind-up animations.- Patrick Stewart is woefully miscast, and sounds like he's phoning it in while reading absolute garbage prose.- No healing orb/item drops require you to first kill (a lot of) enemies to get magic orbs, then activate light magic, and then hit enemies in order to heal. In practice, this means that I don't use the dark magic often to hit harder, because I need more health.I enjoyed my time with other off-brand God of War titles like X-Men Origins: Wolverine or Dante's Inferno a whole lot more. I think Wolverine has a PC version too. Get that instead, unless you're really (REALLY) into the artstyle of this game.			"

												I honestly don't think this game is up for the reviews. If you play it in any serious difficulty is full of movement bugs, glitches, unresponsivenes and simply bad movement and level design. The story is very good, though the DLC is kind of uninspired and clearly just to make more money. I was into it because I was always interested to get into the Castlevania franchise but all the other games made my head spin with so many alternate stories. This one rebbots the series with a decent story but awful gameplay.			"

												What a great game! I had a lot of fun playing, despite that there are a lot of annoying and bad things/ bugs/ features, too.Let´s start with the negative points first:-- fixed camera spots: The fixed camera is not in every case a bad thing (see pros), but especially in corners or spots among 2 camera locations, the fixed camera can be really annoying and bad for the smooth and trouble-free gameplay.-- autosaves points: This problem apears in a lot of games within this genre. At some bosses the game let´s you retry at beginning of the second phase for example. Other, harder bosses haven´t  got these autosave points and you have to do everything from the beginning. Furthermore there could be many more checkpoints at some parts of the game. It can be really frustrating to do everythink from beginning, although there were at least 2 great chances, to place a fair checkpoint...-- structure of the (boss) battles in combination with the fighting system: The game got a great fighting system (see pros) with a lot of diffrent attack possibilities. Unfortunately many bosses and creatures doesn´t allow you to use this various system. It will end up at smashing the X or Y button and adding some special skill secondarily.- rough air controlls: Fortunatly air combat is just a nigligibly part of the game, but certainly you will jump alot. At some parts of the game, especially some parts, where you have to long-jump (run and jump) its kinda hard to hit your destination. Some times you will just jump beyond the platforms, or other times you randomly jump of a cliff... Since you are losing some health every time you fall of a cliff, it can be rally annoying over time....- few smaller balance problems- many blurry texturesAltough it looks like Castlevania: Lords of Shadows got a lot of problems, the positive things outweigh them significantly:++++ atmosphere: The, in my opinion, biggest advantage of the game is the atmosphere. The soundtrack, the fixed camera view, the setting, the scenery, the story, the level, boss and creature design, the protagonist... all these things just build up a awesome atmosphere at many parts of the game. You can easily just blinde out the negative and annoying things and just immerse in the great amosphere. I played the game with my Logitech Z906 5.1 Speaker System, which additionally intensifed the great atmosphere.+++ soundtrack+++ climbing parts+++ boss battles and design: Fight against giant creatures in breathtaking boss fights, or slay the Lords of Shadows and send them to hell.+++ Gabriel: What a badass.+++ diversifed level design: The levels go from a muddy swamp (without shrek, but with creapy scarecrows) to giant castles to a giant-graveyard.++ fighting system and possibilites: That all-purpose cross is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥awesome. You will have a lot of diffrent ways to slay your enemys.++ light and dark energy bars, which allow you to perform special Magic abilities.++ Story: I liked it.+ After credit-scene: Forces me to buy the second part.+ game length: It took me about 20 hours the complete the main story. The the right length for these kind of games - in my opinion.All in all i give it a 9/10 and i can definitly recommend it!			"

												Fantastic game, one of the best action game i've ever played. Fighting system is amazing and very satysfying. The story isn't written on knee, quite the opposite, he's quite interesting. Level design is absolutely masterful. Castlevania offers also great soundtrack and pretty graphic. There's only one fault, but she's burdensome: playing on keyboard is masochism. It is felt in battles with several bosses, when you must press ery fast all WASD keys. However Castlevania is very good game and i can with a clear conscience recommend this conversion.			"

Aerial combat is poor in most of the fights, and you get to use it little. The DLCs are poor, in comparison to the main game, combat/puzzle and storywise. The  last DLC fight is a pain. Nonetheless, a great action game.			"

												I'm not too sure how to rate this game, I think if you try the demo and like it you should get the game. I can't say that I'm a fan of castlevania because this is only the 4th game I've played and I like the game as an adventure game. I suppose i would agree with IGN's rating as they gave this game a 7.5. I like the art style of the game, I like the storyline of the game, I personally like action aventure type games so this was definitely one I wanted to try out. After playing... about 14 hours now into it I would say that I wish the game had better care. I think it has potential but major fact that you cannot control the camera for yourself reallly makes it annoying and difficult in certain area's more so then others. If you like castlevania and have an open mind for the game I wouls suggest picking this up. If you have certain expectations for this game, it may not be worth your money.			"

												This is a fun game, but unfortunately it suffers from some significant flaws. Let me list those first just to give you an idea.Warning: It is fun and I got it for $10 and think it is worth about that. Despite the below criticisms, I still think it's pretty neat. Heck, I may even pick up the sequel on sale(I've heard they are fixing many complaints). 1. It's about 40% too long. I would write a really positive review if this game had not very much overstayed its welcome. I played it for 18 hours and really think it was more like a 9-10 hour game. 2. I frequently did not know where to go next or what to do. Call me dumb if you want, but I found myself bumbling around too much in this game.3. An early boss battle requires a boss to throw a rock at you. I spent over an hour in frustration repeatedly finding the spot to stand in for him to throw it. It sounds minor, but it was annoying almost to the point of me quitting.4. It's repetitive. It is fun, so it is a repetition of fun, but it can wear quite old sometimes.5. The two final chapters(which were originally DLC) have very substandard cinematics, which is distracting. 6. The camera is a nightmare sometimes. And there are invisible walls everywhere. It's really weird for a modern game. Oh, you CAN NOT control the camera. Wow, really?Now the positives:1. Beautiful game.2. Chapters 10-12 were excellent. So good I wish they would have just gotten there a little more quickly.3. The combat is very satisfying and controls really well. 4. The light platforming is fun, though painfully unchallenging. 5. I found the story quite moving in parts and all the voice acting is top notch. Anyway, I do think you should pick up the game on a sale. However, I can not help but be partially disappointed. In summary, a neat game with flaws....flaws that are magnified by the fact the game is way too long. Purchase less than $15 for sure.			"

												What could have been a middling God of War clone is marred by the worst health/mana system I'm ever come across.  To get health, you need mana. To get mana, you have to defeat enemies in a specific way.  But if you could do that, you wouldn't need the health!  So instead of exploring the combos and moves, I spent the whole time hoarding mana so I might regain some health.  Honestly, if Mana regenerated on its own, this game would be a full grade rating better than it is.The graphics are good; the combat's okay (too focused on parry and blocking, especially considering how many unblockable attacks the enemies have); the puzzles are the highlight; the climbing/platforming is okay, but not great.  The story is ponderous and overwrought, but that's par for the style.  The final battle in the game itself isn't bad.But then I played the DLC.  The first piece was actually pretty good. A new feature, some new puzzles.  It ends with 'To Be Continued' which is annoying.Then I played the second DLC.  It manages to encompass every trope of the genre in the worst way possible.  I mean really, a platform jumping section where missing the jump means going back to the beginning?  And then it's a stealth section too (if the boss sees you, it's an instant death)?  And there's a minute-long sequence where you literally play peek-a-boo with the boss.  And the final battle - I spent at least two bloody hours playing it;  I almost gave up and cheated.  Who puts you in a final boss battle and doesn't let you fill up on health and magic first?  Again, exacerbated by the horrible system they have in place, I was tearing my hair out and cursing the game.  I literally deleted it within 15 seconds of exiting after the win.  I can't recommend this to anyone.  The main game, maybe if you're desperate for a God of War clone (with some Shadows of the Colossus thrown in).  But save yourself the headache and don't bother with the DLC. Oh, and the game has little to nothing to do with Castlevania.  The protagonist is a Belmont.  He has a whip. There are vampires.  Middle-Ages Europre. That's the entirety of the similarities.			"

												It may not be the Castlevania as fans know it, but MercurySteam has taken successful mechanics from combat-focused, character action games and blended it with Castlevania’s lore. When it comes to bringing Castlevania to the PC platform, then this is probably the best way to open up the franchise to new people, especially when the sequel is arriving February 2014. If you’re a PC gamer who has never played Castlevania: Lords of Shadow or a hardcore fan that is looking to replay the game before the sequel hits, you should certainly pick up the PC version. It’s undoubtedly the “Ultimate” version, and with DmC being the only recent title to offer similar gameplay on the platform there isn’t much choice when it comes to these types of games. Sitting at a welcoming £19.99 on Steam (and cheaper in other places), there is plenty here for your money that would make even Dracula come out of the shadows for a taste.			"

												Castlevania is an updated version from the original. There is very high level of blood splatter on monster kills. So under 17 with caution or not at all. The monsters are much more graphic looking and will raise your adrenaline while playing. You should use a controller with this game to make movement easier. Headphones will help but speakers are ok.  So just enjoy yourself.			"

												What a great game! I had a lot of fun playing, despite that there are a lot of annoying and bad things/ bugs/ features, too.Let´s start with the negative points first:-- fixed camera spots: The fixed camera is not in every case a bad thing (see pros), but especially in corners or spots among 2 camera locations, the fixed camera can be really annoying and bad for the smooth and trouble-free gameplay.-- autosaves points: This problem apears in a lot of games within this genre. At some bosses the game let´s you retry at beginning of the second phase for example. Other, harder bosses haven´t  got these autosave points and you have to do everything from the beginning. Furthermore there could be many more checkpoints at some parts of the game. It can be really frustrating to do everythink from beginning, although there were at least 2 great chances, to place a fair checkpoint...-- structure of the (boss) battles in combination with the fighting system: The game got a great fighting system (see pros) with a lot of diffrent attack possibilities. Unfortunately many bosses and creatures doesn´t allow you to use this various system. It will end up at smashing the X or Y button and adding some special skill secondarily.- rough air controlls: Fortunatly air combat is just a nigligibly part of the game, but certainly you will jump alot. At some parts of the game, especially some parts, where you have to long-jump (run and jump) its kinda hard to hit your destination. Some times you will just jump beyond the platforms, or other times you randomly jump of a cliff... Since you are losing some health every time you fall of a cliff, it can be rally annoying over time....- few smaller balance problems- many blurry texturesAltough it looks like Castlevania: Lords of Shadows got a lot of problems, the positive things outweigh them significantly:++++ atmosphere: The, in my opinion, biggest advantage of the game is the atmosphere. The soundtrack, the fixed camera view, the setting, the scenery, the story, the level, boss and creature design, the protagonist... all these things just build up a awesome atmosphere at many parts of the game. You can easily just blinde out the negative and annoying things and just immerse in the great amosphere. I played the game with my Logitech Z906 5.1 Speaker System, which additionally intensifed the great atmosphere.+++ soundtrack+++ climbing parts+++ boss battles and design: Fight against giant creatures in breathtaking boss fights, or slay the Lords of Shadows and send them to hell.+++ Gabriel: What a badass.+++ diversifed level design: The levels go from a muddy swamp (without shrek, but with creapy scarecrows) to giant castles to a giant-graveyard.++ fighting system and possibilites: That all-purpose cross is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥awesome. You will have a lot of diffrent ways to slay your enemys.++ light and dark energy bars, which allow you to perform special Magic abilities.++ Story: I liked it.+ After credit-scene: Forces me to buy the second part.+ game length: It took me about 20 hours the complete the main story. The the right length for these kind of games - in my opinion.All in all i give it a 9/10 and i can definitly recommend it!			"

												To be short, this game is simply amazing and I couldn't understand why there's people who wound't buy it.Now explaing my point of view, Castlevania's serie has been with me through my childhood until now, with the earlier 2D plataform games and the best in my humble opinion that is Symphony of the Night.But the game has changed a lot, and you cannot expect a 2D plataformer on this one. This game looks more a God of War with Devil May Cry game than an earlier Castlevania. But it has the details, the feels of Castlevania itself.The storyline has a very good approach, the gameplay (with controller, haven't played with keyboard + mouse) is confortable and allows nice and powerful combos without needing a new pair of hands. I beat the first XII capters on Knight difficult (highest available from the start) and I'm try now on Paladin mode, because I found a little too easy to win the game with it (but don't think you're not going to die, because you are, and a lot).If you don't enjoy games like GoW and DMC I won't recommend you to play this one just because of the title, since the game has a whole different take now. But if you enjoy even a little and love Castevania like I don't, I don't know what are you waiting for.			"

												I'm very disappointed.  I looked forward to purchasing this game for a long while, and I wish that I hadn't.  It doesn't feel anything like the old Castlevania; not that I'm against innovation or anything.  I can't make myself become interested in the story, and sometimes, I just do not feel like waiting for Patric Stewart to read through a wall of text on the screen.  I cannot stand the camera in this game.  I can't control it at all, and it's very annoying and disorienting to have the POV jump 180 degrees back and forth if I happen to go through whatever tunnel or doorway,  Also, b/c the camera doesn't stay behind my character's back, I have died a few times b/c I simply could not see what was in front of my character since it was all off screen, facing towards me.  Such a stupid design, and it carries over to navigating the guy along the wall edges.  Sometimes, I can't quite judge which direction they want me to aim the stick, so I'll jump to my death a few times, or trying to traverse wooden beams and spider webs, but the camera is at an odd angle (not 45, 90, 180) so I can't quite get him to walk straight without having to stop and catch my balance every 2 seconds.  I am really just not having any fun at all with this game, and partway through Chapter II, I had forgotten how many chapters there were until I went back to the main map.  I don't know if I need to sit through an entire game that is not fun at all, with an annoying camera, and the game seems like it may be about 40+ hours to complete.  I really hate to add yet another game to my ""Not Playing"" category, but this one looks to be well on its way.  Surely, there must be some mods or something that people are using that cause them to actually enjoy playing this mess.			"

												I bought this game last year but never actually played it until a couple weeks ago, I actually played all 3 LOS games within the past two weeks and I've gotta say, this one is by far the best one! It's got a brilliant story that pulls you in and makes you care about the protagonist and has you wondering about what's going to happen next. Between each new chapter/level it has narration done by the great Patrick Stewart, and has cutscenes throughout the game. The voice acting is really just phenomenal, job well done by Robert Carlyle and everyone else. I like that it has levels that you have to complete to progress the storyline, rather than being an open world. It makes the game and story easy to follow, there are a few collectibles that cannot be attained within the first play through of the level, as you need special abilities to gain access to them, but that isn't too big of a deal though.The art and level designs are absolutely beautiful! From the vibrant colours of Pan's Temple to the alluring ruins of Agharta, with an enchanting sunset in The Three Towers level that makes you feel like you're in the Mediterranean. And of course, to the wintry scenes of the Vampire's castle, which give you a chill just by playing it as you scale the dark and looming castle! Those are just some descriptions from the scenes I saw while playing the game, there are so many more and each level has something new to show.The puzzles were great fun and added an extra element to the game, while some can be frustrating and take a little while to figure out, there's always the option to skip the puzzle, though I'd recommend you take a moment to collect your thoughts and attempt the puzzles before just giving in, as they offer rewards for completing them.The music was beautiful too, though it wasn't catchy like the old Vampire Killer or Bloody tears from the classic games, it was quite fitting for the game that Lords of Shadow is. Also there is a little gem throwback near the end of the game,  a music box rendition of Vampire Killer.  The game drops a few hints and salutes its predecessors here and there.All in all, I enjoyed the game a lot, and yes, it did have some flaws, as with any game, but for me personally, the pros outweigh the cons by far!

												You know those games that you knock before you try then you realise it's actually pretty darn good? Well for me this game was one of those. I've never played a Castlevania game but after reading the reviews about this series reboot, I thought this was a great time to start. If you enjoy games like Darksiders, God of war and the Legacy of Kain games, this might interest you. It's not Dark souls or Diablo 3 but I had a feeling while playing this that it's got a similair aura about it, maybe it's the atmosphere or the backdrops but it's a nice dark atmospheric game. Graphically, very impressive. The character models and textures are brilliant. Sometimes the areas can get so busy to the eye that you arent even focusing on how pretty the game looks. There were moments I stopped just to look and take a screenshot, something I don't often do unless a game area looks awe inspiring and there are many moments of that here. Sound wise, sometimes I like to turn of music to appreciate the ambient noise, the developers have worked very hard in this respect. The quality of music however, it reeeeaaally suits the gameplay!Gameplay is frantic! Sometimes you can get by with button mashing but with certain encounters there is a certain skill to play this. If I could say one thing about the gameplay it's "" Easy to pick up, tough to master"". I felt like the game threw a lot of moves and combo's at me to learn but I realised after a while that they are just there to spice it up a bit, give the player the power to choose HOW they want to play. You're going to find that you'll buy all the combo's but just use the ones you want to play how you want, this to me is a brilliant design! It's not Batman combat, close but I'd say a little more challenging but not so much as Dark souls. The story keeps you going and wanting to find out what happens next, when the game finishes, it's very nicely set up for the sequels with a  nice twist or two at the end. If I could sum it up in one word, EPIC.			"

												Fantastic game, one of the best action game i've ever played. Fighting system is amazing and very satysfying. The story isn't written on knee, quite the opposite, he's quite interesting. Level design is absolutely masterful. Castlevania offers also great soundtrack and pretty graphic. There's only one fault, but she's burdensome: playing on keyboard is masochism. It is felt in battles with several bosses, when you must press ery fast all WASD keys. However Castlevania is very good game and i can with a clear conscience recommend this conversion.			"

												If you are fan of Castlevania games, you must consider it's not like the usual style and it goes more the way of the older 3D Castlevania games with a specific straight forward path. It has a little bit of exploration but is mostly to find collectables.Graphically I must say it's really beautiful, from the character design to the environtment. It ran really good on my old computer and with this one runs at 60 fps smoothly, though the prerendered videos are capped to 30fps.Music is alright and sometimes maybe a bit soft to my liking but it doesnt get you in the way at all.About the game's plot, theres not much to say, looks really interesting and has some events that you didnt expect.Now to the serious issue, gameplay:As I said before, it's pretty straight forward, meaning there is only one path to follow and you can't really get lost. There are TONS of puzzles to do and it gives a bit of variety, but sometimes I got the feeling they added puzzles just for the sake of it (NOTE: When you reach a puzzle, there is always a body nearby).While the combat seems really pleasing and fun with a variety of combos and abilities to get through the game's plot, the negative point is the horrendous fixed camera. Sometimes the camera tries to get into some dramatic or cool positions that kinds of disturb the combo you are trying to do or gives you clues from where you have to go. Also most of the time it takes like several seconds to reposition, leaving you confused and vulnerable if you are against some foes, I died several times because of that.In this game you will die a lot if you are careless, because of a bunch of enemies attacking you at the same time or from a buffed mid boss that takes you around a good portion of your health.Overall I's a really good game that will take you several hours to complete, and including the DLC's which extend the story an hour or so if you are pro. Pros:+Good graphics.+Cool plot.+Gabriel is awesome.Cons:-Fixed camera.-Lots of puzzles.-Some enemies are really tough to beat.			"

												There are so many similarities between Lords of Shadow and Dante's Inferno: play style, plot, upgrades, boss fights, naked demon ladies. If you liked that game, then you'll probably like this one as well. Although, overall I had a better time with this game. On normal difficulty, it's slightly easier then Dante's Inferno- yet still provides a challenge- and the level system gives it more of an inceptious replay value. Plus there's a sequel; not just some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥DLC that isn't worth a damn.			"

												Well, another ""Yes"" in my review list. (Total rate: 9/10)This is the second time i play the whole Castlevania:LoS game, first time on PS3...when they announced this to PC i knew that i should have it.Finish the main game in around 18h (knight/hard difficulty), with 1 skill, 1 health upgrade and 1 magic upgrade left.So what's good here?-Excellent music 9/10-Excellent story 9/10-Excellent in-game environments 10/10-Very good playability. 10/10What could be bad here?-Re-playability as usual is based in just play the unlocked hardest difficulty and get all upgrades/secrets (but still, is enjoyable). 8/10-The game is kinda easy (for those used to hack&slash games, hard difficulty should be kinda easy). 7/10-For those who don't like ""in-game puzzles""this may be an issue (you still can skip them). As some of you not know... the ""Ultimate edition"" means you have:Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Reverie DLCCastlevania: Lords of Shadow - Resurrection DLCThat basically CONTINUES THE STORY of LoS, and let you know about why Gabriel Belmont (main character) become what he become at the end. Finish the DLC's in about 4 hours (final boss was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for me).Total rate: 9/10 "

												this is definitely one of the best games I've been playing this year.story, soundtrack, voice acting, the cutscenes - it's a great packagethe characters are detailled like in few games nowadays and the varying scenery covers basically anything that comes to mind.the only downsides are the controlls and the camera - I got stuck at some point because it was just impossible to use the keyboard as input device any longer and i had to switch to my ps3 controller - well, not that bad, but still...and secondly the fixed camera positions - argh - it was like Resident Evil 2 all over again...I sure hope they'll get rid of those and by chance even inplement a free 3rd person view in the sequel...anyhow - I'll definitely go for the mising stones and achievements in this game and am very much looking forward to the great finale			"

												What a great game! I had a lot of fun playing, despite that there are a lot of annoying and bad things/ bugs/ features, too.Let´s start with the negative points first:-- fixed camera spots: The fixed camera is not in every case a bad thing (see pros), but especially in corners or spots among 2 camera locations, the fixed camera can be really annoying and bad for the smooth and trouble-free gameplay.-- autosaves points: This problem apears in a lot of games within this genre. At some bosses the game let´s you retry at beginning of the second phase for example. Other, harder bosses haven´t  got these autosave points and you have to do everything from the beginning. Furthermore there could be many more checkpoints at some parts of the game. It can be really frustrating to do everythink from beginning, although there were at least 2 great chances, to place a fair checkpoint...-- structure of the (boss) battles in combination with the fighting system: The game got a great fighting system (see pros) with a lot of diffrent attack possibilities. Unfortunately many bosses and creatures doesn´t allow you to use this various system. It will end up at smashing the X or Y button and adding some special skill secondarily.- rough air controlls: Fortunatly air combat is just a nigligibly part of the game, but certainly you will jump alot. At some parts of the game, especially some parts, where you have to long-jump (run and jump) its kinda hard to hit your destination. Some times you will just jump beyond the platforms, or other times you randomly jump of a cliff... Since you are losing some health every time you fall of a cliff, it can be rally annoying over time....- few smaller balance problems- many blurry texturesAltough it looks like Castlevania: Lords of Shadows got a lot of problems, the positive things outweigh them significantly:++++ atmosphere: The, in my opinion, biggest advantage of the game is the atmosphere. The soundtrack, the fixed camera view, the setting, the scenery, the story, the level, boss and creature design, the protagonist... all these things just build up a awesome atmosphere at many parts of the game. You can easily just blinde out the negative and annoying things and just immerse in the great amosphere. I played the game with my Logitech Z906 5.1 Speaker System, which additionally intensifed the great atmosphere.+++ soundtrack+++ climbing parts+++ boss battles and design: Fight against giant creatures in breathtaking boss fights, or slay the Lords of Shadows and send them to hell.+++ Gabriel: What a badass.+++ diversifed level design: The levels go from a muddy swamp (without shrek, but with creapy scarecrows) to giant castles to a giant-graveyard.++ fighting system and possibilites: That all-purpose cross is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥awesome. You will have a lot of diffrent ways to slay your enemys.++ light and dark energy bars, which allow you to perform special Magic abilities.++ Story: I liked it.+ After credit-scene: Forces me to buy the second part.+ game length: It took me about 20 hours the complete the main story. The the right length for these kind of games - in my opinion.All in all i give it a 9/10 and i can definitly recommend it!			"

												Never was a big fan of Castlevania franchise, never expected much from this one, yet it turned out to be one beautiful arcade experience.Didn't like it that much in the beginning, though, had to endure some things, like the infamous QTEs or the abusive need to base your combat around parrying. Yet, once you get to understand how things work, you get to enjoy the rich atmosphere - it may be inferior to some RPG titans like Dark Souls or Skyrim, but the feeling of being on a crusade is real.There's also this rather popular opinion, that C:LoS is too long and repetative. While it repeats itself in a certain way, the similar parts get reacher each time you encounter them. In the end it felt really rewarding to 100% the game. The included DLCs only made it more so.Overall, if you're looking for a moderately challenging arcade with plenty of action and some nice scriptwriting, give C:LoS a shot, just be sure to leave any expectations out of the picture and take it as it is.P.s.: I find it rather amusing and appropriate that a japanese franchise with a rich christian context was given to a spanish developer.

												Yeah, this game doesn't have the feel of old 2D Castlevania games.Yeah, the gameplay isn't really complex and the game plays like God of War (although the magic system makes it rather challenging on high difficulty levels).It has it's flaws, yes, like the fixed camera, which can bug out and the combat is rather repetitive, but is it a bad game? Definitely not.Excellent voice acting and soundtrack, beautiful levels, a decent story (though nothing outstanding), exploration, atmospere overall... all this makes Lords of Shadow a good and enjoyable action game (and a rather long one too, especially if you want to beat it on the highest difficulty setting and find all secrets).It doesn't feel like a polished 10/10 game, but rather as a not perfect, but a relly nice adventure. Personally, it is what I expect from this type of games... now waiting for Lords of Shadow 2. "

												A great game of its own, but not for the fans of the classic castlevania. I like a game where we can beat Dracula and its minion, this game will give you another story though. Kind of miss the old castlevania's mechanics, but Lords of Shadow works well for a reboot. This game offers a great action with enough decent difficulty. You will be kept busy with full and fast-paced attacks from the enemies. This game reminds me of some games. It's like a crossover between the Shadow of the Colossus and God of War, with the action focuses more to button mashing and you will meet area and boss fights that resemble Shadow of the Colossus. The story is on the better side though. Lords of Shadow will show you a plot twist that will guarantee it a worthy game to play.Bottomline:If you like God of War series or Devil May Cry, you will love it, as the action will satisfy your needs. Gamepad or joystick is higly recommended, I don't know about other guys, but I can't play this game without gamepad controller. But don't worry, it's still playable with KB+M, someone posted some configurations for the KB+M that will probably suit your play style. Other than that, the one most annoying thing is the camera that cannot be arranged. It will be really depressing on some parts ort of the game when you cant move the camera.Updated 16 February 2016:Just beat the final mission (included in the Ultimate Edition Only), the final boss is so satisfying, decently difficult but really satisfying. I even needed a new and proper joystick to finish the last cahpter.Splendid! Moving on to Lords of Shadow 2.			"

												I really don't know how to recommend this game. The quality is good, the graphics are good too, but the gameplay and story, ♥♥♥♥ there is something wrong there.The battles are similar to assassin creed. In fact, almost exactly the same except that in assassin creed, you always hit your opponents close because you had a dagger and your fists. In this game, you got a freaking cross whip that hit from far, so it's not that great contrary to logic. You often try to shoot your whip in the direction of your opponent only to see it hit just right next to it. I don't know if its the not terrybly good angle the camera is pointed at all the time or what, but its especially terrible when you jump and try to hit anything. So you basically don't jump unless you sent something in the air with a combo. Laaaame.The interface is faaaaar from intuitive so you often hit critical point in the game where you basically have to hit the buttons just right or you die and have to try it again 15 millions times before you get it right. And that is on normal difficulty. I don't want to know what hard difficulty and 'paladin insane' difficulty have to offer. So expect a lot of replay of the same scene and monsters over and over and over until you are sick of it or you like to repeat to perfection the same crap (which some people apparently do).There are a couple of puzzle in the game, which brings some originality to it and lots of platforming puzzle, like in the swamp where you have to advance only when the bubbles stop showing. Those are nice. The problems is that all the weak mobs seems to hit you even when you block for some reason (or dodge). They don't hit hard but after the 10th hit, your hp is very low and the freaking healing fountains are only located in the stage when you are already at full health! This is especially ♥♥♥♥♥♥ just before hitting a boss and you're in the red with your hp. Then you have to do the boss over and over and over because he one shot you with your low hp. Quite a big waste of time.And to make matters worse, you got the ♥♥♥♥ing autosave checkpoint feature. At first, it looks great saving for you so you don't have to think about it, but the problem is that each freaking time i had to redo part of a stage, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ autosave recorded me when i'm at my lowest hp, so i have to redo the scene with even worse health than the first time! That's no fun. It was fun in the nintendo 8 bit day when they couldn't do long games so they cranked up the difficulty to 11 so that it looked like it was a long game because we had to redo most part 1 million time before passing them, but today it aint that good. I got millions other game to play now, so i ain't spending all my time on 1 game because the difficulty is rediculus!The story is practically the same exact ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t love story 'cry' 'cry' somber hero lost his wife to evil and must now battle eeeeevil to take revenge. Crap where did i see that story before.... mmmm almost all castlevania before it and quite a bit of other games! Laaaaaamo! I prefer the first casltevania on nintendo 8 bit that didn't really care about the story and made no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about it. You kill monster and thats all! Here they try to make a deep story but it fails badly. It's also funny how the hero is supposed to be somber tough guy when he is so gorgeous he looks like he's coming out of a freaking top model show. All his 'brotherhood' use normal steel armor, but not him! Super hot gorgeous leather clad red painted must have cost an estate armor! And he was raised by monks? And he got married? Hmmmm Hmmm. please tell me more of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story that makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense whatsoevar! You know i like a good story as long as it has some sense and logic in it even if its high in magic, technology science fiction or even god occurrence, but this one tries hard but the logic goes out the windows in a bad way. So the story looks like crap the more you learn about it. Maybe at the end its worth it, but i'm not sure ill be able to even get there so what the hell?As you progress and kill things, you get experience and with it you can buy new skills. This looks like a good thing, but because of the weird angle of the camera and the fact that you miss your hit quite often, it means that in the end, you use the press 'A' 'A' 'A' button simple combo almost 99.99999999% of the time, without jumping for nice combo maker either. Even against bosses. That means all those nice looking skills in the game, they ain't worth♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to your most basic and simple whip hit. WOW! These guys have gone to all the trouble to make a freaking complicated fight system that can look awesome, but then hitting the 'A' button is better than everything else all the time. What could go wrong there! Very disapointing game. I'm glad i got it for 7$ because honestly it ain't worth more even if it has AAA quality studio behind it. The gameplay and fighting ain't that fun. The story is dull and full of holes.			"

												- Graphics :Aged a bit (this is a 2010 game) but still nice to watch. Environments are varied and beautiful (especially during the first act)- Sound & Musics :Voice acting is top notch, the musics are a splendid piece of work- Gameplay :Simple & solid mechanics ; the only downside being that it lacks strategy for most part of the boss fights : power up with dark magic, then cure when necessary with light magic, perfect guard to gain magic back and then power up again with dark magic. You have plenty of combos to unlock though, which is pretty nice- Storytelling :One of the best Castlevania on this aspect because it doesn't reuse the same old routine (one good guy not knowing what's going on ; one dark guy who seems like the last boss but who isn't evil in fact ; one nice guy at the start who's evil at the end ; someone that happens to be a Belmont or Belmont related who helps you at the end). It tries to do a different story, that doesn't play on the ""black & white"" chord. A very nice story at the end of the day.- Length : If you plan to make the main campaign just once : about 10-12 hours ; if you plan to get every achievements : over 40h. CONCLUSION :It's a very good game, very different from usual Castlevania game from IGA, if you can stomach that, then you're in for a good adventure.			"

												It's one of the most epic games I've ever played in my life. If you love Fantasy RPGs and Hack and Smash combat style and the most incredible story you'd be the biggest fool ever NOT to buy this game.I would like to add to this review and just explain how awesome the game really is, to me at least.I have played the entire Lords of Shadow trilogy, for thoes of you who don't know Castlevania franchise has been around for a very long time. I haven't played the other games but I've played this trilogy. From the Lords of Shadow trilogy, this one, the first one is my favourite. What makes it so incredibly amazing is the journey, how he rides fearless and unhinged towards his objective even though he leaves only death in his path. How he, despite everything that is happening, does not abandon his faith. The music that makes you feel his strong desire to see this through but also his fear of what he was done or about to do. You can hear his pain and feel the burden that he carries in his voice(Robert Carlyle is the voice actor for Gabriel), so calm and yet firm and determined. They've really managed to make this game a masterpiece and found the perfect voice actors for the game, Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart, and it desirves a straight 10 in everything, graphics, storyline, combat, plot-twist, music, artworks, etc. It is just pure epicness. I just LOVE IT.			"

												Okay, so I bought this on sale, and I have to say that I would happily have paid full price for it.You get an amazing soundtrack, fantastic voice acting (Patrick Stewart included), and some of the best visuals I've seen to date. That's comparing against games like Dark Souls 3 or Fallout 4 on the PS4, this game looks on par with those, without needing a beefed up PC to handle it. On top of that, you get included DLC and a really cool story to play along to.All in all, I've only put an hour and a half into this game, and I've had more fun than 50 hours of Infinite Warfare. This reminds me of playing Devil May Cry back in the day, and that's one hell of a comparison. The combat may seem simplistic, but if you enjoyed games like Darksiders or DMC, then you're sure to enjoy this.What are you waiting for? Play it!			"

												If you're looking for a God of War esc hack and slash then look no further. Great game. Great characters. Game appears a little sluggish to begin with, however as game progresses abilities you unlock give greater maneuverability and resolve this issue. Game doesn't patronise you and bombard you with constant hints etc. Work it out or ♥♥♥♥ off essentially. On numerous occassions you will have to sit and discuss with yourself why smashing your controller will not help pass the next stage. Great mix of muder, puzzles and platforming. Huge amount of content. 49 hours for campaign playthrough + DLC on normal not 100% each level. Abilities you unlock allow you to access areas in previous levels and obtain items you could not. In all honesty I will probably not go back and 100%. I'm more into storylines and I was satisfied with the content I got. However if you are a completionist then you will get a ♥♥♥♥ ton more hours out of this game. 10/10 would ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up with an Iron Cross again.			"

												Camera angles in this game make it hard to see the enemies. good thing the combat and visuals are good. The combat only improves after buying a good number of combos, so the early part of the game can be too plain. There's a lot of backtracking which feels like a grind getting all the upgrades, but can feel rewarding after. The storya lso takes a long time to build and may be more interesting to see how it develops in the sequels.			"

												Visuals, music and voice acting: Great!Environments are varied and beautiful. There are some stunning locations in this game. Even though the game is quite linear, there are still many opportunities to stop and admire the breathtaking vistas. Lush forests, ancient ruins, towering gothic castles, hellish pits, this game has many amazing sights to take in, and woven through it all is one of the most haunting and heartbreaking soundtracks ive ever heard. If you appreciate a good soundtrack, you will love the work of composer Oscar Araujo in this game. As far as voice acting goes, this game has quite a stellar cast, Patrick Stewart, Robert Carlyle and Jason Isaacs to name a few. Great performances!Actual Gameplay: Fun and ChallengingThe game does a great job of easing you into the controls and makes sure to pop up a tutorial whenever a new gameplay element appears. As the game progresses the enemies get tougher and more numerous and the puzzles get more devious. If you enjoy puzzles, this game has oodles of them! The worst thing about this game i think (apart from the saw blade wall at the end *shudders*) is the fixed camera. It causes some awkwardness throughout the game. Other than that, I highly recommend this game. I just completed my second playthrough of it. I love this game and in my opinion it is worthy of the castlevania name.			"

												WOW!! This game is a blast. Seriously I fell in love with this game. The art style is absolutely FANTASTIC. The graphics of this game made me feel like I was watching a lord of the rings movie. BOSS fights are TOP NOTCH and as for story it has that epic feeling of adventure. This game has also a lot of variation in terms of gameplay like puzzles, hack and slash sections, platforming and even in one section you have to play a chess game with a demon girl. The only problems I found about this game are some small bugs, some camera issues (cause camera is fixed and sometimes gets in the way) and there are some levels that are weak in relation to other and feel out of place. Also some puzzles are hard to solve due to unresponsive controls because the camera gets in the way and your character is not controlled as it’s supposed to. In conclusion I have to say that this game is one of my favorite 2013 games and I highly recommend it.PROS: The art style and graphics are top notch, nice story,nice music, boss fights are awesome, lots of content and a lengthy campaign + the two expansions (22 hrs total)CONS: Camera issues, some bugs, fighting can sometimes be repetitive; some levels are weak and feel like fillers, Some control issues may frustrate you.Final score: 8/10			"

												If you enjoy a visually appealing masterpiece, with a great soundtrack, endless enemies to slaughter, and LOVE a good story line, I would 1000% reccommend giving this game a shot. Castlevania is about an orphan taken in by the brotherhood, a holy man embarking on a quest to defeat the Lords of Shadow, which challenges his mind, spirit, and heart. It has fantastic character development and other various story elements (the twists were very much a genuine surprise each time). Voice acting, with Patrick Stewart?? YES, please. *****The only thing I could complain about this game is the PC controls. I would highly reccomend using a controller for this game, as the PC controls are very clunky and hard to work with (even when adjusted).****The difficulties are fair, and even on easy it was challenging, so this is a game for all levels. With all of the puzzles and different hidden items, I can guarantee you will be entertained for hours. (In my case, 38 wonderful hours.) Definitely get this game! If you aren't sure, there is a demo for this. :)			"

												Wow. I ended up enjoying this game. Quite a bit. I was so wishy washy when it went on sale awhile back that I was unsure I could convince myself to buy a game in a series I was entirely unfamiliar with. Sometimes good word of mouth goes a long way I suppose. The combat is fast and fluid, and more importantly: varied. Even early on without a lot of the skills and combo modifiers unlocked yet, blocking, dodging, aerial attacks, grapples are all able to be utilized. Sometimes I feel I repeat myself a bit when it comes to combat systems but it is immensely important to me that they stay interesting throughout the course of the game. Nothing worse than having a game like Kingdom Hearts where the combat system can essentially boil down to a single button on your controller. This game will punish you if you don't vary up your attacks, try to get the enemies airborn, anything other than attack attack attack. Enemies having both blockable and unblockable attacks means you will have to learn to both block and dodge. It ends up becoming so addicting such that taking a hit to interrupt your combo and reset the meter ends up being rather demoralizing. The meter was a fantastic way of making every encounter interesting, since it meant even trash mobs would be approached with the goal of perfection in mind. On normal mode the majority of encounters were maybe a notch too easy, though at the end of the game the difficulty ramps up quite a bit. In the DLC chapters, you are asked to take on many sets of tough enemies without a checkpoint inbetween, and the final boss (both the story and the dlc) test whether you know when to attack, and when to pull back.The puzzles are great from about the midpoint of the game on. Lots of variations to things you'd see in either a Zelda games, for instance. Many of them are creative and you never really see the same type of puzzle twice. Especially in late game and dlc, I found myself asking my brother for any ideas on 1 or 2 of them (but never the internet!...except once.)My first main gripe of the game is the Uncharted style ""platforming"". This typically involves you moving from glowing ledge to glowing ledge in a straightforward fashion simply to move from one area to another. I understand  the usefulness of implementing that as a traversal mode, but it just felt just it was overabundant. There are a few instances where the world opens up a bit and you're free to do a little bit more climbing around, looking for secrets and whatnot (or retrieving your gear, which gets stolen from you 4 too many times in this game), and these are the best uses of being able to climb and hookshot around.My second main gripe is the abundance of QTEs. There are a lot of them. A lot a lot. It's not the worst use of them I've seen, but enough to make it a bit annoying. Luckily, they are often reserved as ""eye candy"". What I mean by that is typically you'll have your normal fight with the normal mechanics, and then either the finishing blow  or stage-change will be executed with a QTE. I will admit that sometimes the eye candy looks nice, and it feels good to see Gabe rip apart whatever foe in whatever  way the developer felt adequate.Which reminds me of my last point. The art style of this game really sunk its teeth into me. I can't point to exactly what or why, but I love how this game looks, outside of the full motion cutscenes that is (which seem to incur a drop in framerate and overall quality). For being not much more than generic medieval fantasy, I was never really bored with enemy designs or environments. I took a fair number of screenshots simply because I really found myself wanting to share how good it looks. The bosses had some very interesting designs and not a recolor or re-skin to be seen. The story is pretty light for most all of the first ten chapters or so. For someone who knew and still knows nothing or very little of Castlevania anything, this was a good thing. However, the last handful of chapters, especially the final confrontation of the main story, is like an info-dump of PLOT followed by a post credits video of more revelations. The DLC then goes to bridge the game ending and ending scene with more plot. None of it is particularily bad it just seemed like quite the tonal shift.So, a great game, with great core gameplay marred by some lazy qtes and ""platforming"". Maybe Castlevania purists wouldn't enjoy it as much but I don't really have the frame of reference to make a comment on that. On its own merits, its a great game worth playing.			"

												This game should have been right up my street, Fantasy Action Adventure in the style of DmC, Gods of War, etc. But it just didnt quite live up to what i wanted.Graphics 8/10 - Not Bad by any means but recently i have been playing a lot of games with Better quality Graphics.  Low quality pre rendered video at the end was awesome but looked horrible not sure if it was a problem on my end or if thats how it was just pixelated spoilt it a bit.Sound 8/10 - Again not bad and some really nice music in there just didnt feel it as much as others.Gameplay 7/10 - Combo system is good fun and has interesting points and parry/Block mechanic was nice lets you learn an enemy and use his attacks against him, was fun after playing Dark Souls not so long ago, Some Epic boss fights which were sometimes more tedious and frustrating than Satisfying. The Main Reason i score it so low is because of the FIXED CAMERA yes i know it had one before i got it but after playing quite a lot of this style of game recently i just felt so restricted by it, they made a nice looking world for us to battle through but we could only see it from one angle, Just felt it could have been better with the ability to look around freely rather than be locked into some rather interesting angles at points but on the whole they were ok and pointed to the next objective or moved out to show the next grapple point etc i suppose it was different to all the others i played because of this but when i was fighting losing enemies behind me and around me not seeing them charge their attacks was a little frustrating.Puzzles were fun and some of them difficult but not to the point of frustration, platforming was ok but with the camera zooming in on key locations wasnt really difficult to work out where to go, did get a bit tiresome towards the end but meh.Story 8/10 - Solid, well told, but a bit repetitive and long winded the whole speech from Someone near the end felt long winded and drawn out for like 3 minutes of what could essentially have been said in 30 seconds.  Some high calibre Actors hired to voice the characters which didnt really help to get the story across but i guess helps from a selling point of view if its got famous people 'ITS GOT TO BE GOOD' ...Overall 7.5/10 - I played it but towards the end it felt a little grindy and a little repetative the long winded speeches at the end were a tad boresome and Deaths voice made me chuckle as he sounded a bit jesterish, a decent experience and one that is enjoyable, just not as good as i had hoped, Hopefully they release a sequel where they take the Voice acting budget and add in a Free view camera or something.

												As much as I'd like to I just can't recommend this game at full price, and that's terrible to say.This game is a pretty game, too bad that's it's best feature...This game is like gears of war, the first devil may cry game, and prince of persia put together but doesn't come off as good as that can sound.The stages are VERY linear just like gears of war, probably b/c of the graphics looking so good.  And there are MANY loading screens again probably b/c of the graphics.The fighting and style reminds you of devil may cry but fails to deliver that great combat that feels JUST right.  Sure there are a ton of moves, but I found myself not even wanting to bother to study half of them.  The game feels like you could chain together some cool combos, but seems to punish you every time you attempt to string one.  I normally wouldn't say this about a game but a practice board or tutorial stage maybe like street fighter's would do this game well to get you used to the moves.Speaking of tutorials half of this game feels like a tutorial (and not in the right way at all, punish you b/c you have no idea what they want you to do then after you fail correct you), 1/4 like quick time events, and 1/4 fun.This beautiful game is confused as to what it wants to be just like the main character's storyline (yes I played it all the way to the end including the boards after the credits roll).Yes this game does have some cool areas, fun puzzles, a few cool bosses, but it just doesn't live up to what Castlevania should be imo.At most pick this game up on a sale, because at full price you're really just paying for the visual treat.

												The most beautiful game I played in 2013. The game has two flaws - controls and combat system. ControlsUsing sequences like forward-forward in the analog stick controlled game is very questionable. Belmont sometimes just don't sprint. Or SUDDENLY stops sprinting, and you end up with regular jump and die.I wish that I could hold button to sprint. Other problem - there is two buttons, L3 and R3 ( push on analog stick ) to drain magic. You eventually end up draining both types of magic simultaneusly, but accidentally pressing L3 button stops you in combat, or in jumping sequence. So frustrating. Why I just cant use one R3 button to drain both types of magic ?Combat.Just one problem. It is unfair. Any enemy breaks any of your combo with any attack any time. At the same time you can't break enemy attack with anything. You hitting them and they just do whatever they want while you hitting them. So all long combos basically useless. Theoretically, you could juggle, but you don't have a universal launcher. ( You will have an uppercut, but its slow )But I cant criticize other parts of the game. Many interesting puzzles, big levels, many hard bosses. Good story and the way it is told.			"

												First of all don't let the ""Not Recommened"" put you off completly. By that I mean I do not recommend this game at the full price. Simply because it's a port, one word that should normally put any PC Gamer off. Now it's not the worst port in the world, not by a long shot by why for the love of everything holy would you assign the jump key to ""K"" and leave the space bar unassigned? It's things like that which make this game very arkward to play for a PC Gamer, developers did not take the needs of us into consideration at all.No Mouse...that's right; something that doesn't sit right with my PC Gamers as this takes away freedom. And because of this sometimes you cannot fully see where you are heading. The game itself is stunning visually, some great scenes and some great looking bosses unfortunatly the game itself is very repetative in a lot of ways. But it's the controls that will put people off. If you were lucky enough like me to purchase this for 75% off in the sale then it's not so bad; that way the way I see it is I'm getting what I paid for.Also, from what I've read 75% of people have uninstalled it on the second Titan boss, simply because the controls make it that hard to do. I've managed to do it but It's been a long time since a boss on any game wound me up that bad.			"

												This is a bit long, so grab some cookies and milk before you start - will prove usefull, believe me. And English is not my main language, so bear with any mistakes I make. ^^This game is pure awesomeness. Not even chocolate chip cookies were able to take me away from the pc while I was playing it... and that's a serious matter. Trust me.I've played other Castlevania titles and to be honest I feel that the aproach made in this game to the whole ""evil monster slaying and save the world"" is the most appropriate - a hack and slash style feels more right to the ""evil monster slaying and save the world"" thing than a platformer in which you turn to one side whip-whip-whip-whip, turn to the other whip-whip-whip-whip. Naturally, when the first Castlevania titles appeared, platforming and whip-whip was astonishing - it was another age :p - and I enjoyed all the Castlevania titles i played, but I feel that for the quest the main character has ahead of him an hack and slash style feels more adequate.Many people complain that this isn't like an old Castlevania. Of course not, it's a reboot - it's not meant to be like an old Castlevania. And for a reboot it is a good idea (if not mandatory) to try a different approach. And I believe it was amazingly well done.The story is awesome (may take a few missions to understand what is going on, but I believe that was intended - it helps build intrigue), the soundtrack is awesome, the main character development is awesome (if you play the game and the dlc's you actually see the whole evolution the main character goes through, with a little surprise in the end... hehehehe), the gameplay is awesome - it has one small problem or other (to me, it was the time advanced moves take to work - certain moves take far too much time and the main character is defenseless while executing them, making those moves unviable in battle, in my opinion) but nothing to worry too much about; in fact, these details seem to have been corrected in the second game, from what I've read, though I haven't played it yet (BUT I WILL, MUAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!).Regarding the story: I actually am very gratefull to this reboot because, in my opinion, it helped create a whole, coherent story for the Castlevania universe - something the previous title's never cared much for, in my opinion. Every new title just felt like ""oh, check it out, Dracula is back again! The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Well, let's kick his♥♥♥♥♥.. AGAIN.""; this isn't the negative aspect - what's negative is that, in general, there isn't a coherent connection (story-wise) from one game to the other. An example: I played Order of Ecclesia, and in that game you don't play with a Belmont, since they had vanished. But 36 six years before the events in Aria of Sorrow - chronologically after the events of Order of Ecclesia - the Belmonts defeated Dracula permanently. ...where the hell were they at the time of Order of Ecclesia then?... It is stated that the villagers you find in OoE are descendants of the Belmonts, but that doesn't really convince me enough to believe that that was the reason why a Belmont showed up after. It doesn't feel right, at least to me. In Lords of Shadow the story is a whole, coherent block. You have the first game that shows the first Belmont and his quest, you have Mirror of Fate, that is good to make a connection (story-wise) to the second game, and finally you have the second game, which concludes the story. But it is a whole block, and it is coherent, which is something that the previous titles were not - they felt more like separate stories, vaguely related to each other. At least to me.In short, this game is awesome. But all this is just my opinion, so...Peace!			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is with distance one of the best Action RPG's ever made!Short: The Story is excellent and it contains Love, Hate, Vengeance and Sadness, also is well told and full of Surprises.The Gameplay and Combatsystem is fluid.Graphically this game is maybe not up-to-date, but it looks really good and every level in this game is wonderfully designed and affectionately made.Over time you get many upgrades which grants you more Ability's and skill's.More detailed:Story: The story tells of a member of the Brotherhood of Light, named Gabriel Belmont. His Wife Marie Belmont was killed and he wants Revenge for her dead [You will wonder who killed She and why].Even the World has lost the blessing and protection of God. So Gabriel has received the Mission from the Brotherhood of Light to bring back peace to the World.So his Journey begins ...Gameplay/Combat: The Gameplay is really smooth and the controls are even really good and comprehensible. Over time you can learn more and more Ability's and Skill's which you can use by using the right button combination and timing. I played it with the Xbox360 Pad and it works perfect in all cases.Enemys: There are many different Enemys. Every Foe has his unique style and his own behavior and/or abilitys and skills, which makes every Battle with an unknown enemy different from each other until you know them all =)Soundtrack: The Soundtrack fits perfect to the game! It was made from a Orchesta.Graphic: The graphic is outdated but this gameengine looks Awesome!Environment:  You have beatiful surroundings in every Level [Maybe not the world of dead for some =)]. Every detail is well designed and looks really good.Riddles: This game has many Riddles which must be solved to get further [with exception of 1]. Some are Easy, some Average and some Riddles are really Hard for the first time, but you can find hints in the same Areas where the Riddles are and you can let you show the solution if you want. But if you do it you will loose the Bonuses!Over and all this Game is totally worth the Money! You will not make a wrong decision if you buy this game. Also you will need to spend 13 - 26 hours approximately to beat the game the first time.Have a nice Day ^.^			"

												+S+ Graphics, actually quite shocking a 2010 game has these graphics, it almost feels new.+Unique combat system, but combos feel a bit limited+Many enemies++STUNNING architecture/world design, throughout the entire game, but especially at the chapters of the 2nd Lord of Shadow (the Vampire lands)++Great soundtrack (should seriously have the great soundtrack tag)++Actually AMAZING and mystically shrouded story with huge plot twistsI played this game in console back when it was released, I bought it here to play it again because of how fun it was, you go from the lands of the Lycans, through the ruins of destroyed civilizations, fighting werewolves, titants, and many monsters, and travel to the snowy lands of the Vampires at Transylvania, exploring huge, massive castle (I have a fetish for this type of architecture that only few games sate), than you travel to what is essentially hell, wastelands, and fight hoards of zombies, demons, it's a long adventure that doesn't run dry at any point. I really don't have anything bad to say about this game aside from the combat system that might get alittle stale after a while because unless you use shadow or light magic you are just repeating a bunch of combos (partially thanks to the fact of how many shadow/light combos there are compared to normal ones), but still blocking enemies at the right time is one of the best feelings ever in this game.The story is probably the best thing about this game, be prepared for CRAZY plot twists.

												This is one of my favorite games of all time, and that's an unpopular position to have on this game. I'm someone that loves to appreciate great art in games, and this game delivers with literally every level. I also love the Victorian/Gregorian setting (the era has some of my favorite architectural design in history), and being a Castlevania game, it delivers on that front just as well as all the others (better than the others in my opinion). If you don't care about the visuals in games so much, the games flaws will be far more pronounced for you.Combat is acceptable. I personally think it's better than god of war's combat, but not as good as devil may cry or games from Platinum. There is a frustration factor that comes from certain enemies, but every action game of this nature has those enemies. If you are in it for the combat and the combat alone, I recommend games like Metal Gear Rising: Revengance, Devil May Cry 4 or DmC: Devil May Cry instead.  Again, combat is fun, just not the best in the genre.The story is...there. It's not awful, but it isn't great. The general plot is the typical ""save your love"" type of deal. It's fitting for the game and I enjoy it as a driving force for the content.Music is great. Not as iconic or memorable as old castlevania games (primarily because those songs had very pronounced melodies, while the music in this game is comparable in style to Skyrim), but every song is enjoyable to listen to.  Music + visuals really bring the game together.  The game is a sensory treat.For Nvidia card owners, I recommend using a program called Nvidia Inspector to add HBAO+ to the game.  The in-game ambient occlusion is pretty bad and looks better turned off.  The flag to use in Inspector is 0x0000000E.  If you have no idea what to do with this, check out this thread (http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=387114).I believe my first playthrough took about 24 hours.  Since then, I've completed the game a 2nd time on PC and 1 more time on PS3.  I truly love this game and still have urges to go back and play it again.			"

												Realy enjoyed this game!Ups:Great Combat - Lots of combo's to unlock and all are fun to useGreat Magic System - The Light and Shadow Magic system combined with the Focus Bar gives combar an extra layer of depth that is realy welcome.Good Story - Not the best story ever told, but definatly something you wil want to see trough the end.Fun Puzzles - Puzzles are challenging and feel rewarding to solve. You can get  the solution and skip the reward if you likeDowns:The Camera - The fixed camera angles could get realy frustrating in some stages, especialy when fast platforming is requiredThe Platforming - It just felt cluncky in this games from time to time, also you dont realy always know what is climbable and what isn't so you die alot by just tryingCheap Bosses - Some of the bosses (especialy the last one) can feel realy cheap and can get realy frustrating!Overal I had a blast with this game and I would recommend it if you like a good hack & slash game. The combat is just that little bit different that it realy makes it worth it and I personaly realy enjoyed the story.			"

												This is a pretty amazing Japanese hack 'n slasher.  The game opens with Patrick Stewart doing a voiceover on a beautiful fantasy scene and the graphics are quite stunning.  This game does great justice to the Castlevania series which I have been playing since it first came out on the NES.  The combat isn't incredibly difficult but the combos and dodging can be quite fun especially once you start to get the flow of combat figured out.  It isn't quite as fluid as Batman but it is definitely good combat.  The voice acting and cutscenes are rendered so well that they just fit right into the flow of the gameplay as you progress.  Best part is that they even made a demo so that you can see if you will like the game or not, so don't take my word for it and just give it a try.  I think most people will end up with this little gem added to their collection after they see it in action.			"

												Pretty solid port of the console game; a medium-set rig will be able to pull off higher resolutions at a better framerate than its console counterpart, which unfortunately makes the transitions between in-game cinematic and gameplay that much more jarring.Controls are fine, as long as you have a 360 Gamepad; customization options and usability for keyboard controls and third-party gamepads are lacking a bit.Story-wise, as long as you understand that this isn't considered canon and is instead an offshoot loosely based on the timeline set by the original games, it's alright.  The DLC additions included in this title are, however, not very good at all, and feel rushed and don't do a good job of tying the plotholes shut.  I feel sorry for people who paid for the DLC on consoles.  With any luck they'll retcon their decisions when the imminent sequel is published.Graphically, this game is drop-dead gorgeous, and breaks out of the claustrophobic issues that plagued the series' previous 3D forrays.  The scenery is very pretty.  The music is okay... the series has had much better works tied to it, generally from Michiru Yamane.  For the mood this game tries to convey, it works.  The occasional throwbacks to the classic themes are mildly offensive, however.Mechanics-wise, Castlevania: LoS doesn't bring anything to the table you haven't seen done better elsewhere.  The platforming can be mildly to moderately infuriating, and the combat ranges from feeling good to having you bite your controller in frustration trying to grab a grenade from someone as required to progress instead of simply eviscerating them.  The navigation pointers are fairly insulting, and even if you disable hints, the game often displays them anyways.But the storyline shines through, and has appeal whether you're versed in the Castlevania canon or not.  As a whole, the game holds itself together well enough to merit a playthrough if you enjoy hack 'n slashers --er, whipping 'n holy water lobbing, I guess.  If you aren't sure about it, I'd wait for a sale, but as a fan of the series, I was more than happy to drop the full $30 on it.  I owned this on the 360 and the PS3, and the PC version was the first one I managed to play through.  Playing it on PC, even with a 360 controller, makes all the difference in the world.  I'm looking forward to the sequel!			"

Posted: September 28, 2014
												Finished the game and a part of its DLC's. Very mixed feelings for this game and let me explain why.About the plot, Lords of Shadow kind of reboots the lore i guess you could say. Theres practically no links between the old Belmonts, ( You control Gabriel Belmont). Our Belmont's quest is actually pretty simple, his waifu got murdered, so he's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Afterwards we learn that some wierd magic caused the link to the heavens to get cut off so basically monsters and spirits invaded Transylvania, Europe. So Gabriel sets out on his quest to defeat the Lords of Shadows, who are very basic bosses, castlevania lore wise. Death, some queen and a werewolf. Not very important to the story. Thats about it. It also features an obvious plot twist.The combat is probably the weakest part of the game. Its shallow. It doesnt allow for any combo creativity. Enemies take no hitstun and can constantly attack through your attacks. Fortunately the game features a cancelling mechanic so you can do frame perfect blocks and thats about it. Frame perfect blocks is basicly the ""hardest"" combat mechanic (and its very easy once you get used to it) that this game has to offer. Its got a few unlockable moves, very weak stuff, theres basically maybe 20 moves you can unlock, then theres some Dark and Light buffs you can use. Light gives you health regen and Dark gives you more moves and stronger attacks. Like i said i thought the combat is extremely shallow. I give it LITERALLY 3/10.The soundtrack is kinda boring, very typical scores for such a game. battle-ish castle-ish kinda vibes. Very forgettable. Although i gotta admit that Gabriel does pretty funny sounds when he attacks. You can also very clearly hear how Gabriel's voice actor is some spanish guy they hired that slightly struggles in English. Don't get me wrong though it definitly has its charm.Controls are pretty awkward, there's something inside my controller, it's hard to explain. You have to feel it, it just doesnt feel very ""round"" i guess you could say. It often feels like Gabriel's movement are ""square grid"" based. Don't know how they messed that up. Also there's alot of climbing you have to do all the time, that got pretty tiring after a while, he moves really slowly too.There's too many stupid puzzles in the game, Sometimes they're really hard to figure out too, they take up whole chapters sometimes too and most of them are not very enjoyable to execute (they even give you the option to give you the puzzle answer right away, at the cost of the completion XP bonus). Most of the puzzles involve complicated maths or NASA tier scientists, i've spent maybe 30 minutes trying to solve some stupid puzzle. I got tired of them at the end i just started asking the game to give me the answer right away, i ain't got time for that.Now the best part of this Castlevania game is definitly the visuals. Stunning in 1080p and 60 fps. Port feels very optimized by the way. The game's art design is everything you'd expect from a Castlevania game, glorious victorian style castles, GREAT enemy design and presentation, they made very nice artworks for every enemy you encouter, some of them are breath-taking, very nice stuff. Very impressive details in the backgrounds, great visual effects. I got motivated to finish it just because of the great visuals in there. I really really loved them as a whole simply because i felt it really represented Castlevania well, it's everything i would expect from a 3D Castlevania game.The level design is garbage, literally empty hallways at times. Obvious enemy spawn points,  tedious world mechanics (the hands in the swamp, that was awful). Alot of invisible walls, the game gives you a fake feeling of liberty but it really feels like an on-rail game, alot of times. I thought that kinda sucked too. The placement for items such as Upgrades or Text scrolls are very obvious and not very hard to find. There's a ton of upgrades to get though so i guess collecting them was kinda fun. I forgot to mention that even on Normal difficulty, the enemies will hit hard as hell. Better start learning how to do precise blocks as soon as possible or else its into the trash you'll go.So it still does a good job at being a decent Castlevania game, but isnt anything fantastic. If you love the Castlevania franchise, then you will definitely enjoy this game. Get it on sale!			"

Posted: April 5, 2014
												First, I'll say I'm a rather big Castlevania fan. I'll go ahead and list the pros of this game:It has a few nods here and there to the original games and their lore.It's very visually and audibly appealing.The combat, for the most part, is kind of fun.The story isn't too bad, and the voice acting is surprisingly good as well.The game has a great atmosphere.Now for the bad:The 2nd biggest strike against this game, in my opinion, is the pacing. You'll progress a bit only to be stopped by a group of enemies. This gets more annoying as the game progresses, with the inclusion of more enemies and tougher enemies.SOME of the puzzles are tolerable. However, as the game goes on, you'll find they get more tedious and more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The biggest puzzle I had an issue with is later on in the game, in the  Frankenstein lab  level. Here, there are two big problems. Firstly, you need to buy a special move with experience in order to solve a puzzle. While you'd definitely have the experience necessary for the move, the fact that the game expects you to do something that is considered optional in order to move on in the game is really counter-intuitive. Additionally, this move is a bit inaccurate and hard to control, leading to further aggravation solving a puzzle which by its nature is already rather aggravating.Another thing about puzzles. Some of them are trial-and-error by nature. This alone is bad game design. It would be ok to have MAYBE one or two trial-and-error puzzles, but this game feels like it has too many of them. It ALMOST got it right, I will say that much, but it didn't get it right enough.While I mentioned that combat is fun, and it is, as you encounter more groups of obvious-filler enemies, you find that combat can be tedious and boring. It all boils down to mash the X and Y buttons. It's nice that the game gives you options in your combat with advanced moves, but it really tends to not make much of a difference. Going along with this, the shadow and light magic abilities you get don't tend to change up combat much, essentially making a gameplay mechanic useless.And the final, biggest strike against this game: ""difficulty."" Now I say that I haven't gotten a game over in this game sans one time. However, this game's idea of difficulty is to continually add fluff and padding with more enemies, more tedious puzzles, and the worst is when it combines these two. Often I found myself facing a puzzle and I just knew ""Ugh, I'll have to face a group of enemies which will only hold off the oncoming aggravation.""I really wanted to like this game, and for the most part I still do, however I think it needs a bit of a design touch-up. While I know games will lessen the hand-holding as you progress, which is natural for games to do, I think this game didn't hand-hold in the right places.Overall, I'd say play it and give it a shot, but I wouldn't pay 30 dollars for it. (At the time of writing, the game is priced at 29.99)			"

												There is so much wasted potential in this game. The production values for this game are on the right track. Lords of Shadow both looks and sounds great, and it runs at 60fps perfectly fine. For some, the biggest issue is that the game doesn't have too much in common with the previous Castlevania titles and is only borrowing its gameplay elements from God of War, Prince of Persia (Sands of Time trilogy) and Shadow of the Colossus. I'm fine with, nothing wrong about loaning the best parts from the masters. However, the game's very tedious combat and repetive gameplay keeps me of enjoying the game.Gabriel can improve his moveset with combos by buying them with experience points. It is just unfortunate that in actual combat, you can barely ever utilize most of the different moves properly. While you're performing in-air moves, you can be brought down instantly by critters that can only attack on the ground level. Even with strong attack moves and long attack sequences, your enemies may not falter at all, making you just vulnerable instead. There are also wide lashing moves that allow you to attack far-by enemies for crowd control, but as it barely staggers anyone, it won't find much use in the game. Rather than trying out different combos, the player usually ends up repeating a few staple attacks against majority of the enemies.Speaking of combat, the game's control scheme could have used some streamlining. There are some very different moves that are used by just one key/button in the game. For example, the player uses L2 to block and dodge roll in the beginning. But soon enough, you'll find that you use the same button for certain attacks such as gauntlet mash and a quick dash move when you're using magic. All of this variety add needless complexity to the game that doesn't really improve it in the end.These are just some of my complaints of the game. With some tweaking, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow would have been easily a great game, but these issues unfortunately make playing the game very tedious and unrewarding.			"

												i was looking forward to this game, as i havent played any castlevania game in  a long time. upon buying it, i started to regret it...the fixed camera is completely bogus, terrible camera angles in tight spots cause me to fumble with the enemies and for the screen to violently shake back and forth. in certain camera angles, when i move away from the camera, the controls (i use a 360 controller btw) become inverted and going down = going up and i dont think the game should behave that way at all. as well as that, the game is unnaturaly difficult, i dont usually complain about difficulty levels in game (dark souls seems like a cakewalk compared to this), but even on ""squire"" or ""easy"" mode the game just becomes extremely annoying in certain areas, with puzzles feeling like they're forced in. with these two main points the game becomes unplayable (or at least, not fun) for me. the voice acting is great though, and i like the atmosphere of the story, but that's all. it's a shame. i heard LoS 2 got a lower score than this game but i can't see that being possible unless it really got much much worse			"

												One of those half work-of-art, half video game type dealios, and it does it well.Lemme immediately allow people to stop taking me seriously by saying I have NO idea what a castlevania or metroidvania or igavania even is. With that outta the way, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a character action game in an absolutely gorgeous (for its time) fantasy setting. It plays like a Devil May Cry game (which is another legacy I know next to nothing about) for the most part, with some altered mechanics, including very situational giant monster riding, Shadow of the Collosus-esque boss fights, light/dark magic powered by combos, all based on a simple to understand control setting. A gamepad is highly recommended, and the game isn't without its flaws, but I'd say it's worth a try if you're interested. There's a demo and a (subjectively) fantastic orchestral soundtrack you can try for free, as well.			"

												One word for this game: EPIC! Are you looking for the PC version of God of War? Well my friend, just buy it without hesitation. If you knew Castlevania before this game, you already know everything and there's nothing I can do to explain it to you. I played first Castlevania on my NES when I was a kid and I enjoyed it as well as I enjoyed this one. We can call this game a reboot to story and they made it just... well I don't know how to say it but all I can say is you gotta play this game if you're looking for a good story and a good hack and slash. That last boss called The Forgotten One might challenge you a little bit but we all played Dark Souls right? They spilled 'a little bit' Dark Souls just for that boss. Oh and the soundtracks, man, they are in my favorite video game soundtracks now. That's all I can say about this game, I hope it's enough to convice you.			"

												The combat is a bit comparable to God of War's. Your weapon is a whip-like chain that lets you perform direct attacks to center on single enemies or areal attacks for groups of enemies. You can mix these attacks and also learn new movesets and combos the more experience points you gather. These combos and attacks can be combined with the light and shadow powers you receive throughout the game. That way you pile up a nice plethora of combos and movesets at your disposal which gives the combat system enough depth to not get boring. Not Devil May Cry-tier but still nice.In short: Do you love european medieval gothic art styles and are looking for an action game with nice visuals and somewhat meaty combat system? Try it			"

												Whilst the opening scenes were extremely promising, progressing through just the first chapter reveals that this game is unfortunately dragged down by two severe issues:1: Whilst claiming to have keyboard & mouse support, the game was undeniably meant to be played with a controller. This leads to an awkward control scheme, severe input lag, command queuing, and a generally unpleasant experience. Playing with an actual controller solves only the first of these three issues so is not a valid solution.2: The camera has a mind of its own and cannot be controlled directly. Whilst having an automatic camera is not unusual for the genre, this one is - in my opinion - insufficient as it does not provide a proper overview of the action and often snaps to different positions without any transition, greatly hindering both combat and platforming.

												Limited Recommendation:+ Soundtrack+ Landscape/ Art (escpecially the winter area)+ Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard)Well the Shortcommings:- Button Mashing & Quick Time Events- Limited Camera & No Open World (Level Design reminds me of medal of honor)- Using SOTN as THE benchmark of Castlevania series, it's a terrible mutilation of the series e.g.travelling through exotic/jungle-like levels, fighting Titans and other strange creatures -> imho Castlevania feeling - the gothic one - starts when entering the winter-vampire areas but even then the vampires are some wingy creatures- another Belmont, well even when Alucard isn't the best main character- lack of RPG elements - various skills, equipment (armor, weapons, ....)Conclusion:- requires a lot of reaction skills on (stupid) mini-games/puzzles frustrating sometimes- looks and sounds great on PC (better than the LPs I saw years ago for consoles)- grab it on sale- hope the series returns to a more gothic, RPG-like one after the damn sequel of Lords of Shadow 2			"

												I would have really loved to give this game a positive review, but unfortunately the Boss in chapter 2 cannot be defeated without a gamepad because you have to rotate your movement buttons impossibly fast (which would be simply rotating the stick on a gamepad). The fact that you have to use a macro or other weird tricks to defeat this boss by using PC hardware on a PC game is a no-go. The rest of the game was perfectly playable with KB+mouse, so I have no idea why this has not been adapted. I am a big castlevania fan and it hurts that this is what we get for buying the game on other platforms.It's even stranger that i can play all castlevania titles availible for emulators on PC without problems like that, on KB+mouse.Never happened to me before that the platform I play on actually became a plotstopper. The people responsible for this should be ashamed.			"

												Fantastic game.  Nothing like the original, but true to its roots.  Gameplay is like your typical God of War or Devil May Cry but with a whip and a dark/light system to mix in with your combos to change the way some of your moves execute as well as your auxillary items (dagger/holy water).  The fixed camera can be a total pain in the♥♥♥♥♥at times (like when running to another area the camera will completely make you change directions/orientations, sometimes at the worst possible time), but for the most part it works with you.  Loved the game, looking forward to the new one.The DLC is terrible.  You can tell it was rushed and it feels like they had a different team make it and push it out.  The fixed camera angles really mess you up here, its almost impossible to get your bearings.  It's also extremely unforgiving, any time clocked in the DLC will be from retrying an area over and over again, likely due to dying from a terrible fixed camera.  If it wasn't bundled with the game I would be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to have paid anything for it, which is a shame because the core game is so fantastic.			"

												I don't know where even to start.. I've been waiting so much time for this game to be playable on PC..Ok I'm gonna say it right now:1. The visuals are amazing.2. I'm pretty sure that this it has the best soundtrack I've ever heard in game.3. Character progression is fair.4. Challenging bosses.5. There is only one problem.. I don't know if it's only me but my controls seem to have delayed action.. They simply keep doing something even if I don't want to..6. Story is confusing but awesome when you get all the pieces together.7. There are times in the game where you actually have to sit and think♥♥♥♥♥♥trough.My final verdict:9.5/10I strongly recommend you to play it!It would be a solid 10/10 if controls were flawless cause it's really ♥♥♥♥ing me up sometimes.

												There are a lot of problems that you'll have to get through if you want to enjoy Castlevania. The first is the crappy fixed camera. The second is the repetitive combat that relies on quick time events to make up for its lack of depth. The third are even more quick time events. The fourth is a story told through dull and repetitive chapter intros (which are at least read by Patrick Stewart) The fifth is that it's not a proper Castlevania game because it has no backtracking or drive for completion. If you get through all of that, you may be able to enjoy Castlevania adequately. If the words above are not enough to deter you, then you'll enjoy it well enough.			"

												This game isn't a Castlevania game. Now that we have that out of the way, we can actually talk about what this really is. Lords of Shadow is effectively a hack and slash combat driven game which encourages long strings of attacks and high levels of skill. It's no Devil May Cry, but saying that it's a far better game than DmC Devil May Cry. It feels a lot like God of War if you had to compare it to another game, but also has elements of Shadow of the Colossus integrated. It's platforming isn't terribly good, there's a lot of guesswork required to progress through what should be straightforward.Essentially, the combat carries this game, as it is its strongest suit. Castlevania fans are no doubt going to be disappointed, as it severely lacks the charm of the classic franchise, barely even resembling it anymore. But it is a solid game in its own right, despite its flaws. Don't expect to be wowed by it and you may find something to enjoy from it.			"

												As a not-so-longstanding but still major fan of the castlevania series, I think this game is very good. However, if you think this is your ordinary castlevania like the masterful Symphony of the night or the Sorrows, then you'll be disappointed. This is not metroidvania style exploration game anymore, it is instead hack'n'slash god of war style game with Uncharted style of climbing elements, The Legend of Zelda puzzles and some Shadow of the Colossus style bosses. I'm not saying this game is bad, oh gods no. This game has beautiful graphics, good action, great cutscenes and voice acting, being overall very great game.I have seen some people complain about the camera in this game, and I can see why some people would not like it. I however have not had problems with it. The only complaint about this game I have, is the keyboard controls. If you are going to buy this game, please god USE A CONTROLLER, the keyboard controls are bugged and awful. This game has full controller support and I use XBOX360 controller with this and it works fantastically. Some places require very tight movement control, that is going to be pain in the♥♥♥♥♥if you're using keyboard. For example, there is few QTE's in game that require you to rotate left movement stick. Well, I dare you to do that on keyboard where you need to quickly press wasdwasdwasdwasd in quick succession.Overall pros and consPros:-Beautiful graphics-Good action -Very good control of the character (only with controller)-Good story-Good voice acting-Smart puzzles-Exciting bosses-Very long gameCons:-Fixed camera that cannot be manually controlled-Controller almost necessary-This game is hard... but that is not really a con, so I just strike this overOverall8.5/10    Buy it.

												Great game. I, as a nintendo fan, hated when castlevania got effectively ousted from nintendo consoles. But its great to see the series stays strong as ever. I can say as many good things about the game as i want, but we'd be here all day.  The only bad part is the controls. They feel delayed, and kind of awkward at times. Almost like the people prgramming them got 95% of the way through and then said ""F**k it, the games gonna be at least 60$ on release, and castlevania is an older franchise. lets just say we finished progamming the damned controls."" But, If you have a wired xbox360 controller, the controlls are smooth and easy to handle. I'm also going to point out that the first boss is very easy to beat with a hit-and-run tactic, and, full judgeing my knowlege on the franchise, this probably goes for the other bosses as well.  I say its worth the buy because you get the base game and the DLC.			"

												This is more movie than game..... Please check the reviews: although it says ""Very Positive"" you will find, consistently, even in these positive reviews, great criticism concerning the (poor) game design and restrictive controls (NO CAMERA MOVEMENT AT ALL, for one). I reitterate, the visual design and storyline (the movie aspects) are enjoyable; but for someone looking to explore, and battle, and pan the landscape... this is not that game.Though I mentioned that this game is more movie than game; the game-design is more like theatre.... Let me explain: each playable level/board you encounter will be magnificently designed, visually, that is. You, however, will only be able to interact with a very small range of the area, the remaining area (which will be most of it) will be simply 'prop', liken to theatre. And I repeat, you cannot control the camera at all. I don't want to belabor the point - there are many reviews that go into depth regarding the game; and as I said, many still recommended it, though citing both cost and the issues raised here. So I'll conclude with: I do not recommend  this game over $10, you will feel cheated.GameOn			"

												I've played through 3 chapters of this game, and I'm ready to uninstall it.  I am not against a game that is linear, but this game is linear to the point of impotence.  It directs the flow of gameplay so closely that you don't even get control of the camera.  It gives you platforming puzzles, but you're not allowed to jump in any direction but forward.  Also, any sequence where you are given free reign in a level, it does nothing to direct you towards your objectives.  You feel as if you are acting in a film, but weren't given a script.  The combat system has some decent ideas, but it doesn't let you stretch your legs enough to make you feel accomplished.  If you're seriously interested in the story, just watch it on Youtube.  It would be more fun.			"

												It's an unabashed God of War clone and the general gameplay has been picked from various games. It's unoriginal for sure when it comes to how it plays but it more than makes up for it with its compelling story, great voice acting, and engrossing lore. There's a lot to like here and a lot to play with it clocking in at around 15 to 20 hours on your first playthrough. Lords of Shadow is a great game and I highly reccommend you play it.			"

												I'm a huge Castlevania fan and I keep an open mind when it comes to new ideas/experiences even if they involve treasured game franchises. I played the original 2D classics and GBA/NDS sidescrollers and had a ton of fun with those games. I enjoyed the 3D Castlevania on the N64 and Lament of Innocence/Curse of Darkness on PS2. There hasn't been a stand out game that I absolutely detested and LoS is no exception. This reboot series does a really great job in many regards. The graphics are superb and the combat is complex with combos/parries/dodging etc. I've already beaten the game when it first came out on PS3 and the transfer to PC is great. The game never has looked better nor has the game ran as smoothly at 60fps. You'll definitely need a controller though as only n00bz only play on keyboard. The soundtrack isn't as epic as the second game in this series and sometimes sounds a lot like God of War. Speaking of God of War, this game borrows heavily from other franchises such as GoW, Shadow of the Colossus and Prince of Persia. This creates a sort of identity crisis for LoS and you'll either accept it or loathe the fact it tries to do so much variety without exceling in any particular area. The camera is probably one of the biggest complaints I read about since you don't have any control over it. It can be distracting but for the most part I don't find it a hindrince as the camera is pulled back far enough for you to see all the action. Attacks are properly tracked as well as enemy tracking when you perform moves.Depending on your playstyle you might clock around 15 hours of gameplay (not including DLCs) which is a meaty adventure for this type of game. I can't recommend this game enough. It's different in a good way and if you have an open mind you might just feel the same way.			"

												This game is very well crafted. The Patrick Stewart narritive was the orginal selling point for me. When I started playing, it seemed REALLY hard (always start a game on medium). So, I turned down the settings to easy and just played it for the story. The game is built like a ARPG, for more than one play through. It's diversified for casual through hardcore gamers, there's a ton of moves you can do but you can make it through with just the base set, every stage has hidden items for explorers, and the voice actting is amazing so you really don't mind, still you can skip the cut scenes. This a game you can sit down and play for 8 hours straight, or you can casually just pick it up for 15 minuets a day. The konomi code doesn't seem to do anything, but you can just turn on the cheats if you really want to just listen to the story or get through the first playthough. This game is everything I could expect from a button que game, my only complaint is the fixed perspective cammera. Get a copy for both the story and gameplay.			"

												So I've only got about 2 hours up and honestly, that's about all I can take. What promised to be a rich and indepth exploration of a well developed plot supported by quality voice acting was fatally undermined by unfortunate design flaws.- no camera control. Seriously, I was reduced to running to a side so at least whatever attacked me offscreen had to be coming from a certain direction.- no general mouse controls give it a typical pc port feel to it; it was released 2014 not 2009.- mind numbingly repetitive. I had read that the game was pretty long and now I know why. Knowledge I could have lived without.Best thing about this game was Patrick Stuart's voice over. Worst thing about this game was the expectations that Patrick Stuart's voice over raised. I feel slightly used, as if I'm crying in the shower and can hear Patrick Stuart laughing at me.Refund request pending....			"

												100% Corridor has nothing in common except few things with Castlevania series game. Combat system is primitive thats all, push X to win, i found much of combat upgrades useless. Levels are pretty short. Game has unnecessary features for corridor slasher. To be fair original NES Castlevanias was pretty much corridor, so someone might say ""DUDE ITS BACK TO BASICS!"" but no, in 2010-13 it looks not so well, it should be more like Darksiders or Dark Souls(actually Dark Souls gameplay type will be perfect for modern Castlevania). Stupid shadow of collosus boss battles(I just dont like it, deal with it). Also game has camera lock - awful. So If you are huge Castlevania fan like i am you can boldly skip this title, if you want some mid-level corridor slasher so you can buy it i guess. To be fair again, the music is neat, graphics not bad and views and designs are awesome.			"

												This game doesn't live up to the Castlevania hype in comparsion to other Cvania's I've played in the past.  Which is a pity!  Pros:Great graphics, atmosphere, challenging bosses, and fantastic voice acting.  It was awsome to hear the guy who plays Rumple from OUAT as Gabriel and Patrick Stewart as the main narrator, both did a great job.  This game gives that ""Castlevania"" feeling from those voices.  I also liked the fact, unlike other Cvania games:  this one is linear which gave me that old school nes feeling, not the metroid style SOTN.  I like both styles but it was nice to see this style again.  For a linear game, it's a good 20 hours.Cons:This game fails in many ways, which is why I do NOT recommend this title if it's more than $10 (I paid 10$ for it at the Summer Sale).  First off, just like with any other Cvania game I've played that was 3D, such as the one for the N64, you have NO control over camera angles!  I do not know how many games Konmai has to to make to get this right!  Sometimes the camera will do something stupid...sometimes you'll miss something...or even get hit by an enemy or boss.  The DLC content of the Forgotten One does this A LOT.Control:  Overall the control is ""OK"" Gabe is responsive pretty well except for quick relexes at times.  Control overall wasn't bad but it wasn't great either even with a 360 controller.Gameplay:  The gameplay is SOILD and is fast pace and the boss battle's were awesome except for mr RANDOM FORGOTTEN ONE.   What kills the pace, is that this game has a lot of quick time events.  This game is loaded with lots of them!  And if you screw up a QTE you usually will take damage and have to whittle down the boss to the same point and try again.  Fortunealty, the game is forgiveable on check points and you don't have to entirely have to start over.  I do not mind QTE'S for boss fights or key events but this game really spammed the crap out of them.  One boss alone had over FIVE QTE in one sequence.  That's over kill.Speaking over kill, this Cvania had a lot of puzzles....TOO many puzzles.  Most of the puzzles made sense and it was nice they offered the option to skip them (with no reward), but still just too many which killed the pace of this game.  Cvania isn't known for its puzzles.  It's known for its gothic and chain whipping action.Last but not least, Gabe has alot of moves but doesn't have many defensive moves to avoid attacks in the air or while he is in mid air.  Perhaps he should take a lesson from Dante from DMC?I plan to play the sequal when it drops down to a reasonable price.  Bottom line if you like castlevania and can deal with these issues then it's worth $30.  If these issues are over bearing, wait til it goes on sale, and you'll get your moneys worth!4.5/10			"

												I loved castlevania 1, 3 and 4. Thought I'd give this one a shot. Unfortunatly there are a bunch of quick time events, every new gameplay element (if you can call it that, they're poorly executed thus far) is spoon fed to you like a baby. Gameplay is constantly interrupted by tutorials telling you exactly what to do and when to do it, and immersion is broken by constant text popups telling you what buttons to press. I've only played an hour so far, but the only fun I really had was on on the first real boss: some green goblin in a graveyard. It wasn't particularly hard, and in my first hour I can honestly say this was the only well done part of the game, besides the fact it outright tells you how to dodge one of it's attacks before the fight even starts, and it ends in more quick time events. There were portions where it seemed like they should have let go of your hand and thrown you in, but unfortunatley this game gives you a great big hug and tells you exactly what you need to do, down to what button to press. I want to like this game, but so far I've felt  braindead and sleepy. Also the story tries to be mysterious and cool, but really what ends up happening is me getting bored with constant cutscenes with awkward pauses. When a game constantly tells you what to do and when to do it, and leaves nothing for the player to discover on their own, the player is no longer playing the game, the game is playing the player. Should've made a movie instead.			"

												Graphics: Although many people complains about the rough textures and modeling, the artwork is fantastic. The game is so appealing to the eye that it makes you feel that you want to be in that beautiful environment.Music: Actually I didn't pay much attention to the music, or should I say I haven't noticed any great melodies as other Castlevania games always have.Gameplay: Although slashing the enemies and doing all kinds of stuff feel satisfying, the game can be very frustrating. Most of your attacks will not even slow down your enemy, and you do need to block and doge a lot. The ""synchronized block"" requires trial and error, but unfortunately you do not have much hit points. Therefore there's not much chance for new players to try out and get used to the enemies' attack patterns. Also there are too many quick time events, which are boring and annoying, and most of them are unnecessary. Generally speaking, I do not think the gameplay meets my expectations. Oh yes, this game has a fixed camera, which I believe should not be found in an action game published just last year. I know it's a PC remake of an old game, but KONAMI should make more improvements.Generally speaking, the game is quite enjoyable (after you get used to the combat), but it does need a lot of polish. I am looking forward to the sequel.			"

												Some people like the timing press a button game but I don't. The game really doesn't have anything to do with strategy but more a press a key on the keyboard when it tells you to. I can't tell you how frustrating that is if your not a typest and it tells you to press a key at a certain time and you miss the message and your dead and have to start over again. This reminds me so much of the arcade game Dragons Lair where you had a joystick to move and you had a buttons to push at a specific times to advance. The key mapping is horrible for PC but you can remap it and that helps some, you can diffently tell the game is for console games since the camera doesn't doesn't swing so your stuck with one camera view. If I had an Xbox game PC controller it might make the game better to control, but still the game is kind of boring kill monster go down the path kill the next monster.			"

												This game is simply not fun.Great graphics, great longevity  and lots of combos.Controls are a bit stiff and they get quite frustrating especially during some platform sections. There are a lot of moves but you'll rarely use them especially with bosses since you have a small window to attack them not large enough to perform any other move than a handful of power slaps with your ""whip"". All the aerial moves are almost useless since you can't dodge in the air and you get hit easily.Lots of quick time events, in some case miss one and game over, in the majority of bosses miss one, the boss regains life, start pouding it again.Backtracking that forces you to complete a level again if you missed a gem or a weapon upgrade, plus some of the upgrades can't be acquired before getting a  power up at the end of the 8th chaper (12 total).Plot isn't that great either and the ending is quite lame, the final boss in the dlc is one of the cheapest and most frustrating bosses I've ever encountered.I just didn't enjoy it, kudos to the vampire killer easter egg in the music box level.

												This game legitimately bored me to sleep twice. Even when I went back with god mode, infinite magic, and the ability to breeze through for Patrick Stewart: Spirit of Death and the game's insane plot, it put me to sleep.Play the sequel. Maybe play the mid-quel (that one's iffy but not dull). But holy god, skip this.			"

												I tried to love this game, I really did. As an old school Castlevania fan I approached this as any other Castlevania game, but boy was I about to be surprised. This has nothing going for it, the story is meh at best, but Castlevania games were always played for the excellent gameplay mechanics and tight controls with an often hard yet fair difficulty.This game has none of that! The controls are sluggish and often unresponsive, the level design is chaotic with secret items and upgrades often obscured  and very frustrating to uncover naturally, and on top of that they managed to put in some of the worst and failed QTE mechanics which completely feel forced and devoid of any skill. Timing is also random at times so you can fail these repeatedly which leads to even more frustration since the main bosses all have some sort of QTE element to them. I used an XBOX 360 controller and it still felt completely off and unprecise!To summarize this is a far cry from the Castlevania of old, it is riddled with bad game design decisions and frustratingly sluggish and unintuitive control mechanics making it a chore rather than a fun experience. Overall it is not worth the time or effort, modern day KONAMI has lost all its touch with its classic franchises and is spiraling into oblivion, and this game is a perfect example of just that. When you have to force yourself to play a game, you know it’s bad and that is exactly how I felt about this game which I soon am going to remove from my account as I doubt I would ever want to endure the horror that is the QTE unresponsive controlled boss battle failure that this game brings to the table.Goodnight sweet prince of darkness…			"

												This is coming from the perspective of someone who enjoys the gameplay of the side scrolling NES/SNES/Playstation/GBA/DS Castlevania games.It's a fun Devil May Cry like game, but I was hoping for more of the classic platforming to be built in somehow. There were a few levels that had really fun platforming in 3D, but most the game was walking from point A to point B, random beat 'em up/hack 'n slash parts, and a couple of alright bosses that were just slash, dodge, slash, dodge, heal, dodge, win. There's also a lack of need for sub-weapons. There are daggers and holy water, along with fairies and some ""kill everything in sight"" gem, but there's no need to use any of them except in a few puzzles. If you enjoy games like Devil May Cry, then by all means buy this game, it's just not for someone who was hoping for a classic Castlevania experience in 3D.			"

												Castlevania Lords Of Shadow had a strong start with its beautiful graphics, tight controls and combat, massive bosses and the illusion of playing in open levels (and in a way, they are open). But after about 6 acts (6-7 hours into the game I think) it starts to become tiresome, because, except for some small puzzle solving, you'll be slaying hordes of enemies, God Of War style. And even the graphics, combat and impressive boss fights aren't enough to help this game then. By then you're about halfway through the game (it will take about 18 hours to complete if I had to take a guess) and you basically have been doing the same thing over and over again. And, unlike many other games that keep you occupied in a fun way to hide this fact, Lords Of Shadow just rubs it in your face. Playing this game feels like a chore and that's not what a game should be about. Now, I do have to say that Lords Of Shadow 2 looks truly impressive and I hope it will improve upon many of the flaws this game introduces. One I'm looking forward to is the fact that it's set in the modern world and another one is that it's all set in a big open world.If you want to understand the story, play this one first. Otherwise, just wait for the LoS2 reviews before deciding what to do with your money.[Rating: 68/100]			"

												Played 5 hours and I'd say this game is quite like Darksiders. Pretty much the same combat style and if you enjoy Devil May Cry, you may probably love this one too.But in my opinion Darksiders (both 1 and 2) are better. I quite like this game at the beginning but soon got bored. First of all the loading chapter/episode makes the whole story isolated, I dislike the re-introducing of story every 30 mintes it's frustrating but I guess this is the way the story develops, since it does not have many CG tells you what's going on. Secondly the camera needs to be fixed. I have difficulty all the time finding necessary stuffs simply because within the fixed angel of camera, there is no way to see around clearly, so I ended up wandering just to find some dead body and wasted so many times- I mean where are the fun???But there's also merits of the game. The graphic is good scenes are beautiful, and considering my process I would say this game could last 15+ hours for the main story which is good. You can actually mount your enemy and make use of them. The lycan helps you smash giant rocks and spiders help you make a net like build up a  bridge. Boss combat is tight regardless hints should be given. This game could have been a lot better.Well I would give this game a 6/10. worth a try, buy only for a discount price.			"

												Queue the cool music, stair walking and vampire whipping; this is Castlevania. Except that it is not. Not. One. Bit. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is the first 3D foray of the series in a long time and considering its track record in the third dimension you'd expect Konami to have learned their lesson. So they delegated the task to a Spanish studio called Mercury Steam. They produced a meaty and decent action game, but not a Castlevania game. Castlevania has a considerable pedigree when it comes to control, gameplay, action and pacing. You're a brutal vampire hunter out to slay the evil Dracula and his minions. You'd have to find your own way, overcomes dozens of different foes and occasionally master more than one character. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow has none of that. The game is strictly linear, the enemies are monotomous and sometimes overly cheap, and you're generally limited to just your one guy: Gabriel Belmont. Gabriel is sent to save the world from entropy after the heads of your order messed up their retirement plan and now the world is going to hell. The plot and the characters are oddly similar to Darksiders 2, a game in itself that borrows heavily from other games. Castlevania's combat is borrowed largely from God of War and the platforming was taken straight from God of War as well with additional slowdown and tediousness. Gabriel controls like a tank and climbing along walls takes an eternity. And this game contains a lot of climbing. Adding everything up amounts to a very slow and cumbersome experience that is a carefully distilled insult to the pedigree of Castlevania. That is after you get through the tutorial, that insits on getting in your face at every blasted second. When you're finally let go, the game still posts prompts to let you know you're going the wrong or that you can do something here. It is just a beltsander that grinds away any sense of accomplishment you might have gotten. Everything about the game is just sluggish. Besides the movement, the story telling is ham-fisted and the voice acting if off key. Even the great Patrick Steward couldn't absolve this charade. It becomes downright painful when the game keeps sending you through maze after climb after puzzle just to keep you busy. At this point Kratos would have lost all his motivation, let alone Simon Belmont; who would have just turned around left when he saw that the eponymous castle doesn't appear until two-thirds in. Add to this a whole load of ripped-off content directly from Shadow of the Colossus and so many quickltime events it would make the guys at TellTale Games rethink their design. All in all, I cannot in good conscience reccomend this game. It is terribly paced and the gameplay is slow and boring. The music is hardly inspiring to keep playing and the overall design is almost insulting to the player. It doesn't remotely do the name of Castlevania justice.			"

												Performance-wise, it beautifully at native HD resolution on my non-gaming laptop. As far as ports goes, that's amazing. However, it is unplayable without a controller. There is a widely reported input buffer/queue which is horrendous. Doubly so if you have any sort of multilingual environment set up as somehow it wreaks utter havoc with Windows IME (I really cannot figure out what it's mapping things to to cause such issues).I neither recommend nor recommend against this game.

												Tries to embrace Castlevania's aestheticTries to hold God of War's combat Tries to wear Prince of Persia's platforming bootsThe game itself is fine enough, but it tries to be all of these things and comes up sort of short. Combat is JUST stiff enough to where you feel like you're constantly getting swatted out of moves, ESPECIALLY in mid air. The inability to control the camera exacerbates platforming and combat issues.Story is all over the place and nonsensical near the end, ESPECIALLY in the DLC. ♥♥♥♥ the DLC. ♥♥♥♥ every aspect of the DLC. It's awful.♥♥♥♥♥♥levels,♥♥♥♥♥♥puzzles,♥♥♥♥♥♥""stealth sequences"", ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bosses.Forgettable music, forgettable cast, forgettable environments, boring boss battles that consist of spamming one combo, dodging, then doing a QTE. It banks hard on being a re-envisioning of Castlevania lore and almost, almost looks like it's going to pull it off, then just drops every ball spectacularly towards the end.If this game wasn't named ""Castlevania"", it might get a pass, but the fact of the matter is, you just expect more from the name.Pass on this unless you're really hard up for an action game and really crave another look at  aCastlevania mythos that has absolutely nothing to do with the main series' storyline.

												Of all the games i have bought on steam this is in the top 5 for worst waste of money. I bought it on sale but even sale price is too much for it. First off by all accounts it looked really good, big name voice actors, good graphics and lots of action.This game is about a year old but it plays and feels like a much older game. It has lifted elements of games like God of war, Shadow of the colossus and Tomb raider but in the end it falls flat on its face trying to be all at once.The gameplay is simple button bash car on rails, nothing new or exciting. The weapons feel underpowered and the mix of extra moves and magic are way too fussy imo. The fact that you cant control the camera is by far the biggest flaw with this game. Take into account that all the hidden stuff is always out of direct view and you cant use the camera to look for it. It gets real old real fast, it also makes the combat a joke as the camera auto corrects to fixed points as your trying to fight.All in all this game is a mix and match of old dated game dynamics that should be left in the past. I can't recommend this game to anyone at any price.			"

They're banking on you replaying the same levels over and over.Why when you select ""restart from checkpoint"" and it asks ""are you sure?"" does it default to 'no'?Why is it such a pain to skip cutscenes when that's all you'll be doing?Don't waste your time.

												TL, DR; This isn't Castlevania, it's Final Fantasy 13 with a Castlevania paintjob.So, where to begin.  Pros?Decent voice acting.  Belmont was nice to listen to, and Patrick Stewart did a passable job.  The graphics are pretty enough, if you care about that sort of thing.  The sheer number of combat options even early was daunting, but sure to be a bonus for them that like it.  The storyline seemed like it was going to be interesting.  Really, this game would have been a great visual novel.Sadly, that's about it.  None of the pros were exquisite or amazing, not enough to keep me slogging through.  Cons.  Good lord, the hand holding.  I've never felt so babied since I was an actual literal child.  I kept waiting for the game to just fire my controller out of the jack and start playing itself.  The tooltips and popups are just so eager to help out that they seriously overstay their welcome.Combat.  It falls into a category I really hate, which is 'fluid-ish'.  Sure you've got a bevy of crazy combat moves, but you're never going to have any time to pull any of the cool stuff off before you get your lights punched out.  Dodging was pretty useful, but blocking meant stopping everything and standing totally still or Belmont wouldn't actually block until after you got socked in the jaw.  You can't make a combo heavy game and then make all the cool stuff either take forever to pull off or tie it into standing still for a bit.While I'm on combat, does every boss have to be a big set-piece half-battle half-puzzle thing?  I've got a bag of cool tricks but when it comes time to beat down something awesome it's all climbing and button mashing?  Related to that, quick time events?  Why bother?  Just show me a video of me doing something awesome, because I can tell you, the third time I have to repeat a boss fight because I missed a click is decidedly not awesome.  You clearly want to be a movie, so just go ahead and be a movie.  This game is linear.  Crazy linear.  The only reason to go off the beaten path is to find the gem or item hidden 3 steps down that path.  This is supposed to be Castlevania, I should be able to run around and explore willy nilly.  This game didn't even look explore up in the dictionary before running roughshod over its corpse.  I appreciate the desire to implement the ""Go back to old areas to find power ups"" thing, because that's totally Castlevania.  The wrong way to do that would be to chop every area up into its own chapter, forcing you to pick and choose which chapter you want to repeat in the hopes you finally have the powerset needed to access the items you missed (and know you missed because the game helpfully tells you everything you missed in every chapter).  Returning to an area should be a choice, and should feel organic.  I should be back there because being back there makes sense, not because I'm gruellingly farming powerups.Post level trials.  I get it, trials are nice.  But hey, if I complete the trial the first time through the level, credit me?  Repeating a level just to do the exact same thing I literally just did is stupid.  There's probably more, but at this point I'm just beating a dead horse.  This game needed to be more like Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver and less like Final Fantasy ♥♥♥♥ing 13. "

												TL;DR : Do I recommend this game or not? Well, both. I'll keep it at No though, simply because it didn't encourage me to play the sequel. This is the problematic part with Steam Reviews (or yes/no opinions of a medium in general). 5/10 - a God of War wannabe that's unnecessarily stretched out, has shallow gameplay and leaves with one question: What?Let's be honest. It's a slasher (or at least how I call those games), God of War/Devil May Cry type of game. Story doesn't matter, it's all about putting great combos, keeping the score high and taking no damage by doing flashy plays. The problem with it it only does one half of it well - the player mechanics - and it doesn't do it perfectly neither. The base attacks feel smooth, very similar to those of God of War. What it did better, was having more combos that are actually usefull in anyway. What it didn't do good enough, compared to let's say latest Devil May Cry, was combos.Wait what?The problem with this combo system is that you use them just for the sake of using them. Thank lord they work and are effective, in contrary to GoW where you just keep mashing SQUARE because everything else sucks, but those combos are still seperate entities - you can't combine them together to create, if you are good enough, an infinite chain of different attacks fitting the opponent you're facing to prevent any damage from being taken while devastating everyone around. Here you perform one combo, have it's effect, proceed to the other one, have a different effect. No connection or transition at all. It's not bad, but it's far from perfect. It can be fun, but it could be much more fun.So that's OK-ish. There are some good parts of the gameplay. I was honestly impressed by the quality of animations. They were very detailed and smooth. Also all the supernatural monsters felt very natural, so that's a big plus. This was even better in the cutscenes - big shoutout to their animation/cinematic team, great job. Also, some of the fights felt reeeeeaaaaly epic. There is a couple of fights with enourmous enemies, that even though are one big quick time events, felt glorious and epic.Going back to combat though - the second part it, that's unfortunately the bad part, are opponents (except of the giants mentioned before). They are shallow and annoying and most of them is just a filler. They have very little depth, to most counterplay is the same, there is nothing that you would not expect. It goes sadly for both generic mobs and bosses - let's say one of the major bosses could be simplified to counter > 3 attacks > counter > 3 attacks > dodge > 3 attacks. Repeat n times. There were also generic monsters introduced in the final, let's say hub, of the game, that were just walking in your direction just to be mowed with area attacks. They did NOTHING. Very disappointing.There's one more thing that absolutely NEEDS to be mentioned, when talking about Castlevania's gameplay - static camera. This is one of those games where camera has a fixed angle and sometimes slightly follow player's movement. Why on earth someone ever though that was a good idea?! And why on earth someone executed this so badly?! In this game, there were multiple round arenas, with camera placed at the ""bottom"" part of it and following player's movement upward. That means, that if you are pushed, or just manouver to the furthest part of it, YOU CAN'T SEE♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is extremely frustrating. It also doesn't help that transition from one camera placement to the other is always confusing - do I keep the same direction on the stick for my character to move forward, or do I change it? Why the ♥♥♥♥ does it change when I'm enterring a narrow ledge and need to be precise with my movement? There were also locations, that were split into seperate paths creating a loop. You could choose if you want to go left or right. Both paths were meeting at their end, but also you needed to cover them both, overall, to let's say gather both keys. That often led to a situation where you follow one path comfortably just to cover the other by RUNNING INTO THE CAMERA, NOT SEEING ANYTHING IN FRONT OF THE CHARACTER. WHAT. THE. HELL. Many times camera was the reason I was about to quit the game. It's THAT bad.There's also another part of gameplay, that's simply insignificant - the exploration/climbing parts. Basically, it's just a way to prolong the game and show you some views. I'm not going to talk about it much since there's nothing to talk about - it cannot be failed, there's nothing creative about it, it just is. One thing I'm going to say is that it's very inconsistent which can be frustrating - there are some ledges that you can jump over, and there are some that you can't. So you can sometimes create a shortcut and jump to the lower level of the location, but sometimes you can't. Similarly you sometimes cannot fall into abyss, because an invisible wall protects you, but sometimes you can.But what is the game actually about, what about the world it is in? Well, it does look good. Even after a couple of years, the game looks pretty good (in 2K and max settings) for it's age. It also runs well - I had no technical issues and kept stable 144FPS, without a single drop (not counting prerendered videos). The story, however... I don't know. Is it even there? One could say it's missing such key elements, that it cannot be called a story. There's no introduction to the lore, to the protagonist, what the mission is, there's no conclusion neither. You are thrown into an arena for some riddiculus reason that you do not fully understand and you are told: ""Kill monsters! There are also some Lords of Shadows, somewhere."". The main character is as much developed as a plank in a fence and carries just as much emotions. It's actually funny that they tried to develop Gabriel (that's his name) during LOADING SCREEN TEXT. So you find out that your character is troubled, or mad, or depressed, by listening to some dude reading loading screen fluff, not by the character's actions, expression or speech. Very poor, totally not bought. The story also concludes (no spoilers, don't worry) in an absolutely riddiculus way. The ""twist"" that's at the end is completely absurd even though it was teased, and it's also followed by another ""twist"" right after, during the same cutscene, that's even worse. At that point you basically lose all hope and play the game to be over with it. Doesn't matter what my motivations are, I'll just kill the dude and hope that's it. But wait! It's NOT! I'm not going to say what's happening, but if you play this game, and if by the final boss you think the story cannot get any worse, you are wrong my friend. "

												This is by all means a decent game. However I felt that this game was a disappointment to the Castlevania franchise. The storyline and combat are decent but nothing remarkable, and the level of satisfaction I get do not compensate for completely rebooting the franchise			"

												Warning:This could have been an excellent game if you like God of War like action adventures. I really loved the graphics, the gameplay and the overall atmosphere. But oh god, this is a f!?%§$? bad, annoying console port.  I get slightly agitated everytime I am told to press X,B,Y or whatever consolebutton I do not have on my keyboard. Sure you can remap buttons, but some explanations are so sloppy and simply lack the descriptions what buttons are needed to move something or switch between objects. The jump-parts can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥too with a keyboard. The damn fu§$?!"" circle movements (Stone giant anyone, or the eggs who need to be thrown back?) are so upsetting i stopped to play the game the first time i had to do it over and over and over and over again, just until I figured out in what pace you need to w,a,s,d,w.The additional chapters for the ultimate edition are a sad joke. The jumping passages need to be memorized for you to be able to complete them and the final boss fight is so bloody ♥♥♥♥ING annoying it motivated me to write this warning review.I can not say I didn't enjoy the game for most of the time, but it leaves such a sour taste  I wouldn't play it again if I knew what was coming for me. It's like Dark Souls 1 without the dsfix.Better check out the new dmc, that's a pc-port done right.			"

												Probably one of the biggest jokes I've seen for a PC purchase. First, if you play on the PC, don't bother. The controls are terrible. For example, you move with WSAD but you jump with K. No joke. There doesn't seem to be a way to rebind either. However, if you happen to have a controller, then you'll have an easier time. The problem though is that it takes about 2-3 seconds for your controller's action to actually carry over into the game. Want to move right? You hit on the right direction, and 2-3 seconds later it actually happens in game. Absolutely avoid this game like the plague if you're on PC. I'm not sure if the input lag also exists on consoles.

												Crashes, back-to-desktop bug, ... This game tried to kill my computer.- Catastrophic camera angles that don't even show you the whole combat arena. Sometimes it changes in the middle of a move.- Everything is oddly placed in this game, like the health-restoring device, never where you would logically need them.- Movements are so imprecise that you will fall to your death sooooooooooo many times.- Long combos are almost impossible to perform since the most basic enemy can break them. And don't count on your melee attack, it doesn't do s***.- Too many useless combos.- Invisible walls everywhere.- Forces you to play some levels several times to unlock items.It still has many good sides:+ long+ challenging+ beautiful and original backgrounds+ great voice acting+ captivating story+ clever and logical puzzlesAnd for a perfect unplayable experience, don't forget to use a Logitech F710 wireless gamepad that has frequent connection losses, just 2 feet from the receiver.

												Take everything good and fun about Castlevania.Now throw it away, implement a clunky control scheme and a cliché filled storyline with bland and boring characters and the story progression of a Michael Bay movie. That summarizes Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. I thought I was beginning to like the game, but then the game decided to throw in a Shadow of the Colossus meets God of War style boss fight against an Ice Giant. Which is extremely clunky, even with a controller. Every few minutes, between button smashing(you get to mash two different buttons! NEXT GEN!), the Ice Giant will swipe you off, causing you to lose a chunk of your health.Also, there's no way to actually recharge your health during boss fights. Or during the gameplay, for that matter. Or between levels. That means if you screw up, you could permanently lose the game. There are no turkeys, no potions, nothing except some very scarce wells. These wells conveniently only appear in the easiest, puzzle filled parts of the game and not when you bloody well need them.			"

												Scrolling through the reviews, it appears to be the case that many people who pick this game up rapidly drop it.I am one of those people.As I understand it, the standard game (i.e. without DLC) has 12 chapters. I forced myself through the first of those, started in on the second and decided that the game was not worth my time. What I experienced in the first chapter was the laziest possible recapitulation of a Hideki Kamiya-style brawler, complete with boss/level designs cribbed at total random from classic, non-Castlevania adventure/beat-em-up games. In terms of plot, the whole leaky boat is held together by a slap-happy, Epic Fantasy Mad Libs of one-dimensional characters, plowing through an plot that, even for a franchise game, makes the word ""idiotic"" seem either charitable or grossly insufficient, depending on how much warmed-over Judeo-Christian fan fiction is being forced through the pipe at the time.The first bits of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow's second chapter promised no major changes to that formula, so I decided to walk away. A number of other Steam reviewers point that out as a common mistake and, acknowledging the possibility that I may have made that common mistake (i.e. that there may, in fact, be a great game hidden somewhere deep within in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow), I feel perfectly comfortable walking away after only a few wasted hours, based on the first chapter.(Also, as a bit of a post-script, I will say that if you're a Castlevania fan, you already know this, but I feel compelled to write it here anyway: the damage that Koji Igarashi did to this once-great 8-bit/16-bit franchise over however-many successive generations of his erotic kawaii ""Metroid-vania"" drop farming games will obviously take generations to be undone, as the corporate rights-holders struggle to unravel the mystery of why the franchise no longer performs as it once did. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow does not, unfortunately, seem to take any meaningful steps in that direction.)			"

												The only really interesting thing about this game is the art design. The story is bland and unoriginal, except for a few interesting concepts, which despite beign rather promising, are newer truly given a real look at during the story. Most of the personalities of the characters feel like they were added into the game at the very last minute.The gameplay is ""ok"" in and of it itself, just rather unoriginal and repetitive. The thing that ruins the gameplay for me though, is the cinematic camera. All of the camera angles are design to be good looking, rather than to provide the best possible point of view for gameplay. The problem with this is that very often enemies will be off screen, where you can't see them, and then suddenly attack at you, without giving the player a proper chance to react. Also a lot of the enemies often sorta gang up on you, and will just knock you to the ground and hit you again, before you can get up and do anything. Stuff like this just makes the game feel tedious and cheap.As I mentioned in the beginnig, the art design is really good and the game looks beatifull in a lot of scenes, but in my opinnion, no amount of pleasing aesthetics can salvage  badly designed gameplay.Also inorder to look at the concept art for the game, you have to collect experience points to buy them. This is acceptable in itself, but if you buy the art once it doesn't seem to stay accessable, meaning that you are going to have to buy it again. I'm only mentioning this, because in my oppinion the art was the best part of the game, so why not just let me enjoy it without the hassle?Oh, I would also like to mention that this game makes a ""hilarious"" reference to the 'the cake is lie' meme, even though there is nothing in that specific scene that would be in any way related to cakes or portals. Just let that sink in...			"

												Pretty misleading title. It's a hack and slash that wants to be like Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden. Not only that, it does a better job of being Pan's Labyrinth meets God of War/Prince of Persia rather than having much to do with Castlevania. The goblins and werewolves are the most generic looking I've seen in a while, and while some of the art/cinematography look really nice, the combat/bosses/environmental interaction/orchestral soundtrack are all so textbook and ""been there; done that"". It's barely anything like the Retrovanias pre-1997, and it's barely anything like the Metroidvanias from SotN onwards. It's definitely more like the 3D Castlevanias on N64 and PS2, and is basically as good as Lament of Innocence, except that game at least had Yamane as the composer.			"

												I had serious high hopes for this game, given how much of a fan I've been of the castlevania series. They've generally had a perfect blend of skill, action and adventure elements. This game, however, completely tosses any semblence of balance out of the window in favour of going all-out action. Whcih isn't a bad thing as long as you get the action part down right. Which they didn't. The enemies are solely designed to be annoying little obstacles (And annoying they can be) in your path and the bosses are designed purely to frustrate. The witch in the tower and her little bird minions has got to be the single most infuriating section of gaming I've ever played. Little niggles like this don't make games fun to play, they make them annoying! Generally the only way you'll get hurt is through your combos and given the heavy emphasis the combat style places on them it bascially re-inforces a major flaw in the game and rams it down your throat every single battle. One of the things this game runs heavily for too is a sense of epic scale; huge bosses, vast worlds and the like. Unfortunately you won't be seeing any of them thanks to the camera angles which seem placed in such a way so as to obscure as much as possible of what it is you're focused on.So much of this game could have been brilliant and with it's pedigree it was a game that was actually harder to screw up than to get right. But they managed it. And then some. It's rare for a game to make me, not only rage-quit it but to rage-uninstall the damn thing. If your absolutely hell-bent on punishing yourself (or another) than please wait until a steam sale and pick this crap up for less than pocket change, other than that, I can't recommend you avoid this derivative, flashy, hollow trash enough......

												It isn't a terrible game it just isn't really good either. It has a mildly interesting story told by Patrick Stewart, which is neat and the combat is fun (seems to be directly stolen from Devil May Cry, or at best 'inspired' by God of War). What's the problem then? For starters? Fixed camera angles... That was pretty much abolished from video games about a decade ago due to it being the worst possible control scheme but Castlevania has seen fit to bring it back. Second, repetitive. Combat is fun... The first 50x times you do it, but you have done it 200x by about 4 hours into the game and it has lost all of it's luster. Also, it is insultingly easy, even on the hardest settings. I am not the kind of guy to complain about stuff being too easy, usually. I think if it is fun, it doesn't matter. This is so easy, it loses fun factor. Also, it is very linear. Finally, too much 'story', not enough gameplay. Every level is short and has 10x cutscenes in it, then we listen to Picard narate for another 3-5 mins before the next level. If the story was compelling enough that wouldn't matter, but it isn't a hollywood movie in story quality so they could have made up for that in gameplay or involving the player in the story more. I should add that this really isn't designed for people who are big fans of old school Castlevania games. Not even sure why they bothered to call it that. It is a generic demon slaughter action game where they name stuff related to Castlevania, if the main char's last name wasn't Belmont, no one would have noticed. Also, it being designed in short levels rather then one sprawling map feels very not-Castlevania. Pretty mild critism though.Again, the game isn't terrible. I might give it a 7/10, if I was feeling generous. If it was free to play it would be like a 9/10, but as for spending money... I wouldn't bother spending money on it unless you really have nothing else to play and don't care about the cost.			"

												I'm not terribly far into this game, and while certain aspects of the scenery and sound are exeptional, the gameplay, even with a controller, which I purchased specifically to enjoy this title in a well beloved series, is proving to be both tedious and frustrating.  At the moment, I would best describe the gameplay as a combination of linear railroading and pixel-♥♥♥♥♥ing.  The game feels the obligation to prompt the player with tips and instructions frequently, such as pressing or holding the right trigger button to activate what I would call ""interactive story element manipulation"", and then leaves you hanging in almost, but not all, situations without either informing you what to do once you've hit or held the right trigger, or even so much as telling you there is something else you are supposed to be doing. If this was consistent, it may not have been an issue.  It could be assumed that such an action was the execution of a new element of interaction or gameplay.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Just often enough to make sure that you have hopes of it each time, the game will give you another instruction on how to proceed.  This leaves you waiting each time there is a new form of interaction for an instruction just long enough that in each of the 85% of cases where there is no further instruction coming to punish you severely for your inaction.If there was  a return policy on steam for games with limited time committed to them, then I would return it this moment, but as such is not the case, I am still not sure that I will continue playing this game in the future.  A shame, for a series with such a great pedagree and an amazing voice cast to leave me disappointed and frustrated after playing.			"

												First off, for fans of old-school Castlevania, this is going to be unexpected and not like what you're used to, but it's well worth a try. Granted, there's less allowance for exploration and much more focus on combat and action, but if you're a fan of God of War, then this is THE game for you. There's about 40-55 hours of gameplay on the first run of the game, depending on how pedantic you are about finding all the collectibles that can possibly be found on your  first  run of the game, and yes, this means a MINIMUM of two runs if you want to achieve full completion of any of the levels, given that upgrading your Combat Cross allows you to access new areas of old levels, each level's 'trial' is only unlocked after you beat the level after the first time and the highest difficulty mode is only accessible after you beat the game.Buuuuuuut to save myself the trouble of writing a full spoiler-free review in paragraph form and to save readers the trouble of reading a full review in paragraph form, here you go: TL;DR Pros:  Beautiful graphics and artwork Varied combat style, plenty of combos to learn (have fun trying to remember them all and accidentally using the wrong one because you pressed a random button one too many times). You can mash buttons if you want but the game actively encourages you to vary your attacks and combo use, and even if you button mash, the light and shadow magic systems add a nice new layer to the combat anyway Twists in the story (some were, imo, obvious but some weren't, and those that weren't are the ones I'm focusing on here) Level design was generally really complex and engaging Character development is highly interesting and there will be feels Large variety of enemies to always keep you on your toes 110% completion rate available and plenty of collectible items and things to do to entertain completionists and perfectionists for hours (minimum of two runs to get 110% completion on the game, people!) Puzzles are actually challenging if you're trying to complete the trials ('solve this puzzle in a certain number of moves' type stuff) The controls were easy and logical (on an Xbox 360 controller anyway) and my inner neat freak (who doesn't mainfest externally very often) was pleased TL;DR Cons:  If you're not a completionist, then you'll be missing a lot of  weapon upgrades, areas that weren't previously accessible before, trials and so on if you don't go back to replay levels, and most non-completionists I know aren't big on replaying levels they've already beaten Quite a few of the bosses in this game are heavily inspired by other games' bosses, so don't expect the most original boss fights. Additionally, some of them were very repetitive, though some I found very entertaining, albeit difficult The fixed camera angles were annoying and I personally hated that Some of the trials in this game are SMEGGING IMPOSSIBLE. Hell, even some of the levels in this game were damn near impossible, especially on higher difficulty levels I've heard that this game is very finnicky if you try to use keyboard and mouse controls. I haven't experienced that personally but I'm not willing to risk it :PThat's all I can think of right now, but I highly recommend you try this game. The price isn't ridiculous for how much you get out of it if you choose to play all the way through, and it's brilliant monster-slaying fun.			"

												Is not a bad game, the camera sometimes don't help at all, QTEs everywhere, the creepy guy narrating your progress in the loading screen can make you very uncomfortable, the game sometimes feel like it have unnecessary parts just for the sake of be longer, and the extra steps you need to do to skip a scene after die is very annoying (I was playing in hard and maybe that ruined the game for me). I'm a big castlevania fan from the nes times so the story was really nice until the very end, after that everything goes downhill. LIke I said before, is not a bad game, you can enjoy it if you play it in normal or easy to have some fun, the big enemies and boss fights scenes are very nice, the combat system is not so bad (the skills set can look overwhelming) some simple puzzles add variety and there is a simple extra minigame. If you want something to play for 3-4 days (maybe more if you want to get the 110%) with a nice medieval-fantasy story full of lycans, vampyrs and holy super powers you will like this game.			"

												I don't know why this game has become so popular, maybe the reason is because it comes from a spanish studio and here in Spain it makes us proud of that, but the truth is that it doesn't deserve being so highly rated. Don't get me wrong, it is not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, but neither a great one.Things like invisible walls, no control of the camera at all and big difference between characters' modelings make this game a ""could be but is not"". In my opinion, DmC is much better than this one... I haven't finished this CLoS yet, so maybe I change my mind in the future, but for the moment I am not going to recommend it.			"

												Konami, when you make a franchise, stick with the mood, because that's what players liked in the first place, and trying to change what was good instead of simply making a new franchise was a risky and thoughtless move. The gameplay itself is unintuitive, and feels like a slower, less fluid version of every other GOW clone. The bland enemies' untelegraphed attacks with the emotionless character's clunky and delayed blocking and evading was frustrating. Quit after about 10 hours trying to like this series.			"

												I'm not terribly far into this game, and while certain aspects of the scenery and sound are exeptional, the gameplay, even with a controller, which I purchased specifically to enjoy this title in a well beloved series, is proving to be both tedious and frustrating.  At the moment, I would best describe the gameplay as a combination of linear railroading and pixel-♥♥♥♥♥ing.  The game feels the obligation to prompt the player with tips and instructions frequently, such as pressing or holding the right trigger button to activate what I would call ""interactive story element manipulation"", and then leaves you hanging in almost, but not all, situations without either informing you what to do once you've hit or held the right trigger, or even so much as telling you there is something else you are supposed to be doing. If this was consistent, it may not have been an issue.  It could be assumed that such an action was the execution of a new element of interaction or gameplay.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Just often enough to make sure that you have hopes of it each time, the game will give you another instruction on how to proceed.  This leaves you waiting each time there is a new form of interaction for an instruction just long enough that in each of the 85% of cases where there is no further instruction coming to punish you severely for your inaction.If there was  a return policy on steam for games with limited time committed to them, then I would return it this moment, but as such is not the case, I am still not sure that I will continue playing this game in the future.  A shame, for a series with such a great pedagree and an amazing voice cast to leave me disappointed and frustrated after playing.			"

												Beutifull visuals, good story and music aside this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The keyboard controls are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - the commands queue up, the keyboard is basically not usable for any serious fighting. Unless you have a jedi sense of the future or know the timings and sequences of all enemies by hart. The joystic controls are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - it only supports Xbox controller, so for anything else you must use emulator like x360ce. The combat logic is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - many big enemies have a ground hitting area attack that for some reason produces a health damaging shockwawe. I often found myself boxed in some small area with a ground hitter, and the combat was 50% avoid the shockwave, 30% avoid other heavy attacks and 10% do something usefull. The boss fights are irritating - you must constanly climb something and guess which key should be pressed to jump onto the next part of the boss or from where should you jump to reach it. All while the boss swats you down just to start the whole boring climb sequence anew. Add to that a forced perspective that often leaves you guessing where are you actually running or what wall or stone you are stuck at and boss fights become really anoying. Generally this game is an exercise in irritation - you see beutifull environments, great music, interesting story and you want to see what is next but the annoying combat mechanics just will not allow you to. Unless you are ready to invest a heap of time memorising boss climb sequences and timings of enemy attack algorithms.			"

												This isn't a Castlevania game.Originally posted by SpaceCowboy:As I long time fan of the Castlevania series, I was exstatic to see it come to PC! However, much to my disappointment I found this game lacking and I would not recommend it. Stubbornly, I finished the game.The good? Great voice acting, extremely beautiful environments, good music, and a fair story.The bad? Well, everything else. My number one gripe is the fixed camera. As you navigate through the levels, the camera arbitarily positions itself. You have no control over it whatsoever. As a result exploring the levels, or pitching the camera to get an ideal vantage point for battle or movement is completely prohibited. The game almost feels like 2.5D.There is none of the exploration or freedom you feel in games like Symphony of the Night. Levels are extremely linear. They are no alternate routes, like Dishonored, and there are ton of invisible walls.Combat is a mixed bag. I used my Xbox 360 controller, which I don't mind at all. Sometimes combat is fun, but there's a lot to control towards the middle-end game. Double tap an analog controller to sprint?!? Crazy bad game design there.There's also a ton of quick time events, a la the action is paused and you have to hit a button at a precious moment. Really takes you out of the action.I guess I was hoping for something between Dark Souls and Darksiders, but this game was far too restrictive in the controls for my tastes. I'd rate it a 5/10, and highly suggest people try the demo before buying! "

												I can’t say I ever got into the original platforming Castlevania games. I’m told they were a mixed bag, some good, some not so much. With this game they have rebooted it as a hack ‘n slash, one that Yahtzee would probably refer to as a “like God of War but…” game. This should be a great thing; the idea of playing a God of War clone on PC, complete with a higher resolution and frame-rate and the ability to use an Xbox controller would normally have me very excited. If it was of any quality even approaching God of War. The first one. You know, from the PS2 era. In other words, this game is like God of War but God of War was good. Yes, I’m likely to say God of War quite a lot in this review. The comparison is inevitable and when I play a game that is so derivative of a far better game I am very likely going to be thinking about why the other game is better in every way. In other words, you can probably stop reading now and be assured that there are 6 God of War games that are more deserving of your money.I can’t say how the lore compares or even what the story was as I never got that far. There’s something about the gods abandoning mankind, the end of times and the generic trope of a hero’s motivation being to avenge his wife’s death. This is all narrated by a very bored sounding Patrick Stewart who really sounds like he’s just calling it in here, possibly because the story is so boring that even Sir Patrick can’t be arsed putting in any effort.Obviously the most important part of a hack ‘n slash is in gameplay; a game like this lives and dies by how the controlled character feels, moves and fights. In this case Castlevania falls far short of what is expected. Controls are floaty and imprecise so that there is a strong feeling of disconnect between player input and what the character actually does. This makes any movement awkward and unintuitive, with the platforming sections being even more frustrating. This is made worse by a very erratic camera. They’ve gone for the fixed camera setting that randomly changes position every now and again, meaning you often can’t see who’s attacking you. It can also have the effect of arbitrarily switching movement controls around as the camera arbitrarily moves about leading to points where I was entering and exiting an area several times because of these random changes. This is a problem in many similar games and one of my main criticisms of the God of War games, but here it is far worse than anything I’ve experienced.Combat is also a thoroughly unsatisfying chore. You have the standard light, heavy and grab attacks, all using Gabriel’s whip/cross thingy. You can also dodge and, if timed perfectly, the planets are correctly aligned and Polaris is bright at the time, parry certain attacks. Unfortunately the floaty and laggy controls are very obvious here, with commands taking a very perceptible amount of time to register, causing me to take hits where dodges haven’t executed and so on. This resulted in combat being a very unenjoyable event that I just wanted to get over with, something that’s always going to damn a fighting game. A small amount of lag is something that’s inevitable in fast paced combat games but not something I usually notice until playing at a very hard difficulty – for example in God of War I only notice it when doing the “Challenge of the…” maps (which I still managed to complete) or in DmC it didn’t become apparent until I started a Heaven or Hell run (the one where you die in a single hit). Here, it was obvious from the very first fight and by the time I encountered the first boss I just couldn’t take it anymore.Even without the lag, combat is just far too repetitive. Every enemy requires the same tactic and only seem to differ in their aesthetic. A better game would have a large variety of enemies, each requiring a different tactic to beat. The joy and challenge of those games is in finding the right tactics and employing them correctly when you come up against a group of different enemies. Here, I would come up against a group of goblins, a group of werewolves or whatever, usually with one elite character who was essentially the same, only with a higher damage output. The tactic was always a continuous attack, dodge and repeat. It never really mattered which attack you used, it all worked out in exactly the same way and didn’t really require any thought or skill beyond timing your dodges well. Heck, even Deadpool’s combat was more nuanced.Visually the game is quite unimpressive. The art direction is going for a medieval gothic design, that much is clear, but it just feels uninspired and bland. The game does away with the grand areas and designs of similar games, preferring the mundane settings of whatever the artists thought Germany probably looked like a few centuries ago. There’s nothing that really wowed me in any of the level or enemy design and everything feels like it’s been copied from another setting without inspiration. Gabriel’s design itself looks oddly proportioned though I did like the look. It’s just a shame that the character itself is utterly boring and devoid of personality. The graphics themselves are quite poor, with blocky designs, stiff animations and a large amount of artefacting to be found if the game is running in 1080p. It’s a testament to how poor it looks that I was genuinely more impressed with the remastered God of War, a game that came out more than 5 years and an entire console generation earlier.Lords of Shadow is a poorly designed, awfully created game that has no redeeming features. It is creatively bankrupt and tries to copy games that are far better than it. I can honestly say that it’s one of the worst attempts at a hack ‘n slash game that I’ve ever seen, and even then it doesn’t quite cover how bad I think this game is. If it weren’t for the name, I’d have passed it off as another cynical clone made by a small team that sold the kind of crap you see Jim Sterling playing on YouTube so people can laugh about how utterly terrible it is.Final verdict:3/10And it’s only that high because I love Patrick Stewart. Just buy God of War. There are 6 of them and they’re all far better than this. "

												This game sucks...your blood.Good graphics, fantastic gameplay, nice puzzles, incredible voice acting, gripping (and sometimes heartbreaking) storyline.The ONLY criticisms I have are the lack of camera control which made some points more difficult than they needed to be, and secondly the movement controls on a keyboard made the 2nd titan boss very very VERY frustrating (you have to catch an obsticle and throw it back by spinning 360 degrees, with an anolog stick it's very easy...WASD, however, took me several days to THROW A ROCK because I kept getting frustrated and in need of rest). I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this game, it has some brilliant adaptations of old horror tale monsters and its negative points are so overshadowed by how brilliant the game is overall that you'll probably not even notice them (aside from the ""Throwing A Rock"" bit).I recommend the game, but WITH a gamepad.8/10, incredibly brilliant game with only very minor flaws. If you choose not to get a gamepad, the 2nd titan boss will be the only bit you will think ""Impossible!"", just stick at it and remember it's WASDW in that order, don't give up!			"

												As much as I want to get through this game, and as much as I want to see all the environments and experience the large amount of content in here - its a pretty long game - being an action/adventure fan would want to do, Lords of Shadow does not make me want to.  In fact, it puts the player off in almost every category.  The story is totally awful - Patrick Stewart does nothing to make you care about any of these poorly written characters, and the journey of Gabriel should have best been told with a ""less is more"" attitude.  Unfortunately, this would mean that the gameplay could speak for itself, and that would work if it were a given that it was fun to play.  But it simply isn't.  The terrible camera that actively tries to hinder you, anything important or intentionally obfuscate any hidden suprises is one thing, but when it actually DENIES you access to see where you are or where you are going at times is pure frustration.  Yeah, by all means, hide that hidden room with the extra life gem inside.  But when I call your bluff, don't take vengeance on me for crying out loud.The combat seems floaty, imprecise and lathargic response(I hit the dodge button you fool!), the hits lack any sort of weight, the combat flows unnecessarily slowly as you have to whack the same enemies over and over, and it has the audacity to force silly quick time events that have aged the worst of any mechanic in gaming short of the load screen.    While the experience gain and move upgrades are novel none of it really improves your killing prowess, and sometimes opening up the amount of combos you can perform for no other reason that flash is a poor motivator.  The world is broken up into chapters and levels that need to be re-played with future powers to be fully exploited.  While this isn't entirely unwanted, the act of playing them is in no way enjoyable, which could be forgiven if there were a better exploration element to the game.  There have been Action Adventure games that have already solved a lot of these problems, and one only needs look at Darksiders for hugely improved upgrade systems, dungeons, a much more interesting unbroken and seamless world to explore, more interesting enemies, and much more satisfying combat.  You could say Lords of Shadow is a game that does it all - and while that may be true, all the things it does fall flat and are without soul.  Not recommended.			"

												After playing Lamment of Innocence on the PS2 back in the say, this game has really shaped that entire era to a whole new level of hack and slash of Castlevania. Judging by the trailer I given this game the benefit of a doubt to impress me and....it did! Just everything about this game was just spot on for both the graphics, characters, and the story altogether.The narrator, Patrick Stewart, is simply one of the best to choose this role and being the character who helps Gabrielle Belmont on his question to conquor the Lords of Shadow to bring his wife back from the dead from Earth to Hell itself. Let's talk about this for a minute....From what we know of the series, if you ever followed the past games, that Castlevania entirely means that you approach the castle to defeat the same boss as always name Count Dracula. But this time there is just ""a castle"" and the rest is land with one trail to go to (so thankfully no open world) from start to finish. Instead of defeating Count Dracula you have a new arch-enemy to defeat, the almighty skin of evil himself, Satan. Yes, Satan himself is who you have to defeat. Before that you must defeat the Lords of Shadow in order to get to him and retreive something to bring Gabrielle's love back to life.Besides the story the gameplay and graphics really stand out in Konami standards making everything look far more realistic and blending in what the characters represent. Smooth controls for a hack and slash game, fun puzzles, and just seeing the beauty of the scenery is just simply to die for. From being more nature as it gradually becomes grimmer the more you lurk to the later stages  which is both nostalgia and new at the same time. And instead of equipping a whole bunch of equipment like you do in the previous Castlevania games you get enhancements that utilizes throughout the entire game for a better strategy. Just amazing!I highly recommend getting this game, I love it while playing on the Xbox 360 and would give another go on Steam!			"

												Maybe it's because this game is old and just doesn't stand the test of time, but when all my friends threw a fit about me having never played this game I figured it must be pretty good. The visuals are great for its age, but the gameplay is absolutely terrible. The camera is probably the most obnoxious thing about it, however, the controls aren't far behind. Dodging is next to useless, there doesn't seem to be any target locking and the auto aim is pitiful at best. If you played this awhile back and have that nostalgia bug, then I guess this is worth your money. If you haven't played it yet? You missed your shot. Save yourself the frustration.			"

												Let me get this out of the way right now. If you have a 360/PS3/Wii U you're better off buying Bayonetta (2 when its released). It and any game made by Clover Studio/Platinum Games is astronomically better than this.------------------------""It's like if Konami made a Platinum Games game"" is what my friend told and sold me on this. And hoooboy is it a doozy. Sadly, not in a good way. I want to like this game, I really do. But with all the bad choices they made I'm honestly suprised it got a sequel.Story: 6/10You are Gabriel Belmont. Starting point for the♥♥♥♥♥♥hitting the fan with the Belmont family. Demons killed your wife and you set of on a quest to kill the Lords of Shadow to revive your dead waifu. That silly decision pits you against demons, werewolves, vampires, zombies, and Satan himself. Along the way you are aided by Sir Patrick Stewart that narrates your adventure and makes it more awesome than it should be tenfold. (Side note: we need more Patrick Stewart and/or Morgan Freeman in games. Who's with me? :D) After totally not stealing 3 bosses from Shadow of the Collosus and big baddies from Lord of the Rings; it turns out Patrick Stewart was one of the Lords of Shadow that you set out to kill. He kills you. But that's OK. The last thing you heard was Patrick Stewart talking his monologue out loud. Satan then reveals that was his ploy all along and kills Patrick Stewart. You are revived by your waifu and take revenge for Patrick Stewarts voice by beating Satan's smokey♥♥♥♥♥around the yard. Years pass? and you are called to the vampires' castle. Turns out ya dun goofed. The Lords of Shadow were the only things between the world and the♥♥♥♥♥♥train held prisoner down in another realm. To get to that realm, you willingly turn yourself into a vampire and head out to the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t final boss fight I have ever had the displeasure to take part in. You rise victorious as the one. The only. Batman!...errr....Dracula.Graphics: 8/10      -Environment Designs 5/10I felt the need to seperate these two cause while the technical aspect of the graphics are impressive for a game that was originally released in 2010 (Oh lawdy dem god rays QuQ) the environment design is borderline terrible. I felt like they made the environments first, then remembered that they were making a game that needed direction. Up went the invisible walls everywhere except in places that needed it.Gameplay: 4.5/10And here we are at the most important part of any game; the gameplay.Short version: it's passable.Long verion:#1. And pose for the cam!Can we please make it a rule that if your game is in a 3D engine that isn't locked at an isometric viewpoint, the right anolog/mouse movement is for the camera? It's what it was made for, damn it. I had countless times where I was either attacking something off-screen or get clotheslined by an enemy the camera didn't want to let me see. It was more focused on showing me the pretty skybox and architecture.#2. Let us fight man versus tiny baby man.This is it's strong suit. Granted it's not that strong, but it's the best its' got. X and Y are you direct and area attacks, sting them together for different attacks. You know the drill if you've played any of the mentioned games. BUT! What it does have is a really cool mechanic in the Light and Shadow magic. Light heals you with ever attack landed and shadow makes you hit like a brick wall. Woo for rewarding players that learn the system!#3. EVASIVE MANEUVERS!This is where it falls apart. Rather than have a dedicated dodge trigger, they have the dodge and parry on the same button. I have found no use for the parry other than one time in the final boss battle that requires you to parry an attack. I swear the dodge only works when it feels like you appreciate it enough. No air dodge. No, I'm serious. They have rising moves yet no way to get out if things get hairy.#4. Mr.Bones says: ""You're here forever!""Do not come into this thinking it'll be an ~10 hour romp of cuhrayzee vampire killing. This game never ends. Getting close to 20 hours in an I JUST got to the final section of the last chapter. Knowing when to stop is something this game doesn't know.#5. Platforming! CURSES! My one weakness!I know that with the old games you were married to you jump arc, but this is rediculous. You control as gracefully as a whale, you slide as much as Luigi when landing, and when you get the double jump you're essentially shot out of a cannon skywards with an elephant attached to your ankles. In other words: IT'S♥♥♥♥♥♥♥#6. I AM BULLETPROOF!!Enemies rarely get any hitstun. I can understand medium/large-boss enemies, but really? When I'm wailing on something, I don't expect it to smack me out of a combo. The other 10 things in the room, yes. The target for pain, no.#7. One more thing!This game has some of the most padding I have ever seen. Almost every chapter has a simple ""go from point A to B"" aspect. BUT. When you get to B you either need to to go back towards A to get side tracked with a fetch quest to get 3 of something. It's always 3 of something. Adding a good 10-20 minutes to the time running around.Final verdict: 6/10Somewhat Guilty. Court adjourned.			"

Well this is still Castlevania as you know it, just bigger, better and more beautiful. Great story and enjoyable combat system. The game clocks in at around 18 hours DLC's included. Great open ending that makes you want to play Lords of Shadow 2 right now! Definitely recommend playing this game!			"

												I have just recently finished this game, and I must say, I loved it.Castlevania, Lords of Shadow is a reboot of the well known series, and while I never got to play any of the older ones, this reboot helped me get immersed pretty well in the universe.You play as Gabriel Belmont, a young orphan and a skilled warrior of the Brotherhood of Light, an organization dedicated to protecting humans from the evil minions of the night. Gabriel's wife is murdered right before the beginning of the game and Gabriel therefore goes on a quest to slay the three Lords of Shadow and recover their power, that he may revive his beloved wife. All throughout this quest however, Gabriel himself falls deeper and deeper into the darkness...Castlevania: Lords of Shadow features a combo-driven fighting system, that will make many people think fondly of Devil May Cry and God of War. It featues mild exploration and platforming as well as a known Castlevania mechanic which consists of returning to previous areas with new gear to access hidden areas.The graphics are pretty good for a three/four year old game, and it features some immensely terrifying and satisfying enemies. Castlevania is not without its flaws, however. On start-up of the game, the controls are completely ridiculously mapped, and I recommend remapping them first things first. Some of the bosses and quick time events can also prove difficult as the game doesn't quite feel like it was ever properly ported to the pc.Castlevania also features an extremely horrible camera, that is fixed from a certain angle in every area and can make combat and platforming harder than it really should be. This kind of camera however, made me constantly remember the first Devil May Cry game, and therefore served to instill great nostalgia in me, something I really liked.If you like a good RPG with a brilliant battle system and an enthralling story, pick up Castlevania. Be prepared to be frustrated at times by the horrible camera and ocassional strange control decisions regarding boss fights.And hey, if nothing else, play it because Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is coming February 28th and looks to be freaking amazing.

												I tried to play previous Castlevania game on the original Xbox and could not even play for 2 hours.  This game I played for 5 hours every night for a week, losing much sleep, but having so much fun. It has a great sense of style and sense of progression.  The character Gabriel Belmont really builds up to be a strong fighter.  The control is very smooth, each time after you level up and buys new ability, you can develop a new longer combo.  The game encourages you to play earlier chapter to discover more collectible and you can relish in defeating earlier enemy with ease and style.  By the end of the game, when I acquired the Ultimate Light and Shadow Magic, fighting the last boss was easy on Normal difficulty because magic is unlimited and I have maxed out all the stat.  The game always save your experience point so you don’t feel like you wasted time even if you are dead.  This also allows farming for points.  You also don’t feel you need to be stingy with using the items because this is not a survivor game.  Chapter VI, Part III: Castle Hall, when you finish the rune puzzle and it turns night, the vampires do end after a few waves. If you stand and kill all of the vampires, the last one seems to drop a full load of EVERY item (daggers, holy water, faeries, and crystals.  You get about 50 experience points per vampire, and there is a magic fountain there so you can easily use up your item and magic to kill all enemy in just 3 minutes, you can then go to the game menu, “Restart on Last Check Point” and fight them again.  You can get as much experience as you want.  If you can afford to wait though, go to Chapter VI, Part IV: Refectory, the boss Evil Butcher, there is a 30 second QuickTime prompt event before you kill him, and you get 1,000 points for doing that.  You can definitely max on all the skills and relics by doing this.The visual is amazing, there is hand drawn black and white bestiary and storybook like intro in each chapter, and then when you play the game there is the animated cut scene.   There is the QuickTime sequence / prompt event where you have to push the attack button when the circle shrinks down smaller than the indicator circle.   This was very confusing for me at first because I am used to smashing button when the prompt comes up.  In fact, in the first sequence where I ride the horse to escape the goblins I keep getting knocked down.  I also recommend you lose the prompt event sometimes because some of the Gabriel’s death animation is pretty amazing.  This is especially true when you fight Carmilla the Vampire Queen’s true form, Dark lord of the Vampires (BOSS), the animation there is really long and you would never find out if you win at the prompt.  The game has the blatant steal from Shadow of Colossus where you have to climb on a Titan and attach each of the spot on its body, and the Titan will attempt to throw you off.   It is quite exciting. Patrick Stewart of the Star Trek Enterprise / Captain Picard fame is one of the main story character Zobek .  He narrates all the intro level descriptions / stories.  The first time I heard him I was very impressed by his acting and happy that this game has a big budget to hire good actors.On the downside, the game does have some repetitive points, and the DLC which continues from the end of the game, it is very difficult and repetitive even on the normal setting.  In the DLC you help Laura the vampire daughter with The Forgotten big evil boss that is trapped under the castle.  Gabriel chooses actions which leads him to become the man he is in Lords of Darkness 2.  You also see the trailer for the 2nd game if you wait after the game credit ends.  If you just want a fun run through, it will take 20 hours, if you go back and get all the crystal and collectibles and challenges, it will take about 40 hours.   "

												Unfortunately the game did not meet my expectations, which were not that high. I tried the demo a very long time ago, I remembered it being a nice demo. I wanted a game to play the 2 weeks before the release of GTA V, and this seemed like a good nice (and not too long) game.The game began wonderfully. It was even above my expectations. Splendid levels, combo system, and learning curve. Every level you would earn a new powerup or unlock new combos, meet new enemies and new combat strategies.This was almost exactly until mid-game, where the game itself became boring, repetitive, and where you would find the biggest flaws, which IMHO are:- fixed camera not always showing the right angle, making you fall exactly where you should not.- attacks from bigger enemies strike you BEFORE the claw/hand/weapon hits you, making it not difficult but rather frustrating, since the enemy kills you BEFORE you can actually see it movingThe scenery was rather beautiful in general, I am almost at the end but I really can't bother playing the game any further. I am not enjoying it that much anymore, it started as a great substitute for God of War (which we don't have on PC) but it turned out to be a very normal hack n slash with averall good elements but nothing really worth it.Buy it only if it is on offer, and if you really like the genre. The game is long though, much longer than many other games, which unfortunately in the case of Castlevania is not really an advantage....65/100			"

												In this game, you face two tough enemies: Camera and controls. Somebody at Konami thought it would be a good idea to port a boss-fighting trick from controller to keyboard. You're supposed to rotate 360 degrees, which is easily enough done with an analog stick, but sucks with the keyboard. And the camera shows an angle that the designers consider helpful, but you may not. Meaning you run north into a new room, which is shown from another angle, and suddenly running north takes you back out of the room. It gets more frustrating when the camera keeps facing a boss, even though you need to jump and hit a switch on the floor on the other side of the room. The whole setup makes some fights a matter of luck, not skill. Thanks, but we have card games and dice-rolling RPGs for that.Which is a pity, because the rest is good. Nice graphics, great voice acting, a nice enough story of Good vs. Evil, and some battles (normal + bosses) are actually fun. But dreading the next boss fight because of shtty controls/camera doesn't make me want to go forward, it makes me uninstall the game.			"

												Backed by Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima and serving as an origin story, this game sheds new creative light in Castlevania seperating it from the past games in the series. Rather then being like another Metroid type game, this one takes cues from games like Devil May Cry and God of War and gives an engaging hack and slash mixed with a story that's also enjoyable too. Not for everyone but if you're a fan of Castlevania then this is certainly one to get sunk into when awaiting the next installment.			"

												no controller set up in this game..if there were the game would be a great one at that ... a sort of ""castlevania god of war rpg"" type.... but being forced to use your keyboard and press combo elements that way with no camera control makes this game only playable for about 20 minutes or so (inculding cut scenes) and then you just want to stop playing.    My advice, get a controller and buy DMC instead...least taht is playable and enjoyable.   Its sad though, i REALLY wanted to like this game...i suppose if you could get past the control scheme...it would be worth the 8 bucks....but no more than that.			"

												Как истинный фанат жанра Slasher, я хочу сказать одно - ЭТО великое творение. Его можно отнести даже к уровню Devil May Cry или на голову выше.Очень впечатлило меня то, что разработчики не только на геймплей обратили внимание, НО и дизайн уровней очень великолепно изобразили. Даже задние фоны постарались сделать от ДУШИ !!!! Сюжет игры очень простой и, самое главное, не затянуто как в darksiders. И самый присамый БОЛЬШОЙ + это очень много разноообразных противников и боссов. У каждого противника СВОИ слабости и подход к ним, поэтому не получится жмать одно и тоже комбо, комбо легкие и очень запоминающиеся. Оптимизация игры на ""СУПЕР"", на уровне Devil May Cry 4. Управление такое же.Графика очень впечатляющая, может челюсть отвалиться :D .Рекомендую к покупке. Даже не сомневайтесь, что игра вам понравится, если вы такой же любитель как я!			"

												The combat is repetitive and there are a bunch of QTEs although they are not too hard.  Just mash some random button when they tell you too.The world is super linear with rare oppertunity to go left or right.  The camer is fixed which can make a lot of the wall climbing / jumping puzzles a bit more difficult than they should be.  The fighting is very generic as well.This game also uses a check-point save system.  This is a reason I do not think Ill finish this game.  Currently my check point is saved right before a boss fight (and yes you get to watch a bunch of cinematics every single attempt).  The problem is that it saved my character when he was at  very low health.  So now I get to fight a boss in a very small space with his helping minions with very low health to start with.  After about 8 tries I gave up.  It wasn't even close.Unless you know you love these kinds of games, I would suggest that you stay away from the title.			"

												It's a fun hack and slash game with pretty good graphics for the time. If you've played games from this series, it's defintely worth playing.			"

												This game looks cool but the controls are so awkward and weird. It's impossible for me to control the character at all, and he just runs around aimlessly and then jumps randomly. I know its not sticky keys on my keyboard since i don't have this problem in any other game. I tried to reconfigure the controls but it was still to awkward.			"

												Castlevania has ever since the Super Nintendo, always been one of my favorite games. From the whipping and advancing further from the classic games, to the maze like enviromnents of the PSX and GBA games, Castlevania will always hold a special place in my heart as a gamer.Castlevania Lords of Shadows was a game I had high hopes for. The trailers shown off at e3 the first time I saw them showed some collective promise. Unfortunately, the game itself did not surpass my expectations. While the game had many good points, it also had it's fair share of bad points; which unfortunately ruined the experience for me.Gameplay: Lords of Shadows gameplay is a beat'em up simplest terms. You basically go through the level that you start in, advance through the level by fighting many different variants of monsters, and then get to the end of the stage. You play as Gabriel Belmont, who uses a combat cross whip, and many different subweapons in order to do this. While you engage the enemies, you have to be mindful of the other enemies, and various other hazards (such as fire, other creatures, or cliffs) in order to move on. The gameplay is decent. Unlike the other more classic games which required stratgey and cunning to defeat, this game requires you to be skilled with fast paced combat. You have to use your whip to lay on hits on enemies, dodge and block enemy attacks as they come, and continue to lay on your hits to defeat your foes. The sub-weapons that you get are basically there to help you if your in pinch, as they tend to do more damage than your whip per shot. Along the way, you'll gain magic items and powers which will give Gabriel new attacks and new abilities as you advance throughout the game (such as the light and dark magic). Most of these items are limited use, and difficult to replienish often, so it's usually a good idea to conserve such items.In a sense, the game is not about stratgey with planning your attacks and ways around things, but rather the difficulty is in trying to dispose of the enemies that you encounter as you advance; while conserving as little resources as possible. Some stages do different things. For example, in the second level, you are on a horse the entire time, and have very limited movement. These stages break the monomity a bit, and give you something different to focus on as the game goes on. The game does this other times as well, such as the many mini games encoutnered on the way.The boss battles range from normal fights with cinematic things needed to be done to defeat them, to an entire movie for a fight. The normal fights basically involve you beating up the boss until his HP drops to a certain point, and then doing a sequence of buttons afterwards to finish him off. Sometimes though, the fight is all of that.As you continue, you gain experience points as you slay enemies. These XP are basically used to purchase different techinques and spells that can help you advance through the game. They don't come in often, but the techinques do help.The problem with the gameplay is...this is not Castlevania.Castlevania has always been a game about stratgey in advancing. The difficulty of the game didn't come from the enemies themselves, but from the placement of where those enemies were in. The enemies in Lords of Shadow have no placement or spots in the game that the are placed in which makes it difficult. They are basically copied and pasted in different locations which you can easily move through as long as you are skilled in combat. Original Castlevania; and hell, even the RPG ones had enemies placed in specific spots that made them harder to attack and go after. There were no attempts to place enemies in spots which made them for annoying; and even dangerous to go after or provoke. It was hack and slash, hack and slash, hack and slash.The boss battles also bugged me. In order to win the boss battle, you have to do the cinematic thing, or else the boss gains HP back, and you have to start over from a certain point. That also erked me, because now it's not a matter of how skilled you are at fighting. If you can't do it how the game wants you to, you never advance. But...if I was judging the game as it was, I would say the gameplay is alright. Just not what I wanted.Graphics: The graphics are great; much better than the PS2 ones (I would certainly hope). The enviromnents that you will trudge through are beautiful to look at, and have much color in them, especially in the early parts of the game. Even more so is the enviromnent reflecting the current situation. As you play the game, the further you get towards Gabriel becoming Dracula, the darker the lands around you will become. The graphics are great, and beautifully represent the symbolism that the game represents.Sound: Okay...the soundtrack is...it alright. Most of the game has orchestral compositions to reflect the game as a whole. The problem I have is while these pieces all sound great, none of them stand out. None of them I can recall as pieces I would want to hear. Castlevania had many music pieces that stood out: Vampire Killer, Wicked Child, Bloody Tears, Dance of the Moon. This game had none.Story: The story is good; that much I will agree. It's far more deeper than the other Castlevania stories, and has alot of things going for it. There are so many hints of what is going on showed throughout the story, and many of them are not touched on until the very end. I mean some are obvious, but others are not. All of the classic games either had no story, or the story was already apparent from the start. You Belmont. Dracula bad. Kill. What more is needed? The RPG ones did make more of an attempt at a story, but I find the story there to be executed poorly at times, while in here it was executed much better. So if your a glutton for story, you might like this.Overall: The game by itself is good, but I feel unworthy of the name Castlevania. There are very few elements of Castlevania brought over into this new canon of the series, and the gameplay does not live up to it's name. Where as in the old games where stratgey and cunning were on the same level as the combat, this game is sacrifices stratgey and focuses more on combat...which essentially means it is no longer Castlevania. I feel this game should have been it's own series by itself. The game had very few elements of the original story even here. By placing the words: Castlevania in it, it immediately then had a legacy to live up to, which it did not in my eyes. The game is still a good game in it's own regards; and if you are not like me and like to see different things in a series, then this is for you. But if your a die hard fan who was hoping for a challenging fighting experience that required both stratgey and cunning, then I would recommend you steer away from this.			"

												Starting off I have never played a Castlevania title before Lords of Shadow, I know 'blasphemy'. But that being said I believe that give me a unique perspective on this particular title. To start off I greatly enjoyed the title espaecially having played it already on the 360 and then playing it on the PC I can really see the difference in visuals and frame rates. Now I do have one gripe and that even with a computer that should destroy this game the not ingame cinematics did have a odd jagginess to them, this could of been because of resolution scalling differences between the console tv resolutions and the PC monitor but im not sure. Aside from that it had a very good story with alot of well designed monster with unique abilities to each archtype. Music and sound assets were very well done especially the orchestral overtones throughout the enviroment. Combat it designed well though I couldn't help but feel that some fo the later creatures were designed to be less inventive and more or a irritant this was especially true in the DLC. The puzzles were another sticking point, were well done and not too close together in the maing story but in the first DLC they were almost back to back but I suppose that was to make it last longer them the true length of the content was. Overall I recommend anyone who is or is not a Castlevania fan to give this a play for a game of this type it is very lengthy about 12-15 hours if you take the time to find the collectables which I recommend as it makes your ability to survive easier.

And thanks to Steam for not giving me a refund after the 14 days shame on you Steam. So now the lazy devs have my money for free for a game that i can not play. I would not recommend this game to anyone including non disabled people.I dont normaly do reviews good or bad. However this game deserved a review and a bad one at that.			"

												LoS is a bad game? No, but it's a terrible Castlevania.The game follows in the footsteps of GoW shamelessly either in the attacks, submissions, time event. Too bad it did not follow the battle system too, which is not terrible just boring and tiring. The biggest problem is the Americanization too much of Castlevania, who is a fan of the original series is hard to feel playing a Castlevania.Pos- Game picture is too beautiful- Very well-crafted scenarios- Plot, starts a little slow, but engages much in the end- The prologue- Characters, excluding the protagonistNeg- Battle system- Camera system, right jump times- Controls, are not at all bad, but added the cameras and battle system does not flow well- Protagonist, think of all Kratos' rage and replace with depression, have ready Gabriel (or as Games draw myrtle groaning)- Track, not enough to be bad, but not far is reminiscent of CastlevaniaLoS é um jogo ruim? Não, mas é um terrivel Castlevania.O jogo segue os passos de GoW descaradamente, seja nos ataques, finalizaçoes, evento de tempo. Pena que não seguiu o sistema de batalhas também, que não é terrivel é só chato e cansativo. O maior problema é a americanização demasiada do Castlevania, para quem é fã da serie original fica dificil de se sentir jogando um Castlevania. Pos- fotografia do jogo é linda demais- cenarios muito bem trabalhados- enredo, começa meio devagar, mas engrena muito no final- o prologo- personagens, excluindo o protagonistaNeg- sistema de batalhas- sistema de cameras, pular certo as vezes- controles, não são de todo mal, mas somados as cameras e sistema de batalha não flui bem- protagonista, pensa em toda raiva de Kratos e troque por depressão, pronto temos Gabriel (ou como jogos de chamar a murta que geme)- trilha, não chega a ser ruim, mas nem longe faz lembrar castlevania "

												I tried to play previous Castlevania game on the original Xbox and could not even play for 2 hours.  This game I played for 5 hours every night for a week, losing much sleep, but having so much fun. It has a great sense of style and sense of progression.  The character Gabriel Belmont really builds up to be a strong fighter.  The control is very smooth, each time after you level up and buys new ability, you can develop a new longer combo.  The game encourages you to play earlier chapter to discover more collectible and you can relish in defeating earlier enemy with ease and style.  By the end of the game, when I acquired the Ultimate Light and Shadow Magic, fighting the last boss was easy on Normal difficulty because magic is unlimited and I have maxed out all the stat.  The game always save your experience point so you don’t feel like you wasted time even if you are dead.  This also allows farming for points.  You also don’t feel you need to be stingy with using the items because this is not a survivor game.  Chapter VI, Part III: Castle Hall, when you finish the rune puzzle and it turns night, the vampires do end after a few waves. If you stand and kill all of the vampires, the last one seems to drop a full load of EVERY item (daggers, holy water, faeries, and crystals.  You get about 50 experience points per vampire, and there is a magic fountain there so you can easily use up your item and magic to kill all enemy in just 3 minutes, you can then go to the game menu, “Restart on Last Check Point” and fight them again.  You can get as much experience as you want.  If you can afford to wait though, go to Chapter VI, Part IV: Refectory, the boss Evil Butcher, there is a 30 second QuickTime prompt event before you kill him, and you get 1,000 points for doing that.  You can definitely max on all the skills and relics by doing this.The visual is amazing, there is hand drawn black and white bestiary and storybook like intro in each chapter, and then when you play the game there is the animated cut scene.   There is the QuickTime sequence / prompt event where you have to push the attack button when the circle shrinks down smaller than the indicator circle.   This was very confusing for me at first because I am used to smashing button when the prompt comes up.  In fact, in the first sequence where I ride the horse to escape the goblins I keep getting knocked down.  I also recommend you lose the prompt event sometimes because some of the Gabriel’s death animation is pretty amazing.  This is especially true when you fight Carmilla the Vampire Queen’s true form, Dark lord of the Vampires (BOSS), the animation there is really long and you would never find out if you win at the prompt.  The game has the blatant steal from Shadow of Colossus where you have to climb on a Titan and attach each of the spot on its body, and the Titan will attempt to throw you off.   It is quite exciting. Patrick Stewart of the Star Trek Enterprise / Captain Picard fame is one of the main story character Zobek .  He narrates all the intro level descriptions / stories.  The first time I heard him I was very impressed by his acting and happy that this game has a big budget to hire good actors.On the downside, the game does have some repetitive points, and the DLC which continues from the end of the game, it is very difficult and repetitive even on the normal setting.  In the DLC you help Laura the vampire daughter with The Forgotten big evil boss that is trapped under the castle.  Gabriel chooses actions which leads him to become the man he is in Lords of Darkness 2.  You also see the trailer for the 2nd game if you wait after the game credit ends.  If you just want a fun run through, it will take 20 hours, if you go back and get all the crystal and collectibles and challenges, it will take about 40 hours.   "

												In this game, you face two tough enemies: Camera and controls. Somebody at Konami thought it would be a good idea to port a boss-fighting trick from controller to keyboard. You're supposed to rotate 360 degrees, which is easily enough done with an analog stick, but sucks with the keyboard. And the camera shows an angle that the designers consider helpful, but you may not. Meaning you run north into a new room, which is shown from another angle, and suddenly running north takes you back out of the room. It gets more frustrating when the camera keeps facing a boss, even though you need to jump and hit a switch on the floor on the other side of the room. The whole setup makes some fights a matter of luck, not skill. Thanks, but we have card games and dice-rolling RPGs for that.Which is a pity, because the rest is good. Nice graphics, great voice acting, a nice enough story of Good vs. Evil, and some battles (normal + bosses) are actually fun. But dreading the next boss fight because of shtty controls/camera doesn't make me want to go forward, it makes me uninstall the game.			"

												This is not a TERRIBLE game. But it is very important for people to know that it's Castlevania in name only. This isn't me complaining about things changing. It's 3D, of course it has to change somehow. The thing is, Metroid Prime proved that it's entirely possible to make a 3D Metroidvania, and THIS game proves that the dev team didn't care at all and just wanted to use the Castlevania license as an excuse to show off their hack writing and make something in the style of, but vastly inferior to, Devil May Cry. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO OPEN EXPLORATION IN THIS GAME. NONE. IT IS COMPLETELY LINEAR AND PATRICK STEWART IS WASTED ON GARBAGE WRITING.On top of that, it's full of painfully stupid QTEs. Some of these are pass-or-die events placed at the end of boss fights. If you like that, you are your own problem.Please don't buy this. I don't understand why enough people bought it for there to be a sequel. If it had any other name, it would be merely below average, but with ""Castlevania"" on it, it's a rank betrayal.			"

												Unfortunately the game did not meet my expectations, which were not that high. I tried the demo a very long time ago, I remembered it being a nice demo. I wanted a game to play the 2 weeks before the release of GTA V, and this seemed like a good nice (and not too long) game.The game began wonderfully. It was even above my expectations. Splendid levels, combo system, and learning curve. Every level you would earn a new powerup or unlock new combos, meet new enemies and new combat strategies.This was almost exactly until mid-game, where the game itself became boring, repetitive, and where you would find the biggest flaws, which IMHO are:- fixed camera not always showing the right angle, making you fall exactly where you should not.- attacks from bigger enemies strike you BEFORE the claw/hand/weapon hits you, making it not difficult but rather frustrating, since the enemy kills you BEFORE you can actually see it movingThe scenery was rather beautiful in general, I am almost at the end but I really can't bother playing the game any further. I am not enjoying it that much anymore, it started as a great substitute for God of War (which we don't have on PC) but it turned out to be a very normal hack n slash with averall good elements but nothing really worth it.Buy it only if it is on offer, and if you really like the genre. The game is long though, much longer than many other games, which unfortunately in the case of Castlevania is not really an advantage....65/100			"

												I have just recently finished this game, and I must say, I loved it.Castlevania, Lords of Shadow is a reboot of the well known series, and while I never got to play any of the older ones, this reboot helped me get immersed pretty well in the universe.You play as Gabriel Belmont, a young orphan and a skilled warrior of the Brotherhood of Light, an organization dedicated to protecting humans from the evil minions of the night. Gabriel's wife is murdered right before the beginning of the game and Gabriel therefore goes on a quest to slay the three Lords of Shadow and recover their power, that he may revive his beloved wife. All throughout this quest however, Gabriel himself falls deeper and deeper into the darkness...Castlevania: Lords of Shadow features a combo-driven fighting system, that will make many people think fondly of Devil May Cry and God of War. It featues mild exploration and platforming as well as a known Castlevania mechanic which consists of returning to previous areas with new gear to access hidden areas.The graphics are pretty good for a three/four year old game, and it features some immensely terrifying and satisfying enemies. Castlevania is not without its flaws, however. On start-up of the game, the controls are completely ridiculously mapped, and I recommend remapping them first things first. Some of the bosses and quick time events can also prove difficult as the game doesn't quite feel like it was ever properly ported to the pc.Castlevania also features an extremely horrible camera, that is fixed from a certain angle in every area and can make combat and platforming harder than it really should be. This kind of camera however, made me constantly remember the first Devil May Cry game, and therefore served to instill great nostalgia in me, something I really liked.If you like a good RPG with a brilliant battle system and an enthralling story, pick up Castlevania. Be prepared to be frustrated at times by the horrible camera and ocassional strange control decisions regarding boss fights.And hey, if nothing else, play it because Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is coming February 28th and looks to be freaking amazing.

												A solid PC port of a surprisingly wonderful entry into the Castlevania franchise. Textures look like they got a bit of polish over the ps3 version and the game runs at a buttery smooth 60fps. The cut scenes still run at 30fps with noticeable artifacts from compression, but that's not a deal breaker at all. The gameplay is where it counts and this version certainly wins out over any of the console versions. The soundtrack is one of the most atmospheric in any Castevania game. It's all new music, however, if you're a fan of Castevania, you'll notice all kinds of little nods to the classic Castlevania music in numerous tracks throughout the game. Best of all, it's priced right and includes all of the dlc. Definitely recommended for anyone interested in action/adventure games.			"

												***UPDATE****I actually completed the game now and I decided to update my review. Although I still think my previous review was a fair assessment of the game, I somewhat changed my overall opinion about it... I still feel the beginning is an uninteresting drag, and all the problems I have mentioned are still there until the end of the game.I think that the biggest mistake you can make when starting the game is thinking that you're going to play a metroidvania, because it really isn't. Once you let go of that idea, you can start appreciating it for what it is: a beautifully crafted corridor beat 'em up with an interesting story and setting.Oh and, I played a lot of games with puzzles and Lords of Shadow has some very creative ones (I especially liked the music box).It's a shoddy Castlevania, but it's a rather nice game.-----ORIGINAL REVIEW-----General info about me: my favorite Castlevania is Aria of Sorrow and I'm very familiar with so-called spectacle fighters.Disclaimer: I'm not too far into the game and I might change my opinion if I ever decide to go back to it, since, right now, I have no desire of playing this again.The best thing about the game is the world itself. Years ago I grew tired of fantasy games and movies as they're basically devoid of any real imagination (oh look! Elves!) and in Lords of Shadow the bestiairy and the lore don't seem really that influenced by Tolkien-ish drivel. That, to me, is a huge plus.The level design is basically a really pretty unending corridor (awful invisible walls) with a few arenas and some ledge-grabbing tomb raider-esque nonsense. Don't get me wrong, I love exploration in a game (and the occasional ledge-grabbing), but here, because of its linearity, it isn't enjoyable.I have to say I don't have problems with linear games as they are better suited to tell a story, but there's a difference between linearity and what this game does. The sensation you're stuck in a corridor is accentuated by the fact that you have no control over the camera. With a better camera, the same exact game would have seemed a lot different, more open.Also, these design decision don't make sense in a Castlevania. The defining caracteristic of a metroidvania is to have a somewhat open world with inaccessible parts that can be unlocked by getting new skills or tools/weapons. One example is that some ledges are too high for you to jump on, and once you get the double jump you can explore all these areas you had to skip. This works really really well for a 2D Castlevania with a map.The problem is that in this game you don't have an open world, it's just a string of levels. So, unless you replay the level (from start to finish!) you won't come across the same obstacle multiple times... what's the problem with that? Well, once you get the skill that allows you to overcome said obstacle you probably won't remember where it was or even that there was an obstacle to being with (although there's some kind of log that is supposed to help you).The odd thing is also that whenever you replay a level, you've also to go through the different cutscenes, as if you were travelling in time instead of revisiting the region.This, to me, is the biggest fault this game has. It's as if for it to be a Castlevania game they had to add mechanics that people expect in a Castlevania, but didn't know what to do with them.Regarding the second most important aspect of the game, combat, I think it's okay and rather liked the two types of energy you can collect as it added a rather nice tactical element to the fights.The main problem I have with it is the parry mechanic. It feels wonky and imprecise and sometimes enemies hit you for no reason (note: I usually play these games on maximum difficulty). Every single other game with a similar fighting style do it better than Lords of Shadow: Batman Arkham series, DmC, Deadpool, etc. and even triple Z games like Conan on the Xbox 360... But it also might be that I just don't get it. So take this with a grain of salt.Regarding the quality of the PC port: it's good except for the awfully compressed video. I haven't tried playing with a keyboard, though.			"

												I tried to play previous Castlevania game on the original Xbox and could not even play for 2 hours.  This game I played for 5 hours every night for a week, losing much sleep, but having so much fun. It has a great sense of style and sense of progression.  The character Gabriel Belmont really builds up to be a strong fighter.  The control is very smooth, each time after you level up and buys new ability, you can develop a new longer combo.  The game encourages you to play earlier chapter to discover more collectible and you can relish in defeating earlier enemy with ease and style.  By the end of the game, when I acquired the Ultimate Light and Shadow Magic, fighting the last boss was easy on Normal difficulty because magic is unlimited and I have maxed out all the stat.  The game always save your experience point so you don’t feel like you wasted time even if you are dead.  This also allows farming for points.  You also don’t feel you need to be stingy with using the items because this is not a survivor game.  Chapter VI, Part III: Castle Hall, when you finish the rune puzzle and it turns night, the vampires do end after a few waves. If you stand and kill all of the vampires, the last one seems to drop a full load of EVERY item (daggers, holy water, faeries, and crystals.  You get about 50 experience points per vampire, and there is a magic fountain there so you can easily use up your item and magic to kill all enemy in just 3 minutes, you can then go to the game menu, “Restart on Last Check Point” and fight them again.  You can get as much experience as you want.  If you can afford to wait though, go to Chapter VI, Part IV: Refectory, the boss Evil Butcher, there is a 30 second QuickTime prompt event before you kill him, and you get 1,000 points for doing that.  You can definitely max on all the skills and relics by doing this.The visual is amazing, there is hand drawn black and white bestiary and storybook like intro in each chapter, and then when you play the game there is the animated cut scene.   There is the QuickTime sequence / prompt event where you have to push the attack button when the circle shrinks down smaller than the indicator circle.   This was very confusing for me at first because I am used to smashing button when the prompt comes up.  In fact, in the first sequence where I ride the horse to escape the goblins I keep getting knocked down.  I also recommend you lose the prompt event sometimes because some of the Gabriel’s death animation is pretty amazing.  This is especially true when you fight Carmilla the Vampire Queen’s true form, Dark lord of the Vampires (BOSS), the animation there is really long and you would never find out if you win at the prompt.  The game has the blatant steal from Shadow of Colossus where you have to climb on a Titan and attach each of the spot on its body, and the Titan will attempt to throw you off.   It is quite exciting. Patrick Stewart of the Star Trek Enterprise / Captain Picard fame is one of the main story character Zobek .  He narrates all the intro level descriptions / stories.  The first time I heard him I was very impressed by his acting and happy that this game has a big budget to hire good actors.On the downside, the game does have some repetitive points, and the DLC which continues from the end of the game, it is very difficult and repetitive even on the normal setting.  In the DLC you help Laura the vampire daughter with The Forgotten big evil boss that is trapped under the castle.  Gabriel chooses actions which leads him to become the man he is in Lords of Darkness 2.  You also see the trailer for the 2nd game if you wait after the game credit ends.  If you just want a fun run through, it will take 20 hours, if you go back and get all the crystal and collectibles and challenges, it will take about 40 hours.   "

												I love the vampire theme, and if you love it, this game is a must have. First very collorful but evey step you make it becomes more and more a game of darkness. The controlls are great, even for me they are useable xD Graphics are amazing and I was amazed this beautiful graphics worked on my laptop.Oh, and this is not a game for people who get in rage quickly, you need to have some patience to learn your ennemies weak points before breaking them.Buy this game for its storyline, theme, graphics and gameplay. A must have!			"

												Solid action game with fun engaging gameplay and even though its sheer length (it took me a whopping 26 hours to beat excluding DLC, but I can be very thorough) it never really gets boring, just tedious and unforgiving. Trial and error is key here. It's a classic hack and slash type of gameplay with a plethora of unlockable skills, maybe a bit too much if you ask me. The game has a fixed camera, which doesn't work too well with some combat scenarios and especially platforming, which there is a lot of. You'll find yourself confused and annoyed by invisible walls and sudden changes of the camera placements, messing up your momentum and sense of direction at crucial moments. The game has a fair use of quick time events as well, but even though you'll run into them frequently, they don't feel over the top.Like previously said there is a LOT of different skills to employ, but you can get through the game with pretty much only the standard attacks, some of the combo skills feel like they are too clunky to be worth the effort to pull off in order to look more cool. Some skills are required to reach certain collectibles which opens up for a lot of backtracking, which in turn can be very time consuming since you can't just get the collectible and then quit the level as far as I know, you have to complete the level again from beginning to end.The aesthetics in this game is simply gorgeous. There are some truly impressive vistas in this game and you'll be visiting a lot of different kinds of areas, ranging from swamps to castles to hellscapes. The menu is noteworthy as well, giving off the appearance as an open living book of sorts. Very nicely done.As for the story... Meh... You are Gabriel Belmot, the good guy, and your mission is to defeat some bad guys, because they are bad. The story is mostly delivered in the form of premission narration by none other than Patrick Stewart. But not even he can convincingly deliver the poorly written lines that at times can feel amateurish and cringe-worthy. Our hero doesn't really have a personality and rarely talks which makes it feel a bit disconnected. It would have been nice with some more fleshed out characters and more character integration as a whole.All in all, a good game well worth the money.7/10			"

												Backed by Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima and serving as an origin story, this game sheds new creative light in Castlevania seperating it from the past games in the series. Rather then being like another Metroid type game, this one takes cues from games like Devil May Cry and God of War and gives an engaging hack and slash mixed with a story that's also enjoyable too. Not for everyone but if you're a fan of Castlevania then this is certainly one to get sunk into when awaiting the next installment.			"

												Unfortunately the game did not meet my expectations, which were not that high. I tried the demo a very long time ago, I remembered it being a nice demo. I wanted a game to play the 2 weeks before the release of GTA V, and this seemed like a good nice (and not too long) game.The game began wonderfully. It was even above my expectations. Splendid levels, combo system, and learning curve. Every level you would earn a new powerup or unlock new combos, meet new enemies and new combat strategies.This was almost exactly until mid-game, where the game itself became boring, repetitive, and where you would find the biggest flaws, which IMHO are:- fixed camera not always showing the right angle, making you fall exactly where you should not.- attacks from bigger enemies strike you BEFORE the claw/hand/weapon hits you, making it not difficult but rather frustrating, since the enemy kills you BEFORE you can actually see it movingThe scenery was rather beautiful in general, I am almost at the end but I really can't bother playing the game any further. I am not enjoying it that much anymore, it started as a great substitute for God of War (which we don't have on PC) but it turned out to be a very normal hack n slash with averall good elements but nothing really worth it.Buy it only if it is on offer, and if you really like the genre. The game is long though, much longer than many other games, which unfortunately in the case of Castlevania is not really an advantage....65/100			"

												In this game, you face two tough enemies: Camera and controls. Somebody at Konami thought it would be a good idea to port a boss-fighting trick from controller to keyboard. You're supposed to rotate 360 degrees, which is easily enough done with an analog stick, but sucks with the keyboard. And the camera shows an angle that the designers consider helpful, but you may not. Meaning you run north into a new room, which is shown from another angle, and suddenly running north takes you back out of the room. It gets more frustrating when the camera keeps facing a boss, even though you need to jump and hit a switch on the floor on the other side of the room. The whole setup makes some fights a matter of luck, not skill. Thanks, but we have card games and dice-rolling RPGs for that.Which is a pity, because the rest is good. Nice graphics, great voice acting, a nice enough story of Good vs. Evil, and some battles (normal + bosses) are actually fun. But dreading the next boss fight because of shtty controls/camera doesn't make me want to go forward, it makes me uninstall the game.			"

												This is not a TERRIBLE game. But it is very important for people to know that it's Castlevania in name only. This isn't me complaining about things changing. It's 3D, of course it has to change somehow. The thing is, Metroid Prime proved that it's entirely possible to make a 3D Metroidvania, and THIS game proves that the dev team didn't care at all and just wanted to use the Castlevania license as an excuse to show off their hack writing and make something in the style of, but vastly inferior to, Devil May Cry. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO OPEN EXPLORATION IN THIS GAME. NONE. IT IS COMPLETELY LINEAR AND PATRICK STEWART IS WASTED ON GARBAGE WRITING.On top of that, it's full of painfully stupid QTEs. Some of these are pass-or-die events placed at the end of boss fights. If you like that, you are your own problem.Please don't buy this. I don't understand why enough people bought it for there to be a sequel. If it had any other name, it would be merely below average, but with ""Castlevania"" on it, it's a rank betrayal.			"

												Set aside some time to play this game in one playthrough. It is not a game you can play, leave for a couple of months and come back to. There are tons of different combat combinations, and the ai is smart and challenging so coming back to play it after a while would probably be difficult. The story line is great, and even if the boss fights are tough, once you figure out the bosses moves and timing winning the fights is VERY rewarding, and not as hard as they seemed to be. Definetely worth playing  even more so if you take the time to learn the combat system.			"

												This is a great game with a solid story to it. It has a lot of twists to it. The graphics are solid, as is the voice acting. I would highly, highly, highly, recommend using a controller to play this game. You can play it with a keyboard, but the controls are just too awkward in my opinion. This is also a very long game, I finished the main game somewhere around 18-20 hours. I haven't played through all the DLC but the first one I've played is very promising. It also encourages you to go back and replay areas with newly acquired equipment to become more powerful. They do a really great job with the big boss fights. It's not a case of they just give them more hitpoints. I thought they couldn't possibly top the second to last boss battle of the game, and they really did with the final fight. One of my chief complaints is when you enter the quick time events with the later bosses it doesn't always tell you what button or combination to press. The solution in most of those cases was to move the thumbstick in a circle. Still this is very frustrating when you die or just fail over and over. Fortunately, it often just restarts right at the begining of the QTE. Still its frustrating knowing the only reason I am not progressing is due to the fact I have to keep guessing at things. There aren't really any graphical options with this game either. I honestly cannot wait for Castlevania 2.			"

												Console port? Sure... Keyboard controls feel a little wonky? Sure... But plug in a contoller and go to town. This is a great reboot of the Castlevania series. The graphics feel a little outdated on PC, but are still great. Further, there is no arbitrary screen cap, runs crossfire and eyefinity natively (which is more than I can say for some recent AAA titles, I am looking at you Ghosts.) The soundtrack is beautiful and the voice acting is top notch; boasting the talents of Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle. Patrick Stewarts voice makes you want to listen through each and every story preceding the levels, even though you could read it yourself in half the time and get to playing. There are few issues when using keyboard, as this game (and all in the genre) are made with a gamepad in mind. This is a mere temporary annoyance if you have a gamepad handy, you can also remap the keyboard to something that makes more sense to you. I wholly recommend this game to Castlevania fans as well as action adventure aficionados (God of War, Dantes Inferno, et al) Now, back to playing this game and wasting the day away.			"

												A truly great re-boot to the Castlevania franchise that, in my opinion, honors and respects its roots appropriately while freshening up the overall experience.  Plus, if one were to play the follow up to this game, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate, then they would be in for a treat there as well since that game, along with the ending to this game, set up the finale for the franchise that will take place in Lords of Shadow 2 (technically the third game to the re-boot of Castlevania).  The end is nigh and what an outstanding story this game has told so far!  In the past, some players have complained about this game not being enough like a Castlevania game and, to be fair, where game mechanics are concerned I can sometimes see that argument as valid, but a powerful story with constant nods to its humble beginnings is where this game pays the most homage to its predecessors.  The imminent release of Lords of Shadows 2 will see the re-boot story told in full and I just know that, at the end of that game, I will be asking myself, ""Does it really have to end?"", mostly thanks to the wonderful experience I've already had with this game.  I now have great faith in the future of Mercury Steam, the developers of these games, and I will be watching for whatever they work on from here on out.			"

Posted: May 11, 2016
												Before I begin I'd like to say that I haven't played the previous Castlevania games; this being my first venture into the world of Castlevania. I'm aware that this game takes a different approach to the originals, however I am reviewing this as a standalone. The world setting is an interesting one, but the overall plot is predictable to say the least. There's some interesting characters visually, however characterisation is little. An ensemble voice cast consisting of Robert Carlyle, Natascha McElhone, (hello to) Jason Isaacs, and even the dramatics of Patrick Stewart, known for his Shakespearean background, struggle with the creaky dialogue. To get the cons out of the way, the biggest irk in this game, and as mentioned in many other reviews, is the fixed camera angles. Much like Resident Evil, camera angle cuts are jarring and often leave you moving back on yourself. The camera angles can be most frustrating during platforming sequences, cutting from wide shots to extreme long shots, forcing you to search the screen for Gabriel. Often you will be taken on a cut scene showing you the enviroment for the sole purpose of allowing you to see it, because the fixed camera won't allow you to take in the hard work gone into the creation of world. There are collectibles in the game, however the fixed camera deters from adventure and exploration making levels feel terribly linear. The fixed camera is not without its perks, I found that, especially in battle with The Forgotten One, that a change of angle can signify what attack is about to come, but much like the adventuring this takes away from personal achievement. Another thing I'd like to point out is the DLC. It has some exciting sequences, and allows for another playable character, but it almost felt like a different team worked on it. The 2D animation for cut scenes, however nice to watch, stands out from the artistic style of the rest of the game. I personally like the animation, but would have preferred for one or the other. Also, I'm not sure if it's just me but the difficulty curve for the DLC in comparison to the rest of the game seemed rather steep; ghouls appeared to do significantly more damage and the battle with The Forgotten One became a bit of a grind and somewhat frustrating. Strangely, after all these faults, I am giving this game a positive review and after getting past the frustrating camera I found the game to be a fun hack-n-slash. It's influences are obvious, taking aspects from God of War, Devil May Cry, and the platforming of Prince of Persia. The variation of combos make combat with smaller enemies exciting and very rarely does it become monotonous. Aside from the Titans, boss fights can be fun, but allow little time to use combos. There is a nice variety of enemies that each have different weaknesses and different methods of fighting. My only fault, and this is my personal preference, is the button prompts during cut scenes that occur during fights, mainly in boss fights. These will be fine for people who enjoy the God of War series and don't mind button prompts, but for me it takes away from personal achievement. If you enjoy hack-n-slash games like God of War, then you'll probably enjoy this game. It has a fun variety of combos and enemies, and although exploration is little the world and mythology in which the game is based is an interesting one. For the full price I wouldn't recommend this game, but if you can pick it up on sale - I think I picked it up for £5 in a Steam sale - then give it a try. I've had nearly 34hrs out of the game, most of them enjoyable, and it's been worth every penny. The game has clear issues, but if you can get to grips with them or have played and enjoyed past hack-n-slash games of the PS2 era then I highly recommend it.			"

												I'm going to start off saying that I've been a long term player of Castlevania all the way back to the first time it came out on NES. I was VERY sceptical starting this game due to hearing about how mixed this game is and how the Castlevania canon has been twisted into a new plot. I bought this on sale and figured ""Why not? Lets see how deep this crap pile goes.""At first I thought this was practically a God of War throw back -and in most sense it is- but what really caught my eye,IS ALL OF THE SUBTILE HINTS FROM PREVIOUS CASLTEVANIA GAMES THROWN IN!!!!I don't want to go into complete detail but if you've played any of the older Castlevania's  *Super Castlevania 4, Castlevania Legacy of Darkness (64), Symphony of the Night, etc.* you will definitely notice a mix of a little bit of everything thown in but with a new plot all together. This story is quite different and really puts a lot of background on why the Belmont clan hates Dracula, but it is quite unclear as to why until the very end. Overall I woudl consider this a seperate canon to the Castelvania story rather than a whole new perminant one. I give this game a good review and look forward to playing LOS 2. Castlevania 4 Ever-Gaibon			"

Upgrading your character and trying out new attacks is also a lot of fun, although it's annoying sometimes to be in the middle of some 5 step combination and getting hit and having to start over...But it came out in 2010, so...For that kind of cash I highly recommend that you get a copy.

												I have to say that I really love this game. A incredible epic journey, The story is good. The acting and music is very nice. The graphics are excellent. I knew it had to be a person with great talent behind this. This is a Kojima game. That explains why the 2nd Lords of Shadow isn't too good like the 1rst one. I played this on ps3 and I never got to finish it. I can now finish where I left off. Many say its like God of War which is true in some ways but it has its own identity. I recommend this game. I give it an 8 out of 10.			"

												Excellent and well polished game!Although there is some slight hand-holding along the way (in the beginning chapters) it does a good job as more of an extended tutorial system that I noticed eases up as the game progresses. A must for Castlevania fans and anyone looking for a fun combat enthused action adventure with not too much exploration. **For those reviews complaining about the fixed camera system; I suspect they haven't really played the first DMC, or any Onimusha game for that matter... Or even Ninja Gaiden Black. All great action adventure games that all have a fixed camera perspective. I never really considered this a flaw and more so one less mechanic to worry about. And if you've played any of the above mentioned games then you'll have no problem picking up this one**The combat is great! Most notably the block/dodge/counter mechanics that allow you to keep your focus meter stacked. It borrows most of the staple themes that we see in these types of games including simple button command prompts.Do yourself a favor and just pick this one up :)			"

												Reinventing the Castlevania franchice is not an easy job and not many 2D games can make the transfer to 3D. Well this is still Castlevania as you know it, just bigger, better and more beautiful. Great story and enjoyable combat system. The game clocks in at around 18 hours DLC's included. Great open ending that makes you want to play Lords of Shadow 2 right now! Definitely recommend playing this game!			"

												Console port? Sure... Keyboard controls feel a little wonky? Sure... But plug in a contoller and go to town. This is a great reboot of the Castlevania series. The graphics feel a little outdated on PC, but are still great. Further, there is no arbitrary screen cap, runs crossfire and eyefinity natively (which is more than I can say for some recent AAA titles, I am looking at you Ghosts.) The soundtrack is beautiful and the voice acting is top notch; boasting the talents of Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle. Patrick Stewarts voice makes you want to listen through each and every story preceding the levels, even though you could read it yourself in half the time and get to playing. There are few issues when using keyboard, as this game (and all in the genre) are made with a gamepad in mind. This is a mere temporary annoyance if you have a gamepad handy, you can also remap the keyboard to something that makes more sense to you. I wholly recommend this game to Castlevania fans as well as action adventure aficionados (God of War, Dantes Inferno, et al) Now, back to playing this game and wasting the day away.			"

												A truly great re-boot to the Castlevania franchise that, in my opinion, honors and respects its roots appropriately while freshening up the overall experience.  Plus, if one were to play the follow up to this game, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate, then they would be in for a treat there as well since that game, along with the ending to this game, set up the finale for the franchise that will take place in Lords of Shadow 2 (technically the third game to the re-boot of Castlevania).  The end is nigh and what an outstanding story this game has told so far!  In the past, some players have complained about this game not being enough like a Castlevania game and, to be fair, where game mechanics are concerned I can sometimes see that argument as valid, but a powerful story with constant nods to its humble beginnings is where this game pays the most homage to its predecessors.  The imminent release of Lords of Shadows 2 will see the re-boot story told in full and I just know that, at the end of that game, I will be asking myself, ""Does it really have to end?"", mostly thanks to the wonderful experience I've already had with this game.  I now have great faith in the future of Mercury Steam, the developers of these games, and I will be watching for whatever they work on from here on out.			"

												If you're looking for a 2d/sidescroller Castlevania game, then this is not your game.Feels very God of War-like. A lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ QTE, and gay platforming. Fixed camera sucks at times. Despite that, it's pretty fun and difficult. Art direction looks wonderful. The narration is nice and some dialogue is pretty cheesy. Worth a pick up if it's on sale and you like action/adventure games.			"

												Having been a Castlevania fan since the NES days, I was somehow disappointed with the last few installments of Castlevania (Dawn of Sorrow, Lament of Innocence, and Judgement). Konami did great with reviving the franchise with Lords of Shadow. Not only was the gameplay a mesh of the old platformer and the good storytelling of the franchise, the art was superb and its characters enchanting.Just as Alucard was to Symphony of the Night, the new twist with Gabriel was refreshing also . It's about time we introduced a dark persona for the protagonist (again, aside from Alucard SotN), and Konami delivers. Other than the seldom awkward camera angles, I have no qualms at all. I'm waiting to Pre-Order the next Installment.			"

												I have just recently finished this game, and I must say, I loved it.Castlevania, Lords of Shadow is a reboot of the well known series, and while I never got to play any of the older ones, this reboot helped me get immersed pretty well in the universe.You play as Gabriel Belmont, a young orphan and a skilled warrior of the Brotherhood of Light, an organization dedicated to protecting humans from the evil minions of the night. Gabriel's wife is murdered right before the beginning of the game and Gabriel therefore goes on a quest to slay the three Lords of Shadow and recover their power, that he may revive his beloved wife. All throughout this quest however, Gabriel himself falls deeper and deeper into the darkness...Castlevania: Lords of Shadow features a combo-driven fighting system, that will make many people think fondly of Devil May Cry and God of War. It featues mild exploration and platforming as well as a known Castlevania mechanic which consists of returning to previous areas with new gear to access hidden areas.The graphics are pretty good for a three/four year old game, and it features some immensely terrifying and satisfying enemies. Castlevania is not without its flaws, however. On start-up of the game, the controls are completely ridiculously mapped, and I recommend remapping them first things first. Some of the bosses and quick time events can also prove difficult as the game doesn't quite feel like it was ever properly ported to the pc.Castlevania also features an extremely horrible camera, that is fixed from a certain angle in every area and can make combat and platforming harder than it really should be. This kind of camera however, made me constantly remember the first Devil May Cry game, and therefore served to instill great nostalgia in me, something I really liked.If you like a good RPG with a brilliant battle system and an enthralling story, pick up Castlevania. Be prepared to be frustrated at times by the horrible camera and ocassional strange control decisions regarding boss fights.And hey, if nothing else, play it because Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is coming February 28th and looks to be freaking amazing.

												Imagine the boring repetitiveness of God of War and the destruction of everything you loved about the older Castlevania games.

												LoS is a bad game? No, but it's a terrible Castlevania.The game follows in the footsteps of GoW shamelessly either in the attacks, submissions, time event. Too bad it did not follow the battle system too, which is not terrible just boring and tiring. The biggest problem is the Americanization too much of Castlevania, who is a fan of the original series is hard to feel playing a Castlevania.Pos- Game picture is too beautiful- Very well-crafted scenarios- Plot, starts a little slow, but engages much in the end- The prologue- Characters, excluding the protagonistNeg- Battle system- Camera system, right jump times- Controls, are not at all bad, but added the cameras and battle system does not flow well- Protagonist, think of all Kratos' rage and replace with depression, have ready Gabriel (or as Games draw myrtle groaning)- Track, not enough to be bad, but not far is reminiscent of CastlevaniaLoS é um jogo ruim? Não, mas é um terrivel Castlevania.O jogo segue os passos de GoW descaradamente, seja nos ataques, finalizaçoes, evento de tempo. Pena que não seguiu o sistema de batalhas também, que não é terrivel é só chato e cansativo. O maior problema é a americanização demasiada do Castlevania, para quem é fã da serie original fica dificil de se sentir jogando um Castlevania. Pos- fotografia do jogo é linda demais- cenarios muito bem trabalhados- enredo, começa meio devagar, mas engrena muito no final- o prologo- personagens, excluindo o protagonistaNeg- sistema de batalhas- sistema de cameras, pular certo as vezes- controles, não são de todo mal, mas somados as cameras e sistema de batalha não flui bem- protagonista, pensa em toda raiva de Kratos e troque por depressão, pronto temos Gabriel (ou como jogos de chamar a murta que geme)- trilha, não chega a ser ruim, mas nem longe faz lembrar castlevania "

												Starting off I have never played a Castlevania title before Lords of Shadow, I know 'blasphemy'. But that being said I believe that give me a unique perspective on this particular title. To start off I greatly enjoyed the title espaecially having played it already on the 360 and then playing it on the PC I can really see the difference in visuals and frame rates. Now I do have one gripe and that even with a computer that should destroy this game the not ingame cinematics did have a odd jagginess to them, this could of been because of resolution scalling differences between the console tv resolutions and the PC monitor but im not sure. Aside from that it had a very good story with alot of well designed monster with unique abilities to each archtype. Music and sound assets were very well done especially the orchestral overtones throughout the enviroment. Combat it designed well though I couldn't help but feel that some fo the later creatures were designed to be less inventive and more or a irritant this was especially true in the DLC. The puzzles were another sticking point, were well done and not too close together in the maing story but in the first DLC they were almost back to back but I suppose that was to make it last longer them the true length of the content was. Overall I recommend anyone who is or is not a Castlevania fan to give this a play for a game of this type it is very lengthy about 12-15 hours if you take the time to find the collectables which I recommend as it makes your ability to survive easier.

I haven't played any of the previous Castlevania game so this was my first one into the Castlevania world.The game has amazing graphics and soundtrack. Also the gameplay is very good, similar to other games of the genre such as Devil May Cry or God of War. I love the fact that you get to visit many different locations with very different ambients and characters. The main story is very good too, however the DLC part doesn't add too much to the game itself except a key twist in the history of Gabriel Belmont, the main character.The game is very well optimised and runs very fluid.I would rate this game 9/10.

												Take God of War, made the protagonist a dark-gothic dude with the Belmont name, and you have Lords of Shadow.As a huge fan of Castlevania I sat through this whole game through the Knight difficulty (for some reason the final level only registered Esquire, but the game pi**ed me off because the last boss is so cheap I refused to replay that level). This game is gorgeous, every ounce of the game screams ""castlevania"", all the enemies you expect are there.Where this game stumbles are in a few areas; 1) it doesn't feel like Castlevania, 2) A lot of the boss battles are uninspired, they feel like button mash fests with QTE events 3) QTE events (SO... MANY!) 4) Its a chore, rather than exciting, to go back and explore. I'll go through each a bit.1 - It doesn't feel like Castlevania - this is very true, it feels like God of War. The upgrade system is essentially ""buy more ways to button mash"", and on higher difficulties you literally will almost never use any non-whip attacks because enemies are so damn punishing. This kind of combines with my fourth point in that exploration is a CHORE because each level is self-contained. I HATE having to kill hordes of enemies to go get that one item I missed in a level; I can't skip a lot of fights. As such, there is no ""metroidvania"" gameplay to be found.2 - Boss battles - This was a huge pet peeve to me. Half the boss battles are like shadows of colossus style fights, while the other half are ""dodge around in circles, hit when you can, oh look another QTE."" QTE's are fine in moderation, but it felt like I was playing god of war 3 with how many there were in boss fights! Don't get me wrong, I love a good cinematic battle, but 10 hours in it gets old.3 - QTE events - by god... the fact you had to QTE event for opening certain levers and switches just tells you how many there are. As well, the intersecting circle style QTE's are really annoying because the faster ones its hard to tell when its in or out.But, the game is gorgeous, its very long, and quite cinematic. I also enjoyed the story quite a bit. If only they didn't gut a lot of what makes castlevania what it is....Pros-----* Long game* Gorgeous* Very cinematic, the world feels alive* Fights can be fun at times* The puzzles, and there are a lot, can be quite ingeniousCons-----* Boss battles* Doesn't feel like a castlevania* exploring is a CHORE* The stupid game didn't give me my knight difficulty final battle win... and the final boss is a MASSIVE cheapa**Overall I'd give it a 6/10. Only buy this if you want a hack and slash game, and don't mind occassionally throwing your controller with frustration.			"

												It's not like older Castlevania games, it's not a side-scroller, you can't level up, it's not even in the same canon as the other games. Judging this game on its own, it's a 3d beat 'em up with lots of quick time events, fairly easy platforming and puzzles of varying difficulty, similar to God of War or Darksiders. The story is fairly long, it took me about 25 hours to beat the game, including the dlc on the Knight(normal) difficulty. The game is split into chapters of various sizes. You'll be going all around the continent, so the levels are varied. Story quality is pretty mediocre, I felt like there were a lot of moments where the story didn't make any sense. Voice acting is mostly okay, you have Sir Patrick Stewart as the narrator as well as a major character and he's a very pleasant man to listen to. Other voice actors perform well enough.Since I mentioned that this game is like God of War, I might as well mention that the controls are not nearly as fluid. Block and dodge are bound to the same button on gamepad, the sprint power-up is activated by double tapping the left stick in any direction, which feels sluggish and unreliable to execute. Your character feels slow and clunky when turning and aiming attacks, which is a big problem in a game like this. The camera is always in a fixed position, which is an incredibly poor design decision.The two dlc included in the Ultimate Edition are short and rather poor in my opinion. The first dlc, Reverie is a puzzle focused dlc where logic flies out the window because some puzzles wouldn't make sense otherwise. The second dlc, Resurrection begins promisingly, with an awesome platforming/climbing section with a bit of a twist. After that, however, you're left with an multi-phase boss who was absolutely infuriating, one of the most frustrating bosses in any video game I've played.Overall, Lords of Shadow is a decent game, if you can handle the occasionally clumsy controls and accept that it really has very little to do with Castlevania.But yeah, that dlc boss can ♥♥♥♥ right off. Harder than the fight with  Satan  himself.			"

This game is a unique fantasy experience with a complex background combining very different traditions. The gameplay is tricky enough to challenge you.

												In 2017 this game came to me like a saviour. What a refreshment. Addictive, fast and fluid combat. Great music and graphics are still great for today's standards. 10/10-Based on the gameplays i watched this is much, much better than the second game.			"

												One of the nice game I have ever bought, even through the control is a bit bad using keyboard, I recommend using controller for the player who is not really patient and the story really awesome and i quite enjoy the gameplay. But I quite disappointed because the region lock I cannot purchase the Castlevania: Lord of Shadow 2 and the Castlevania: Lords of Shadow – Mirror of Fate via Steam.			"

												Jogo excelente, jogabilidade boa, as vezes a camera atrapalha um pouco pois não consegue focar no personagem, mas não atrapalha tanto, os inimigos são legais, a dificuldade equilibrada, não é o jogo mais dificil do muito, mas não é o mais facil.Na minha opinião é muito dificil encontrar um hack'n slash decente, mas se você procura um hack'n slash de qualidade castlevania lord of shadows não vai decepcionar			"

												Okay, full disclosure here, I loved the original Castlevania games on the old NES :) Having said that I really wasn't sure what to expect out of this but I got it on sale so I had to give it a shot. It did not disappoint. There is enough similarity to the old games in the premise and structure of the games for an old fan like me, but different enough and new enough to bring it into the current video game world.  The main quest line is linear, but you can go back through levels you have already completed at any time for any reason so it is not completely linear. Indeed sometimes you will come to things that you cannot get until you get a weapon or item from a later level and are forced to come back or miss the item. The game is long also with challenges that show up after the initial completion of a level to add further playability to it, as well as having steam achievments and cloud support which is always a bonus for me. All in all I would rate this game an 8 out of 10. Definitely worth picking up!			"

												Overall decent game! Probably 30-40 hours of solid gameplay. The only criticism is there are probably too many puzzles and there's a good chance you will not be finishing this game without some kind of guide and perhaps even knocking the difficulty down to easy a few times. Regardless, it kept me entertained. Right now I'm working my way through the DLC. Would definitely recommend this if you like a nice beat em up with some puzzles and dramatic cut scenes sprinkled through out the game.			"

												A very repetetiv and ""outstreched"" piece of vampiredust! A very shallow combatsystem and the same enemies over and over, even when they look different the pattern is more or less the same. If you want a good hack-and-slash; try the Devil May Cry series or Metal Gear Rising.			"

												If you're a fan of the Castlevania series, do yourself a favor and skip this game.  If you're a fan of the God of War series, do yourself a favor and go replay those instead, because this is just a shoddy facsimile.  With writing terrible enough to make me want to skip over even Patrick Stewart's dulcet tones, and an attitude that rejects everything that made Castlevania a classic game series, this game is best left in the waste pile of terrible 3D Castlevania games.

												I really can't recommend this one. It's cool in that it plays like a PS3 game, but ultimately the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. Feels extremely linear - even if you usually don't mind that kind of thing - and it's not much fun. The graphics are awesome, and Jean Luc Picard narrates the (very dull) story, but even he can't save this game.			"

												All cinematics, no gameplay. If i wanted to watch a movie I would have gone to the movie theater. Castlevania 64: Legacy of Darkness is what all castlevania games should have been modeled after. Lords of shadow fell so short of it, I was sick to my stomach. 90% of today's games have become a ""rail shooter"" style and/or boundaried to the point of where you can NOT go in and explore a map, which is a shame. I want to get lost in a game, so much that I forget reality. Today's games do NOT deliver that experience anymore.			"

												A solid PC port of a surprisingly wonderful entry into the Castlevania franchise. Textures look like they got a bit of polish over the ps3 version and the game runs at a buttery smooth 60fps. The cut scenes still run at 30fps with noticeable artifacts from compression, but that's not a deal breaker at all. The gameplay is where it counts and this version certainly wins out over any of the console versions. The soundtrack is one of the most atmospheric in any Castevania game. It's all new music, however, if you're a fan of Castevania, you'll notice all kinds of little nods to the classic Castlevania music in numerous tracks throughout the game. Best of all, it's priced right and includes all of the dlc. Definitely recommended for anyone interested in action/adventure games.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of ShadowGenre: Action-AdventureRating: 5/10Comment : There are better Action-Adventures to play for example 'Darksiders'.While the game has some great moments it's in general not a very good Action-Adventure. The combat is repitive, the puzzles are mostly too easy, the camera can not be controlled, there is no free saving, the world is not contiguous, the levels are mostly linear with very little to discover, the story does nothing special and you have to play through once to unlock the hardest difficulty.But 'Castlevania: Lords of Shadow' also has some beautiful landscapes and impressive cutscenes espcecially the epilogue.If you are a fan of the genre it will probably be worth playing through once. Otherwise I would advice you to play something else.			"

												For some reason this game just doesn't do it for me.  It plays like God of War and it is in the Castlevania series, being a big fan of both I thought this game would be a home run.  There is just not enough action.  I feel like I spend more time watching cutscenes than I do fighting monsters, and I definately feel like I spend more time jumping around and climbing than I do fighting monsters.  In many games the environment presents challenges that add to the game but in this one it feels more like something you have to do to get to the next fight.The graphics and sound are very nice and it feels like a lot of work went into this game, but it feels repetitive and just isn't that fun.

												This game is just not fun to play.It has a bunch of problems from the bottom up that just hamper any enjoyment i could get out of the game, lets start with the combat, the amount of health the enemies have is just ine general too high this mixed with the fact that they take virtually no hit stun (and any larger enemy will take non) means that you will have to spend more time moving around the enemies dodging attacks than actually hitting them, this also means its pretty much impossible to use any of the combos you get. This starts to become more and more of a problem as the game throws constantly larger enemies at you which you have to plink away at ad nausium, igf you've played this game before you might be thinking why not just use the block and thats fine and all for the first half of the game but when its throwing enemies at you where 2/3 of their moves at least are unblockable its kinda a moot point. the bosses were really meha couple of them had dumb puzzles to solve to beat them which were dumb and badly sign posted but thats pretty much the whole game in general. The platforming is super boring, there is only ever one path to go forward there is no way to speed it up and it just generally wastes your time rather than being anything meaningful. Even the platform bosses are monotonous the only difference being that they are also frustrating because if you dont know exactly what the game wants you to do then you get knocked off and have to start again. the fact that the bosses try to shake you off every 10 second, which means nothing more than hold RT for 3 secs, is just a time waste and its no where near dynamic enough to be interesting.The puzzles are mostly ok but there are a few with really bad at showing you how to even start the puzzles otherwise they are not very complexe just unintuitive sometimes .Ohh yeazh this game also has QTE's sbecause everyone loves QTE's and for the record they arent even good QTEs they are the random button low effort kind of WTEs that are only there to m,ake sure you pay attention and cant skip their precious cut scenes.Theres one thing i havent mentioned which hugely underpins everything else: the camera. The use of static camera placement often makes the platforming and combat harder purely because it doesnt show you what you need to see, it also leads to the second biggest issue in that the game has no idea how to lead you  they are so many times when i would follow the path leading to a secret thinking it was to progress and vice versa and there were also times when i would be stuck in a room because i couldnt see the one way to progress thanks to the camera being unhelpful.As far as the story goes its in general stupid with a couple of cooler moments hidden within but they're not worth going through the rest of it. The graphics are good for their time but it really seems that the designers onl;y cared about making the game look pretty rather than have it play well Overall this game is just really not worth anyones time or effort to play and i regret the time i put into it.

												As much as i love the story and the game itself on the consoles i will have to not recomend this game for its bad port.Now if you own an xbox 360 V you can buy the game and enjoy it... HOWEVER. Because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥coding which konami did you will get input lag if you playing on a keyboard and it will get on your nerves even on tutorial stage. If you dont have an xbox 360 controller i once again telling you DON'T buy this game you are wasting your money if you have a ps3 just buy it for that console. And no any other controller wont work it HAS to be xbox 360 controller otherwise the game wont see the controller and wont even show up even If emulate it to be an xbox 360 controller it does not work. If you still want to buy this game then start saving up for xbox 360 controller because if you will play on keyboard you will get major input lag. And no it has nothing to do with fps im getting 60 fps from the game its not realated to fps lag. Im warning you because there is no fix or patch for this problem on the internet i wasted 2 hours of my life searching for the fix but there is nothing. So once again im going to tell you in all caps since probably most of you aint going to read the whole♥♥♥♥♥♥anyways. DON'T BUY THE GAME IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN XBOX 360 CONTROLLER NO OTHER CONTROLLER WORKS AND YOU CAN'T EMULATE IT IF YOU GOING TO PLAY ON KEYBOARD YOU GOING TO GET MAJOR INPUT LAG. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON PC VERSION OF THE GAME BECAUSE LAZY KONAMI CAN'T CODE CONTROLLS.			"

												Feels like a terrible port. Does not support mouse by default - all commands are via the keyboard. I feel it probably would work fine with a game controller so if you use one of those, feel free to disreguard this entire review as all the negative I have to say is a result of the controls and camera set up  :) + The graphics are very good, considering how old it is - I could see that right away. The screenshots are what captivated my interest and got me to buy the game.+ The story sounds interesting- No camera control. It's stuck at an awkward angle (for me at least, I like the camera further off the ground). Most 3rd person games allow you to swing the camera in any direction. This does not.- No default mouse control. You can set the mouse buttons to various commands manually though but you're still stuck with commands set to the right side of the keyboard. - Does not do a good job of constraining the mouse to one monitor. This may be why they discourage using it. Whenever it gets outside the screen onto the other monitor and you click, it tabs you out of the game. This is not something that happens every time you move the mouse... but it happens regularly. The lack of control over camera angles is really what does it for me. If that would not have been unsatisfactory I would have played with the controls more. As it is, I may eventually come back to it and give it another try, but I have many other games in my list that don't require a lot of 'control fiddling' and use standard mouse+keyboard commands.

												SPOILERS:Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is essentially a Shadow of the Colossus/God of War clone, with great atmosphere and beautiful music. The game itself has a decent story and various different characters, all of which feel fleshed out.Unfortunately, the game itself suffers from horrendous execution. It seems most of the budget was spent on graphics and art and the gameplay suffers accordingly. There are far too many cookie-cutter enemies, and the combat is unrefined. Weak enemies can ignore your CC skills and every hit you suffer staggers you and interrupts your combos and focus (a mechanic that allows you to regain magic through proficient combat), making the grab attack the most efficient way to kill hordes of throwaway baddies and reducing combat to a chore rather than entertainment. They're often thrown in as a way to keep the exploration exciting, which makes no sense, given that the world is very beautiful and combat takes away from the experience, rather than adding to it. More competent enemies are still easily dealt with since the game is quite generous with items, which are very effective against them. Even in these fights, peon-class monsters are thrown in and all they do is slow the combat down as you grab/kill them individually. The boss fights range from being excellent (Cornell, Brauner and Olrox come to mind) to breathtaking (but unfortunately easy i.e. the Titans) to downright stupid (and this one's more of a personal peeve). For instance, the Butcher boss is very easy to beat. Beat on him enough and he puts on a pot as a helmet. Just before fighting him, you rang a bell to summon Ghouls into a room. Since your attacks don't hurt him, you assume that you can use his helmet somehow to summon the Ghouls, resulting in a gruesome death for this ugly beast as his pets literally bite the hand that feeds them.No such luck. You have to (get this) jump and attack. That's right. Jump and attack to smash the helmet.YOU HAVE A WHIP! IT LETS YOU CROSS MOUNTAINS! WHY THE HELL WOULD JUMPING MAKE THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE TO YOUR RANGE? /rantAnother (and the worst part, in my opinion) problem is that the programmers violated one of the Great Gaming Commandments.THOU SHALT NEVER MAKE A 3D GAME WITH PLATFORMING AND A FIXED CAMERA.Yeah. I shouldn't have to explain this, but I will.The game has many parts where you have to climb stuff. And it doesn't let you look around. For the most part, it's fine but good luck beating the game without screwing up your double jumps.The icing on the mechanic cake is the fact that the camera/controls don't always line up, resulting in controls and directions being swapped for the sake of a cinematic view. It is infuriating to platform when up suddenly becomes right because OOOOOHHHH LOOK AT HOW ARTSY THIS IS! LOOK HOW EPIC IT IS! WHY DID YOU FALL?. Once again, the bad mechanics take away from the atmosphere and instead of being enraptured, you're left wondering when it ends. A crime against the art department, since they did their job fantastically.Finally, there are a multitude of puzzles, which also allow you to forgo the reward in exchange for the answer. Clearly this was added with consoles in mind, since PC gamers can simply shift-tab and search the answer. Even so, the puzzles aren't too complex, and actually add to the game since there's no bad programming to get in the way. It's just you, the puzzle and your brain.So while this game is beautiful and atmospheric, I cannot recommend it since it forgets that it's a game. Gameplay/game mechanics are vastly more important than story and art. If I wanted to watch something with great graphics and music, I'd watch a movie or listen to my favorite bands. I buy games to play a GAME, not an interactive movie. TL:DR Nice to look at, rots you from the inside like your ex.			"

												Went into the game with an open mind because it's on sale but it's not really that great.  It does get better as you progress but progression feels sluggish & most things about it are just disappointing. PROS-Great Graphics-Action Style Combat-Patrick StewartCONS-Fixed camera angles-Auto-targeting system-Too many tutorials-Repetitive Combat-Incredibly Linear-Too Many QTE's-Bad Story-Boring Characters-Too Many Cutscenes-Too much Patrick Stewart (Never thought I'd say that)STORYYou're wife's dead & you're emo.  Patrick Stalwart shows up & says, ""We can bring your wife back by making you into a god!""  So you go around killing things until it happens, I assume.  It all was so dull & boring that's all I could get from it.  Something about ancient spirits of ""The Order"" are using your wife's soul to communicate with you?  I dunno... GAMEPLAYYou Mash X when there's a single target & Y when there's multiple targets while dodging or jumping over attacks.  You can block but you might as well just dodge.  You get the power to absorb magic orbs & add ""Light Magic"" to your attacks which only serves to give you lifesteal & ""Dark Magic"" which, you guessed it, increases your damage.  Also, why don't the magic orbs just absorb when I get close?  Why do I have to hold a button down to absorb them?  That adds absolutely nothing to the gameplay & just leaves you open during combat.  Another thing about combat, every time you're hit you get interupted while enemies rarely do themselves.  So, while you're attacking an enemy he'll walk through your attacks only to blindside you upside your head or throw a weapon at you, breaking your combo.Then there are segments of the game where you'll have to fight a large enemy to progress because you have to mount them & use their abilities to make it through the level.  Basically, they're living keys.  You ride them, use them to make progress then kill them because they're useless now.  You can use them during combat but you get reduced rewards for every enemy slain using a mount so it's not really worth it.The camera is so god awful during gameplay.  Enemies will attack you off camera by leaping at you or throwing bombs & the auto targeting is so bad that you'll constantly miss when you throw knives & attack nothing half the time because you don't know where you're aiming or if you're locked on when you start attacking.  Blocking is mapped to the same button as dodging so yea, good luck with that.  When you're not moving you block, when you're moving you dodge & it can get cumbersome to suddenly stop moving during combat just to block an attack.  Timed blocks give you a parry that lets you attack freely. Don't even get me started on the QTE's which only serve to break up the already boring combat & make it even more boring.  Whenever you grab an enemy it's a QTE that forces you to wait one whole second before pressing the kill button.  Why?  I don't know.  They could have easily just let you press the button to kill whenever you wanted but no... You gotta wait for the game to tell you when you can kill it which only serves to break the flow of combat.Then the way the areas are designed are just straight lines with small off paths that lead to either an upgrade or to something that could have been put on the main path like a Regeneration Fountain.  There are several paths that intertwine & the only difference is an item being hidden on one path.  Why?  What is the point of making the paths lead to the exact same place if the only difference is one has an upgrade?  That's blatantly punishing players who choose the path without the upgrade forcing them to replay the level just to find it.  It's padding at it's absolute worst.To make matters worse every level has or is a tutorial.  Level 1?  Combat tutorial.  Level 2? Jumping tutorial.  Level 3?  New item tutorial.  Level 4? Boss tutorial.  Level 5?  Magic tutorial.  Level 6?  Poison effect tutorial.  ENOUGH WITH THE TUTORIALS!  Well into chapter 2 I'm still seeing tutorialThen there are the cutscenes.  Why oh why are there so many cutscenes?  Even during the finishing blow of the first boss I was interupted so Mr. Portrick Stewbird could swoop in & finish it off for me.  KS'd by Potluck Standard!  What exactly did making him instead of me, the player, take out the first boss of the game add to the game?  NOTHING!  It made me, the player, feel like a wimpy emo panzy (which the main character kind of is) so Mr. Prenub Studmuffin could seize all the glory for himself!  I guess because they were paying big money for a big name voice actor they had to ruin the game's first boss fight in order to get their money's worth.And the puzzles are even worse, especially in the beginning but if the early stages are any indication of puzzles in late game then I bet they're not any better.  The first real puzzle you come across involves finding 5 rocks with pictures on them.  Then you put those pictures in the order you found them, which is shown on screen as you solve it.  Yes, a puzzle that gives you the solution on screen while you are doing it.  HOW IN THE HELL IS THAT A PUZZLE?The next puzzle?  A rotating bridge!  To your dead wife's corpse!  That's got a swinging axe getting closer to her corpse & if you take too long she gets cut in half.  Questions.  Why do I care about a corpse?  Why is the corpse in the middle of a rotating bridge death trap?  Why is this a vision test to prove my worth to a goat man?  Because ♥♥♥♥ YOU! That's why!GRAPHICSThen there's the graphics.  Yes, the game is pretty but there is a downside to this & I'm not talking about how horrible the rest of the game is as a result.  The game is so detailed that it's hard to make out all the, well.. Details.  No, seriously.  It all blends together like a pristine painting that was made by some of the best artists they could probably find, but the end result is... What am I looking at exactly?  With the fixed camera angles it's nearly impossible to tell what your looking at half of the time.  If there was a 3rd person mode that let you actually see the details up close you could probably tell what you were looking at, but because it's so far out of view & unfocused it just becomes a bland mess.And that's the worst part about the game.  The camera.  They made an action based hack & slash game with gorgeos graphics & 3D platforming segments only to ♥♥♥♥ it up by giving it a fixed camera perspective.  This just takes you away from all the action, all the great graphics & away from being immersed in a fantasy gothic horror style environment.  You want to see that segment of grass up close? Too bad!  You want to see the detail of the enemies they paid artists tons of money to work on for hours?  Tough nuts!  You want to be in the middle of the action & see the blood splatter on your face as you fight?  Not gonna happen!OVERALLThis game is incredibly mediocre.  In fact, the first two hours I spent playing it about half or more of that was in cutscenes & replaying levels to find an item I missed. And every time I replayed a level all I could think was, ""What is the point of this?  Why is this in the game?  Why is that in the game?  This isn't fun.  It adds nothing to the game.  This only serves to extend the level to make it seem longer than it actually is!"" It's padding & not the good sort of padding.I'm not sure where the ""Very Positive"" rating is coming from because this game doesn't do anything spectacular at all.  It rips things from other games (which isn't a bad thing) but it grinds them down into their most generic format & puts them together in a way that is just ""Meh...""  If you pick up this game, don't expect anything amazing or ground breaking.  Hell, don't even expect it to be a Castlevania game because it's not.  It's just some game that happens to have Castlevania's name on it.			"

												Castlevania is one of my favorite franchises of all time. I played Symphony of the night when I was 8 years old with my cousin, and it stands as my favorite to this day, but considering I was a dumb child who had no knowledge of the english language whatsoever, I didn't understand anything about it's story.  But considering the point of this review isn't about Symphony of the night, I'll set that aside.Now talking about lords of shadow , it is an hack n´slash game with some rpg elements and with a great story.The game is about Gabriel , a knight who losts his wife and just wants to find a way to bring her back to the earth.Gabriel believes that the gods don´t care about earth anymore and he wants to show them that they are wrong.(I won´t spoil about it)Talking about the gameplay , the combat system is awesome because it has many weapons to use like daggers and upgrades to the main weapons , the combos are also amazing.Gabriel can use different powers to defeat his enemies.This game also makes use of a good parkour system (that reminds me of Prince of Persia).Overall the game is awesome (of course , for me).It has few bugs, however they don't don´t impact the gameplay at all. You'll most likely go through the whole game without noticing a single issue.8,3/10			"

												I do not recommend this game:* Checkpoints are too few and too far apart;* No Checkpoints after annoying parts;It is frustrating even for fans of challenging games;Lords of Shadow's difficulty isn't in the challenge it presents, it is in dealing with the few checkpoints and punishing task;You can't roll One or Two checkpoints back after a battle that left with low health and few resources;In this case you need to go back to the start of the chapter and try to reach the same point in better conditions;You have to replay a lot, and it gets old fast;Sometimes after a particularly difficult battle, the player is left with little resources, low health and has two choices:* Restart, which can make you have to replay a lot of what you have just played;* Or push forward, hoping to find items and health and not reaching a second checkpoint that saves your game in poor conditions, making it even more punishing, forcing you to restart from the beginning of the chapter;It's a pity;			"

												Do you know that feeling when you spend some money on a game from one of your favorite franchises and it just sucks?I do, but the deal with Casltevania: LoS is a bit different - it's just a big disappointment. The only thing this game shares with another games from the franchise (let's jus skip the psx game) is the last name of the protagonist (Belmont, again, let's just skip Alucard and stuff for the review's sake).Of course the game was placed in a 3D world so the game was supposed to be bit different, but don't be fooled: this is not metroidvania, or anything even close to Castlevania. This is a tpp slasher which did a bad job at being what it was meant to be. If I were to pick Darksiders, DMC or Castlevania I would just send this game straight to trash.There are some upsides to this game: regular mini-boss fights, art-style, fast-paced action. But let's go straight to the downsides, shall we:The hero's got hardly any identity, it's just some Gabriel Belmont who is so sad about losing his wife that he's got to save the world and nothing is going to stop him. This is extremely cliche, but let's go further - maybe the gameplay is so awesome it's going to make you forget that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?No way, it's just another slasher, but you can only use a few weapons, there's no advanced switching techniques, the whip feels really... soft. Unless you're using heavy attacks but even then the ps2 jrpg 3d graphics make it feel like you're just so weak you should turn your back on this whole quest. Combos are extremely weak, and honestly there's hardly any point in switching to anything but attack spam. The game doesn't really punish you for losing and doesn't force you to get better at the game so why bother?The plot is completely chaotic and I don't mean lack of plot like in Dark Souls. This game just tells you some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and then follows with completely random areas and bosses, why? Only fighting Lords of Shadow makes any sense, but then again meh...Camera is one of the things I hate the most in this steaming pile of goat excrement. It focuses random thing, often makes jumps impossible or hard. I think this would be much better on the controller so maybe it's a warning: don't play on a hecking keyboard holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I know it sounds like it's a 3/10 game, but I would give it 5 or 6 even. It sucks, it really sucks at being a castlevania game and a slasher game as well. It's trying to be similiar to DMC or Darksiders but just doesn't meet the challenge. It's not worth the money as you can get something so much better than this. Just... don't bother. Maybe they will release another 2D game, this time for PC as well.			"

Seriously? This is gamepad game, as is DMC or Bayonetta, it's masochistic to play those on k+m. No Win 10 support? What? I'm playing this on Windows 10 without ANY problems.

												Don't buy this game... If you expect God of War for PC!!Having played all GoW's on the PS, I had high expectations for this one, and I was let down many times:* The gameplay feels quirky. Many actions (block, roll, ""power"" hit) are mapped to the same button, so most of the time you end up doing things you didn't want to do.* The more powerful moves/skills are hard to use because most of them require excessive amounts of time to ""charge up"" and are therefore not really suitable for multiple enemies or boss fights. Also, tossing enemies in the air and overall airborne combat isn't as powerful as I would have liked it to be.* There are frustrating moments in the game, most of which are due to the unfair/bad placing of checkpoints.As I worked my way through the game, forcing myself to finish it, there were a lot of parts I hated that had trail-n-error elements and the mentioned badly placed checkpoints, making it an overall frustrating experience.BUT, there where also parts I enjoyed a lot, especially the puzzles (which where often hard, but never unfair) and the last 3 Chapters as a whole. The story is average, except for the ending (after the ending), which has a nice twist to it. Technically, the game itself is pretty nice. It sounds good and looks terrific (except for the rendered cut-scenes and the in-game close-up shots).In conclusion, just because I ended up enjoying the last part of the game, I would not recommend it to a friend.

												Great movie, terrible game.  Klunky, awkward controls, frustrating camera and boring, poorly responsive button mashing combat.  The story and settings are intriguing but the linear hand holding of the player that limits any exploration, innovation or unique character development or playstyle ruins any enjoyment gained from the story.  Its a shame considering the impressive art direction and voice acting.You would think that having put so much effort into crafting such interesting environments the developers would consider mouse functionality and camera control allowing the player to actually appreciate their hard work.  Instead they seem to have opted for something intended for a smart phone.Dissapointing.  I regret spending even the sale price of £4.99. "

There is little to no exploration, you simply move from arena to arena fighting monsters. This game is disappointing is disappointing in it's own right, it should never had bared the castlevania name.Also, many of the sound affects were ripped from old PC games. Many of the ""atmosphere"" sounds were taken directly from Classic Everquest. Many world of warcraft sounds were used as well.

												I've been playing Castlevania games since the MSX days and loved most of them. The new 3D Castlevania games I have always skipped thinking that they'd be not as good as the old 2D times. With this one being my 1st 3D Castlevania, I have to agree with my thoughts - they 3D Castlevania really is no good game.Okay, sound, animations and graphics are really excellently done. But when I look at the rest of the game I only can say that they've made a rush job.Just look at the controls. You MUST use a X-BOX controller because the controls with mouse & keyboard are simply unplayable. And I am no controller player.Then the 'manual'. Well, that's lacking big-time. Finishing off a monster, press R1 the game tells me. And next..? Not a single hint on what to do >:( And it's very frustrating to have a boss monster at it's last health and not knowing how to finish it off, OR when I finally find out, just be that split-second too late to press that one (which one?) button.

												There are three kinds of videogames - casual, competitive and hardcore. This game is hardcore. However, hardcore difficulty can be different. One type of difficulty involves some training that can be helplful in a lot of different games once you've mastered it. For example, you learn to react faster, to shoot accurately, etc. This makes sense. However, the other type of hardcore ""difficulty"" is a fake one - there is a boss or a sequence which requires specific inputs of commands from player, and the only way to progress is to learn this sequence. Learning this once won't provide any actual skill increase, because it is useless anywhere else (even within the same game). You can guess which type of difficulty this game has. Yes, it is the bad one. So, I can't recommend it to anyone who wants to either have fun or learn some universal skills to get better at videogames. The best way to ""play"" this is watch some youtube video and enjoy the story.			"

Castlevania: LoS actually sucks the fun out of me instead of providing it.Now, let me describe what's wrong with the game -everything.Second level is a slow swamp level in which you slowly walk around the slow-paced location full of slow mud that makes you slow. Great way to start the game.Have I mentioned cutscenes? I just encountered a moment when I skipped a cutscene just to get welcomed by another cutscene. Not to mention the 30s long cutscenes that present locations in which you spend less than 10 seconds.Combat is as generic as it gets and for most of the time you can just press RT, do the QTE and repeat that until everything is dead. I also hope you enjoy beating enemies till their HP is low so you can mount them to cross a bridge/destroy a gate/climb a wall since at times you'll have to do that 5 times a level.Yeah...no.			"

												An okay God of War style game with an annoying camera and unintuitive combat controls that keep stacking on awkward button hold combinations as you unlock more skills. Music is awesome and story takes a number of hours to get interesting. Gets tedious very quickly without much to keep the player invested. During dramatic quick time events, like trying to hold onto a giant boss you are climbing, Gabriel doesnt respond to your button press. You either flail around and fall off or flail around and dont fall off. Stuff like this creates a disconnect between you and what is happening and can cause you to fail because you question your own timing.

												(please keep in mind that I have not played any of those games people compare this one to.)I really liked this one. yes, it has its flaws, like, the fixed camera is sometimes not where you'd want it to be. but for me it was only mildly annoying at some points. I think I precisely liked it for the fixed camera: it's the first time I actually played a game with a controller, and not having to worry about the camera sure did help me in being comfortable with the controls. the story is... a bit cliche, but overall good. I liked it. What would you expect for a video game story, anyway? the gameplay is just fantastic, even if you are not used to play with a controller, trust me, get one!! it feels like the only way to play this. it just feels natural, good. the lenght, well, around 25 hours according to steam. too short for full price (there's no way I'll  pay more than 1E/hour for almost any game), but since I got it on sale... I really think it was well worth my money. thanks to this, now I'm looking forward to play more modern hack and slash titles...			"

												Oh boy, where to begin . . .I rarely write an anti recomentation but this game absolutely deserves one. Castlevania: Lords of Shadows is a beautiful game with a lot of fine 3d modelling and great texturing all over, unfortunately that alone doesn't yet make a great game. In this product, outdated game design meets up with all the wrong kind of innovations of the new era. Whole product has a smell of artificially prolonged lenght all over it and quick time events will drive you aboslutely insane. Combat, which you do most of the time in the game is tedious, boring and unresponsive (not to mention unaccurate). Most of the time level design makes no sense and otherwise well done backgrounds lose their appeal when only thing you do is climb a wall after another just to meet up with a wall that can't be climbed until certain enemy is defeated.  Game's camera does it's best to be an additional enemy among the unimaginative and cliche-filled enemy charter. Voice acting is one of the worse I have ever heard and competes for the last place with Finnish children's animation dubbing. Music works quite well, but same can't be said for the rest of the sounds that work just as an addional (and bland) effects instead of adding to gameplay or experience. Please save your money for something more worth while.  "

Instead I got something more like resident evil 2 with quicktime events everywhere.In conclusion this game was a dissapointment and I do not recommend it.			"

												Bought it on Steam sale and wanted to play it on my PC with mouse and keyboard. I´ve just finished chapter 1. Wanted to like that game but there is a fixed camera which automatically adjusts itself. During combat the hardest fight you have is with the camera. It´s constantly changing the view means you always have to re-orientate yourself and readjust what you want to do or need to do (aim, block jump move direction). Sometimes the camera doesn´t even show you important parts of the enemy or your playing character and you can´t do anything against it yourself manually. Only do some uncontrolled movement until the camera gives you a useful view. That makes combat really annoying and time consuming.I´ve played both Darksiders and DMC, no complaints here.I will play on with the lowest  difficulty to see if at least the nice atmosphere and the nice artwork is worth my playing time. Update after 2/3 of the playthrough. Even more fascinated by the wondereful and detailed artwork and the audio specially the part from Patrick Stewart. But - Quit playing - because the game mechanics and excessive quick time events drove me insane. And you have to have a gamepad or controller. There certain actions where you have to do fast movements with the left analog stick (360 circle, zigzag). This is impossible to do with WASD on the keyboard. And not all controllers are working.

												I bought this game on the opinions of people that I thought had similar tastes to mine. This game however, is a slow ponderous mess of bad design and boring monologues of which I just couldn't tolerate to find those gems of gameplay that apparently exist... somewhere.If you must play it, then grab it from the bottom of the bargain bin like me, so that your disappointment can be lessened.I'm going to go and play The Witcher 2 instead, for some real adventure.

												Half of your time spent in this game will be QTEs and cutscenes. Areas that look like they should be accessible are blocked by invisible walls. The camera zooms way out and yet somehow you still can't see anything. The platforming(?) is clunky and boring. The combat is decent when it isn't filled with QTEs, and the story seems interesting. I can't bring myself to finish it though. I dislike playing it that much.			"

												Castlevania: Lord of Shadow is an Ultimate let down, nothing like I thought it would be. When I heard that this game was coming out, I could not wait to play it. The graphics is great I give it a 10/10 as well as the music and sound, but you can't move the cam around, your view is restriced. Most of the time I could not figure out what to due, a hint would be nice. You spend a lot of time trying to figure out what the game wants from you due to poor view. They do give you hints from time to time but other times nothing when you really need it. If you want to play a better Castlevania game, play the N64 version instead.I give this game a  3.5/10			"

												If you can endure the terrible game that is everything up until the ""last"" boss of the original game, then the last two levels are fine. The (REAL) last boss was fun and his stages were cool as♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the puzzles at the epilogue levels were fun and required some thought, but the rest of the game is so mediocre and repetetive that it isn't worth it. The beginning is especially bad because of all the forced tutorials with no flow what so ever. The bosses goes from♥♥♥♥♥♥ to decent, to pretty fun and challenging. it's a mixed bag where i think it's the only part where you can't really take an objective standpoint unlike the other flaws. the first boss, however, feels like a shoddy version of a shadow of the colossus boss.The story... oh my god, the story.It's♥♥♥♥♥♥ enough said. The characters feels so unoriginal, likewise the story and its premises. in fact it is so cringeworthy that i literally stopped watching cutscenes because i was afraid there was dialogue, even if the cutscenes were generally great from a visual standpoint. In fact the aesthetic of the game is great and i felt very drawn into this world.The hidden gem of this game really is the UI. it's stylished perfectly and beautiful. i honestly think if they made a 2d game in the style of the combo-previews i would love the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta that game.There are some great stuff about this game, like puzzles, some bosses and the UI, but the terrible start, ridiculous story and just the general mediocrity of the gameplay and stages doesn't make it worth playing. Don't waste your time.			"

												I wanted to love this game, I really did. But there are a few things that I can't overlook that just make it a chore to play and enjoy.- Fixed Camera. Ok, this is a holdover from its console heritage, and I realise it couldn't be reworked at all. It's still unforgiveable that the game will often obscure the action on-screen. If you play on the higher difficulties this becomes a big issue very quickly. Finding alternate paths is at best frustrating and at worst non existent because of it. - No lock on. WHY.- You can't remap your controller. This is more than an oversight, it's unforgiveable in a PC ""Ultimate Edition"". Which is exacerbated by the awful and unintuitive default pad layout. A third party program won't help you either because combos/QTEs obviously use the default bindings. And no, I'm not going to play a spectacle fighter on M&KB; I wouldn't play tennis with a baseball bat either. - Combos that are comprised of at most 3 buttons in different sequences. Deep.- QTEs are mandatory. The sequel apparently fixed this by having them as an optional toggle, alas not here. Who actually enjoys QTEs? You spend more time watching for button prompts than you do the on-screen action. Screw that.- When you die, the game will promptly ask you if you want to revert to the latest checkpoint. Every time. It'll also ask you to confirm your choice. Every time. And this was a superior alternative than, oh I don't know...just defaulting to the last checkpoint reached without having to verify it twice? Utterly redundant. - Set piece ""Titan"" bosses. Which look impressive but play the same every single time: 1) Scale titan. 2) Hang on 3) Find weak point 4) Button mash to destroy a weakpoint 5) Dodge highly cinematic titanic arm grab dramatically6) Get thrown off because gravity7) Go to 1 In other words, Titan battles are glorified QTEs which require no skill. Just patience. A lot of patience.- The script/story. I certainly wasn't expecting a gothic masterpiece, but Patrick Stewart manfully struggles with a script and dialogue that's frankly embarassing even in the context of video game writing. I can only assume/hope a lot was lost intranslation because hooboy. At one point he utters the immortal line ""I could not tell who was the prey, and who was the hunted."" I don't know about you, but where I'm from, prey and hunted are, you know, the same thing o_OIt does look gorgeous and perform well. I'll give it that. But it's not enough to save it for me. Which is a shame, because on paper this game sounded awesome. At least I picked it up on a sale, I'd be far more salty if I'd paid the usual asking price.			"

												Not as cool as other installments in the Castlevania franchise, but still fun-ish. Some of the levels (particularly the music box level and the Dracolich boss fight) can get incredibly annoying and you'll most likely want to punch a hole in your monitor. Still though, the story is good. The combat is only slightly interesting, playing on the God of War styles, and the puzzle, while few, are decently challenging enough. Again, not the best game in the franchise, but still cool.			"

												Lets start with the positive before going negatice. Awesome music! The combat system is standard hack and slash but the main character is a sitting duck when ever you jump. And jumping to get smaller enemies into combos is essential when you want to take out enemies without having someone poke you in the back. Having an easier way to get back to the ground or an air dash would have been great. The camera will be the bane of every object you crush as you fall to enemies that are shaded the same as the floor, platforming that has sudden camera angle switches and boss battles where you get carsick from the camera spinning you right round like a record.If you get this game, do yourself a favor and don't play the 2nd DLC. The 1st DLC isn't too bad if you have a guide nearby to help with platforming segments that point out that the main character isn't agile enough to do platforming. The 2nd DLC will put you up against a boss that is more bullet sponge than enemy. Expect to have to do precision mid-air whip aiming which is something the game never made you have to do. Others have said that it appears that the 2nd DLC was farmed out but that shouldn't break the auto-targeting. About 4 hours of my playthrough was with that last boss and the holes in my wall just isn't worth the aggravation. Get the game on sale for $10 or so and you can have a pretty good time if you like 3D action games. Just never play Chapter 14 if you value your sanity or the skin on your hand as you punch your monitor into the wall.			"

												I haven't been playing this game for too long, but my opinions on it changed multiple times through short period of time I spent on it. I'm a huge fan of classic NES Castlevania games, as well as classic universal horror movies. And when I was playing first level, it was great - rainy dirty village in the night, with werewolves attacking the villagers, great music. It SCREAMED ""CASTLEVANIA"". But then something really awkward started to happen. First of all, next few hours of the day were at daytime. Second of all - goblins, trolls, forest spirits...where are all the cheesy horror monsters? Why this looks like a classic medieval fantasy instead of gothic horror-themed game? And this game is boring. Fighting is boring, and that's a surprise for me, because I love brawlers. You are constantly served with new mechanics and moves. YOU HAD TWO ♥♥♥♥ING ATTACKS IN CASTLEVANIA. This is the case when constant upgrades is just plainly boring.And I would have forgiven this game if it had some gothic environment - why couldn't forest be foggy and dark instead of generic ""beautiful"" forest with huge tree in the middle straight out of the Ocarina of Time?

I've played a few Castlevania games on Nintendo (NES) so this is a new experience.At first I was confused... ""Who is this Gabriel Belmont?"" I know who Simon Belmont is but not Gabriel.The gameplay is decent. It's keyboard only so I made changes to have the number pad do things so my fingers were more spaced out. F*cking stupid console controls.The graphics, music and overall quality is amazing though, very well done and challenging!SPOILERSApparently Gabriel is a vampire hunter who later becomes Dracula, that's pretty cool, and also the grandfather of Simon Belmont.7/10 "

												Controls on this game SUCK!  Seems to be meant for another platform, not PC.  Prime example, you have to throw a rock back at one point in the game by going around your forward, left, right and back movement controls.  W,A,S,D and it takes some time to figure out the timing and speed.  Not just that, I like to be able to control my forward view.  This game is set up to be more movie that a game.			"

If you don't own a controller do not buy this gametl;dnr : Do not buy unless on sale or if you are a sadist.---Warning-----Review contains minor Spoilers---Warning-----I bought this game recently on a steam sale because i enjoyed its sequel. Looking back now i probably wouldn't buy it again.First the good parts:* This game has a realy nice aesthetic to it and its story telling is immersive. You can feel the struggle of you hero while he spirals down into darkness.* The world is a dark and grimm place like you would expect from a world cut off to the heavens.* You can autosolve all puzzles (but you wont get exp)* Puzzles are mostly funNow the bad: The camera is fixed. Its just a cheap way to hide secrets, since most of the time you dont see the entrence of the area where you need to go. This also leads to abysmal fights since enemies are often offscreen or infront of the camera. The combat system: The whole comabt system ist balanced around not getting hit and using your two powers. One can heal you and the other one lets you deal bonus damage. But in order to use them you need to hit enemies to fill your combo bar. When full your hits produce little orbs which you can absorb into either of your power bars to fuel them. If you get hit you have to restart filling the combobar. Now what happens if you have low HP and low healingbar? Well you are quit ♥♥♥♥ed. Minibosses just love when they can onehit you and play their little 20 sec cutscene again and again. Best way to heal yourself? Here fight 5 enemies. The whole system is flawed at its core: you need to hit enemies in order to fill your powerbars  Entering in one of the power modes wont let you collect powerorbs. Gitting hit still cancels the combo   So in order to heal you need to fight, but you dont want to fight since you are low on Hp  The Damage Power is mostly useless. You want the orbs for your healing power but you cant  collect them if you deal bonus damage.   While timed blocking quickly fills your combo bar, many enemies have fast unblockable attacks and attack in groups, so if you block one you get hit by another one. And one of the worst things is, that late in the game you get wings which let you double jump. While this is nice to dodge stuff and usefull for a lot off puzzles they have one major flaw. If you are in healing mode and double jump then you perform a special attack draing half of your max healing power pool and blind all enemies. But bosses for example dont get blinded and most of the time you desperatly need this healing. To many unskippable cutscenes. You died? Here have this 20 sec animation of this creep again and then let him kill you There are little deamons which steal your gear from time to time just to annoy you. But you cant even kill them to get some sort of satisfaction. A lot of charaktes are think you have the memory of a fish and need to repeat their objective for you every 10 sec. Not a surprise that you feel more reliefed than sad when they have a tragic death. to many quick time eventsWhile i beat this game on hard diffculty i did not enjoy it most of the time and just wanted to progress in the story and get it over with			"

												The game is fairly good, but with many things to improve. I liked the story and love the artwork, specially the extra levels after the final boss. If you like games like Zelda titles, Prince of Persia, and the like, and you are also very patient, the games is good enough. I'd rate it 6 or 7 out of 10.I usually read reviews in order to find out the bad things, if you do the same, these are the bad things in this game IMO: many sections are repetitive, you just do the same thing to progress in the game. This is particularly bad with bosses, since you don't really feel the bosses are cool fights. After the first one, pretty much all the rest are the same: you whip them till they die. About the Zelda games I mentioned: there you get new weapons, you defeat bosses in new ways using your new weapons. That is what this game is missing. Also, I found utterly ridiculous that you have to beat levels to get some upgrades then go back several levels to get other upgrades. That doesn't even make sense and levels are not that cool as to say, ""ok, i don't mind going back and repeat that level because it was cool"".Also there are points where ""challenging"" is replaced by ""frustrating"", you make small simple mistakes and you have to re-do a lot of things. And it's not the ""ima git gud and beat this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ challenge to prove myself"" kind of thing, you just have to perform boring stuff all over again in penalty for small mistakes caused by serious unfairness.And finally, the controls, in many sections the controls behave in a weird way, which causes you to fail what you have to do. It puts you in disadvantage against the game, not in the ""git gud"" way, but in the ""♥♥♥♥, the control response is ♥♥♥♥ed up"" way.Overall however, if you have a good amount of patient, you can forgive these things and have a good time playing. Also, pretty brutal finishing-off moves for bosses :D			"

												This game when watching the trailor which got me to purchase the game, the BIG issue i have with the game on PC.1, No camrea movement. 2, its very linear you cannot look around with the mouse.3, the way the controls are set out seems to be for a left handed person.4,there has been no thought from the studio developers into the usual Keyboard and mouse i.e. left mouse button fight with weapon space bar jump etc.the game is not a cheap game to purchase and is not worth a PC player to buy this game, i altered some of the controls for the mouse and keyboard and still found the process of playing frustrating, Wish i had saved my money.

I could not get past the bad controls. Perhaps I will pick this up for another platfrom in the future. At this moment, this is not a game I recommend.The difficulty levels are not up to par with the controls, so if you are considering buying it for the PC, please use an external game controller. Keyboard + mouse is a no go.Being used to very well developed games, the camera in this game is very bad. For instance, you can turn your character around, but not he camera, it is fixed. Why they ever designed the game this way is beyond me, it feels very 1990-tish.			"

												I pray to Dark Souls every night before I go to bed. This game is not nearly as good.While this game does have some strong points, it is ultimately plagued by gameplay that I feel is very uninspired, repetitive, and heavily scripted. That is ultimately why I do not recommend this game. I wanted to like this game as I am a fan of the old-school castlevania games myself (which are quite superior)Pros:- Graphics that look good even now. . . .6 years after it has been released. They are especially good if you install the helix mod and sweetfx mod.- The game has some nice music, but the game needs to use it more often.- Combat, overall, is quite nice. If you are a god of war or DMC fan, you will enjoy it. However, I didn't like it that much as I heavliy prefer Dark Souls styled combat to this game. Level Design and Camera also makes combat worse as I will explain in a moment.- The game is prettly lengthy at 20+ hours.- Story so far is. . . . .a mixed bag for me. It doesn't complement the other elements of the game as it is a little confusing and dis-jointed. It is interesting, but it isn't flushed out enough to really take a from that I can like.Cons:- Camera: This game is the perfect example of why giving players the ability to control the camera is so important. Even if the camera is always positioned perfectly in platforming and combat (which it isn't all of the time as I am often fighting enemies off-screen) the game encourages the player to explore the level and find secrets. However, it is hard to do and painful with a camera that can't be controlled.- The level design of this game is uninspired and repetitive. First, there's a flat area where you fight monsters. Then, there's a platforming section that feels heavily scripted with the ledge-jumping and gripping mechanics that the game has. Then, more fighting in flat areas where the environment doesn't change how the fighting happens. To be fair, the game introduces a little bit of variety through giving the player new abilities, weapons, and creatures to fight a lot of the time, but that doesn't change the fact that the environments do not add any depth to the gameplay. Castlevania 4, on the other hand, had many areas where the environment greatly affected how you fought enemies, and platforming was fun and not scripted in that game. Combat and Platforming complemented each other and made the game extremely fun and varied. However, Castlevania: Lord of Shadows has bland combat and bland platforming sprinkled throughout the game. If it weren't for the good combat mechanics, I'd feel like this game would be terrible.- A lot of boss battles are just glorified Quick-Time events. I HATE quick-time events in a game. There are also times when I fight bosses where I have no idea what I'm suppose to do because the game doesn't properly communicate anything to me, and these boss fights aren't like the ""Legend of Zelda"" bosses where you have fun figuring out how to fight the bosses. You might be hanging on the side of a boss when the boss just knocks you off of him without the game giving any clear indication of how to prevent that form happening. Remember that these fights feel heavily scripted, and creativity just doesn't help when you are restricted in the scripted-style climbing that the game requires of you. To be fair, though, the bosses in the game look awesome, and it's cool climbing up their gigantic form.- The game plays terribly with keyboard and mouse. A controller is REQUIRED.Overall, I do not recommend this game. The game doesn't really have anything redeeming quality that makes it stand out and worth purchasing, and the combat and story are only decent. There isn't really anything that really ""carries"" this game and makes it better than others. It would be an good game if it didn't have the major issues that turned me off. Even if the 6 year-old graphics are impressive, visuals do NOT make a game.But even if the game is only mediocre, I'll still finish the game. I'm interseted to see where the game goes from here, and I want to make this review ""complete.""			"

												Castlevania fan since super castlevania iv.Maybe when this game came out three years ago it was better, but as it is now it has not aged well.Combat, puzzles, and exploration all feel clunky. Controls are inconsistant. Ok I climbed up this ledge and now i have to bash through a window by jumping off the wall, so push jump right? No, you push X? Stuff like that happens too much.Combat is cheap. Enemies will attack you mid attack with unblockable attacks randomly. Compared to games like devil may cry and god of war, the developrs tried but fell short to come up with a solid combat system. And why do I have to stop, run away from an enemy and hold down joystick buttons to absorb their enegry all the time? It just ruins the flow of combat. The ups are that the game still looks nice, production values are high, and the story is delivered well, even though it can be melodramatic. And now that its 2014 lets all agree that clock type rotation puzzles are unfun and should be given to children as a punishment.			"

												            Aight so to put it simply I really didn't like this game a whole lot at all? I just have a lot of issues with just about everything, the story isn't bad by default in fact I certainly do believe that it had potential to be amazing. What lies central to the story is this moral about how love can change a person and it feels like it's trying to go for this love can make a person evil or something? The game is fond of telling you what's going on instead of showing you what's going on. The game will tell you that Gabriel has been having problems to trying to sleep but at no point during actual gameplay is this a factor or even remotely shown at all. Also why should I care about Marie, she only ever shows up to tell Gabriel ""I love you and keep going."" and that's basically it?          Gameplay-wise it's just a God of War clone the gameplay isn't awful but it's also not great, it definitely favors blocking as opposed to dodge rolling, which i never got used to, that's just a personal preference i realize. The music and the voice acting itself is pretty dope, nice to listen to for sure. If you're gonna get it, get it on sale, just don't buy it full price it is not worth it whatsoever.			"

												Avoid at all costs. The reaction times for the QTEs involve hitting RT when two circles match each other. However, depending on whether the game is lagging, what screen size you're using, or whether the moon is in the 5th house of Scorpio, it doesn't work. The reaction time for the QTE is so slow, and there is no margin for error at all as the area is hair thin, you're stuffed. Look up on YouTube 'Swamp Troll battle'. Notice people are using the keyboard - I think it's because this port doesn't accept the pad so readily.Oh, and each time you miss, the enemies regenerate 1/4 health and you don't. Nor can you use potions to heal. Brilliant!This game has stolen an hour of my existence. Could have been fun if Konami had cared to make sure the QTEs wouldn't block players from progressing through the story.			"

												I play a lot of bad games but as long as they do not take themselves to seriously or are funny then I don't mind; I will play the worst games ever as long as their is some part of it which entertains me. However this game is not fun; its nice when you finish a part as you think ""I getting closer to finishing and never having to play again"" but that is it, I hate this game with a passion and I feel like it will remain that way for years to come. The game seems to be trying to be like God of War and Prince of Persia with the Castlevania decor. The combat is not finished and needs ajustments in small numerical ways like stager points and still time during moves. The camera is♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have been shouting about the camera for so long; you give these lovely looking area and give a nice view to see it but a terrbile view for fighting where enimies can easily hide in blindspots and then hit you from the shadows; in a game where not getting hit and hitting them to gain ""focus"" is important this is terrible games design, also your weapon. It is cool and iconic but it becomes weak, maybe you do later but at the moment it is not doing enough dmage for the enimies; its just a long duration of me slowly taking their health down while evading, if you want to be like God of War add a method for making the weapons stronger as the combos don't seem to add that much more powers; just variety. The story is okay but charaters are not to well portrayed and some are just terrible. The main's head seems a little off close up but other than him the visuals are good. Has hoping that the game got better but it doesn't and I am half way through the game at the moment. Decided that I will finish this game and I have made a great mistake in that decision.If your thinking of getting the game be carefull as even a large amount of alchohol doesn't fix it.			"

												Tight PlatformingMethodical CombatFamiliarity-based ExplorationSense of Character ProgressionEverything you love about the Igarashi-era Castlevania series...... none of which can be found here. Instead, what you get is a God-of-War-like, Quicktime Event riddled, ""Western Take"" on a truly beloved franchise.  Everything down to the feel of the ""whip"" weapon and ""kill all enemies to proceed"" gameplay elements from God of War (read: Devil May Cry) is here, and gone are the things that made Castlevania so magical.  The story takes itself seriously (a huge no-no for a great Castlevania game: ""WHAT IS A MAN!?"") and feels SO serious that there's hardly any levity or fun to be had in the narrative, let alone the gameplay.  If you want to play a better version of this game, go play Darksiders, or Devil May Cry, or God of War... if you want Castlevania... well, you're just going to have to wait for Bloodstained.			"

												I have found this game to be extremely aggravating and time consuming.  It givesa you a tutorial in the begining  but will not let you start your game over if, as you progress you decide that you don't want to play this character the way you started out but want to make changes in the way you do things. so you end up with a game that makes you continue forward weither you want to or not.  the user interface is none existent, and heaven help you if you have been away from the game for a while and can't remember how to play the toon you are screwed.  because you won't be able to access the tutorial ever again.  in short I would recommend a ""ROOT CANAL"" being done to you before I would recommend this game.

												Honestly this is a Castlevania as good as the original game from mid 80s. It has no open worlds like you were used in the past games but straight forward. Your Belmont looks like a superultrastrong cartoon hero from the 80s, bulky but charming in his presence, noble and dramatic like a british actor, deadly as Dracula himself.Only downside for us story nerds: the (very good) story will begin at ca the last third ofthe game :(			"

												NOT GOOD! I was finding the game difficult even on easy setting, and then i came across the lord of the lycans part 2 boss fight and never got any further. Should it be this difficult on easy mode? REALLY?This is one game i will never see the ending of. And i don't like spending good money for game i cannot possibly see the ending. It's like renting a Blueray that stops playing halfway through.Only buy if you like banging your head against a brick wall! God of War is far superior and more enjoyable.			"

												IDK why, it seems I cant get myself to love this game. I cant seem to complete one combo without dodging, AI fight pattern are too easy to predict, not much enemy variety, the quicktime event is boring, you have to complete the game and replay it a few times just to to get all the upgrades for your equipments, that static camera thingy, I hate it, the gameplay overall is mehhh. You can use keyboard and mouse if you frequently play hack and slash with it, gamepad is preferable tho.Good voice acting, good story, good visual. Still if you like casual hack and slash, I would recommend this.			"

												It's... meh.  The controls are clunky (seriously, no mouse support?), the fixed camera angles are counter-productive, and the story segments/intermissions, though voiced by Patrick Stewart, are uninspired and badly-written.  The feedback of the hack-and-slash combat is somewhat enjoyable, but nowhere near worth its $30.00 pricetag.  I feel cheated.			"

												There's a trailer for Lords of Shadow on its Steam Store page, showcasing a bunch of exciting and interesting moments from the game. Most of these moments are from the last half of the game. I'll let that statement stand as commentary on the game's length and pacing, both of which isn't all that great.SHORT VERSION:Basically, it's a no-go, unless you're a really BIG fan of 'God of War clone'-type games. It's super linear (with unecessary ""backtracking"" of whole levels at once for one or two item upgrades at a time), the music is unmemorable, and the gameplay is painfully mediocre, and the game as a whole drags itself out for way longer than it needed to.LONG VERSION:The gameplay is basically what you'd expect from a 'God of War clone'-type game. You jump a bit around, do some slow-ish climbing, and hack'n'slash a whole bunch of enemies. It doesn't bring much new stuff to the table, although there's an interesting mechanic with Light and Dark magic, making you choose between attacks that heal or deal more damage, but unfortunately the mechanic isn't really made use of to its fullest until the very end of the game. Some of the boss fights are interesting, even a bit fun, but as with the regular enemy fights, they get dragged out too long half the time and just feel like a chore in the end.The maps and locations look pretty at times, but the locked camera angles makes it a less enjoyable trip, because it is often hard to tell what you can interact with or move around on and what's blocked by a jarringly sudden invisible wall.Finally, storywise, it's a bit of a mess, while the story is generally interesting, the final cutscene doesn't make any sense unless you play the DLC afterwards (luckily you get that for free in this version of the game), and while Patrick Stewart's narration between levels is really good, the disconnect between Gabriel's described personality in the narration and how he acts in-game and in cutscenes is a bit weird. The story builds up to a lot but it falls really flat because the story's way longer than it should be; the first half of the game just feels unecessary.  SO YEAH.			"

												Had a lot of hope for this game...  The art work is amazing, the music is very mood-setting, the enemy designs were interesting.  That said, it is a lesser version of God of War, any of which I would play again before this title.  The levels are short, which is nice, but each one is introduced by a reading from Mr. Stuart, which while good, gets tiresome when the writing is so repetitive and boring.  Level after level of ""I watch my friend, there is a darkness growing in him, enemies beware.""  If you just want a Castelvania game set to a God of War combat system (same moves and everything), go for it.  The art work, again, is amazing.  You want a solid gaming experience, you might wanna look elsewhere...In the end, and no spoilers here, there were some pretty glaring plot holes and continuity errors that left the ending a bit of a let down, that and the fact that the final fight was by far the easiest.  Then there is the DLC.  I pushed through this in the hopes that some flaws in the story would be corrected or at least explained.  Nope.  The writing got worse, the whining hero got worse, the monologuing (don't get me started on the 10 minute+ bit at the end of the primary game), but the levels got worse.  In the end, the hardest part was when they dragged out the flee-upwards-while-lave-rises-for-no reason and platform hopping schemes.  Let's not forget the multi-stage boss fight that just rehashed itself each time.  Sadly, I bought this, the DLC, the sequel and the true sequel during a sale.  So... dang... I guess I am in it fot he long-haul... hopefully it gets better before it gets any worse...			"

												I want so, so, SO badly to like this game, because I'm interested in the story and the sequels. But it's just not good. The presentation and lore is great, but the gameplay is PAINFULLY mediocre. I'm talking mind numbingly boring.  I'm torn between putting the game away for a time when I find myself without internet or a job (having time to kill) or just YouTubing the cutscenes and moving on to the sequel.Pros:-Amazing visuals. It's almost at the level of Trine 2, which was a 2D game.-Interesting lore. Avenging love lost. Gothic theme. Dracula's origin story. I'm not versed in Castlevanie lore but this seems like a fine reboot of it.-All-Star voice acting. Enough said.-Journal offers bits of lore via beastiary entries and equipment descriptions, etc.-*Seemingly* long. My playtime shows the time it took to clear chapter 1. From the map screen, it seems like there's at least 9 chapters.-Out of absolutely nowhere, a little fairy appeared and showed me her boobs. This pleased me greatly.Cons:-Lacking soundscaping. The level of audio detail does not match the visual detail. For example, a big titan crushing it's fist into solid ice has no crunch to it, just a weak *whomp*.-Linear level design. Every level is a corridor. No, seriously. It's like Crash Bandicoot. I'm not kidding you. You have branching ""Y"" paths that later rejoin to the same area. Just like in Crash Bandicoot.-Simple combat. It's skill based character action, but it lacks nuance. It's not bad, but it's a total bore.-Simple platforming. Think Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, but dumbed down for 6 year olds.-Clunky controls. The game never stops showing what button you need to press to do what. The problem is that it does it for good reason. You aren't taught the basic scheme of the game via repetition. Buttons do unique things at every turn that you would have too much difficulty figuring out on your own. Climb on a big boss's arm. Hit the gem with ""B"". It's stupid that the game's still showing me tutorials, yet I'm grateful because I probably would have been lost as to what the game needs me to do. I didn't know I'm climbing to the gem to hit it. Ugh...It's just a stupidly bland game. Most of all, it doesn't feel at all like Castlevania 1. You know what does feel like Castlevania 1? Dark Souls. Go play that instead.			"

												A God of War clone. A Castlevania game in name only. Although, it is rendered fully in 3d, one cannot operate the camera angle so it becomes the absolutely worst enemy in the game. All the ""secrets"" are ""secrets"" only because there is no map to see the invisible walls and sudden nooks and crannys in levels, so you stumble on them accidentally. The camera doesn't help here, either.Fights tend to be tedious button smashings and the boss fights, though big and multi-layered, suffer from the camera (again), or should I say ""view point"". Oh: and of course there is no target locking, so pray those daggers choose to fly towards the enemy.There are far better Castlevania or metroidvania games out there; do not waste your time on this one. This is not even a good hack'n'slash, so maybe put your money in Devil May Crys?			"

												I love Castlevania games (not just the Metroidvania ones) but the gameplay in this one is really repetetive - you walk from fight to fight, usually you fight some smaller enemies around one larger enemy. Then there are titan fights and I found them no fun at all - they're nice to look at but gameplay-wise just a reaction game, not a real boss fight. I was aware that this game was closer to God of War than to previous Castlevania games, but I hoped that at least the scenary and lots of different enemy types would give me a Castlevania feel. Sadly the variation of enemy types if very low.			"

												Quite possibly the worst game I've ever played. You spend more time fighting the controls than the enemy. There is no animation canceling, or inviniciblity frames. The game also punishes for not being able to follow their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls, and has no use of combos. The only move you ever need is X,X,X as it mini-stuns while Y doesn't do anything but hit in an AoE but lack mini-stuns. Every enemy in the game stuns on hitting you, including the 3ft tall flying imp demons who attack every 2 seconds, and appear on average in groups of 4. At one part you fight 20 of them at once. The Shadow Magic is also terribly useless with no visible difference in damage at all. Not even 20% difference. The combo meter also takes about 50 hits in a row to activate so you can began healing but you can't get hit at all, and most encouters end in ~10-15 hits. DON'T BUY THIS GAME EVER.			"

												I really can't recommend this game, esspecial not at a high price tag of $30. It's not worth the frustration over stupid issues where they either played on bad controls to add difficulty or just decided to be lazy and not play test it. And given that it includes some DLC that also seems lazily made it's really kind of pathetic that this is what they put in for a reboot of such a loved franchise. I bought it on sale, and it's kind of worth it for that; except that it doesn't come with controller support native aside from Xbox controller and while the keyboard controls aren't too bad they aren't good enough not to complain. Over all it's a solid combat system that feel like God of War meets Devil May Cry, but after that it's a clumsy platformer with a fixed camera and by the end relys on the ""move fast enough on these platforms or die and start over"" mechanic (which only highlights how bad of a platformer it is) to be worth the money they're looking for.

												Though I'm not recommending Lords of Shadow, it's not necessarily bad. It's just not worthy of playing when there are better titles out there in the same genre. If you've played all of those then LoS could still be worth a purchase for you.My biggest complaints are the following:1) The game feels too gimmicky. You acquire several new abilities that you'll need to progress in the game. It doesn't feel fun or clever when using the abilities. It feels like a pointless roadblock.2) The fixed camera can be extremely frustrating.3) Combat gets tiring as the game continues on. The purchased abilities pale in comparison to something like Devil May Cry. The game can be finished using primarily attack patterns purchased early in the game. 4) While not bad, the music is weak compared to other Castlevania titles. None of the tracks are very memorable. And no Bloody Tears? What?5) Quick time events are...well...quick time events.The voice acting and visuals deliver a strong sense of immersion. The story is decent enough and the characters are OK but nothing that will win an award. Lords of Shadow is obviously a well liked game, but it's not something that makes my recommendation list.			"

												I HATE this game. I dont ever write reviews... but THIS game deserves my hate. first of all I kinda like the story only for the character likeliness to the original story other than that the actual charaters in this game are boring and  have terrible un-inspired acting. Now for gameplay i tried playing this game on the Xbox 360 when it ariginally released and decided i didnt like it then cause of how there were many other games that did the same stuff except for better ...and than a few days ago i decided to pick it up cause it was on super sale for 7.99 , instantly didnt regret it because of the price originally ...but i kept having to put up with the clunky controls and boring QTE ...it started to wear on me ...and now im just done with this game ...i am so disapointed on what konami decided to do with the castlevania francise and glad they ended the series with just 3 games (although the second game is better than this one ) ....please konami ! do something nice to this series for a change!

												This game gets on my nerves so much.  I expected it to action orientated but there are far too many puzzles for my liking.  Think about it this way.  If there are so many flippin' puzzles that are always beat the same way every time.  Why on earth would you want to replay this game the puzzles already feel like a waste of time.  Stupid design flaw imo.  I've never been a fan of QTE's so that bugged me to.  Yes it's true you can't control the camera, that never bothered me tbh.  In fact I'd of geniunely enjoyed this game if there was more general fighting and less rip off Shadow of the Colossus boss fights in it.  The story is crud.  The graphics are wonderful even by todays standards but the cut scenes revert back to typical 360 and PS3 720p & 30fps gash.Basically I'd of loved it if the game was more action and combat envolved.  It has good combat mechanics with dumb platforming due to the fact you can't control the camera.  Some jumps you'll fall to your death as you can only estimate roughly where to jump.  On the default highest difficulty you'll often start levels where you'll get killed in 1 hit as your health carry's over from the previous level.  You'd expect to get full health at the start of every new level sighs...  F this game!			"

												I was excited to get stuck into Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - So many good things can be found on the forums and in the reviews.The combat is similar to that of God of War, you even have several 'Shadow of the Colossus'-esque boss battles. Each fight is riddled with epic bland-ness throughout. You are given the opportunity, and are reminded of this opportunity, at the end of each level, where you can spend your experience points for new combos and upgrades to combos which (For the time I played the game for) were unnecessary.The voice acting is absolutely amazing if you enjoy things below average! - The NPCs quite frequently enjoy stating the obvious every minute or so, occasionally even during combat to remind you that you're not there to fight werewolves, you're there to search for hidden purple glowing shards.The shards of which are near impossible to find due the incredible work of the camera angle hating you and your life.The music... It's so forgettable that I forgot what I was going to say about it.The story... Due to how much actually happens I will give you a snippet of the first 20 minutes of story;You play as a man gone insane due to losing his wife, to overcome your insanity your mind conjures up mythical beasts to kill. People fear you due to collateral damage you leave behind in your wake. Your weapon may only be a cross, but people can see that you are also cross, cross with life!While on the run from the peaceful settlement you just ravaged, a talking glowing pony comes to your aid, the pony says ""Lol, hop on, i'll take you to that place you want to be""Due to Gabriel being a complete psychopath he doesn't even question it - He hops straight on the back of this majestic beast and rides off, taking out several werewolves riding other, larger werewolves (Naturally).About half way to the destination that the pony said he would take you to, the pony stops and says ""Lol j/k. only taking you halfway, toodle pip!"" and it vanishes.Eventually getting to your destination you meet a goatman, which Gabriel doesn't question because Goatmen are obviously common place in a psychopaths mind. The Goatman gives him an opportunity to see his dead wife again, Gabriel jumps for joy and thinks he is strong enough to speak with the dead.Anyway, after saving his dead wife from a cieling pendulum axe he kills her, so she's now twice dead.Now on to the ratings!If Dracula is 'Excellent' andThe creature from the Black Lagoon  is 'Meh, it's alright'I would give this game a 'Bloodrayne'			"

												Castlevania, a simple cash in on a long dead franchise.  This game is terrible, beyond bad, its just absolute garbage.  This is one of those games with the most annoying gameplay elements in gaming histroy.  lets review the awful elements of this game which sadly make up the core of the game.1.  the story, dear god its all words on pages, in 2013 their all TLDR and if they dont care enough to animate it then why bother putting it in, noone cares, we want a game not a book.2.  It takes longer to restart after dying than to actually die.  This is a huge mistake in game design there are like 3-4 menus or a total of 5 steps everytime you die.  Why bother restarting the cursor is set to NO on do you want to restart, its like the devs are telling us dont bother playing this game it sucks.3.  EVERY boss fight ends in a QTE thing.  Whats worse is your not hitting button combos to challenge your skill, you watch two white circles come together and spam a random button, thats it.  If you hate QTE this has to be the worst implementation of QTE ever in a game.4.  In the first 5 minutes of the game is this water part you go in the water hands come up you die, who thought that was a good idea?  Whats after that MORE WATER with hands coming up killing you.  If you thought this was some hardcore platforming action, sadly your dead wrong.5.  cutscenes, they must be like almost EVERY 5 seconds, walk a couple seconds, CUTSCENE OUT OF EFFEN NOWHERE!  constantly over and over, just let me play the game stop interrupting.  the story cut scenes go on and on and on, theres no story there its all nothing, NOTHING, ever heard anyone talk about the awesome story in this game?  Of  course not because there isnt one, when a cut scene comes on just roll over and go to sleep and wake up when its done.  its like that old Metal gear crap with the 45 minute cut scenes, have mercy!6.  This game has a fixed camera system.  Remember how popular myst was back in what the 80s?  Well this game does the same thing, fixed camera, ugh.  what is next in castlevania a browser based text version of the game now with more seeds?This is a multimillion dollar game but its crap its not a pretty looking bargain bin game at best.  Whats worst is people in the gaming industry sit around whining all over about how they want the mainstream market.  NEWSFLASH with crap like this it aint going to happen, do they think everytime people die they want to sit through five menus?  Or every 5 seconds they need a cut scene showing the character walk into a room you just walked into?  This game is a classic example of how these whiny companies get mad and go out of business wondering why noone buys their games.  From junk play control to forced pausing of the game everytime a tutorial is on screen its terrible, its not a game if I cant play it and every ten seconds the game stops for some tutorial or longwinded story or brief cutscene.  Its thanks to games like this that the entire game industry suffers, when they suffer we suffer ending up with more junk games from the same people who know nothing about game development.  Any ten year old can and has coded games that isnt hard, making them fun and playable is an art, something this game doesnt do.  /rantRating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

												This was the first Castlevania game that I've played, so I'm not familiar with the world or lore.  This game tries to be an action game, a platformer, and a puzzler and generally failed to impress in any of those areas.  The graphics stand up to current standards and the game ran flawlessly, but there were a number of issues, which I'll go into with more detail.  The scenery and scale of the environment and bosses is very impressive at times.  The game took me about 21 hours to finish (including the DLC).  Boredom set in about 5-7 hours in, though, so it was a trudge.  As for some details on the problems with this game:- The camera is pretty annoying.  Its location is set to one or a few locations per room and moves abruptly.  It makes it a bit difficult to explore.  Also makes platforming very difficult at times.  There are also invisible walls everywhere, so the platforming path forward can be very tough to discern.- I didn't try to play with the keyboard and mouse, but plenty of reviewers have and it apparently it can be rage-inducing.  I went through the game with a DS4 controller, which is not natively supported (XB360 mapping).- The story and pacing is very awkward.  Very little introduction to the world and the bulk of the story occurs at the last 2/3rds of the game.  Not very engaging.- An online walk-through is pretty necessary unless you want to punish yourself.  There are alot of unintuitive puzzles and platform sections.  The game generally only provides hints when something completely new (item, skill, combo) is required to progress.There've got to be better games out there in this genre.  Doesn't help that the sequel (Lords of Shadow 2) got critically panned and then the studio broke up.  Overall I don't recommend this game unless you're a big Castlevania fan.			"

The start was promising, but I've actually managed to have less and less fun with each hour spent. What a waste.			"

												It is hard to judge this game. I wanted to like it. It started with promise, as a fun third-person action-platformer. At first, it was fun with the normal levels, and the bosses were bad. Then the boss fights got better, and quite different each.However, the experience was rough: the levels were hyper-linear; it is not possible to control the camera in any way; and some of the controls are plain bad (try double-tapping a direction with the left stick for running...). I won't talk about the story: it is dark and grim for being dark and grim, but its better to forget the story entirely - the game becomes much better that way (at least in my opinion).And then came the final boss, the Forgotten One. It started with a timed instant-death platforming section, followed by a slow battle with the boss. Then came an even more difficult instant-death platforming section, followed by even more of the _same_ slow battle with the boss. It was infuriating. My playthrough lasted around 37 hours; this final boss was around 7 hours of it. On the 2nd difficulty (of 4).Alltogether, this is a game, that is very close to be a fun, good game, but ultimately falls flat. I would not recommend playing it, there are much better candidates (better story, controls, less infuriating bosses, etc.). However, I would state, not much is needed to be good, so if you are prepared for the bad parts, it might be for you.			"

												I have played better Castlevania games on N64.The graphics are good, the controls are decent... It's the design that's so bad.The developers seem to not know the difference between ""difficult"", ""fun"", and ""wasting the player's time"".  Every section of the game seems to be designed around the fact that the developers were trying to make things more fun or more difficult, but instead just end up wasting the player's time.  In each section, there are tasks designed to probably make you have fun but instead they waste your time.You see how that works?  That previous paragraph had very little content, but it took you a longer time to read it than if I had just said ""this game wastes your time"".  That pretty much sums this game up.Here's an example:You enter a new setpiece.  The game shows you a cutscene panning around the setpiece to give you a look at the pretty graphics.  Then you have to run down the path that the cutscene just showed you, to the end where there's a cliff you jump down to block you from backtracking.  Now you fight some goblins.  Ok, what was the point of the whole cutscene and path I had to walk down?  Solely to waste my time before the combat.There's also numerous sections with Prince of Persia style platforming and wall climbing.  However, there's never any danger of dying.  If you do fall, you start back instantly right before the fall - no Sands of Time necessary.  Another mechanic meant to waste your time. Then there's the combat which seems to be the meat of this game.  You get experience and use it to unlock new abilities... But they all seem so useless.  Like, I'm never going to remember to hold the right trigger in the air and input this combo.  And if I did, what good would it do me?  ""Look, I'm swinging my whip in a different fashion!  Good thing I spent that 3000 xp to get this ability.""Oh yeah, and YOU DO NOT HAVE DIRECT CONTROL OF THE CAMERA!Then there's the story... Ugh.  If I had to make an analogy, I'd say the developers took everything good aboud God of War, Shadow of the Colossus, Prince of Persia, Devil May Cry, and Castlevania... and then they threw them out and made a game from the leftovers in an attempt to cash in on a franchise that hasn't had a hit entry since 1997 (the 2D castlevania games on portables were fantastic but I wouldn't call them hits).So, to reiterrate:  I've played better Castlevania games on N64.  And I'm not kidding.  The version of Castlevania 64 where you played as a werewolf was so super rad compared to this! "

												This is my first Castlevania Game. It was recommended by a friend because I liked Darksiders 2 so much. The gameplay is similar but although I tried to find the game enjoyable, it was not. This starts with the whiny main character Gabriel who mourns over his loss of his wife. He acts more or less selfish and I was tempted to shout at him like: Get over your loss and act as a grown man!  Gabriel is part of an ""templar"" order to fight evil and to help the poor and weak, but the during the few moments you see any civilian he does not act like a hero. For me he sees the civilians just like nuissances.From time to time a comrade of the same order (who is also the narrator (spoken by Patrick Stewart) of the episode beginnings) appears and helps Gabriel out. Why couldn't I play this guy who acts more like a hero? For some extras you could visit the former areas if you got the equipment to reach the chests. But you have to fight through the same monsters again to reach the locations which is quite boring for me so I totally skipped this later on. This could be important for the higher difficulty levels, but due to the very very weak story with no enjoyable ""sidestories"" it must be a major pain. The same is valid for the challenges you can get for every level by completing a task (like: kill 20 monsters with grenades), but you find out about the task by pure luck or after you played a level when the challenge will be mentioned on the summary screen. The fighting is quite okay and with the 4 special items (like daggers, butterflies,...) quite versatile.So if you like fighting a la Devil May Cry, Darksiders,... without any good story and without a likable hero with some puzzles, the game is for you. If you look for a good story, charismatic characters you have to play something else.			"

Such a pity because the universe is fantastic, the graphics are quite good, the characters are charismatic and the bosses are awesome!

												It's so great that I'll finally have the chance to play this epic on my PC. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is the start of an amazing tale, reinventing the myth behind the Castlevania Series. The gameplay might seem a bit 'stolen', but let's face it: is it the only one? I like to think it's more of a 'best of' from most games. Also, terrific voice acting, and excelent character portrayal. To me, what matters most, is the story. As simples as it is, it's still well developed and most importainly, well told. If fits this new universe, and things can only get better from here.			"

Maybe a little late, but Castlevania: Lord of Shadow has finally arrived on PC. A solid port that looks sharp and runs smoothly on modern PCs. The dissapoint about this is that the original game remains mostly untouched and there is a liitle awkward camera positioning, inaccurate platforming and pacing issues may turn some people off though.

												(I used an Xbox 360 controller to play this game so any notes on the controlls will be referenced in that configuration)Generic mechanics are generic but still..the story, setting, level design and the fact that Patrick Stewart voices one of the main characters more than makes up for it.If you're a Castlevania fan then you'll appreciate the story more than anything and perhaps enjoy the little throwbacks to the old style games when the camera switches to a side-scrolling type view. The camera is my main gripe about this game, for a Third-Person action oriented game i would of expected full control over the camera but you get none at all here.The camera angles are fixed resident evil style angles for the most part, switching when you walk around a corner. when it comes to action the camera is fixed for a wide view of the battlefield, this makes comabt difficult in that if an enemy is off screen and is about to attack you'll have a hard time dodging or blocking which is unnacceptable when the game's focus mechanic requires that you NOT take a hit.Combat is pretty generic in terms of an action game but it's still more varied and advanced than the old side-scrollers. you have your two basic buttons for attack, (X) is your single target focus attack and (Y) is your area focused attacks, they do less damage but hit ALL enemies within range of it.you can dodge and block, timing your block correctly opens up your enemy for a counter-attack, it's pretty standard stuff here, save for the light/shadow magic system (Light replenishing your health per hit landed and shadow increasing your damage)The combat isn't where this game shines, it's fun but it gets repetative not only due to limit upgrade options and only one weapon but the enemies are recycled over and over and you just get tired of fighting the same thing over and over again, if i wanted that then i would of hopped on to an MMO instead..The story is where it shines and for an older game the graphics hold up well, while i LOVE Patrick Stewart in this game as the voice of Zobek i can't say the same for Robert Carlyle who voices the main character Gabriel. While i love the guy as an actor in general, his portrayal of gabriel just makes the man feel devoid of any personality and emotion (Which isn't the case with Gabriel, if you pay attention to the story he is supposed to be full of emotion, all be it negative emotion but it's stilll emotion)All in all i'd give this game an 8/10. it looses points for the main character feeling kind of robotic and the combat being repetative with recycled enemies. the story, the platforming and puzzle sections an the graphics more than make up for it, plus the soundtrack is epic.

												This game is pretty goddam amazing. I originally bought this at release on 360 and played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. When I frist saw it was coming to steam with all DLC as well as graphical advancements such as extra settings and a framerate that isn't locked to 30 fps as it was on console which now makes the game look amazing, even though it already looked amazing. Not only amazing visuals but also a beautiful orchestral score.The gameplay is great too with really fast and action packed combat with amazing boss fights that have you on the edge of your seat. This is balanced out with some pretty tricky puzzles that will have you scratching your head until A HA you finally get it and also some really fun platforming such as climbing the sides of cliffs etc. which really give you this feeling of dread that if you mess up you will be falling all the way down into the abyss below. The voice acting is also great, i mean who doesn't want Picard narrating the game and also being a character? Its great. This game is just amazing over all. A lot of people like to complain about the combat saying it rips of God of War but GOW set the standard back in 2005 and it only makes sense that newer games are going to adopt that style because it obviously worked the first time. This game takes all of the good things we love from adventure games like the GoW combat, the Uncharted style platforming and the Shadow of the Colossus style epic boss fights, with gigantic bosses that take some thought on how to bring them down rather than just hack n slashing their way through, and mixes them all together to create a really beautiful and fun game.10/10 would Belmot again.

												Gabriel, a paladin of the Brotherhood, seeks to end earth's seemingly hopeless end of days scenario by slaying the Lords of Shadow.Fight lycanthropes, vampires, giant trolls, and many other mythical creatures.Combat is identical to God of War with very similar combos and control.The music is superb and (when not eradicating hell spawn) worth taking the time to listen and appreciate.Voice acting is clear and overall decent, with Sir Patrick Stewart providing monologue before each level.Boss battles are gargantuan in proportions requiring precision timing or memorization, often challenging.Replayability is extremely high due to the myriad of hidden upgrades and the need to revisit levels for trials and unreachables.Coming into the game expecting castle after castle, the varying environment was a pleasant surprise.Mastery between the use of light and dark energy will keep you alive and allow bursts of damage accurately.The DLC serves as an epilogue to explain the events preceeding Lords of Shadow 2, though the content itself was not as enjoyable as the primary game.The DLC final boss is unreasonably difficult as if it were from Dark Souls.

												First off, would like to say that I am not judging this game in comparison to other Castlevania games.  I played a few hours of one on the ps2, but that about sums up my Castlevania experience.  Pros: Beautiful game.  Absolutely gorgeous.  Voice acting done well, I don't know any names, but I've heard people mention Patrick Stewart.Cons: Everything else.  This game was just...not that entertaining.  The combat felt repetative, easily cheesed (grab small enemy, quick time event to smash small enemy, wash and repeat 50 more times).  The bosses were challenging, not because they were well designed, but because of the awkward combat system.  Oh, and did I mention the boss that looks like a giant statue that you climb up and strike repeatedly at weak points...does that remind you of any other game *cough*shadowofthecollosus*cough*.I'm a huge fan of SoTC, but this ripoff was just blatent, and frankly with the system they made for it.  Then imagine my surprise when the boss after that one was...ANOTHER GIANT STATUE THAT YOU CLIMBED AND STABBED WEAK POINTS!  They didn't even have the courtesy to make this one a different shape.All in all, a quite sad game.  The concept was there, it really was.  It was poorly executed however.  My recommendation: try the demo first.  It might be for you.  It wasn't for me, however.			"

												The glory days of Castlevania are gone it seems.To start. This game LOOKS great. but it just doesn't play well.Combat is difficult (not in the challenging way), repeatitive, and unrewarding.Movement, whether that be when you're trying to attack an enemy or manuver through a level is attrocious. The CAMERA can dictate where you go. Walking around a corner and the camera will move and your direction will change involuntarily. THIS IS TERRIBLE DESIGN!It takes the idea of revisting areas for upgrades and rewards, but executes them poorly. The game is needlessly difficult. I'm an avid Dark Souls veteran and this game on normal difficulty had me pulling my hair out.  Cheap AI. Troublesome controls just make you want to smash your head into the monitor. Completely hamstrings the pace of the game.Wait for it to go on sale if you must sate your curiousity for this one.			"

												Story is decent for the genre.Visuals are decent for the console port. Environments look very nice and although general theme of all stages is gothic, there is plenty of variety. Some gamma issues here and there. Had no problems with the camera. Musiс is solid, not in your face but matching game atmosphere and gameplay nicely.Combat could be better. There are plenty of moves, but a) attacks are split into single target and area attacks with latter being useful quite rarely, b) big chunk of moves is limited by a double resource which is not easy to replenish mid fight and half of it is used for combat healing. As a result only a handful of moves is actually used. Particularly liked the focus on counter-blocking. Reaction window is pretty forgiving which makes it accessible to players of various skill level. It feels very rewarding to learn enemy attack animations and both evade damage and punish your opponent with block followed by counter attack chain.I'm not a fan of QTEs and there are plenty of them in the game, but I wasn't particularly annoyed. Again, there is usually enough time to react and I quickly learned when to expect one. Could do with less button mashing tho.Puzzle design is the low point of the game for me. Feels (more than in other games at least) that they were put in just to stretch playthrough time. Not that they are repetitive, on the contrary, some puzzles rely on obscure moves that are never even explained or taught to a player (whip hold double jump, block dodge roll) and never used again after that. Just, a lot of frustrating design decisions.Bosses are great. There's a lot of them and they are varied in size and flavor. None feel like rehashes of one another, none feel like dumb HP bags, many have clever mechanics that should be figured out. I was always looking forward to next boss fight.Overall, for a sale price I'm very happy with what I've got. Would recommend this game to any action adventure fan.			"

												This is just the third Castlevania game I've played, so I can't really tell if it fits the Castlevania-""feel"" or not. As a pure adventure game it has got a lot to offer: nice graphics, gorgeous vistas, cool monsters, epic bosses, and an interesting story with superb voice acting from Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart. It is also very long, so you definitely get your money's worth from this one.It is virtually littered with cut scenes that drives the story forward, with most of them skipable. The game is split in chapters containing a varying amount of levels. Every finished level, in any chapter, can be played again right after it is finished the first time. This comes in handy if you didn't find (or couldn't get to) every item in that particular level. To add some extra replayabilty, a trial is also unlocked for every finished level. Some of these are a cakewalk, and some are painstakingly hard.The gameplay is a mix of platforming and fighting. The platforming is pretty straightforward and easy, but will sometimes punish you if you get sloppy. The fighting works really well once you get the hang of all the combos and the dodge and block moves. There is also frequent use of action buttons, which could be irriitating, but works pretty good here (kinda).The ordinary gameplay is broken off with the occasional puzzle and boss fight. Some of the puzzles are really clever and you need your brain, raher than your reflexes, to beat them. As for the boss fights, I played the game on normal difficulty, and though some of the bosses were really challenging, it never felt hopeless fighting them. Just a couple of tries later the adventure continued.This ultimate edition also contains a ton of unlockable, very nice artworks, as well as some other in-game extras.It also contains two DLC chapters, and here comes my only real issue with this game. Don't get me wrong, they both look as good as the earlier game, and also serves to flesh out and deepen an already great story. The thing is that they try to make it last longer by riddle it with puzzles, as opposed to the earlier game when they were occasional, and some irritatingly hard platforming sequences. There is also a boss fight that many probably will find a bit unfair (I found it reeeeeally f-ing hard on just normal difficulty and I rage quit more than once).Besides that last part, I can do nothing but recommend this excellent adventure game. I will definitely buy LoS 2 when it arrives to PC.			"

												Brilliant storyline, great looking graphics and superb voice acting by none other than patrick stuart! The ultimate in fantasy adventure third person RPG games. I'm suprised a game in this genre hasnt been created before with vampires, werewolves and brave tormented soldiers looking for thier loved ones. Opportunity for collectors to indulge in exporing, massive boss fights, and superb environment all contribute towards an excellent experience of gaming. My only gripe would be the camera moves where it wants to not like in assassins creed where you can move it to explore the environment yourself, but i think this was done on purpose to ensure you dont miss the spectacular beauty of this game. Highly recommend to anyone who lives fanatasy adventures.			"

												The glory days of Castlevania are gone it seems.To start. This game LOOKS great. but it just doesn't play well.Combat is difficult (not in the challenging way), repeatitive, and unrewarding.Movement, whether that be when you're trying to attack an enemy or manuver through a level is attrocious. The CAMERA can dictate where you go. Walking around a corner and the camera will move and your direction will change involuntarily. THIS IS TERRIBLE DESIGN!It takes the idea of revisting areas for upgrades and rewards, but executes them poorly. The game is needlessly difficult. I'm an avid Dark Souls veteran and this game on normal difficulty had me pulling my hair out.  Cheap AI. Troublesome controls just make you want to smash your head into the monitor. Completely hamstrings the pace of the game.Wait for it to go on sale if you must sate your curiousity for this one.			"

												Yeah. Lords of Shadow is definitely a different kind of Castlevania.Far more serious than the previously 3D games which failed miserably to bring a Castlevania atmosphere.I'm not claiming that the previous games were bad, but they failed where Lords of Shadow made a point.The atmosphere is far more linear and didn't have the level up system which made Castlevania a brutal RPG. But in fact I liked the way the history is told and rebooted. I think that MercurySteam did a fine job bringing a new chapter in the Belmont family roots and the plot twist. Mind Blowing. The gameplay is well paced, fluent and the boss battles somewhat repetitive, but mostly epic nevertheless. The character progress is beliaveble and gaves an idea what a true Belmont is made of.It's a fine game to play and I Clearly enjoyed better than it's predecessor.""I am Dracul!"" --- 9/10 ~~~Arth			"

												It is not the most cutting edge conversion, but Lords of Shadow is the best action-adventure game in recent years. Maybe a little late, but Castlevania: Lord of Shadow has finally arrived on PC. A solid port that looks sharp and runs smoothly on modern PCs. The dissapoint about this is that the original game remains mostly untouched and there is a liitle awkward camera positioning, inaccurate platforming and pacing issues may turn some people off though.

												        In my opinion this is an amazing game, despite the negative reviews that it got when it first came out. I recently played it for the second time and I gotta say, I enjoyed it better. The puzzles are great, with the option to unlock, if you get stuck, if you got the experience to do so. People complaining about the fixed camera and invisible walls obviously have no clue about games like God of War, Legacy of Kain:Defience or Dante's Inferno etc.; they should stick to 3rd person games. The visuals are breathtaking, staying side to side with games today. Good animation, great voice acting and a good plot. Also the fighting mechanics are good, putting your reflexes to test. I don't know about staying true to the Castlevania games, but this,  I found a very good game. I most certanley recommand if you like action/adventure games or hack and slash, call it what you like.			"

There is great voice acting, the artwork is beautiful, but the combat is extremely dull and requires the exact buttons to be mashed in the exact order to accomplish the most basic thing.  And the game is on rails - there really isn't a world to explore - you just kill all the monsters (at nauseum until you figure out the ""trick"" for each area) and then get excited for a minute while Patrick Stewart reads to you before another disappointing action sequence.

												Gabriel, a paladin of the Brotherhood, seeks to end earth's seemingly hopeless end of days scenario by slaying the Lords of Shadow.Fight lycanthropes, vampires, giant trolls, and many other mythical creatures.Combat is identical to God of War with very similar combos and control.The music is superb and (when not eradicating hell spawn) worth taking the time to listen and appreciate.Voice acting is clear and overall decent, with Sir Patrick Stewart providing monologue before each level.Boss battles are gargantuan in proportions requiring precision timing or memorization, often challenging.Replayability is extremely high due to the myriad of hidden upgrades and the need to revisit levels for trials and unreachables.Coming into the game expecting castle after castle, the varying environment was a pleasant surprise.Mastery between the use of light and dark energy will keep you alive and allow bursts of damage accurately.The DLC serves as an epilogue to explain the events preceeding Lords of Shadow 2, though the content itself was not as enjoyable as the primary game.The DLC final boss is unreasonably difficult as if it were from Dark Souls.

												Fun game overall; the help pop-ups are a bit annoying, and often don't explain what needs to be done.  For instance, there are times that you are being ""gripped"" by enemies and two concentric circles appear on the screen.  One shrinks into the other and you are supposed to know to hit B at exactly the point when the two come together.  Never are you told that you have to press anything, let alone which of the 14 options you have on the 360 controller.  It is VERY tempermental, so if you are not superb with accuracy and speed, then boss fights will be infuriating!  Still playing it to see if it gets better.  Will ammend this review if my opinion changes.			"

												A somewhat great action adventure game and somewhat like a reboot of the castlevania franchise. The focus lies more on the excellent battlesystem and the exploration of the levels. The soundtrack is beautiful and supports the dark ambient of this game even more. One of the best i've heared in years. On the downside, the story of this game is very boring and even worse, 90% of it you will learn just right in the last 5 minutes before the final boss fight. Not a moment sooner.It has also too much levels. About 30% fewer levels would have been good, because they are just MEANINGLESS. They don't tell something of the story, nothing important happens, (hell!) you don't even know why you are there anyway!Also this game can't hold its own standard imho. It begins great. The land of the lycans, the first zone, is great! So many cutscenes! So emotional! *Sigh* Beautiful. The second zone, the land of the vampires remembers of the good old castlevania feeling. A BIG spooky castle with impressing architecture. Just stay still a second and watch it. It's bombastic! But the third zone, the land of the dead. Meh... its so BORING! It is empty, it is a dessert, nothing to see, almost no cutscenes, just run from level to level until the end of this game. *yawn*All in all, it is a game which made a lot of fun to me. At least the first two zones. Unfortunatly the last zone is SO boring, that the ending of this game keeps it away of the olymp of the action adventure games.			"

												As a staunch pc gamer, I can't  believe I am writing this:  This game, while fun, is an inferior port of a superior console game.  Everything is up to par except one thing (the one thing that arguably needs to be the most on-spot): controls.  This game is not designed for any sort of reasonable input from a keyboard.  If I had be warned beforehand by, oh say, STEAM, that I needed to go out of my way to buy a controller, I would have skipped it.  But instead, I now have an unplayable game sitting in my library and a future $20+ purchase to make.  Thanks guys.			"

												For fans of Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, Shadow of the Colossus, and Prince of Persia.An awesome relaunch of this series. I beat the regular story in about 21 hours with another 3 hours going to replaying levels to get weapon upgrades. The DLC took me roughly another 5. The controls are really smooth and the dodge/attack system is pretty epic. You get a ridiculous amount of abilities and new moves but at the pace the game moves it does not make it hard to remember everything. The game has really well placed checkpoints ESPECIALLY in boss battles. The only exception to this is the final boss in the DLC. It is an utter and complete be-otch. That boss alone took me nearly 2 hours to defeat.If you are a fan of mini game puzzles this game is chalked full of some pretty good ones. I would encourage people not to look up the solutions to any of them because none of them are that bad. They just take a little bit of for sight.The story line is also pretty awesome and the cinematagraphy is amazing. However, like with most konami games, the camera angles can be pretty terrible when you are trying to fight someone or jump somewhere. Overall this is not that bad and is almost not even worth mentioning in comparison to some other konami games that have come out in the past.Added bonus: Patrick Stuart, enough said.Get it, definitely worth the money especially on steam sale (I think I picked it up for $7.99)			"

												The Castlevania series really reached its maturity with this game. This is a spinoff in more than a way - the storyline isn't cannon with the rest of Castlevanias, and the gameplay is more like Castlevania 64 without the RPG: no Metroidvania here. However, the theme, the depth and the darkness of the story is completely on a new level. No more ""Bishounen guy enters castle and defeats Dracula"". Expect a lot more from this game.Absolutely recommended for Castlevania fans - as myself - and for those who enjoy third person action games such as God of War and DMC. It can take many hours to complete the main story (more or less 22 for me), and even more with the DLC's. Go ahead and fetch it if you haven't already. If you have it but it's in your backlog, what's wrong with you?			"

												Being an NES / SNES junkie back in the day, Castlevania kinda slipped though my gaming experience. I did play 1 & 2 but don't remember the SNES version.  So, when I heard there was a new Castlevania, I was in! I originally purchased it for my XBOX360, but because I travel alot for work, I have it on steam now.I found the game play takes a bit of getting used to....at least it did for me. There are lots of combo's that can be added as the game progresses and trying to remember them all...well its a challenge. The game becomes more of a button masher with followed failure if you don't remember some key moves to fend of the more powerfull foes.  I found myself consulting the in game menu to aid me in remember the combo's.  The controls aren't bad for movement. It can be cumbersome at times, but this is due to the camera angles. It just takes some getting used to. The graphics, level design and character design is nice.  I enjoyed the graphical experience more than the actual game I think lol.  Beautifuly done.  The sounds in the environments are great as well to help aid in the overall experience. Some elements could've been better (some close ups were pixelated a bit on both the PC and XBOX version), but overall done well.The replay value is there if you play the entire game first  and complete every challenge at a later date.  I did a complete play though to get a feel for the game and then picked off at the challeneges and secrets that are available. After that however, I lost interest quickly.As a whole, it's a good game. Not something that everyone might like, but for a ""Re-boot"" of the franchise, it does well.			"

												I originally pre-ordered this game on PS3, and have now played it on PC with the DLC included. First, for those of you have already played it, the DLC adds another 2-3 hours of gameplay. The graphics look great and the game runs at a better framerate than its console counterparts. The DLC has not received as much care as the main game. The first DLC chapter is puzzle based, and though the puzzles are interesting some of them are needless and frustrating. The second DLC is some platforming and a rather frustrating boss battle. The boss itself is very cool but fighting him becomes tedious in the later stages, and I honestly recommend switching the game to EASY mode just to get through the fight. Bottom line, $10 is the right price to get this game at if you are wanting to replay it.For those of you have never played this game, the best thing this game has going for it is the art direction. It will absorb you into the Castlevania world and you'll care about the story and the characters, and eveything looks great. If you're a fan of the fantasy genre, this is the game for you. The story in this game is non-generic and is filled with a lot of care and attention to detail to bring the world to life. The game is LONG by action game standard (15 hrs for the main story), and there is incentive to replay chapters as certain skills you acquire during the game open up new areas to access. The combat system is Devil-May-Cry-esque, and is generally quite fun. There are things to unlock and special abilities to learn, so new things are constantly getting thrown to prevent you from getting bored. Enemies are extremely varied, and have special strategies required to defeat them. Boss battles are for the most part well done, some occuring on grand scales (think Shadow of the Collosus). There are also lots of very clever puzzles in this game, which may require a piece of paper and pen to visualize and solve quickly. But if you don't feel like solving them, you can opt to have the solution. There is a lot of platforming as well, and it is done rather well to break up the action sequences. It's not going to be as good as some of the tomb raider or prince of persia games, but it has its place.A few gripes I have with this game are the invisible walls. They drive me nuts as I like to look for secrets and often you try to go to a certain area only to be met with an invisible wall you can't go past. Second, is the game is a bit too liberal with the checkpoint system, and lets you play rather carelessly. I guess you won't get frustrated as much as a result. Finally, I would have liked to have an extra weapon or two aside from the whip/chain to add some depth to the combat system (this is being adressed in the sequel).Overal this game is around a 9/10 for me. I would add that the sequel is releasing in Feb and hopes to improve the game in every way. Is this game worth $30 for newcomers? I would definitely say yes. As someone who played it twice now, I had just as much fun going through it a second time as I did the first.			"

												This is the PC's God of War, an excellent (long but never boring) beat em up with a lot of jumping, quick time events and riddles that make you use your brain later in the game (you can unlock the solutions). It's not a stellar game but it bleeds quality all over the place. The story is great (with a what the eff moment after the credits roll in) and even better gameplay, but not everything is well executed. For example the camera. I just hated it, made me die numerous times and sometimes it zooms too far out and expects you to play while your character is just a tiny speck. While movement is only as good as the camera, the controls are fine with a controller and forget about playing the game with mouse and keyboard. It's possible but just don't. I found myself liking the story, the main character is bad a** and doesn't speak unless it's absolutely necessary, making some moments really epic. There is some backtracking to previous levels if you want to pick up powerups you missed the first time.Graphics are... fine. While the game runs @1080p with AA the pixels are huge. Especially in cut scenes on hair and similar fine objects. I bet it's because this is a console port and the assets are 720p but it's nothing gamebreaking unless you're an elitist.As someone who doesn't usually play this genre I really enjoyed this title and give it a thumbs up. Cheers.			"

												This game should really say that it NEEDS a controller, and not just that it's compatible. If anything it's the keyboard that's compatible, but barely - I couldn't play it for more than 10 minutes. I might change my mind on this if I purchase a controller to play the game but at the moment, I cannot reccomend this for game such a terrible port of the controls.			"

												Finally on PC...This was the most under rated game of 2010 on the PS3 and Xbox. I played and beat the game on PS3. The game for $30 with both DLC packs is a great value(I paid $60 for the game and $10 each for the DLC packs =$80 PS3). It has a great story line with good cinematic cut scenes. The graphics are good, the sound track and FX are good and the game play is great, but a 360ce controller is the best way to play and enjoy it. If you're a hard core gamer the paladin difficulty will challenge even the best. It's an epic Adventure with lots of Action. You start off killing Werewolves and 12 chapters later face Satan. 12 epic Boss fights, tons of creatures to slay inbetween, lots of weapons to upgrade through XP points you earn by killing creatures, lots of items to find and earn and puzzles to solve.The game has some replay value if you're after achievments, if you can get them all then your one badass botton pushin mofo gamer...For $30 you would be hard pressed to find a more fun, challenging and entertaining game. This game looks better and plays better on a PC vs the consoles it originally came out on. I usually don't say this much about a game, especially one 3 years old, BUT for $30 it's a great bang for the buck. Please don't listen to the haters, this game rocks. Most people love it...The Demo is the lowest aspect of what the game is all about. The rest of the first chapter and the other 11 chapters are really good. Play the demo first to see if your system can play it and then buy this GREAT Aventure Action Game!!! This game on sale is a huge gaming value ! I'm looking forward to Castlevania LOS 2 to come out on PC too.			"

												Really good game. Lovely detailed scenery. Good graphics and fun gameplay. A classic re-imagined successfully!The hack n' slash parts are fun and varied enough to keep you interested while the puzzles and level design are suitably tricky without being  rock hard. Only faught a couple of bosses so far but they are a highlight, particularily the spectacular scripted sequences and cutscenes during these fights.If you like the genre you will love the game it is that simple. Production values are key here, the team making the game took time and effort to make quality throughout. As far as lifespan is concerned no multiplayer obviously but the single player campaign is a good length and in this edition it includes a few dlc quests also, so you won't finish it all in one night. Not finished the game at the time of writing, but I have heard the story is over average and it is indeed shaping up well.			"

												All and All an amazing game! So great to see the game get ported over to PC. The voice actors for Gabriel and of course Patrick Stewart are absolutely amazing! Amazing storyline, great fighting sequences, good puzzles and an amazing world. This is the first castlevania I've ever played and I loved it all. I had no idea I'd enjoy this game so much. Its a combination of shadow of the colossus, God of war, and Van Helsing all combined in an amazing game. This is a must play! Though only negative is the free DLC kinda sucks. Would not have paid money for the DLC. Still, great game, its a must play for everyone! Just make sure when you start the game that you switch the attack controls to mouse.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a reboot for the franchise and it does quite well. You play as Gabriel Belmont, of the Order of Light, which is sworn to defend against the terrible (and decidedely  evils which now stalk the land with impunity after what appears to be God's withdrawal from the world.The story is good; the only thing really negative I have to say is that the plot's segue to the sequel is left barely explained, which diminishes the impact of a rather effective climax.The art direction is fantastic, and the game's voice-actors are a professional cast including Patrick Stewart. The soundtrack won the the International Film Critics Association's award for ""Best original score for a videogame or interactive media."" The game features a fixed camera which makes it more cinematic; the environment is also designed to utilize this, making scenes more impactful than they would be if the player had control over the camera.The combat system is also very good and centers around executing combos and attacking tactically; as you progress through the game Gabriel gains increasingly more sophisticated combos and impressive moves  to the point where it can be a little hard to keep all your options in your head at once. Combined with the aesthetic choices of the developers, a well-fought battle gives no small satisfaction.Interspersed between combat are prince-of-persia/assassin's creed ledge grappling and platforming and puzzles to solve. The puzzles vary in difficulty from being clever, but easy, to requiring real strategy to complete. You can skip these puzzle sequences, but only by forfeiting the experience reward.It took me 20 hours to complete the story on Knight difficulty (level 3 of 4), with the hardest difficulty Paladin being unlocked when you complete the game. (There are some 3.5 hours worth of cutscenes, narration, and quick-time event cinematics.) The levels are episodic which allows you to return to specific levels whenever you like, and doing so will yield benefits: you have another opportunity to discover hidden upgrades, and each episode has its own level-specific challenge to complete. Even after completing the story there is still a lot of gameplay to be had in order to fully complete it. The DLC's add even more collectibles and extend the plot.There are few things that detracted from the game. The epilogue makes little sense. You need to play the DLC's in order for the epilogue to the core game to make sense. Secondly, the fixed camera - though it does wonders aesthetically - can work against you at times, either making it difficult to see alternative paths switching your movement directions on you in awkward ways. Sometimes the fixed camera forces you to fight in a specific part of a room if you want to be able to see well enought to fight. The only other thing I have to complain about is the checkpoints. For whatever reason, the developers decided to put the checkpoints some distance away from the real difficult parts, and some of the sub-bosses. That means if you're having trouble defeating a tough enemy, you've got to spend a few minutes ledge-grabbing and platforming first. If you die a lot, this gets old and tedious very fast.A gamepad is highly recommended; the game is clearly designed for analog controls.			"

												Castlevania..probably one of the best video game franchises around. I've been a fan for many years. I never thought they could even come close to what was done in Symphony of the Night. Which I still think is probably the best game in the Castlevania Saga.This game was just a enjoyable experience to play from the visuals to the combat and most of all the story telling. The Voice acting is very well done and some of the best i've heard in a long time. The gothic feel and art design are some of the best i've seen. Very few games have made me stop and check out the scenery. I take very few screen shots of games and I found myself stopping taking the time to take quite a few. The Music is just awesome it added so much to the game and is one of the reasons why I like Symphony of the Night so much. This game knocks it out of the park with atomosphere and the music that just elevates it to another level. I really enjoyed the combat and the game does a great job of equally making the progression of your powers and difficulty flow together. Plus you can increase it to be quite difficult if you choose to do so. I see alot of people were complaining about the camera angles and how you can't control it. I did find it a little difficult at times but I felt it added kind of atmosphere to the game. Alot of the power ups are hidden throughtout the game and I think  the angles made me want to explore every nook and cranny of the levels to find them. I can understand how it could be frustrating at times. Overall I don't think it takes away too much from the game itself.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone of enjoys a game with great visuals, great story line, awesome music and just an overall enjoyable experience. I can't wait for the Sequel and to see what happens in Lords of Shadow II. "

												There is not much good action adventure slashers on PC, as a matter of fact there is not much of them at all(on PC). Till now I remember Legecy of Kain series, Prince of Persia(sands of time trilogy) and quite new Darksiders 1 & 2, there is also DMC series which am not familiar with, yet.Comparing Castlevania LotS:+plot There is great story, with few but interesting characters, a lot of additional content(to be read ). And most of all great story telling by Patric Stewart. Personally I could only compare this plot to the Legacy of Kain series which has quite similar world and great plot also. +Puzzles In first chapter I was afraid that there won't be puzzles at, when I stumbled across first one I was not impress. But during whole game puzzles become more complex, harder and more interesting, with great vampire chess at first place, this is also big advantage of this game.There is less puzzles than in PoP or LoK, but they are harder and more sophisticated. From possible cons this become one of the major pros of this game. +Combat First thing which I may not like in this game. There is a lot of Combos, but these are not very effective(visually and practically). attacks with magic are ok, but they are limited and keybord input lag which I and lot of PC players had didn't help with performing them.Pop and LoK combat system ware much simpler but I personally prefer one from Darksiders series which was almost perfect. +Graphic, level design and overall visual experience Generally graphics  are beautiful, it of course can't be compared to PC's FPS shooters, but it please the eye. Level designs are great and varied, similar to those in LoK but both games had resembledark fantasy universes.  +Music, voice. I fall in love into ""Belmont's Journey theme"". But whole soundtrack is absolutely amassing and epic. It fits this game perfectly.Voice acting is also definitely pros of this game. Some major cons, as I wrote above combat system could be better. Levels between beginning and end of many chapters are just boring because most of the actual story is at the ends of the chapters.As a conclusion well this is just epic game. All action-adventure games and slashers fans should go for it.PC port could be better thou. I used to playing this kind of games on keybord, but input lag was...annoying, especially in 2nd DLC boss(If you know what I mean :)) "

												As a Castlevania fan from the very beginning, and having played a few hours of this game now, I'm unimpressed.  It seems generic in its combat approach, and the boss fights really are too much like Shadow of the Colossus (though not as long or as elaborate).  It looks pretty, sounds quite nice, and has stellar voice acting; but the gameplay is lacking and the story is lackluster.			"

												The character and keyboard input system is terrible.  The keyboard inputs if pressed too quickly appear to be read into a buffer.  The buffer can cause the characters movements to be delayed, and uninterruptable.  Pressing a bunch of buttons quickly can end up moving the character tens of seconds later.  So the character doesn't response to the keyboard instantly,Further, it appears opponent animations further delay the characters movement and actions at time, whether the character is hit or not.

YouTube™ Video: Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Ultimate Edition Review - THE MEWS 

			Views: 712		

			How does Castlevania: Lords of Shadow suit up on the PC? Tom takes a look at the revamped edition of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow.		

Castlevania: Lords of Shadow will hurt you, talk down to you and generally ♥♥♥♥♥ slap you around, but it will also delight, entertain and satisfy you if you want it to.At it's core you could be forgiven for claiming that Lords of Shadow is a straight up God of War clone. I would be lying if I said I didn't jump at the chance to play it on PC due to God of Wars PS3 exclusive status. But although it does give you all the elements of the God of War series that made it so successful, brutal combat, quicktime events and gigantic boss battles, LoS stands out as it's own beast.Presentation wise, the game boasts some pretty impressive vocal talent. If Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle weren't enough, the rest of the voice cast throw in some heartfelt and talent rich performances. There's also a small role for Lucius Malfoy himself, Jason Isaacs. The creators really pulled all of their talent gathering weight when it came to getting some recognisable actors on board. The dialogue is overall fine and fits within the setting and lore, but can falter a little on occasion. But a great orchestral soundtrack and epic setting help pull it through those moments. The world itself is huge and glorious, and the game treats you to some truly epic vistas as you travel through its realms. Unfortunately the fixed camera has not been freed up from the console version of the game. So the same issues with awkward camera angles obscuring enemies or platforms are still present. This does frustrate as well when so much hard work has clearly been put into the creation of this world, but what you can see and explore always feels limited some what. As far as the graphical improvement from the console version to the Ultimate edition, nothing much seems to have been changed other than the increased resolution. On occasion the improved resolution actually shows up some low res textures and points out a few flaws in the character design, but for the most part it is an improvement. On close inspection the character design is already showing it's age somewhat, but at a distance works well, and some of the monsters in the game are truly inspired.Lords of Shadow throws a good mix of gameplay at you. Sure for the most part you'll be dashing around in combat, but it forces you to mix up that combat and utlilise different tactics for different enemies. If you plan on just button mashing you wont go very far and you have to make good use of the different attacks, secondary and special attacks you unlock as you work your way through the game. There are plenty of puzzles as well to break up the action, which offer you rewards on completion, though there's always an option to skip these puzzles if you're more concerned with getting back to the action. Some of these puzzles will have you genuinely perplexed for a while, but I never came across any game breaking puzzles that couldn't be worked out by scouring the area for clues.A good job is done with the storyline which succeeds in providing some emotional pull, but towards the climax does get a little bit preachy. It certainly leaves you with a sense of expectation though and sets things up very well for the upcoming Lords of Shadow 2. The two DLC chapters are also bundled with the Ultimate Edition, which give you more of the same gameplay, whilst introducing you to a new playable character and filling in the gaps between this game and the sequel.There's no doubting that Lords of Shadow - Ultimate Edition is an improvement on the original version, if not a huge improvement. But if you never played the original version, this is a great introduction to the Castlevania universe and is definitely an experience worth having.			"

												Tough for me to wholeheartedly back this game with a good score. Main protagonist Gabriel isn't really much of a character, and I found it tough to cheer for him on his quest. Boss fights are okay, and the ending is interesting and left me wanting to know what happens. The downsides to this game are the bad camera angles and the controls. The combination of the two can make sections of the game unecessarily difficult. It seems that they were trying to go for an artistic look and feel for the game, but aesthetics should in no way overshadow the gameplay, and that's what has happened here. The DLC is short but somewhat interesting as they try to introduce some new elements to make the game less stale. Overall, the ultimate edition gets a 6.5/10. Wait till the price drops if you want to check it out.			"

												The base game is fun, featuring challenging combat, beautiful settings and a great voice cast, but its irreparably marred by the awful dlc chapters, particulary the last one, which features one of the most tedious video game bosses ever conceived.  Combined with the non-intuitive quick time events and some♥♥♥♥♥♥poor checkpointing that last boss is an exercise in frustration.  Only pick this up if there's absolutely nothing else to play.			"

												There is not much good action adventure slashers on PC, as a matter of fact there is not much of them at all(on PC). Till now I remember Legecy of Kain series, Prince of Persia(sands of time trilogy) and quite new Darksiders 1 & 2, there is also DMC series which am not familiar with, yet.Comparing Castlevania LotS:+plot There is great story, with few but interesting characters, a lot of additional content(to be read ). And most of all great story telling by Patric Stewart. Personally I could only compare this plot to the Legacy of Kain series which has quite similar world and great plot also. +Puzzles In first chapter I was afraid that there won't be puzzles at, when I stumbled across first one I was not impress. But during whole game puzzles become more complex, harder and more interesting, with great vampire chess at first place, this is also big advantage of this game.There is less puzzles than in PoP or LoK, but they are harder and more sophisticated. From possible cons this become one of the major pros of this game. +Combat First thing which I may not like in this game. There is a lot of Combos, but these are not very effective(visually and practically). attacks with magic are ok, but they are limited and keybord input lag which I and lot of PC players had didn't help with performing them.Pop and LoK combat system ware much simpler but I personally prefer one from Darksiders series which was almost perfect. +Graphic, level design and overall visual experience Generally graphics  are beautiful, it of course can't be compared to PC's FPS shooters, but it please the eye. Level designs are great and varied, similar to those in LoK but both games had resembledark fantasy universes.  +Music, voice. I fall in love into ""Belmont's Journey theme"". But whole soundtrack is absolutely amassing and epic. It fits this game perfectly.Voice acting is also definitely pros of this game. Some major cons, as I wrote above combat system could be better. Levels between beginning and end of many chapters are just boring because most of the actual story is at the ends of the chapters.As a conclusion well this is just epic game. All action-adventure games and slashers fans should go for it.PC port could be better thou. I used to playing this kind of games on keybord, but input lag was...annoying, especially in 2nd DLC boss(If you know what I mean :)) "

												I'd never played a game with this sort of combat before, and I'd never wanted to either. However, something about the story that was glimpsed at in the sequels trailer made me vastly interested in getting LoS1 to experience the interesting story, despite my lack of interest in the combat type. Lucky for me I got gifted a copy for xmas as a thank you for gifting a game to a friend. Best random videogame gift ever! I loved this game ...right after I'd re-mapped most of the controls.The games story is mildly slow to start, but the layers and details are added slowly, bit by bit and I found it really drawing me into it, immersing me in the plight of the main characters. Once I got my head around the combat, I kind of enjoyed it, much to my suprise, though I was operating on the lowest difficultly as I'm a complete novice to this sort of combat in games. At times I found the game to be quite challenging, and the that was on the lowest difficultly, so some more hardcore gamers might get some fun out of that. I'm not a big fan of puzzles usually, and they pop up quite a bit in the game, which will cater to some people's tastes. I can't complain too much though, because you can sacrifice exp gain to find solutions to them or to skip some meaning players that don't enjoy puzzles aren't forced to do something they really don't like.The game is very long and even madly rushing it because you're so envoloped in the story takes a considerable amount of time to reach completion. There are some things that can only be unlocked in levels that you gain access to in later sections of the game. This is supposed to add to replay value, ...and I suppose it would, not for and incentive to play the whole game again, maybe to help enjoy on another play through simply inspired for a love of the interesting story.Despite all my praise, I have one small issue to raise, that can cause rather big problems. It's a console port and one, that means the default controls are awkward, ..but no big issue, just remap them, but the second point is the part that's pretty annoying. The analogue sticks of controllers are brought into play in a few places during the game, ...a few places where smooth, fast and fluid circular motion has to achieved quite precisely in order to complete something/move on. With a controller this is so much easier as I found out i desperate frustration fighting a boss by resorting to plugging a wired xbox controller into my PC. The problem is the movement from analogue stick has smooth transition between directions, but WASD at certain parts of a full circle rotation that has to be executed perfectly in time and synchronisation, becomes jarred and awkward when combined with another annoying feature of the game, forced camera angles. when trying to pivot the character on a spot using WASD it's hard to transition from one part of the turn to the next, not being being clear when to start or stop pressing one of the directions to stop yourself failing the move or going backwards or simply jarring out all weird. Still it's a minor complaint and will affect only a minor portion of the game. The determined of you will get past it and those that happen to have a wired xbox 360 controller around would do well to plug it in and use that, ..the controls are nicer on it too. So if you are familiar with the controller, win, win, stick to that.I suppose also, the DLC is tiny, yet crucial to setting the plot of LoS2, it kinda feels like it should have not been optional DLC and been a part of the game considering the vastly important plot points in it. As well as that in the DLC suddenly generated cutscenes are gone and replaced with comic like visuals with narrations. It's by no means bad, but the sudden disruption in continuity and the tiny size of the DLC it does seem like the developers put the minimal amount of effort into it in order to complete it to a satisfactory level. Overall I'd definately recommend this game for it's deeply interesting religious war, sort of van helsing dark feel to it and it's great story, paired with a fun, but my no means new, take on combat and the sheer size of the content in the game. It's got at least a 8.5/10 from me.			"

												As a Castlevania fan from the very beginning, and having played a few hours of this game now, I'm unimpressed.  It seems generic in its combat approach, and the boss fights really are too much like Shadow of the Colossus (though not as long or as elaborate).  It looks pretty, sounds quite nice, and has stellar voice acting; but the gameplay is lacking and the story is lackluster.			"

												The combat is very enjoyable accompanied with awesome music and good story. Having played couple old Castlevania games on Nintendo DS, I can say that this game has very similar great gameplay of the older games, in 3D. The levels are linear and exploration is limited (too bad).I recommend playing with controller. Also if you have 3D Vision setup, make sure to grab the fix from Helixmod (game is 2x better in S3D in my opinion).			"

												Did not expect much from this game, but heard it was good and bought it on release day. After seeing the final cutscene, I can say that I am really blown away and I had never thought this game to end up so great! The story is a bit confusing at the beginning and the fighting system and the camera feel a bit strange (especially when coming from Dark Souls) but once you get used to it, you won't regret playing the best Action-RPG I played in a long long time! Most epic Bossfights and unexpected story twist are the cherry on top! Do NOT miss this diamond!			"

												Good game with a great story, world design and character design. The combat is very much like Devil May Cry and God of War with difficulty rivaling previous Castlevania games.  The puzzle system is the best in any action adventure game and you even have the option to skip puzzles without getting the reward. The graphics good considering the massive variety of level types. The controls are responsive and the animation is quality is really high. The entire game is highly polished, bug free and very high quality. The ending is really epic too.However there are some issues such as bad keyboard and mouse controlls and a locked camera that moves at the worst possible times making you fall from jumping platforms. The music is good but poor compared to  the previous titles that had a massive range of different soundtracks and the final DLC boss is the most annoying thing ever. There is no customisation outside of new skills and powerups but then again this game is supposed to be a reboot and the original games didn't have it until they started adding in RPG elements. There is also a ton of button pressing events which can get annoying after a while.			"

												1st of all for a game 4 years old (and albeit remastered) the graphics hold up very well.  I cannot praise the voice acting enough, especially the narration.  Story is strong and very enjoyable although its not your typical Castlevania story if you're hoping for that.  Gameplay is very fun think God of War style.  The only downside is camera work is not ideal but it works out fine and that its not traditional Castlevania...traditional as in you don't really explore a massive Castle, which is imo the most enjoyable part of the series for me.  Only about 1/3 of the game is spent exploring and actual vampire castle, and although I am not finished yet, that has been my favorite part.  Despite this the other enviroments you explore are beautiful and the game encourages you to go back and replay them.  All that being said I highly reccommend this game. 10/10 can't wait to move onto Mirror of Fate and LOS 2.Oh I almsot forgot the score is incredible.  Especially the calm music when you are not in battle or in danger.  Absolutely beautiful, boss music is great too and this game has many difficult and epic boss fights I know you miss from games so much.			"

												A good, solid hack 'n slash action game with a combat system that is as deep as you so choose.You could go through the whole game using only the basic attacks or you could use the advanced combos to tear through enemies and boss with ease. The difficulty gradually ramps up through the game, and while the common enemies will rarely give you much of a fight, it's the bosses that make this game shine. I heartily enjoyed virtually every boss fight. The puzzles weren't terribly hard but a nice diversion to keep things from being stale. Platforming elements were not too frustrating, barring one or two areas.It took me about 30 hours to finish on Knight (Hard) difficulty, which unlocks the Paladin (Very Hard) difficulty. At this time, I haven't played through on that difficulty yet, but in regards to replayability, there is a decent amount. To get 100% in this game, after you beat it you'll need to beat every level over again on the max difficulty and there is a trial that is unlocked after every level is finished that you will need to complete.At the time of this review the price for this game is $29.99, and I would recommend it at that price, and doubly so if you find it on sale which seems to occur fairly often.

												+Beautiful Graphics+Story Seems interesting-BAD camera angles that get annoying fast and are everywhere.-Basic hack and slash setup most games have-Moments of game play that take forever to get by and seem to just drag on.Over all from what little I played I feel they concentrated mostly on making it pretty and forgot that one of the most important things about games is that gameplay.  How smooth and nicely it runs, that the player ends up enjoying it.  Without at least that the game becomes more like a pain in the butt, struggling and forcing yourself to play in hopes the bit of story makes it worth it.   And honestly if it gets that bad, I may as well watch a let's play despite playing the game even if I DO own it.			"

First, I would like to say that I became a fan of Castlevania through the installments on the Nintendo DS. Not only did I like the gameplay, most importantly, I enjoyed the atmosphere, art, imagery, and its mythological influences. I knew from the get-go that the gameplay in Lords of Shadow would be totally different and did expect a Metroidvania style, but I did enter the game expecting the same or similar atmosphere and imagery.GAMEPLAY (7 out of 10)The God-of-War-like, third-person, character-action style of gameplay did not put me off from the beginning like a lot of other fans; in fact, I was quite open to the change. The hacking and slashing can be as mindless or coordinated and graceful as you like, and you are given a multitude of nice, flashy combos to destroy your enemies. The implementation of Light and Shadow magic proved to be a lot of fun, and it was a decent challenge to a more strategic and coordinated balance of both to better adapt to changing combat scenarios. I found the quick-time events in this game to be the run-of-the-mill, unchallenging, pointless, uninteresting, and downright annoying combat mechanic. I had no fun with them, but that is not too big of a deal nor surprise. The Titan-class bosses in the game have a great deal of QTEs, but I only found the final one to really get on my nerves. The puzzle elements in this game were OK in the beginning, but had me pulling my hair out in the second half of the game. They were not particularly difficult nor challenging; however neither were they fun nor rewarding. These puzzles, to me, would break the pacing, flow, and rhythm of the combat I expected and wanted. Easily, the puzzles were the absolute worst part of the gameplay. Boring and tedious. Second worst? The Chupacabras (for the same reasons). I have to note that the level design was by-far very linear, but this did not really bother me; however, I do acknowledge that this is a great deviation from the great deal of emphasis previous titles put on exploration and branching paths.GRAPHICS AND VISUALS (8.5 out of 10)They look pretty damn good on PC compared to the PS3 (as expected). The world and combat looks gorgeous and detailed. My framerates were constant and high—even when there is a ton of action on the screen. I never experienced any dips or stuttering. I can only gripe about the fixed camera that is not uncommonly placed awkwardly. One nitpick I had was the character animation when Gabriel is rappelling or climbing a wall with the whip: the transition from moving to standing still is too abrupt and choppy. Aside from that, Gabriel’s movement is beautiful and smooth.SOUND (8 out of 10)I am not a diehard audiophile, but the sound effects and design were very good. Impacts sounded heavy and solid. Beasts sounded alive, hungry, and menacing. The ambient noises did their part well. The sound design in this game adds wonderfully to the game’s look and feel. The English voice acting was fantastic for the most part.MUSIC (7 out of 10)Although I found the music to be somewhere between acceptable to good, I also found it to be mostly forgettable. It definitely does not have the same punch that Castlevania music is known to have, but I am not going to fault this game because of how it compares to the music of its predecessors. In short, the music was “aight.”PLOT AND WRITING (5.5 out of 10)This was the worst aspect of the game. From the big picture, the game has some seriously awesome plot points that take place, but as I played the game chapter by chapter, I felt the story did not keep me interested consistently from the beginning to the end. It started off well, dragged and weezed in the middle, but had a stellar ending. The lore is divulged through cutscenes and from the loading screens before the stages begin. The cutscenes had decent, acceptable dialogue and writing, and they also looked and sounded fantastic thanks to their motion capture and voice acting. The loading screens made me want to stab my ears and eyes. First of all, it was pure exposition or what you could call info dumps. I prefer to be shown rather than be told. Second, the writing in these loading screens were unbearably horrendous. Think of a 13 year old trying to sound like Tolkien or H.P. Lovecraft. It was all charmless cliché, weak melodrama, and felt too try-hard. Patrick Stewart’s acting could only do so much to make these stories bearable. The game already feels disjointed from chapter to chapter (which did not bother me in and of itself), but the loading screens felt to heavy handed in telling me exactly how to feel and think about Gabriel’s current state of affairs. Nothing from the gameplay nor cutscenes made me infer anything about Gabriel that was remotely close to what Zobek was describing. I would often ask myself, “Where the hell did Zobek get that idea from?” That kind of writing in books, film, television, and games does not sit well with me at all. I found it difficult to relate to or become invested in any of the characters beyond mild curiosity.OVERALL (7 out of 10)Lords of Shadow has moderate highs and very low lows. I am very glad I played it to the end, but, damn, it really tested my patience and ability to stay awake at times. Castlevania lore-fans have a good chance of enjoying it, but if you cannot stomach the gameplay, it might be better to watch a Let’s Play or cutscene compilation online. If you come in expecting classic or Metroidvania Castlevania, you are going to be crying bloody tears. If you come with an open mind, you’re either going to have a decent time or just get bored.			"

												Lords of Shadow is a great game. It has great combat with tons of skills to learn and master. It has fantastic voice acting and a truly engrossing story. It has beautiful visuals and runs wonderfully. There are a very minimal amount of bugs. I once got flung up into the air and hung from an invisible ledge, but this only happened once, in one area on my second playthrough. Apart from that it's a technically solid, fun, romp through a twisted tale of deceit, revenge, and redemption. My knowledge of Castlevania is limited to this game and Symphony of The Night, but I believe this game can stand proudly as part of the Castlevania series.			"

												Castlevania: LoS is a very mediocre reboot for the Castlevania series. Even though the game is beautiful and the last quarter of game (including the DLC) is fun; the tedium and repetition out weigh any of the games redeeming features. The QTE's, the stunning a large creature so you can ride them only to break open something, the wall climbing, the boss fights were you do chip damage until they are stunned so you can actually hurt them, and the puzzles (even having to complete puzzles to complete other puzzles) are just too often and not enjoyable after the first couple of hours. That leads to LoS's biggest problem; the length of the game. Easily half of what you play is either unnecessary (as in its hours before you are fighting the lords of shadows or even seeing a vampire) or just there to pad time repeating the few game mechanics so the game isnt ""short"". I would only recommend Castlevania: LoS to die hard fans that want to see what becomes of the very first vampire hunter.			"

												Yeah. Lords of Shadow is definitely a different kind of Castlevania.Far more serious than the previously 3D games which failed miserably to bring a Castlevania atmosphere.I'm not claiming that the previous games were bad, but they failed where Lords of Shadow made a point.The atmosphere is far more linear and didn't have the level up system which made Castlevania a brutal RPG. But in fact I liked the way the history is told and rebooted. I think that MercurySteam did a fine job bringing a new chapter in the Belmont family roots and the plot twist. Mind Blowing. The gameplay is well paced, fluent and the boss battles somewhat repetitive, but mostly epic nevertheless. The character progress is beliaveble and gaves an idea what a true Belmont is made of.It's a fine game to play and I Clearly enjoyed better than it's predecessor.""I am Dracul!"" --- 9/10 ~~~Arth			"

												I'll just make this a fast review from the first things that pop into my head.Thoughts:- Great Story (Predictable in some parts, but there were still surprises.)- HUGE Game (takes several hours... which is a good thing and a bad thing. Good because it is entertaining. Bad because I didn't have the endurance for that length from this kind of game and just wanted to have the pay off of the game being over.) (80+ Hours on Pokemon is one thing, 20+ hours on this game was a little much for me.)- A little glitchy (my game would freeze during some of the Baba Yaga cut scenes, and there were a few platforming glitches or lever issues)- I hate the Titan fights, but there are only a few of them- Easy game for a casual gamer to get into (I'm a very casual gamer.)- QUALITY voice acting from the main cast- Very different from your average Castlevania (You spend most of your time OUT of a castle, you don't have as many monsters, and the format of the game reminds me of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time for some reason)- Fun puzzles (except for that dumb blood cup one)- Interesting Character Design (Like, I LOVE the concept art in the game)- Gabriel is a cutie.- Graphics are pretty great too. Landscapes are gorgeous. People have a little of that uncanny valley going on. (Especially Marie. Those dead eyes...)- Really great soundtrack.- Fighting system is pretty easy to get a grip on. Combos aren't that hard to remember or figure out either.- RELICS. (I really liked the Relics along with Gabriel's super fancy cross whip thing.)Overall, I really liked this game. I would recommend it to plenty of people.			"

												This is my first review, but not my first rodeo.Synopsis: Gabriel Belmont of the famed Belmont family must defeat the Lords of Shadow to acquire their powers and heal the rift between heaven and earth which is allowing the forces of darkness to spread unopposed throughout the land.Overall Impression: A beautiful, epic experience strongly influenced (in my opinion) by Dante's Inferno, both the literary work and the video game. However, for those of you who have played Dante's Inferno (which was only on console I believe), this game is superior in every way.Graphics: Massive, haunting landscapes with excellent ambient effects such as rain and frost on the screen. I don't think the graphics could have been much better given the time and what the creators were aiming for.Sound: Adrenaline-driving Gothic-style soundtrack that picks up at exactly the right moments. Useful sound cues when an offscreen enemy has been spawned. Also, Patrick Stewart as the voice of Sean Connery/Ramirez (from Highlander) man. The weapons sound effects are substantial and pair well with the force feedback on an Xbox 360 controller.Controls/Gameplay: Flowing controls and somewhat simple combat/combo system which is conducive to button mashing. However, enemies usually dodge on the second or third strike so button-mashing is of limited utility.Pros: This is truly a stellar game, with immersive graphics and sound with an engrossing storyline somewhat in the vein of Dante's Inferno (both the literary work and the console game). Significant replay value for completionists.Cons: Not too many. If anything, the combo system could have used slightly more complexity to add more depth to the combat, but this may not have been feasible after everything was mapped out on the XBox controller (yes, you should definitely use one to play this game).

												Really good game. Lovely detailed scenery. Good graphics and fun gameplay. A classic re-imagined successfully!The hack n' slash parts are fun and varied enough to keep you interested while the puzzles and level design are suitably tricky without being  rock hard. Only faught a couple of bosses so far but they are a highlight, particularily the spectacular scripted sequences and cutscenes during these fights.If you like the genre you will love the game it is that simple. Production values are key here, the team making the game took time and effort to make quality throughout. As far as lifespan is concerned no multiplayer obviously but the single player campaign is a good length and in this edition it includes a few dlc quests also, so you won't finish it all in one night. Not finished the game at the time of writing, but I have heard the story is over average and it is indeed shaping up well.			"

												This is a great game, albeit not the best, but who am I kidding? I was constantly entertained. Yes, it takes elements from God of War and Shadow of the Colossus, but to be honest, it's because those idea works, and it still very much cut out it's own atmosphere. The action in God of War is a bit over the top (which is not a bad thing). This is still very much over-the-top at times, but it's a very different feel. The ambience is overall very different too, and the visuals (taking into account the release date) are quite good. With a custom ENB and SweetFX setting, they were phenomenol. The gameplay is very satisfying. And I appreciate being able to play Shadow of the Colussus-esque bosses because I wasn't able to on my own time, but they aren't my favorite. It's all too scripted for me. The short demo of LOS: 2 had a much better Titan battle where it was a combination of SOTC and fighting regular enemies and avoiding ranged attacks from another boss. I don't understand what people have against QTE... the reason they pop up everywhere is because they WORK, although sometimes they are overused in other games, where it seems every little action requires one. In this game, they keep you on your toes, because failing one at best gives you a loss of health. In boss fights, you will be brutally (and quite satisfyingly) killed, and I feel like I have to stay riveted to the scene so I don't miss one and get absolutely horendously murdered. I don't know many games where dying is quite as awesome as this game during the boss fights. I'm hoping the LOS: 2 continues that.The story is good, although it could have been a bit better. Comparing it to God of War, it is much better, although I'm a fan of story-driven games. Again, LOS: 2 looks like it's going to improve on this front. I like the whole descent into darkness thing, but Gabriel, as a character, is a bit lacking. His supposed transition to darkness is noticable, but not by much... he always seemed aloof and unempathetic. By the end, he's aloof, unempathetic, and a bit angrier (which is shown mostly through grimacing). I feel bad for him more when he's being described by the narrator then when I see him in cutscenes, except for a few particularly potent ones. Otherwise, he kinda falls flat.The end boss was a bit sudden, and I didn't like the design of the boss. He is not what I would visualize for that character. For a final boss battle, I would've liked something a bit more bad a** (can I swear on these reviews?) Again, I heard that's going to improve in LOS.EDIT: I didn't mention the static camera... but of course, that was a disappointment. Overall, I heavily recommend this game. However, I understand that some people might not like every aspect of it. As I always recommend, DOWNLOAD THE DEMO.			"

												I love this game and I hate this game.  This game is rewarding and infuriating.  This is a flawed gem that's worth playing.The first few hours of the game are abysmal and irritating.  You'll have to press through 30 minutes at a time, trying desperately not to throw your controller across the room.  You don't start with enough life or moves or idea of what the hell you're doing.  The game hasn't opened up yet.  It's 4 hours of long, drawn-out, arduous training wheels you really want to rip off but can't.  It is hellish and awful you you'll want to give up on the game.If you don't, which you shouldn't, the game opens up.  The points and skills start flowing in.  The mechanics open up.  The story gets interesting.  Everything gets better.  Everything.  It's like a switch.  It goes from horrible to wonderful in a mere hour of playtime.  It will go from tedium to joy in a matter of moments.The game is still brutally hard, even on Normal.  While the game is enjoyable and rewarding you will die a lot.  You'll be forced to rely on checkpoints like a crutch, especially during some boss fights.The puzzles are good.  They are generally doable without guides and aren't too hard.  If you've ever played an actual puzzle game these won't provide any real challenge, but they'll give you a nice break and some bonus skill points to boot.  If you are horrible at puzzles you can skip all of them.Don't expect a classic Castlevania experience.  There's some semblance of it there.. where you can go back to past levels with your existing gear and access new areas; but if you're the type of explore and poke around levels as you go the progression of your upgrades will be fairly natural; you won't need to backtrack if you don't really want to.The dynamic cinematic camera angles can be really, really irritating.  You'll get attacked off-screen by fast-moving enemies sometimes and you'll die from things you can't see.  You'll jump to places only to have the camera angle change and since you ever-so-slightly moved your thumbstick your character will whip around and fall somewhere he shouldn't, probably killing you in the process.  Words cannot describe how infuriating the camera can be, but with anything else this type of camera really just has a learning curve.  You'll figure out where to position yourself so you never get attacked off-screen again.  You'll figure out what angles to jump from to avoid untimely deaths.  None of this is really taught to you, but you'll figure it out (and die trying).Despite all of my griping about this game I still recommend it.  I really enjoyed it and I liked the direction they were going with it in for a sequel.  The story is dark and its world twisted.  There's a fascinating mix of different religious mythologies in said world that make it unique.  Despite what others might say the story is actually very easy to follow if you listen to what Patrick Stewart is narrating, read the travel scrolls you come across, and generally just pay attention.  It's not spoon-fed to you, but it's very easy to follow the plot and character development (there's actual character development!).  I think ultimately the story is what kept me interesting and going in this game.  Even when the combat gets too hard you'll want to keep going for the sake of finding out what happens to the protagonist.  He is so flawed and wonderful as a character; you'll come to care for him in a way you don't with most action game male leads.This game is weird.  It is unique.  So many of its parts are not.  The combat, upgrade system, platforming, and so many other things have all been seen before.  This is one of those games that is more than the sum of its parts.  It has a dark charm that draws you in.  This is an action game, but it is not typical for its genre.  It's like one of those 'weird' dark movies like Pan's Labyrinth that you really need to be in a certain mood to take in and enjoy.  If you go in looking for your typical hack 'n slash, typical action game, typical anything you'll get disappointed.  You'll be frustrated no matter what, but if you go in expecting something a little darker and a little more unusual it will transcend from a hateful frustration to a loving one, in the same way that you really love your spouse despite their infuriating habits and flaws that you really wish you could wave away.After finishing this game, in spite of all of my frustraton for it, I wanted more.  I am excited that the sequel to it is coming soon.  Speaking of the sequel: do yourself a favor and ignore every single piece of information about Lord of Shadows 2 that you can.  Even the promo artwork, if possible.  A major story component to the end of this game will be spoiled immediately, which really sucks.  It doesn't ruin it so much that you'll want to stop playing, though, the journey is still worth the 20 hours it will take to experience.			"

												I'm fan of the series since the early days, bud definitely not a hardcore one. When I saw the sale offer I didn't think twice and I bought this title without knowing what was I in for (even more, I was completely unaware that this is a series reboot). I was just looking for a fun and fast paced game and the game seemed to fit the bill, and I was 100% right. The sountrack is epic and the voice acting is the cherry on top. If you've at least seen screenshots of the early titles from the series you will easily recognise the environments as you progress over the game (and probably think of those screenshots in a different way now). I'm not saying this is ""the perfect game"" (the controls are a bit off at times, and the fixed camera is annoying at first), but it's extremely entertaining and feels like an interactive movie. The puzzles are entertaining, you can (and will) replay many levels  looking for secrets or trials without getting bored, the boss fights are a bit too easy at times but playing at higher difficulties or for the trials makes it harder (and sometimes frustrating if you use the wrong tactic).Bottom line: I'm looking forward to playing the sequel and I would recommend it to anybody that loves the action genre.

												For those not already aware, the Lords of Shadow entries of the Castlevania series are not a part of the classic continuity; Mercury Steam has crafted a total re-imagining of the Belmont legacy (including a rather big twist as to protagonist Gabriel Belmont's ultimate fate). This is not the first Castlevania game to take place in an alternate timeline, seperate from the clasic continuity, but it is probably the most ambitious among the alternate continuities. The developers did not, however, totally abandon or forget about the series' roots, and some little winks and nudges are scattered throughout the narrative (such as the reveal of how Gabriel's weapon, the Combat Cross, comes to gain the name of Vampire Killer, the name of the whip used by the Belmonts in the classic continuity. If you are a diehard fan of the original series, you may have a hard time swallowing all the changes, but if you are able to set that aside and accept Lords of Shadow as it's own experience, then you should be able to get a fair degree of enjoyment out of the story. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is, at it's core, a standard action adventure game which does not stray far from formula. This is not, necessarily a bad thing, though, as it follows the formula fairly well. LoS is simply an example of a game which does nothing new, but does everything well. You start at point A of the stage, and work your way towards the end, fighting enemies and solving puzzles along the way. You earn experience points, which allow you to purchase more combos, and upgrade your weapons and abilities along the way, allowing you to progress further, and also to revist previous stages an access areas you couldn't before. The combat controls are fluid and work well, though you should definitely play with a controller rather than the keyboard. I know it sounds obvious, but I was forced to play the majority of the first two chapters with my keyboard, and the experience was, at best, uncomfortably passable and, at worst, nearly unplayable. Once I was able to use a controller, however, things improved a hundred fold, and the game became much more fun. If I had to cite one major complaint about gameplay, I would say that the stages are fairly linear. For someone like me, who enjoys exploration, this felt rather limiting, especially since the stages are so beautifully designed. This doesn't do much to decrease the enjoyment, however, and in fact is almost nostalgic, as this makes the game more similar to the early installments of the series, before Symphony of the Night introduced us to the ""Metroidvania"" style of gameplay which defined the series for so many years. On that note, you may want to brace yourself for a notable lack of castles; Tomb Raider-vania may have been a better title for this game, as you spend more time in ancient ruins and lush forests and jungles than, but that is mere semantics and not a huge issue in the overall scheme. The bottom line is this: Lords of Shadow is a solid action-adventure game with an enticing narrative, and if that is what you are looking for then you should be able to enjoy this game.			"

												I bought this game the day it released on the PS3.  At the time it was very hard to put down.  If you can put aside bias from previous Castlevania games you'll have fun with this title.  It is nothing like any other Castlevania.First time through the story drove me onward.  Gabriel Belmont is a dark hero in a dark world.  Watching the plot unfold was by far the best part of the game for me.  Many of the enviroments you visit are graphical beauties.  The combat, though I was never great at it, wasn't terrible but wasn't anything special.  My main complaint the first time through was the abseents of Castlevania-esque music.  The soundtrack isn't bad, but I'm quite a fan of older Castlevania music.  After completing the game I picked it up off and on during the next few years to play levels at a harder difficulty, collect all the extras, and complete the extra missions.  It was challenging and fun, but not the best replayability.When this game released on steam I figured I'd pick it up since I no longer had the PS3 version.  Second time through the game feels much more like a chor.  Platforming becomes frustrating and boring, along with the combat.  The story still shines, though, and demands that the game is completed once again.Overall the game makes for a sad Castlevania game, but if you let go of the past your first journy through this new Castlevania world will be a memorable one.

												 Incredible highly underrated game. Boss fights that take you back to Shadow of the Colossus days. Really great challenge on highest difficulty. Camera mucks you up a fair share but a minor frustration compared to the rest. One of the best ways to show off the artwork progress and team behind it in any game I have ever played. It was the first time I even looked at a games artwork... which goes to show it was thrown in there in a nice easy to handle way. For the price it was during the sale, it has been one of my top 10 buys so far. Dracula is in fact, the♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Had this game on PS3 and played it for awhile until the Ultimate edition became available on the PC.This versions add the DLC and of course hits the higher res and framrates of a decent gaming rig and as such is the afr better version to own!The game itself is fairly rinse and repeat once you have the basics down; its Devil may Cry or Bayonetta or any other of the games of similar ilk.What sets Castlevania appart however is the depth of lore and feel the game brings. Enviroments are stuffed with detail and feeling. The voice acting is gerenally very good which all adds to the atmosphere created in the game.There are a few niggles here and there; one later level sees you trapped in a music box and the way it is played out forces the player back and forwards on numerous occasions...the issue isnt so much the design of the level but the constant repeat of dialog and the sections within it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth after the constant forward progress of previous levels.Character design is very good throughout the game with the various enemies allowing for a bit of a mix up in the combat techniques and some nice quicktime events being thrown to the general melee on occasion.all in all a solid way to spend a few hours of mindless gaming.

												Tough to add-on what others have stated already but the bottom line is if you enjoy hack-n-slash type games then you will not want to miss this one.  What separates this one is the story and graphics.  The visuals are amazing and after playing it on the PS3 and starting again on PC it is testament to the developers to see how well the visuals have held up.  Having the DLC thrown in wasn't necessary as I felt there was nothing additional to make them worth playing (felt very ""tacked on"") but glad they're here anyway.			"

												Finally on PC...This was the most under rated game of 2010 on the PS3 and Xbox. I played and beat the game on PS3. The game for $30 with both DLC packs is a great value(I paid $60 for the game and $10 each for the DLC packs =$80 PS3). It has a great story line with good cinematic cut scenes. The graphics are good, the sound track and FX are good and the game play is great, but a 360ce controller is the best way to play and enjoy it. If you're a hard core gamer the paladin difficulty will challenge even the best. It's an epic Adventure with lots of Action. You start off killing Werewolves and 12 chapters later face Satan. 12 epic Boss fights, tons of creatures to slay inbetween, lots of weapons to upgrade through XP points you earn by killing creatures, lots of items to find and earn and puzzles to solve.The game has some replay value if you're after achievments, if you can get them all then your one badass botton pushin mofo gamer...For $30 you would be hard pressed to find a more fun, challenging and entertaining game. This game looks better and plays better on a PC vs the consoles it originally came out on. I usually don't say this much about a game, especially one 3 years old, BUT for $30 it's a great bang for the buck. Please don't listen to the haters, this game rocks. Most people love it...The Demo is the lowest aspect of what the game is all about. The rest of the first chapter and the other 11 chapters are really good. Play the demo first to see if your system can play it and then buy this GREAT Aventure Action Game!!! This game on sale is a huge gaming value ! I'm looking forward to Castlevania LOS 2 to come out on PC too.			"

												Good: Gothic, cinematic storytelling with awesome voice actors. Visceral, brutal combat clearly inspired by games like God of War. Lots of secrets hidden within the levels. Incentives for replaying levels and achieving ""perfection"" in those levels. Looks beautiful and runs smoothly on my not-so-modern rig. The combat abilities are fun to play with, keep you on your toes, and prevents the game from being a button-mash or click-fest.Bad: There are some really ugly faces in this game. The game is not designed for a mouse and keyboard so it can feel a little wonky sometimes. Fixed camera can make exploration a chore. The minigames seem weird and forced, and they detract from the pacing of the game.Overall: There are better ways to spend 30 dollars, but if it's on sale for 20 or lower, I'd suggest going for it.

Got it on the steam sale and really gave it a go and iam loving the story and what Mercury steam did with this franchise and giving castlevania an actual origin story.

												Still trying to beat this one. Not because it's hard but because of how not fun or creative it is. People have said it's a bad God of War ripoff and despite the fact that so many people make that arguement it doesn't make it any less true. I keep finding myself thinking about playing it but every time I go to press play my mouse jumps up to a better game and I play that instead. Even if it is on super sale for a dollar don't buy it. Don't even steal it because just the time it takes to download is a ripoff. Go play one of the good Castlevanias that are actually a Castlevania game instead.			"

												As a staunch pc gamer, I can't  believe I am writing this:  This game, while fun, is an inferior port of a superior console game.  Everything is up to par except one thing (the one thing that arguably needs to be the most on-spot): controls.  This game is not designed for any sort of reasonable input from a keyboard.  If I had be warned beforehand by, oh say, STEAM, that I needed to go out of my way to buy a controller, I would have skipped it.  But instead, I now have an unplayable game sitting in my library and a future $20+ purchase to make.  Thanks guys.			"

I am a bit disappointed as Castelvania fan, but the game itself is very fun and very-refined in pretty much every aspect, so I am still going to recommend it. If I were to find some flaws, I would say this game is a bit repetitive and it relies too much on QTE.			"

It has good hack and slash gameplay mechanics with it's own style (not God of War or Dmc copy) and there are a lot of different places you'll go throughout the whole game and the story is very good. The soundtrack and art are also impecable. It's one of my favourites hack & slash games in recent years.			"

												The first and biggest complaint I have is about the camera and it's transitions. My god are the transitions jarring and frequent, taking me out of the game every time, making me wish for control of the camera, and the fact the controls basically get stuck sometimes. I can't tell you how many times the character acted like he was hitting a wall and running along it after a transition, having to let go of the stick, then move him again is frustrating, and the platforming with a static camera was annoying, because the character doesn't turn or move smoothly, like with the camera there is no finesse in it's movements. The wall climbing just plain sucked, and I hated doing it everytime, I mean the most ""intense"" thing that would happen is the ledges breaking off behind you or getting away from the lava, but it didn't matter, you're stuck at one speed while wall climbing, so you just have to trundle along completely forgetting about the ""impending doom"" behind you. The combat at first is interesting, but after a few hours it got dull and tedious. The biggest highlight after I got bored with it, is when I figured out you could just straight us grab and kill the weaker enemies, but after a very short time, that got just as tedious. Getting yelled at to do things in a few fights by allies got old really fast. I was fighting the second Titan(collosus), and the girl kept yelling ""do it now, now grab onto to something"" over and over again while I was running over to do so, and other things not allowing me to focus or get into the fight, such as it was. The eviroments from what I was allowed to see were kind of interesting, and I'd of loved to look at the castle and landscapes, but you know, fixed camera and all. The story is dull, and the characters are aswell and during core games ending I laughed a bit at the portrayal of ""emotion"", because it just looks so stupid and bad. The eviroment has a clearly rich history and story I'd love to know about, but can't, so oh well.The ""puzzles"" in the game are a joke, and trust me if you've played any kind of game like this or any game with puzzles you've done these ones before.The padding is this game is ridiculous as well, the wall climbing, making enemies take more hits then necessary, the camera focused on objects/objectives for way longer than is needed, having just a swarm of enemies show up right after some platforming for no reason, then nothing as you go back to wall climbing/platforming, the motherf*cking chupacabras that get introduced out of nowhere that steal your relics so you have to chase them and get them back is terrible. They should be an optional thing to deal with after you beat the level to get a reward, not a main game element.			"

												I'd never played a game with this sort of combat before, and I'd never wanted to either. However, something about the story that was glimpsed at in the sequels trailer made me vastly interested in getting LoS1 to experience the interesting story, despite my lack of interest in the combat type. Lucky for me I got gifted a copy for xmas as a thank you for gifting a game to a friend. Best random videogame gift ever! I loved this game ...right after I'd re-mapped most of the controls.The games story is mildly slow to start, but the layers and details are added slowly, bit by bit and I found it really drawing me into it, immersing me in the plight of the main characters. Once I got my head around the combat, I kind of enjoyed it, much to my suprise, though I was operating on the lowest difficultly as I'm a complete novice to this sort of combat in games. At times I found the game to be quite challenging, and the that was on the lowest difficultly, so some more hardcore gamers might get some fun out of that. I'm not a big fan of puzzles usually, and they pop up quite a bit in the game, which will cater to some people's tastes. I can't complain too much though, because you can sacrifice exp gain to find solutions to them or to skip some meaning players that don't enjoy puzzles aren't forced to do something they really don't like.The game is very long and even madly rushing it because you're so envoloped in the story takes a considerable amount of time to reach completion. There are some things that can only be unlocked in levels that you gain access to in later sections of the game. This is supposed to add to replay value, ...and I suppose it would, not for and incentive to play the whole game again, maybe to help enjoy on another play through simply inspired for a love of the interesting story.Despite all my praise, I have one small issue to raise, that can cause rather big problems. It's a console port and one, that means the default controls are awkward, ..but no big issue, just remap them, but the second point is the part that's pretty annoying. The analogue sticks of controllers are brought into play in a few places during the game, ...a few places where smooth, fast and fluid circular motion has to achieved quite precisely in order to complete something/move on. With a controller this is so much easier as I found out i desperate frustration fighting a boss by resorting to plugging a wired xbox controller into my PC. The problem is the movement from analogue stick has smooth transition between directions, but WASD at certain parts of a full circle rotation that has to be executed perfectly in time and synchronisation, becomes jarred and awkward when combined with another annoying feature of the game, forced camera angles. when trying to pivot the character on a spot using WASD it's hard to transition from one part of the turn to the next, not being being clear when to start or stop pressing one of the directions to stop yourself failing the move or going backwards or simply jarring out all weird. Still it's a minor complaint and will affect only a minor portion of the game. The determined of you will get past it and those that happen to have a wired xbox 360 controller around would do well to plug it in and use that, ..the controls are nicer on it too. So if you are familiar with the controller, win, win, stick to that.I suppose also, the DLC is tiny, yet crucial to setting the plot of LoS2, it kinda feels like it should have not been optional DLC and been a part of the game considering the vastly important plot points in it. As well as that in the DLC suddenly generated cutscenes are gone and replaced with comic like visuals with narrations. It's by no means bad, but the sudden disruption in continuity and the tiny size of the DLC it does seem like the developers put the minimal amount of effort into it in order to complete it to a satisfactory level. Overall I'd definately recommend this game for it's deeply interesting religious war, sort of van helsing dark feel to it and it's great story, paired with a fun, but my no means new, take on combat and the sheer size of the content in the game. It's got at least a 8.5/10 from me.			"

												Fun game overall; the help pop-ups are a bit annoying, and often don't explain what needs to be done.  For instance, there are times that you are being ""gripped"" by enemies and two concentric circles appear on the screen.  One shrinks into the other and you are supposed to know to hit B at exactly the point when the two come together.  Never are you told that you have to press anything, let alone which of the 14 options you have on the 360 controller.  It is VERY tempermental, so if you are not superb with accuracy and speed, then boss fights will be infuriating!  Still playing it to see if it gets better.

												ok, So this game is pretty rad except for two things: 1)the two extra DLC chapters are bad. the last one is really, really bad. the controls are somehow broken(as in, gabriel suddenly decided he doesn't like my choice of direction to jump in and veers wildly off) in an area of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t platforming segments with not enough checkpoints, compounded by a boss with stupid hitboxes on all of his attacks, who moves fast enough that you JUST have enough time to dodge - IF you're on the ground. which wouldn't be a problem if you were capable of hurting him from the ground. not being able to dodge-cancel aerial attacks is one of those things that never really mattered in the main game but makes the last boss fight in the DLC unplayable. just awful. ugh.2)actually a long-standing issue with konami games... who decided it was a good idea to double-tap a direction to initate running? this is literally the worst way I've seen running implemented. funnily enough, this doesn't cause problems in the main game, and yet for the second bit of DLC causes SO. MANY. HEADACHES. because it is faster paced than the main game using an engine designed for the pace of the main game. It's been an annoyance in other games but this particular DLC has made me decide to hate whatever nebulous programmer first decided that double-tap running is a good thing.okay, after all that venting, let me get back on track- if you like castlevania, and you like God of war, the main game is a pretty solid game. it's kind of like the devs thought, ""you know, there hasn't really been a good 3D castlevania...I wonder what we could really do about whip mechanics in a 3D game, though...oh yeah, God of War!""but still, stay away from the DLC. it's just. awful.

												It's a great game. But not what you would expect from castlevania if you only know the older versions. Where the older versions where side scrolling based and maybe required a few tactics to get through certain areas, Lords of shadow is a hack and slash game. Which means this has become something totally different but in a good way. It's very well worked out and really deserves a nice place in everyones gaming library. I would totally recommend this if you are a fan of god of war and prince of persia but without the puzzles.			"

												After having played through the PS3 version of this game, having it on PC has been a wonderful experience. Super fast load times, skip cut scenes really quick and just get in to the action. It also has some unique options, such as showing your health bar near your character so it's harder to lose track, as well as health bars on individual enemies. There were more to unlock, but I haven't unlocked them yet. Personally, I enjoyed this Castlevania experience. It doesn't homage the old games very well, but it isn't supposed to. It is a *new* experience. A new origin, a new everything. And while it does take the series a gorgeous new direction, there are still throwbacks to the old games if you look for them.It's also challenging. Four difficulty modes, and individual trials to complete after each level.			"

												DISCLAIMER - I COULD ONLY MAKE IT ABOUT 30 MIN INThis game gets my a fake award for both 'Most Nauseating Camera' and ‘Stop telling me what to do god dang it!’It wins the first for making me almost vomit. I mean, wow. I’ve never been this close to vomiting, while playing a game. It constantly moves, shakes or wobbles. I’m fine with fixed positions, sometimes they’re really cool! But only if done right. If you do it wrong, the customers may come close to vomiting on their keyboards. Some will do it anyway, if only to make point.This game has control issues and doesn't trust you to do anything by yourself. Constantly moving the camera to tell you what to do and when. And always with the text. Press RT to grapple, Press RT to loot, Do this, do that. Maybe tell me once or twice. But when you feel the need to tell me for a fifth time, just stop. Please? Can we please talk about the ridicilous jingle that accompanies the text? Grrr. Patrick Steward is great. The rest is laughable. Lines are rushed and they don’t really seem to care. There might be better actors further in, but when the protagonist fails this miserably, no hope is to be regained. The visuals are great. Yay! Score one!Wouldn’t reccomend it. "

												While the graphics can, at time, come off as looking a little rough and the combat may get slightly repetitive, this is an otherwise good reboot of a fantastic - not to mention classic - franchise.You play as Gabriel Belmont, one of the last members of the Brotherhood of Light, an ancient order dedicated to fending off the minions of the Lords of Shadow in the name of God Almighty. Tasked with journeying to an ancient forest where the power of the Old Gods still resides, Gabriel seeks the soul of his dead wife, whom the elders of his order suspect holds an important message pertaining to the Lords of Shadow and their increasing influence over the lands.Gabriel's main weapon is the Combat Cross, which is a retractable chain whip in the form of - wait for it - a giant metal cross. This provides for some relatively basic hack-n-slash combat, though they do feature some nifty combos and the cross is upgradeable. You get some secondary weapons as well, such as throwing daggers and an amulet that lets you absorb magical energy (neutral) and convert it (light or shadow) to varying effects. There is also a bit of platforming thrown into the mix that is, to be perfectly honest, neither here nor there - what I mean is, it's neither terrible nor is it particularly amazing either.Plus, it's got Patrick Stewart on narration, which is just epic!

												Not the Castlevania game I was expecting. Yet it managed to go from less to great. Perhaps I'm too optimistic with it but I really enjoyed playing it. It's not perfect nor the best action game (Darksiders is still my favorite ""end of the worl"" action game) but it does things well and for $10 on sale it was a no brainer. Sure it could have been better with free camera and with less invisible walls, bit more explorations but everything else its great. Performance is ok, with a core i5@3.3GHz, 8GB RAM and a gtx560se I get constant 60fps @ 1600x900. I could run it at 1080p and still 60fps but GPU usage on this game is agressive making my poor GPU reach 60-65 C with ease and even on the credits screen it was around 55 C. Using my GPU software I could increse fan speed a bit and I got 55 to 57 C.			"

												Lords of Shadow is one of those games that gives new life to an old school type game.  The gameplay is similar to many adventure games (Mortal Kombat Anthologies: Sub Zero is a good example) and offers nothing new.  Go here, push this button/switch, fight bad guys with combos etc. is pretty much it.  However, the story is rather engaging (Patrick Stewart!) and the environments are stunning.  Also, as a player of a lot of the older Castlevania games, I feel like there are a lot of small tributes to the previous games if one is paying attention.  In summary:PROS:More Castlevania, woot!Patrick Stewart narating the storyAwesome cut scenes and environmentsBoss fights require some thought and strategy CONS:Fixed camera angle which leads toSometimes you have no idea where to go because you can't look aroundSome places require massive button mashingIf you like Castlevania, this is a good buy if on sale.

												Excellent story and pacing, well thought out combat system, and challenging puzzles. Very different to previous Castlevania games but the combat (at higher difficulty settings) still remains a test to even the most seasoned hack n' slashers. Narrated by Patrick Stewart, this game sucks you in and let's you progress from chapter to chapter with amazing flow and storytelling pace. Definitely pick it up if you're a fan of the genre or the Castlevania series. On a side note, the game only recognizes the XBOX 360 controller but you can use software like MotionJoy Gamepad Tool to emulate any other controller to be recognized as a 360 controller. This game is very tedious to play without a controller.			"

Yes, it uses God of War fighting system, but it very good match for Caslevania. Monstrous beatiful big combo looks very good. Amazing story, beatiful graphics(it were good on consoles, but on PC simply impressive, 1080p 60fps), great music and athmosphere. So good dark gothic vampire athmosphere of lonelines I can't see in many old Castlevania games. I beat this game on Xbox 360 and with pleasure play another time on Steam. Highly recommended!			"

Also, it has a fixed camera, which it wildly annoying at this point in gaming.

												Good game with a great story, world design and character design. The combat is very much like Devil May Cry and God of War with difficulty rivaling previous Castlevania games.  The puzzle system is the best in any action adventure game and you even have the option to skip puzzles without getting the reward. The graphics good considering the massive variety of level types. The controls are responsive and the animation is quality is really high. The entire game is highly polished, bug free and very high quality. The ending is really epic too.However there are some issues such as bad keyboard and mouse controlls and a locked camera that moves at the worst possible times making you fall from jumping platforms. The music is good but poor compared to  the previous titles that had a massive range of different soundtracks and the final DLC boss is the most annoying thing ever. There is no customisation outside of new skills and powerups but then again this game is supposed to be a reboot and the original games didn't have it until they started adding in RPG elements. There is also a ton of button pressing events which can get annoying after a while.			"

The combat is that of the god of war style. Which is never a bad thing if it is done right, and here it is. The graphics are just beautiful in this game. They clearly put alot of effort into the look of this game and it shows well at 60fps and 1920x1080. Now this is by no means the perfect action game. It has it flaws. The camera can somtimes get in the way of the platforming, and the combat take take a bit to nail down. But the small flaws this game has doesn't really pull from the experience. If you are a fan of action style games and  a fan of the Castlevania franchise then you should be playing this game.			"

												1st of all for a game 4 years old (and albeit remastered) the graphics hold up very well.  I cannot praise the voice acting enough, especially the narration.  Story is strong and very enjoyable although its not your typical Castlevania story if you're hoping for that.  Gameplay is very fun think God of War style.  The only downside is camera work is not ideal but it works out fine and that its not traditional Castlevania...traditional as in you don't really explore a massive Castle, which is imo the most enjoyable part of the series for me.  Only about 1/3 of the game is spent exploring and actual vampire castle, and although I am not finished yet, that has been my favorite part.  Despite this the other enviroments you explore are beautiful and the game encourages you to go back and replay them.  All that being said I highly reccommend this game. 10/10 can't wait to move onto Mirror of Fate and LOS 2.Oh I almsot forgot the score is incredible.  Especially the calm music when you are not in battle or in danger.  Absolutely beautiful, boss music is great too and this game has many difficult and epic boss fights I know you miss from games so much.			"

												Combat: 7/10Graphics: 8.5/10Story: X/10General:Platforming elements are atrocious. Jumping is horrible because it's not accurate (this is especially frustrating in the DLC.)If you like action games like GoW and DMC this might be a game for you, but know this: environments are dull (too much brown!), enemies and combat can get repetitive and you keep waiting for that epic conclusion that may or may not come.It's not a bad port, though gamepad is a must.I do recommend playing it if you got your eyes on the sequel.

												Subjective(Commonly Agreed on): This game take the one thing wrong with all 3d castlevania games and fixes it; that one thing being, the combat. Objective: Putting a more modern and comfortable twist on the classic chain whip combat by taking influence from the combat system such of god of war. Though lacking a combo counter, it is reflected on the focus meter that allows you to build mana and... (That... red fluid...lol) faster. all of what makes castlevania an excellent series is left in tact, with minor additions such as grapple, rappel and swinging mechanics. The major change though is the game structure. The game is linear yes, but you can revisit  chapters and find secrets using newly found enhancements and skills, but that is optional... no longer manditory. Subjective: I personally loved the structure of the post Symphony of the Night experience, the only way forward was back. finding an area you cannot quite get to and cannot progress until you recieve the enhancement. some find this tedious... I am in favor of it.Objective: This game harkens back to the original castlevainia games of the 90s by delivering a forward level by level srtucture. Locations are quite varied, and using UE3, present us with a world that is pleasing to the eye.Subjective: The art direction and level design capture the lore and world as a whole of castlevania in a way that we would only dream of in the 90s and early 2000s. Objective: Finding my self still playing through the satifsyingly lengthy story so far... I have experienced minor bugs. The bugs I have encounters seemed to be minor hiccups that are typical of any game. It was only rarely did I find myself completely clipping into a solid object, leaving me trapped within it for a second or two, but spamming the jump button fixes it. As well, one major important thing... the camera, though you can get use to it... jumping into the game after not playing may leave you a bit rusty in concept of remembering that you have no control of the camera. the camera, much like classic resident evil games, has fixed locations, which can switch up the directional controls upon camera switching.Overall, This is so far, The best castlevania experience  to date. As a huge fan, I am very happy with the execution of both the characters and the story. The combat was enjoyable. I found the camera to be super frustrating at times but I got use to it, but that just may be experience kicking in from classic resident evil games. The game so far reaches the epic scale. Boss Fights are epic with sime being gigantic Shadow of the Colossus experiences, and some being a head to head battle with a supernatural humanoid foe... it was quite entertaining.			"

												Castlevania Lords of Shadow for me is a percfect modern Castlevania game.  Sure, it isn't symphony of the night, but what is?  Castlevania had a bit of a rocky existence for a while on the PS2 trying to figure out how it was going to grow up into the world of 3D.  Sure, nothing can replace the side scrolling glorious wonder of SOTN or any castlevania before it, that is what Bloodstained is for now.  I will continue to play Castlevania in both forms as long as the 3D versions evolve and stay true to the heart of this style of 3D castlevania.  I love this.  I bought it on PS3, and I bought it again on Steam and am playing it again.  I love Lords of Shadow.			"

												Although it has a very awesome art direction, a good variety of enemies and some very intresting levels the actual level design, the combat and the story are lackluster. The platforming is linear and the controls are very unresponsive in that regard.  If there are tricky jumps or hard platforming sections, it´s because the controls aren't working as they suppose to not because of good level design. There are puzzles but they are easier than the ones found in the Uncharted series.The combat, though fuctional and responsive, is nothing to write home about. It´s very unispired and derivative. If you played Devil May Cry, God of War or Ninja Gaiden Sigma, you´ve already played this. The only intresting mechanic that differenciate this game from the much superior games it´s trying to ape is the light/dark magic mechanic. Having said that, the combat is fun. It's clear that this game doesn't want to be a Castlevania because there are sections that mimic Shadow of the Collossus but with more Quick Time Events and less Awe.The story is... well. You won't pay attention to that because you'll be distracted by Patrick Stewart's vibrating voice. It's not even forgettable because you cannot forget something you didn't understand. The worst part of this is that the main story takes about 14 hours to finish. By the end I was forcing myself to beat this crap so I could finnaly move on.It's as if Konami was trying to blend Hack n' Slashes, with Shadow of the Collossus and Patrick Stewart. What we got is a game with insipid gameplay, narcoleptic story, terrible platforming controls, and Patrick Stewart.I wasted my time playing this....  "

												I love the Castlevania games, i started with Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and i've been hooked ever since. The only ones i haven't beaten are the games that were created kinda the same style as this but for the PS2 (Lament of Innocence and Curse of Darkness). The games i have beaten are Symphony of the Night (PS1) Aria of Sorrow, Circle of the Moon, Harmony of Dissonance (GBA) Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin, Order of Ecclesia (NDS) and finally Lords of Shadow and Lords of Shadow 2 (PC/Xbox/PS3). The Castlevania games are my favorite games by far, and i highly reccomend playing any of them.			"

Detracts from enjoying the otherwise excellent cutscenes.    -Tried to do the lame 'go back to previous levels for item upgrades you can't access without another certain upgrade' thing for replayability.  I skipped doing that though and it wasn't that big of an impact.      -Lame cutscene style in the DLC (last 2 chapters).  But the story they told was still interesting.Overall I recommend the game.

												I saw this game on Steam for a while but could not commit to buy; the screenshots looked more like cinematics than actual gameplay, and it had been a few years since I shelled out hard cash for a Castlevania game. From what I had seen online, the series seemed to have degraded into a number of identity-confused games (are we jumping puzzles, or are we adventure, or are we 3D, or are we side-scrolling?) featuring a number of feminine-looking male heroes.Eventually I gave in while the game was on sale, and after it sat in my library for a few more months, I started playing.It turns out to be a really good game.Gameplay is fixed-camera third-person combat and exploration with an experience points system and unlockable skills and combos. The camera angles were typically well placed, though the environments hint at more exploration than what is really available.The graphics are good, with rich visuals that are a real treat for fantasy fans. I particularly liked the castle of the vampires (which is not the final destination of the game, but is the ""Castlevania"" of the series) and the Land of the Dead, which was appropriately eerie.This game truly shines in creating a great experience for the player. The voice acting is very good (if any of the actors and actresses are phoning in their performances in for an easy paycheck, they're too much the professionals to let it show), and the story is intriguing (though it was a little hard to follow at first).Combat is a lot of fun; the combination of interesting enemies, dynamic music, great dodges, combos, and quick-time events are woven together to create cinematic battles where the player controls the action. The first time I fought the Swamp Troll, and later when I went up against a massive golem (referred to as a Titan in this series), I knew this game was something special.On a negative note, I will say that the environments for the boss battles are very boring; with a few exceptions, you always fight a boss in an open, arena-like space. I would have liked more ""swinging on my chain whip to avoid attacks"" and boss battles fought over chasms and so forth.Lastly; the music in this game is AMAZING. It's possibly the best music in a video game (and many movies) that I have ever heard.I am not sure if this game FEELS like a Castlevania game. I was a big fan of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo games, and ""Lords of Shadow"" has a unique vibe. It's not a sequel or translation of the old stuff, but a total reinvention; this is a good thing though. If it was trying to be the original games and recycling the music and everything, it could not have shined as it does.			"

												A great entry in the Castlevania series. Great, great story that is suprisingly deep and well-thought out with a cast of compelling and memorable characters further enhanced by excellent voice acting (by Robert Carlyle and others). As a Castlevania game there are of course puzzles which end up being rather clever and a lot of fun to solve as they are neither too complex nor too easy with only one that I found frustrating. Gameplay and combat are well done and fun with sweet-looking and powerful combos à la Devil May Cry/God of War/Bayonetta which become increasingly more badass and useful as you unlock them through an effective leveling-up and upgrade system. The enemies and environments are also epically MASSIVE at times & nicely varied and appropriately thematic as you first battle werewolves as you progress towards the lycan lord in forested areas, followed by vampires in a sinister and GIGANTIC European castle and its environs where you confront the necessary vampire master and finally a swampy area filled with zombies and its lich lord.The only short-coming I can think of it that most enemies can become easy to defeat once you unlock the faeries and especially the ultimate magic moves towards the 2nd half/end of the game, but come on, you get to ride & control bear-like lycans and huge spiders and use them to rain glorious PAIN upon those foolish enough to oppose a Belmont xD! Oh, it's also a little unfortunate that there is no element of free-roaming and that each new area is encapsulated by invisible walls or cliffs/etc as it would have been a real treat to explore the spooky and menacing landscapes but I wasn't overly bothered by this. However it really would have been nice as well as an added additional layer of immersion to the game if there were NPCs (villagers, survivors) that you could interact with and that would provide you with side-quests.9/10			"

												Funnily enough, though having heard about the Castlevania games, I never really played them. I didn't think they were for me, cus truth be told I thought they were completely different. However it was recommened to me because there is a games series I thoroughally enjoy, which by now, I'm pretty sure was partly inspired by this games. This would be the God Of War series. Which I also sorta played in reverse ^_^** (started with 3 in late 2012 I think, before I played the others)So,... my review would be: It never hurts to try a game. You might end up loving it! And if you enjoy rich fantasy with beautiful design and inspiring landscapes, while slicing and dicing up a bunch of colourful creatures,.... This is a game you'll enjoy.			"

												Really great and ejoyable reboot of the Castlevania franchise; story is much better too. My only complaint was that the DLC was not quite as good. The puzzles were nice but that one particular boss was not a cery good match for Gabriel since he was about three stories tall, thus forcing you to jump in the air to attack for all of the fight and leaving yourself vulnerable to one of his many unblockable, AoE attacks. Should that fight have been against someone that didn't require as much jumping I would have no real complaints. 8.5/10			"

												Yeah I got tired of this game after about 42 minutes... Just cutscene, endurance round, cutscene, endurance round. I think there might be more cutscenes than actual action. Sometimes they let you walk a few feet by yourself before triggering another small cutscene followed by an endurance round. I think it is to hold the small attention span of console gamers... Not to mention that the keyboard controls are horrendous - a game pad is pretty much required. You also have no control over the camera so if there is an enemy behind you or to the far side of you you are screwed.			"

												The game is incredibly frustrating if a mouse and keyboard are your only options for controlling the action. The game itself looks visually slick and promising but, without a game controller, most non-leet PC gamers will die too often to maintain the level of fun. Even the tutorial fights had me respawning numerous times because of control awkwardness -- the keys are re-mappable, but this wasn't as helpful as I expected it would be -- and autosaves that save your progress at low health points in the middle of battles only make matters worse. The combination of the two is as frustrating as it is deadly.			"

												DISCLAIMER - I COULD ONLY MAKE IT ABOUT 30 MIN INThis game gets my a fake award for both 'Most Nauseating Camera' and ‘Stop telling me what to do god dang it!’It wins the first for making me almost vomit. I mean, wow. I’ve never been this close to vomiting, while playing a game. It constantly moves, shakes or wobbles. I’m fine with fixed positions, sometimes they’re really cool! But only if done right. If you do it wrong, the customers may come close to vomiting on their keyboards. Some will do it anyway, if only to make point.This game has control issues and doesn't trust you to do anything by yourself. Constantly moving the camera to tell you what to do and when. And always with the text. Press RT to grapple, Press RT to loot, Do this, do that. Maybe tell me once or twice. But when you feel the need to tell me for a fifth time, just stop. Please? Can we please talk about the ridicilous jingle that accompanies the text? Grrr. Patrick Steward is great. The rest is laughable. Lines are rushed and they don’t really seem to care. There might be better actors further in, but when the protagonist fails this miserably, no hope is to be regained. The visuals are great. Yay! Score one!Wouldn’t reccomend it. "

												While the graphics can, at time, come off as looking a little rough and the combat may get slightly repetitive, this is an otherwise good reboot of a fantastic - not to mention classic - franchise.You play as Gabriel Belmont, one of the last members of the Brotherhood of Light, an ancient order dedicated to fending off the minions of the Lords of Shadow in the name of God Almighty. Tasked with journeying to an ancient forest where the power of the Old Gods still resides, Gabriel seeks the soul of his dead wife, whom the elders of his order suspect holds an important message pertaining to the Lords of Shadow and their increasing influence over the lands.Gabriel's main weapon is the Combat Cross, which is a retractable chain whip in the form of - wait for it - a giant metal cross. This provides for some relatively basic hack-n-slash combat, though they do feature some nifty combos and the cross is upgradeable. You get some secondary weapons as well, such as throwing daggers and an amulet that lets you absorb magical energy (neutral) and convert it (light or shadow) to varying effects. There is also a bit of platforming thrown into the mix that is, to be perfectly honest, neither here nor there - what I mean is, it's neither terrible nor is it particularly amazing either.Plus, it's got Patrick Stewart on narration, which is just epic!

												This game oozes quality. The enviroment, story, and voice acting are all above and beyond what most games give you. The combat and leveling are good aswell, you'll be button mashing different combos for the most part. I can not think of a single place where they decided to go cheap on this game. Oh you wonder about Replay?, yeah check that one off too. You'll find hidden♥♥♥♥♥♥on every level and the items you don't find they'll let you know you left behind, so no need for guides. Hidden items don't make or break you either, they just give you more health or magic. All and all pick this one up if you got the cash. I'm not a big hack n' slash guy but i enjoy this game.			"

Know that the camera is fixed so your right stick will be useless. If you want a hack and slash game, for the pc, then by all means you should get this. If you want a Castlevania game theeeeen maybe go play them on the Snes or get this on a very cheap sale.			"

												Talk about reviving a franchise, Lords of Shadow does a masterful telling the story of Gabriel belmont and his rise to power. Gameplay mechanics are incredibly well done as your combos gracefully decimate your foes. The music score provides a great atmosphere although nothing too memorable.

												Not the Castlevania game I was expecting. Yet it managed to go from less to great. Perhaps I'm too optimistic with it but I really enjoyed playing it. It's not perfect nor the best action game (Darksiders is still my favorite ""end of the worl"" action game) but it does things well and for $10 on sale it was a no brainer. Sure it could have been better with free camera and with less invisible walls, bit more explorations but everything else its great. Performance is ok, with a core i5@3.3GHz, 8GB RAM and a gtx560se I get constant 60fps @ 1600x900. I could run it at 1080p and still 60fps but GPU usage on this game is agressive making my poor GPU reach 60-65 C with ease and even on the credits screen it was around 55 C. Using my GPU software I could increse fan speed a bit and I got 55 to 57 C.			"

												Finally on PC...This was the most under rated game of 2010 on the PS3 and Xbox. I played and beat the game on PS3. The game for $30 with both DLC packs is a great value(I paid $60 for the game and $10 each for the DLC packs =$80 PS3). It has a great story line with good cinematic cut scenes. The graphics are good, the sound track and FX are good and the game play is great, but a 360ce controller is the best way to play and enjoy it. If you're a hard core gamer the paladin difficulty will challenge even the best. It's an epic Adventure with lots of Action. You start off killing Werewolves and 12 chapters later face Satan. 12 epic Boss fights, tons of creatures to slay inbetween, lots of weapons to upgrade through XP points you earn by killing creatures, lots of items to find and earn and puzzles to solve.The game has some replay value if you're after achievments, if you can get them all then your one badass botton pushin mofo gamer...For $30 you would be hard pressed to find a more fun, challenging and entertaining game. This game looks better and plays better on a PC vs the consoles it originally came out on. I usually don't say this much about a game, especially one 3 years old, BUT for $30 it's a great bang for the buck. Please don't listen to the haters, this game rocks. Most people love it...The Demo is the lowest aspect of what the game is all about. The rest of the first chapter and the other 11 chapters are really good. Play the demo first to see if your system can play it and then buy this GREAT Aventure Action Game!!! This game on sale is a huge gaming value ! I'm looking forward to Castlevania LOS 2 to come out on PC too.			"

												Tough to add-on what others have stated already but the bottom line is if you enjoy hack-n-slash type games then you will not want to miss this one.  What separates this one is the story and graphics.  The visuals are amazing and after playing it on the PS3 and starting again on PC it is testament to the developers to see how well the visuals have held up.  Having the DLC thrown in wasn't necessary as I felt there was nothing additional to make them worth playing (felt very ""tacked on"") but glad they're here anyway.			"

People have said it's a bad God of War ripoff and despite the fact that so many people make that arguement it doesn't make it any less true. I keep finding myself thinking about playing it but every time I go to press play my mouse jumps up to a better game and I play that instead. Even if it is on super sale for a dollar don't buy it. Don't even steal it because just the time it takes to download is a ripoff. Go play one of the good Castlevanias that are actually a Castlevania game instead.			"

												If you look at this game without comparing it to others of it's genre or looking at previous Castlevania games then it is a decent game. For me Castlevania Curse of Darkness is one of my favorite games ever. I tried giving this game multiple shots on Xbox and Pc and i just dont like it. It's tedious. The camera angles suck. The combat isn't all that great. Enemies attack right through your hardest hits. It doesnt allow you to feel powerful at all. Your best bet is just sitting there waiting to get a perfectly timed counter. Cool at first but it gets boring quick. I can't recommend this game as i just dont think it's all that enjoyable			"

												If you're the type of person who really enjoys backtracking over the same levels two or three times (minimum), and you're really excited by the idea of never actually getting *stronger* and instead just getting more consumable gadgets to throw at stuff, then this is the game for you! If you're not the type of person to whom this stuff sounds appealing, move on. This game is plagued by a lack of imagination, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera angles, and even a little contempt for the people foolish enough to play it. Example: the Chupacabra. Rather than any sort of goat-sucking, the Chupacabra exists just to waste five minutes of your life. It shows up twice, steals everything but your main weapon and consumables, and then you have to chase it down -- but you never get to kill it. Or smack it. It just boogies on out of there after being a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and adds literally nothing to the overall experience. I got up to chapter nine (I think) and uninstalled it when I realized it was just going to be more of the same, especially once I finally gained the ability to double-jump (!!!) and would have to go back through six or eight previous levels to get the upgrades I was unable to reach before. That's not _fun_, that's a way to pad the ""hours played"" numbers. It's dull, tedious, but it's absolutely on par with the rest of the game.			"

												There is not much good action adventure slashers on PC, as a matter of fact there is not much of them at all(on PC). Till now I remember Legecy of Kain series, Prince of Persia(sands of time trilogy) and quite new Darksiders 1 & 2, there is also DMC series which am not familiar with, yet.Comparing Castlevania LotS:+plot There is great story, with few but interesting characters, a lot of additional content(to be read ). And most of all great story telling by Patric Stewart. Personally I could only compare this plot to the Legacy of Kain series which has quite similar world and great plot also. +Puzzles In first chapter I was afraid that there won't be puzzles at, when I stumbled across first one I was not impress. But during whole game puzzles become more complex, harder and more interesting, with great vampire chess at first place, this is also big advantage of this game.There is less puzzles than in PoP or LoK, but they are harder and more sophisticated. From possible cons this become one of the major pros of this game. +Combat First thing which I may not like in this game. There is a lot of Combos, but these are not very effective(visually and practically). attacks with magic are ok, but they are limited and keybord input lag which I and lot of PC players had didn't help with performing them.Pop and LoK combat system ware much simpler but I personally prefer one from Darksiders series which was almost perfect. +Graphic, level design and overall visual experience Generally graphics  are beautiful, it of course can't be compared to PC's FPS shooters, but it please the eye. Level designs are great and varied, similar to those in LoK but both games had resembledark fantasy universes.  +Music, voice. I fall in love into ""Belmont's Journey theme"". But whole soundtrack is absolutely amassing and epic. It fits this game perfectly.Voice acting is also definitely pros of this game. Some major cons, as I wrote above combat system could be better. Levels between beginning and end of many chapters are just boring because most of the actual story is at the ends of the chapters.As a conclusion well this is just epic game. All action-adventure games and slashers fans should go for it.PC port could be better thou. I used to playing this kind of games on keybord, but input lag was...annoying, especially in 2nd DLC boss(If you know what I mean :)) "

												As a Castlevania fan from the very beginning, and having played a few hours of this game now, I'm unimpressed.  It seems generic in its combat approach, and the boss fights really are too much like Shadow of the Colossus (though not as long or as elaborate).  It looks pretty, sounds quite nice, and has stellar voice acting; but the gameplay is lacking and the story is lackluster.			"

												Really good game. Lovely detailed scenery. Good graphics and fun gameplay. A classic re-imagined successfully!The hack n' slash parts are fun and varied enough to keep you interested while the puzzles and level design are suitably tricky without being  rock hard. Only faught a couple of bosses so far but they are a highlight, particularily the spectacular scripted sequences and cutscenes during these fights.If you like the genre you will love the game it is that simple. Production values are key here, the team making the game took time and effort to make quality throughout. As far as lifespan is concerned no multiplayer obviously but the single player campaign is a good length and in this edition it includes a few dlc quests also, so you won't finish it all in one night. Not finished the game at the time of writing, but I have heard the story is over average and it is indeed shaping up well.			"

												This is a great game, albeit not the best, but who am I kidding? I was constantly entertained. Yes, it takes elements from God of War and Shadow of the Colossus, but to be honest, it's because those idea works, and it still very much cut out it's own atmosphere. The action in God of War is a bit over the top (which is not a bad thing). This is still very much over-the-top at times, but it's a very different feel. The ambience is overall very different too, and the visuals (taking into account the release date) are quite good. With a custom ENB and SweetFX setting, they were phenomenol. The gameplay is very satisfying. And I appreciate being able to play Shadow of the Colussus-esque bosses because I wasn't able to on my own time, but they aren't my favorite. It's all too scripted for me. The short demo of LOS: 2 had a much better Titan battle where it was a combination of SOTC and fighting regular enemies and avoiding ranged attacks from another boss. I don't understand what people have against QTE... the reason they pop up everywhere is because they WORK, although sometimes they are overused in other games, where it seems every little action requires one. In this game, they keep you on your toes, because failing one at best gives you a loss of health. In boss fights, you will be brutally (and quite satisfyingly) killed, and I feel like I have to stay riveted to the scene so I don't miss one and get absolutely horendously murdered. I don't know many games where dying is quite as awesome as this game during the boss fights. I'm hoping the LOS: 2 continues that.The story is good, although it could have been a bit better. Comparing it to God of War, it is much better, although I'm a fan of story-driven games. Again, LOS: 2 looks like it's going to improve on this front. I like the whole descent into darkness thing, but Gabriel, as a character, is a bit lacking. His supposed transition to darkness is noticable, but not by much... he always seemed aloof and unempathetic. By the end, he's aloof, unempathetic, and a bit angrier (which is shown mostly through grimacing). I feel bad for him more when he's being described by the narrator then when I see him in cutscenes, except for a few particularly potent ones. Otherwise, he kinda falls flat.The end boss was a bit sudden, and I didn't like the design of the boss. He is not what I would visualize for that character. For a final boss battle, I would've liked something a bit more bad a** (can I swear on these reviews?) Again, I heard that's going to improve in LOS.EDIT: I didn't mention the static camera... but of course, that was a disappointment. Overall, I heavily recommend this game. However, I understand that some people might not like every aspect of it. As I always recommend, DOWNLOAD THE DEMO.			"

												I love this game and I hate this game.  This game is rewarding and infuriating.  This is a flawed gem that's worth playing.The first few hours of the game are abysmal and irritating.  You'll have to press through 30 minutes at a time, trying desperately not to throw your controller across the room.  You don't start with enough life or moves or idea of what the hell you're doing.  The game hasn't opened up yet.  It's 4 hours of long, drawn-out, arduous training wheels you really want to rip off but can't.  It is hellish and awful you you'll want to give up on the game.If you don't, which you shouldn't, the game opens up.  The points and skills start flowing in.  The mechanics open up.  The story gets interesting.  Everything gets better.  Everything.  It's like a switch.  It goes from horrible to wonderful in a mere hour of playtime.  It will go from tedium to joy in a matter of moments.The game is still brutally hard, even on Normal.  While the game is enjoyable and rewarding you will die a lot.  You'll be forced to rely on checkpoints like a crutch, especially during some boss fights.The puzzles are good.  They are generally doable without guides and aren't too hard.  If you've ever played an actual puzzle game these won't provide any real challenge, but they'll give you a nice break and some bonus skill points to boot.  If you are horrible at puzzles you can skip all of them.Don't expect a classic Castlevania experience.  There's some semblance of it there.. where you can go back to past levels with your existing gear and access new areas; but if you're the type of explore and poke around levels as you go the progression of your upgrades will be fairly natural; you won't need to backtrack if you don't really want to.The dynamic cinematic camera angles can be really, really irritating.  You'll get attacked off-screen by fast-moving enemies sometimes and you'll die from things you can't see.  You'll jump to places only to have the camera angle change and since you ever-so-slightly moved your thumbstick your character will whip around and fall somewhere he shouldn't, probably killing you in the process.  Words cannot describe how infuriating the camera can be, but with anything else this type of camera really just has a learning curve.  You'll figure out where to position yourself so you never get attacked off-screen again.  You'll figure out what angles to jump from to avoid untimely deaths.  None of this is really taught to you, but you'll figure it out (and die trying).Despite all of my griping about this game I still recommend it.  I really enjoyed it and I liked the direction they were going with it in for a sequel.  The story is dark and its world twisted.  There's a fascinating mix of different religious mythologies in said world that make it unique.  Despite what others might say the story is actually very easy to follow if you listen to what Patrick Stewart is narrating, read the travel scrolls you come across, and generally just pay attention.  It's not spoon-fed to you, but it's very easy to follow the plot and character development (there's actual character development!).  I think ultimately the story is what kept me interesting and going in this game.  Even when the combat gets too hard you'll want to keep going for the sake of finding out what happens to the protagonist.  He is so flawed and wonderful as a character; you'll come to care for him in a way you don't with most action game male leads.This game is weird.  It is unique.  So many of its parts are not.  The combat, upgrade system, platforming, and so many other things have all been seen before.  This is one of those games that is more than the sum of its parts.  It has a dark charm that draws you in.  This is an action game, but it is not typical for its genre.  It's like one of those 'weird' dark movies like Pan's Labyrinth that you really need to be in a certain mood to take in and enjoy.  If you go in looking for your typical hack 'n slash, typical action game, typical anything you'll get disappointed.  You'll be frustrated no matter what, but if you go in expecting something a little darker and a little more unusual it will transcend from a hateful frustration to a loving one, in the same way that you really love your spouse despite their infuriating habits and flaws that you really wish you could wave away.After finishing this game, in spite of all of my frustraton for it, I wanted more.  I am excited that the sequel to it is coming soon.  Speaking of the sequel: do yourself a favor and ignore every single piece of information about Lord of Shadows 2 that you can.  Even the promo artwork, if possible.  A major story component to the end of this game will be spoiled immediately, which really sucks.  It doesn't ruin it so much that you'll want to stop playing, though, the journey is still worth the 20 hours it will take to experience.			"

												I'm fan of the series since the early days, bud definitely not a hardcore one. When I saw the sale offer I didn't think twice and I bought this title without knowing what was I in for (even more, I was completely unaware that this is a series reboot). I was just looking for a fun and fast paced game and the game seemed to fit the bill, and I was 100% right. The sountrack is epic and the voice acting is the cherry on top. If you've at least seen screenshots of the early titles from the series you will easily recognise the environments as you progress over the game (and probably think of those screenshots in a different way now). I'm not saying this is ""the perfect game"" (the controls are a bit off at times, and the fixed camera is annoying at first), but it's extremely entertaining and feels like an interactive movie. The puzzles are entertaining, you can (and will) replay many levels  looking for secrets or trials without getting bored, the boss fights are a bit too easy at times but playing at higher difficulties or for the trials makes it harder (and sometimes frustrating if you use the wrong tactic).Bottom line: I'm looking forward to playing the sequel and I would recommend it to anybody that loves the action genre.

												For those not already aware, the Lords of Shadow entries of the Castlevania series are not a part of the classic continuity; Mercury Steam has crafted a total re-imagining of the Belmont legacy (including a rather big twist as to protagonist Gabriel Belmont's ultimate fate). This is not the first Castlevania game to take place in an alternate timeline, seperate from the clasic continuity, but it is probably the most ambitious among the alternate continuities. The developers did not, however, totally abandon or forget about the series' roots, and some little winks and nudges are scattered throughout the narrative (such as the reveal of how Gabriel's weapon, the Combat Cross, comes to gain the name of Vampire Killer, the name of the whip used by the Belmonts in the classic continuity. If you are a diehard fan of the original series, you may have a hard time swallowing all the changes, but if you are able to set that aside and accept Lords of Shadow as it's own experience, then you should be able to get a fair degree of enjoyment out of the story. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is, at it's core, a standard action adventure game which does not stray far from formula. This is not, necessarily a bad thing, though, as it follows the formula fairly well. LoS is simply an example of a game which does nothing new, but does everything well. You start at point A of the stage, and work your way towards the end, fighting enemies and solving puzzles along the way. You earn experience points, which allow you to purchase more combos, and upgrade your weapons and abilities along the way, allowing you to progress further, and also to revist previous stages an access areas you couldn't before. The combat controls are fluid and work well, though you should definitely play with a controller rather than the keyboard. I know it sounds obvious, but I was forced to play the majority of the first two chapters with my keyboard, and the experience was, at best, uncomfortably passable and, at worst, nearly unplayable. Once I was able to use a controller, however, things improved a hundred fold, and the game became much more fun. If I had to cite one major complaint about gameplay, I would say that the stages are fairly linear. For someone like me, who enjoys exploration, this felt rather limiting, especially since the stages are so beautifully designed. This doesn't do much to decrease the enjoyment, however, and in fact is almost nostalgic, as this makes the game more similar to the early installments of the series, before Symphony of the Night introduced us to the ""Metroidvania"" style of gameplay which defined the series for so many years. On that note, you may want to brace yourself for a notable lack of castles; Tomb Raider-vania may have been a better title for this game, as you spend more time in ancient ruins and lush forests and jungles than, but that is mere semantics and not a huge issue in the overall scheme. The bottom line is this: Lords of Shadow is a solid action-adventure game with an enticing narrative, and if that is what you are looking for then you should be able to enjoy this game.			"

												I bought this game the day it released on the PS3.  At the time it was very hard to put down.  If you can put aside bias from previous Castlevania games you'll have fun with this title.  It is nothing like any other Castlevania.First time through the story drove me onward.  Gabriel Belmont is a dark hero in a dark world.  Watching the plot unfold was by far the best part of the game for me.  Many of the enviroments you visit are graphical beauties.  The combat, though I was never great at it, wasn't terrible but wasn't anything special.  My main complaint the first time through was the abseents of Castlevania-esque music.  The soundtrack isn't bad, but I'm quite a fan of older Castlevania music.  After completing the game I picked it up off and on during the next few years to play levels at a harder difficulty, collect all the extras, and complete the extra missions.  It was challenging and fun, but not the best replayability.When this game released on steam I figured I'd pick it up since I no longer had the PS3 version.  Second time through the game feels much more like a chor.  Platforming becomes frustrating and boring, along with the combat.  The story still shines, though, and demands that the game is completed once again.Overall the game makes for a sad Castlevania game, but if you let go of the past your first journy through this new Castlevania world will be a memorable one.

												The first and biggest complaint I have is about the camera and it's transitions. My god are the transitions jarring and frequent, taking me out of the game every time, making me wish for control of the camera, and the fact the controls basically get stuck sometimes. I can't tell you how many times the character acted like he was hitting a wall and running along it after a transition, having to let go of the stick, then move him again is frustrating, and the platforming with a static camera was annoying, because the character doesn't turn or move smoothly, like with the camera there is no finesse in it's movements. The wall climbing just plain sucked, and I hated doing it everytime, I mean the most ""intense"" thing that would happen is the ledges breaking off behind you or getting away from the lava, but it didn't matter, you're stuck at one speed while wall climbing, so you just have to trundle along completely forgetting about the ""impending doom"" behind you. The combat at first is interesting, but after a few hours it got dull and tedious. The biggest highlight after I got bored with it, is when I figured out you could just straight us grab and kill the weaker enemies, but after a very short time, that got just as tedious. Getting yelled at to do things in a few fights by allies got old really fast. I was fighting the second Titan(collosus), and the girl kept yelling ""do it now, now grab onto to something"" over and over again while I was running over to do so, and other things not allowing me to focus or get into the fight, such as it was. The eviroments from what I was allowed to see were kind of interesting, and I'd of loved to look at the castle and landscapes, but you know, fixed camera and all. The story is dull, and the characters are aswell and during core games ending I laughed a bit at the portrayal of ""emotion"", because it just looks so stupid and bad. The eviroment has a clearly rich history and story I'd love to know about, but can't, so oh well.The ""puzzles"" in the game are a joke, and trust me if you've played any kind of game like this or any game with puzzles you've done these ones before.The padding is this game is ridiculous as well, the wall climbing, making enemies take more hits then necessary, the camera focused on objects/objectives for way longer than is needed, having just a swarm of enemies show up right after some platforming for no reason, then nothing as you go back to wall climbing/platforming, the motherf*cking chupacabras that get introduced out of nowhere that steal your relics so you have to chase them and get them back is terrible. They should be an optional thing to deal with after you beat the level to get a reward, not a main game element.			"

												Should you play this game? Yes. Though I would caution fans of the original series to keep an open mind. The Lords of Shadow games are not connected to the main storyline in any way. You will see familiar names, quotes and story elements from past titles in the original canon but ultimately this reimagining is its own animal. Think of it as a short and sweet break from the patterns and pace of the original. The environments are beautiful and the character designs are detailed. The game can become a bit of a rage fest when the QTE sequences start and there is no way to turn them off (Something to smile about in LoS2). Though once you get into the rhythm of the gameplay it should be smooth sailing for the most part. The story is centered on Gabriel Belmont and the journey that sends a man with noble intentions down a cruel dark path. Looking back on the three games as a whole there is some parallel to the Legacy of Kain series. Lords of Shadow shows the beginning of a dark road, Mirror of Fate is the outcome of the events in LoS as seen from another point of view and Lords of Shadow 2 are the two perspectives coming together for the end game. If you're the type that enjoys seeing a video game character fall from grace only to rise up and make the darkness within their own, I highly recommend the Castlevania: Lords of Shadow series, starting with this Ultimate Edition.

												Lords of Shadow is one of those games that gives new life to an old school type game.  The gameplay is similar to many adventure games (Mortal Kombat Anthologies: Sub Zero is a good example) and offers nothing new.  Go here, push this button/switch, fight bad guys with combos etc. is pretty much it.  However, the story is rather engaging (Patrick Stewart!) and the environments are stunning.  Also, as a player of a lot of the older Castlevania games, I feel like there are a lot of small tributes to the previous games if one is paying attention.  In summary:PROS:More Castlevania, woot!Patrick Stewart narating the storyAwesome cut scenes and environmentsBoss fights require some thought and strategy CONS:Fixed camera angle which leads toSometimes you have no idea where to go because you can't look aroundSome places require massive button mashingIf you like Castlevania, this is a good buy if on sale. Even as a Castlevania fanbot, I don't think this game is worth $30, though. 8/10			"

												I couldn't finish it. I just couldn't force myself to sit through more tedious fights with the same, boring combinations of moves, unpleasant camera shifts, dull puzzles, and awful, awful, awful writing. This game has writing at a level, read by the otherwise incomparable Patrick Stewart, which I surpassed in High School. I usually sit through mission briefings, as story is my favorite part of games that have it... this game, I did not. I COULD not. It was so cringingly painful that I would unconciously skip the beautiful voice of JEAN LUC PICARD HIMSELF. (I'm well aware of how terribly nerdy that sounds.)Enemies take numerous hits, but they aren't difficult to defeat. This cheap padding turns the game into a slog, rather than a challenge. Bosses are interesting, if simple enough in execution, typically presenting a single method by which the player may defeat them (or one which is overwhelming more effective), but other enemies offer no challenge apart from appropriate dodging and/or countering. The BEST part of the game is the background designs. The actual space which the player can traverse is quite limited, but the skyboxes and backgrounds are beautiful and display a real sense of imagination on the part of the game artists. Unless you are desperate for some fantastic settings, however, I strongly recommend staying away from this turd.			"

												Castlevania: Lords of shadow has to be one of the best games of the Castlevaina series. Visually the game is amazing with great graphics and scenic design, the one thing that stands out to me is the unforgettable soundtrack. We first get introduced to Gabriel Belmont, a member of a bortherhood of light. He has been put on a holy task to defeat the darklords of this world but he also has his own quest of revenge on his poor lovers death Marie. You will encounter many vile creatures through out the game such as vampires, werewolves, skeletons and much more.  Also I wont spoil it but there is some pretty amazing bosses sectionsI very much enjoyed this game and one of my all time favourites. I give it  9/10 rating.

The strong point of this game is the visuals, which are very good and demanding of a good PC. The combat is OK at his best with a lot of combos to unlock, but it´s a little bit stiff as the platforming aspect of the game.In overall it´s a good game, takes a little bit too much time to take off though, but i´m still waiting for old school Castlevania game, with the well known Metroidvania style which this game lacks.Pick it up on a good sale.

												DISCLAIMER - I COULD ONLY MAKE IT ABOUT 30 MIN INThis game gets my a fake award for both 'Most Nauseating Camera' and ‘Stop telling me what to do god dang it!’It wins the first for making me almost vomit. I mean, wow. I’ve never been this close to vomiting, while playing a game. It constantly moves, shakes or wobbles. I’m fine with fixed positions, sometimes they’re really cool! But only if done right. If you do it wrong, the customers may come close to vomiting on their keyboards. Some will do it anyway, if only to make point.This game has control issues and doesn't trust you to do anything by yourself. Constantly moving the camera to tell you what to do and when. And always with the text. Press RT to grapple, Press RT to loot, Do this, do that. Maybe tell me once or twice. But when you feel the need to tell me for a fifth time, just stop. Please? Can we please talk about the ridicilous jingle that accompanies the text? Grrr. Patrick Steward is great. The rest is laughable. Lines are rushed and they don’t really seem to care. There might be better actors further in, but when the protagonist fails this miserably, no hope is to be regained. The visuals are great. Yay! Score one!Wouldn’t reccomend it. "

												While the graphics can, at time, come off as looking a little rough and the combat may get slightly repetitive, this is an otherwise good reboot of a fantastic - not to mention classic - franchise.You play as Gabriel Belmont, one of the last members of the Brotherhood of Light, an ancient order dedicated to fending off the minions of the Lords of Shadow in the name of God Almighty. Tasked with journeying to an ancient forest where the power of the Old Gods still resides, Gabriel seeks the soul of his dead wife, whom the elders of his order suspect holds an important message pertaining to the Lords of Shadow and their increasing influence over the lands.Gabriel's main weapon is the Combat Cross, which is a retractable chain whip in the form of - wait for it - a giant metal cross. This provides for some relatively basic hack-n-slash combat, though they do feature some nifty combos and the cross is upgradeable. You get some secondary weapons as well, such as throwing daggers and an amulet that lets you absorb magical energy (neutral) and convert it (light or shadow) to varying effects. There is also a bit of platforming thrown into the mix that is, to be perfectly honest, neither here nor there - what I mean is, it's neither terrible nor is it particularly amazing either.Plus, it's got Patrick Stewart on narration, which is just epic!

												This game oozes quality. The enviroment, story, and voice acting are all above and beyond what most games give you. The combat and leveling are good aswell, you'll be button mashing different combos for the most part. I can not think of a single place where they decided to go cheap on this game. Oh you wonder about Replay?, yeah check that one off too. You'll find hidden♥♥♥♥♥♥on every level and the items you don't find they'll let you know you left behind, so no need for guides. Hidden items don't make or break you either, they just give you more health or magic. All and all pick this one up if you got the cash. I'm not a big hack n' slash guy but i enjoy this game.			"

Know that the camera is fixed so your right stick will be useless. If you want a hack and slash game, for the pc, then by all means you should get this.

												Talk about reviving a franchise, Lords of Shadow does a masterful telling the story of Gabriel belmont and his rise to power. Gameplay mechanics are incredibly well done as your combos gracefully decimate your foes. The music score provides a great atmosphere although nothing too memorable.

												Not the Castlevania game I was expecting. Yet it managed to go from less to great. Perhaps I'm too optimistic with it but I really enjoyed playing it. It's not perfect nor the best action game (Darksiders is still my favorite ""end of the worl"" action game) but it does things well and for $10 on sale it was a no brainer. Sure it could have been better with free camera and with less invisible walls, bit more explorations but everything else its great. Performance is ok, with a core i5@3.3GHz, 8GB RAM and a gtx560se I get constant 60fps @ 1600x900. I could run it at 1080p and still 60fps but GPU usage on this game is agressive making my poor GPU reach 60-65 C with ease and even on the credits screen it was around 55 C. Using my GPU software I could increse fan speed a bit and I got 55 to 57 C.			"

												As you can tell, I didn't play much of this game. That's because it's very hard to not be annoyed by it.This game should be called Castlevania: Corridor of Quicktime. That's because it's all it is: a big long corridor until you find enemies, where you punch the enemies for a little bit until the cutscene yanks the game out of your hand or you're prompted to do timed button presses, instead of just letting you kill the enemies like a real game. It's really annoying and makes you tired very fast.Do you think it looks a bit like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night? Or at least like Castlevania: Curse of Darkness? Think again. There's no map whatsoever. Why would you need it if it's just a big corridor of a game? There's no variety. Everything is scripted for you to just follow the path.It looks beautiful but there's the excuse of a game you have to play to see the rest, so it's not like you feel like doing it after a while. You just turn it off and do a bad review on Steam instead, I guess.Want a game where you level up and explore to find stuff? Buy a Castlevania game… but not this one.			"

The games i have beaten are Symphony of the Night (PS1) Aria of Sorrow, Circle of the Moon, Harmony of Dissonance (GBA) Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin, Order of Ecclesia (NDS) and finally Lords of Shadow and Lords of Shadow 2 (PC/Xbox/PS3). The Castlevania games are my favorite games by far, and i highly reccomend playing any of them.			"

												This game holds true to the original concept of Castlevania when it first released on the Nintendo Entertainment System. It's graphics are excellent for what the XBOX 360 can offer, and the level design and theme are synonymous with the original game in the style of platform fun, except it entails 3D design. The sequal Castlevania 2 Lords of Shadow pales in comparison; it fails on every level to deliver a true respresentation of what Castlevania was meant to be. Yes, Lords of Shadow 2 (which I played in the XBOX 360) has vampires and blood, but foretells the story in a way which would be comparible to Twilight instead of sticking to the roots of how the story was designed. It truly is a heartbreaking thing for me to see, as it might be a trend within the gaming community to destroy such beautiful games, and their beautiful storylines and art. In short, buy Lords of Shadow, and if you get the chance,♥♥♥♥♥♥on Lords of Shadow 2 and set it on fire.			"

I skipped doing that though and it wasn't that big of an impact.      -Lame cutscene style in the DLC (last 2 chapters).  But the story they told was still interesting.Overall I recommend the game.

												Fun game overall; the help pop-ups are a bit annoying, and often don't explain what needs to be done.  For instance, there are times that you are being ""gripped"" by enemies and two concentric circles appear on the screen.  One shrinks into the other and you are supposed to know to hit B at exactly the point when the two come together.  Never are you told that you have to press anything, let alone which of the 14 options you have on the 360 controller.  It is VERY tempermental, so if you are not superb with accuracy and speed, then boss fights will be infuriating!  Still playing it to see if it gets better.  Will ammend this review if my opinion changes.			"

												A somewhat great action adventure game and somewhat like a reboot of the castlevania franchise. The focus lies more on the excellent battlesystem and the exploration of the levels. The soundtrack is beautiful and supports the dark ambient of this game even more. One of the best i've heared in years. On the downside, the story of this game is very boring and even worse, 90% of it you will learn just right in the last 5 minutes before the final boss fight. Not a moment sooner.It has also too much levels. About 30% fewer levels would have been good, because they are just MEANINGLESS. They don't tell something of the story, nothing important happens, (hell!) you don't even know why you are there anyway!Also this game can't hold its own standard imho. It begins great. The land of the lycans, the first zone, is great! So many cutscenes! So emotional! *Sigh* Beautiful. The second zone, the land of the vampires remembers of the good old castlevania feeling. A BIG spooky castle with impressing architecture. Just stay still a second and watch it. It's bombastic! But the third zone, the land of the dead. Meh... its so BORING! It is empty, it is a dessert, nothing to see, almost no cutscenes, just run from level to level until the end of this game. *yawn*All in all, it is a game which made a lot of fun to me. At least the first two zones. Unfortunatly the last zone is SO boring, that the ending of this game keeps it away of the olymp of the action adventure games.			"

												The game is incredibly frustrating if a mouse and keyboard are your only options for controlling the action. The game itself looks visually slick and promising but, without a game controller, most non-leet PC gamers will die too often to maintain the level of fun. Even the tutorial fights had me respawning numerous times because of control awkwardness -- the keys are re-mappable, but this wasn't as helpful as I expected it would be -- and autosaves that save your progress at low health points in the middle of battles only make matters worse. The combination of the two is as frustrating as it is deadly.			"

												Having only played the older Castlevania games on the NES long ago, I can honestly say that I was very curious with this reboot as a modern version. And, it was well founded as the game really impressed me on various aspects! Without spoiling too much, this game follows the journey to redemption of Gabriel Belmont, an orphan taken cared of by the Brotherhood of Light. He wants to save the world from the Dark Lords of Shadow and also, avenge the murder of his wife. What he hasn't planned was how this journey will unfold all throughout his travels until he meets his fate at the end.PROS:+Solid Porting to PC (played the game with the XBOX 360 gamepad which was well suited for this action game... can't comment as for Keyboard+Mouse controls as I haven't tried them).+Fun gameplay (reminiscent of God of War playstyle).+Challenging combat (the game is quite hard on ""normal mode already"").+Ultimate Edition = Includes the two story DLC set right after the endgame.+Fantastic crafted world, diverse levels, incredible atmosphere and amazing HD visuals for a port too!+Excellent voice acting (Robert Carlyle, Patrick Stewart, Jason Isaacs, to name a few).+Epic orchestrated soundtrack.+Great boss fights.+High replayability if you seek to unlock everything and get achievements.CONS:-Awkward camera positioning. (Since you have no control of the camera, it can become problematic while navigating, exploring and especially during combat).-Inaccurate platforming and pacing issues (WAY TOO MANY PUZZLES that slows down the pace of the game).-LOTS of Quick-Time Events.RECOMMENDATION:Absolutely! You crave an action game with good gameplay, awesome story and with an incredible atmosphere? Get Castlevania: Lords of Shadow Ultimate Edition! I just hope Lords of Shadow 2 won't take too long to release now on PC!RATING:8.5 / 10			"

												This game commits every gaming sin possible. Quicktime events and button mashing are not good game design and the Shadow of the Colossus enemies lack all of the creativity and wonderment of SotC. LoS is literally button mashing, quicktime events, and terrible puzzles. Putting a stone in a glowing statue and then rotating it slightly is not a puzzle it is a task. In SotC you have to find out how to weaken the giant beast, find the weak point, hurt it, then find another. Here you just dodge an attack or two, do some quicktime events, follow a linear path up the beast and hurt the blatently obvious weak spot. And worst of all, CUTSCENES DURING THE BOSS BATTLE, LITERALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT THERE WAS A CUTSCENE THEN YOU CONTINUE. The fact this game got high scores, was generally well recieved, and was given a sequel is deplorable. This perpetuates bad game design as being good enough if you make enough money. I can't get into the story with this level of terrible gameplay, if the story is so good make it a movie or a book, don't give me this garbage.			"

													Castlevania LoS was a very good game. It's strongest point was that it had a really solid fighting system, along with abilities that were  progressively unlocked. The fighting always felt really satisfying and switching between various abilities to keep your momentum going is a lot of fun.  My only real complaint as far as unlocks go was that some one in particular came late in the game, but overall they unlocked at a good rate. This i 	The story itself was pretty good. It's nothing new, but it's nor inherently bad it just pretty predictable; especially the so called plot twist that can be spotted coming a mile away. But, the characters themselves were interesting and the voice actors were top notch.	My biggest gripe would be the camera angles. At times it felt like I was constantly battling the game to get a decent viewing angle. This is further compounded by some of the hidden items being out of view, mostly due to the fact that the camera was often at a static angle and until you stepped into the right spot you wouldn't be able to see it.	Despite any complaints or misgivings I may have mentioned, overall Castlevania Lords of Shadow was a lot of fun to play and a great game overall. I would definitely recommend CLoS to any fans of Hack n Slash genre or God of War type fighting.			"

												This is just the third Castlevania game I've played, so I can't really tell if it fits the Castlevania-""feel"" or not. As a pure adventure game it has got a lot to offer: nice graphics, gorgeous vistas, cool monsters, epic bosses, and an interesting story with superb voice acting from Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart. It is also very long, so you definitely get your money's worth from this one.It is virtually littered with cut scenes that drives the story forward, with most of them skipable. The game is split in chapters containing a varying amount of levels. Every finished level, in any chapter, can be played again right after it is finished the first time. This comes in handy if you didn't find (or couldn't get to) every item in that particular level. To add some extra replayabilty, a trial is also unlocked for every finished level. Some of these are a cakewalk, and some are painstakingly hard.The gameplay is a mix of platforming and fighting. The platforming is pretty straightforward and easy, but will sometimes punish you if you get sloppy. The fighting works really well once you get the hang of all the combos and the dodge and block moves. There is also frequent use of action buttons, which could be irriitating, but works pretty good here (kinda).The ordinary gameplay is broken off with the occasional puzzle and boss fight. Some of the puzzles are really clever and you need your brain, raher than your reflexes, to beat them. As for the boss fights, I played the game on normal difficulty, and though some of the bosses were really challenging, it never felt hopeless fighting them. Just a couple of tries later the adventure continued.This ultimate edition also contains a ton of unlockable, very nice artworks, as well as some other in-game extras.It also contains two DLC chapters, and here comes my only real issue with this game. Don't get me wrong, they both look as good as the earlier game, and also serves to flesh out and deepen an already great story. The thing is that they try to make it last longer by riddle it with puzzles, as opposed to the earlier game when they were occasional, and some irritatingly hard platforming sequences. There is also a boss fight that many probably will find a bit unfair (I found it reeeeeally f-ing hard on just normal difficulty and I rage quit more than once).Besides that last part, I can do nothing but recommend this excellent adventure game. I will definitely buy LoS 2 when it arrives to PC.			"

The voice acting is decent, and the combat is fairly challenging, or at least you actually have to pay attention and use some strategy.  Began on Knight difficulty (hardest available).  However, at times it feels like the game ""cheats"" at some points and it can be very unforgiving on you the way it autosaves.Hit detection is fairly poor, as enemies can begin swinging, and you'll be damaged before their weapon actually physically reaches you.  Almost none of your attacks will interrupt an enemy, when almost every enemy attack will interupt yours.  I've also had a few times I've gone into a battle with full magic, died, and began at the autosave point with none.You ARE going to die often, and if you started a fight after an autosave with very little health, you'll be stuck with that.  Same goes with boss battles.  Additionally - when you end one chapter (or part of) and begin another, you are NOT granted full health / magic.  Not sure if that is an aspect of the difficulty level, or the game design, but these end to some bouts of replaying a fight a good number of times needing to get things perfect to survive.  Though, I believe you *can* turn the difficulty down at anytime if you are cowardly enough.I'd recommend it.  Also - there's always a demo if you're not sure it's for you.  The demo stays pretty true to the rest of the game's content.			"

												A well designed action adventure game, with a better than average story. The most brilliant part of the game however is the setting, atmosphere and general game design. From environments to enemies, the lore and setting will take you in. I recommend this anyone who loves gothic elements such as vampires, werewolves, and demons as they are well represented here.			"

												This is a fantastic game. It pays homage to the original very well and kept me entertained for hours. I haven't bothered with the trials because they're just ""re-do the mission"", but I did have a good go at finding all the upgrades. The main selling point I'd say is the story, which is just great.Graphics: 8/10Sound: 8/10Story: 10/10Mechanics: 9/10Puzzle difficulty: 10/10Total: 9/10			"

It's a great way to bring the series back into action, and it still feels like Castlevania should, dark, hard [at times], but worth the time used to play through. I absolutely love and recommend this game!10/10			"

												Good: Gothic, cinematic storytelling with awesome voice actors. Visceral, brutal combat clearly inspired by games like God of War. Lots of secrets hidden within the levels. Incentives for replaying levels and achieving ""perfection"" in those levels. Looks beautiful and runs smoothly on my not-so-modern rig. The combat abilities are fun to play with, keep you on your toes, and prevents the game from being a button-mash or click-fest.Bad: There are some really ugly faces in this game. The game is not designed for a mouse and keyboard so it can feel a little wonky sometimes. Fixed camera can make exploration a chore. The minigames seem weird and forced, and they detract from the pacing of the game.Overall: There are better ways to spend 30 dollars, but if it's on sale for 20 or lower, I'd suggest going for it.

												This frankenstein of a game starts out dreadfully dull and the default difficulty makes the learning curve extra bumpy.  There is an enjoyable action game underneath all the crap and it is well worth discounted price.  Folks looking for classic Castlevania exploration should look elsewhere.For best experience, I recommend starting with Squire difficulty.  Remind yourself that this game is balanced around the overpowered block button (with dodge/jump being secondary avoidance), so use block liberally as you learn the timing of perfect blocks.There are plenty of annoyance in the game that you should expect if you buy/play this game.  Game's menu keys are stupidly locked to enter key.  There is no mouse support during gameplay.  Fixed camera angle likes to hide enemies from view.  Platforming is really boring and pointless most of the time and overuse of the ""hold on"" mechanic like those seen in Shadow of Colossus will make you facepalm. The final verdict is a buy if you are looking for a discounted action game to kill time between major action games, and you are ok with all of the above in exchange for interesting boss battles.  If you're choosing between playing this game vs playing better designed-for-PC action games like Vindictus and Tera (or Black Desert, Blade & Soul, etc.), I'd play those first.			"

												*Before you buy this game make sure you have a controller. It makes playing the game so much easier.*That being said, this is a very great game. I've heard alot of people say that this game rips off Shadow of the Collosus, God of War, and Tomb Raider. It is very similar, but who says a game cant be similar to another one. The story is great, the combat is very satifying (You can unlock several combos and abilitys), the visuals are beautiful, and the voice acting is perfect. The only real bad thing I can say about it is that it has alot of invisible walls and a few camera problems, but even then its just minor nitpicking. Any fan of Castlevania will love this game.			"

												This Game is really good, i purchased this game for the 360 then for ps3 never really givning it a chance. Now when the sequal is about to come out. I decided let me give this a try since i love castlevania and havent played a good one since the GBA days. Got it on the steam sale and really gave it a go and iam loving the story and what Mercury steam did with this franchise and giving castlevania an actual origin story. If you love God of war and Darksiders and any third person action game. Castlevania is all that and more give it try its well worth it.			"

												I am an old castlevania fan, and i just finished the game in 110% and got 100% achievements. Why? To make this review count. Im really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at people who made this game, not because its bad, but because they ruined it. Its like hitting your self with a frying pan, or more like painting a beautiful painting, and then smacking it with dog poop. Why game is GOOD?> Great story that ties somehow all castlevania games together ( one bad thing about it: its dull at the beginning, yet keeps getting better over time)> Great enemy and in general graphical desing ( Landscapes, monsters, everything looks great, exept for the final boss... he looks unfinished and pathetic, but maybe thats the point?)> The combat system is original, takes a lot of time to master the focus meter and usage of magic but over all its fun ( nvm useless combos that you wont even bother to learn after you have the good ones)> I need to point out how smart they animated the whip attacks in 3D. Looks REALLY REALLY impressing> Actually has this ""castlevania"" feel (for most of the partNow what kills the game?> Fixed on player camera - Tell me! Why the ♥♥♥♥ lock the camera on angles that are for most parts nonsense? When you play a 3D game you NEED to control the camera. You NEED to see where you are jumping etc. I cant count all the times i jumped into my doom, because the camera didnt even show me a platform somewhere else. Althou the camera works sort of OK in combat, there is no reason to fix it on landscapes, when you are trying to make a tricky jump. Also, whats the point of making awsome landscapes, if the player cant even see them! Because the camera thinks otherwise. ♥♥♥♥ the camera. And dont tell me ""its a fixed camera game"". NO, fixing a camera in a 3D platformer on the player is just evil and wrong. Take a lesson from darksiders devs. camera should be controlable via the mouse or pad> Hit detection - This is a thing that should be fixed before the game release. First off there are times where Gabriel takes damage in the same moment as the enemy attack animation starts. What does this mean? It looks wrong and makes some attacks unblockable and undodge able. Even if you have uber reflexes, the game expects you to be a prophet. Other times the animation shows clearly that you should have been hit, but the game thinks otherwise. Yeaah sometimes a huge sword just flies throu your body without making even a scratch. wtf. This is either a problem of the hitbox, or hit timer. Im just going to call it broken hit detection.> QTE - You might say that there are too mane QTE in the game, but i actually like them + they are not sooo anoying, dont worry :)>neccesery backtracking - dont get me wrong, backtracking is a good thing if you want to find all the secrets and stuff, but its a sin if you HAVE to backtrack orelse you dont get any power ups, without those power ups you will have a very hard and unfair challenge. Also backtracking is good for exploration games, where there is a open world. I have nothing against invisible walls, but if you cant explore the world, why force the player to backtrack levels? This is just a cruel way to make the playtime longerAnd thats all, believe it or not but if not for these 2 issues that ruin the whole experience. I would call this a 10/10 game, because castlevania! It even recyles some of classic enemies, and there are some eastereggs so to call.TL;DRI recommend this game from my heart, its greatBUT BEWARE:>locked camera>broken hit detection			"

												Excellent game, with great animations, many enemies, a good plot and wonderful environments.The good:- Gabriel abilities and combat skills;- the bosses, except for the Titans;- a quite various gameplay;- the graphics and the inspired environments.The bad:- the fixed camera: simply horrible and inconvenient;- the jump system, that lacks in precision;- the Titan battles: really boring and needlessly long.My final rank: 9/10.

												I haven't played any of the Castlevania's since the NES, so take that for what's it worth.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed this game!  I will admit, there are times the camera angle makes you want to scream violently, the rest of the game (story as well as gameplay) will make up for the times you're wanting to shake your monitor like a British nanny.

												This is a game I was expecting to be much better than it actually was. It is a linear game with repetitive combat and a lot of filler levels. The story is basically kill all three Lords of Shadow, so the protagonist`s wife can be resurrected. The plot reveals itself to be a little bit more complex than that. Based on what I know about Lords of Shadow 2, I was expecting a great ending, but I was disappointed.What keeps the game going is that it gets so boring and repetitive that just when you are about to give up, you either get a new ability or a great boss fight, so it brings the excitement up again. The combat features several sets of combos that you can purchase with in-game experience, but most of them are useless, you end up using your special powers which you obtain as you defeat bosses much more often.I can say that one of the few things I liked about this game is that the boss fights are how they are supposed to be: challenging.Last, but not least, there are some good puzzles in this game, and they are also very challenging. There is even a Vampire Chess game. The game would be better if the filler levels could be exchanged for more puzzles like the few ones present.I recommend skipping this game and looking for a better Castlevania.			"

												one of my all time favorite games i have every played.Where to start the story beautiful, graphics amazing,gameplay is bare but its still good.This by far is the best castlevania for it defined the series by taking a different turn and making a lore for dracula which hadnt been done before and they killed it with a mind blowing story and so sad with castlevania los 2 cause the first level made the game look, feel and play better then the first game did but then went way down hill from there with lame gameplay a lack in the story and the feeling that they rushed it.please remake los 2 but change everything but the first level just make the rest of the game as amazing and rerealse it!!! just say you guys went and ♥♥♥♥ed up los2 big time.
