												While the title gives you the idea that this game is, essentially, the video game version of the film trilogy it is actually a 5-episode long sequel to that. What's more is that it's amazingly done and Telltale not only brought back many of our favourite characters from the show (and timelines, too) but we get to meet new ones, as well.The plot revolves around the disappearance of Doc and once Marty finds out he ended up in 1931 he is set out to save him - of course, speeding up to 88 miles per hour is a must for the journey to begin! It is an era of gangsters and speakeasies due to the prohibition of alcohol and of course this time period has its antagonist in the form of a Tannen.I would love to go on and elaborate the story but it would be a spoiler, plus, this game is best played if you are a fan of the trilogy as there are so many references to each film that it really helps you with the immersion. Bob Gale (creator of the trilogy) was brought on board to assist with the game's story, hence the references and the similarly funny nature of many of the dialogues.As for the gameplay: it is a standard point-and-click adventure game but unlike the classic ones (Lucasarts) released decades ago this one only has a small inventory (you never really have more than 5 items with you for long) and it is always one or two places where you can wander about and once you completed the needed task the story progresses accordingly taking you to new areas. Some puzzles can require some thinking but if you are desperate you can always use the in-game ""Hint"" function at your leisure.I enjoyed the story from beginning to end but I must admit I felt the tale lost its momentum around episode 4. It became a bit convoluted and I wished it'd end as soon as possible. The ending made up for the last episode's shortcomings and I might just do another walkthrough after I finished watching the films once more. Having been released 5 years ago this Telltale adventure does not have any achievements and nor do we have decisions that can result in a different story progression - this time it is as linear as it gets.Overall, Back To The Future The Game is a great video game and I hope Hollywood will never ruin the trilogy by making a sequel or remaking it. This game is another hint for them so that the story can be left alone for good. If you liked the production of Zemeckis and Spielberg and you're also appreciative of the games Telltale releases this game is a must for you!			"

												If you're a big fan of the original Back to the Future trilogy, you need this game. No, seriously, you NEED this game. Period. The storyline is incredibly good and feels authentic to the original movies, pushing the characters in interesting directions that I hadn't expected. It takes place after the movies, and as Marty McFly you'll end up traveling back to prohibition era Hill Valley after discovering that a prolonged absence by Doc Brown is due to his having been murdered back in the 30's. As expected, traveling back in time to save him leads to unexpected alterations in the timeline and a frantic hustle to fix one mess, only to create another. Overall it's very cleverly written and worthy of the franchise.Aesthetically, the game takes a more stylized cartoonish approach to the characters rather than attempting realism - something that I personally rather enjoyed. And the voice acting - hoo man the voice acting is amazing! Christopher Lloyd reprises his role as Emmet Brown, and though Michael J Fox does not reprise his, the person who fills in as Marty does such an amazingly good impression that I literally could not tell the difference. Seriously, I was genuinely shocked to learn it hadn't been Fox voicing him. Best yet, Fox returns for a couple of cameo roles in the final episode.From a gameplay standpoint, it's a point-and-click adventure with pretty simple puzzles. Overall its approach is straight forward and only a small handful of times did I find myself getting hung up on a puzzle - however, the puzzles aren't really the point so much as that you're involved in an interactive movie, and this is made very clear by the fact the game has a hints feature that will outright TELL you the answers if you're well and truly stuck, allowing you to breeze through the story at a pace that's already hardly broken by frustration. At least, not in terms of the puzzles themselves. This isn't to say this game isn't without issue - things like movement is a bit buggy and aggravated me quite a bit, especially when switching between sceneries. The inventory is also kind of annoying the way it makes you have to scroll through it instead of having all items available at once. As inconvenient as this can sometimes be, it's hardly enough to detract from what makes this game shine.Seriously, if you're a fan of the movies, put this in your collection. You'll thank yourself.

												The fact that this is a telltale adventure game about the back to the future series should pretty much determin on its own weither or not you should buy this game. the writing is fantastically clever and reminiscent of the origional trilogy. If you like point and click adventure games or the back to the future franchise then you should buy this game. If not then the game isnt for you and it is never going to be for you.			"

												Really amazing game, I loved each of the 5 episodes and always hungry for more after each episode. Writing as as well as you expect from a Telltale game....needless to say 10/10. I cant really think of much else to say about it other than its worth every penny (and more) if you enjoy point and click action/adventure puzzle story games.			"

												Back To The Future: The Game is heavy.Episode 1 feels like classic BTTF1. Very rewarding for fans of the series, full of lots of references. Everything you could want from the reintroduction. Some things are new, and other things are still tied to the original series. The introduction of Young Emmett “Doc” Brown is a nice addition to the series. The puzzles are fine, but not the main appeal.Episode 2 feels like classic BTTF2, during the past timeline. This is where the game starts to stand on its own, rather than relying on a heavy dose of nostalgia. This episode further develops the characters of the game, introducing the major conflict of the game. The puzzles are much better, and far more logical than the puzzles of Episode 1.Episode 3 feels like classic BTTF2, during the alternate present/future timeline. Continues the story established in Episode 2, while allowing the player the opportunity to see an alternate version of the cast of the original movie.  This cast manages to hold true to the classic personalities, while giving the characters a new reality to react to. The puzzles feel very heavy handed when compared to the previous two episodes. They rely far more on trial & error, over logic or clear direction like the previous episodes' puzzles. The highlight of the puzzles in this episode would be the heavy metal guitar battle.Episode 4 doesn't feel like a classic BTTF movie. But this is not a bad thing. By this point, Young Doc learns how to stand on his own two feet, which is also what happens with the story. It no longer needs the safety net of the classic movie trilogy any more. While this episode might have the worst and most tedious puzzle in the game, conversely the story is one of the highpoints of the entire game. Asking heavy questions like “Is it worth hurting a friend, to do what is right?” and “How do you deal with someone that has given up hope?”. This episode manages to juggle these types of questions, while still advancing the story into the final chapter. By the end of episode 4, this story has truly become its own, and worthy of the BTTF name.Episode 5 resolves all the stories created from Episode 1 through Episode 4, and at the same time it feels like classic BTTF3. This episode, by far, has the best puzzle in the game. This puzzle actually advances the plot, rather than being that annoying thing that stops the story from progressing. As this episode gives closure to the game, it pays homage to the series, with the ending that ties back into the classic BTTF1 ending.If I would have known that the writer of the movies helped write this game, I would have played it years ago. The gameplay isn't the main attraction here. The reason anyone would play this game, is for the story. While the story is VERY linear, this is not a negative. We are more interested in allowing Marty to fix the timeline, over having a heavy focus on gameplay or a branching narrative. This game is going for a cinematic presentation, and it would never be considered a bad goal to aim for, as it is creating its own spot in the BTTF legacy alongside the trilogy of movies. It knows how to do a proper BTTF story, while still breaking new ground worthy of being included in the canon of the series. The Young Doc storyline shows us that no matter what influences the future, you will still become the heavy hitter that you were always destined to be. There are so many great references and parallels to the movie trilogy, it feels rewarding to fans of the series, as we are not ignored for a new vision of the universe. It really respects the original trilogy, which is rare for a video game based in a movie universe. This game manages to create new classic BTTF moments, without completely relying on constant references to the movies.It has the “classic” Telltale problem with reading the previous episode's gamesave for the choices you made in the previous episodes. Luckily the number of times the later episodes check the gamesave is minimal, so it is only a minor annoyance. It's best to just choose the first “cover name” for Marty, because that is what the game defaults to, if it fails to correctly check the first gamesave for the name you have actually chosen. This allows for your immersion to not be broken, while bypassing the problem of Telltale's bad programming.There is a heavy amount of heart and joy in this game, and it is safe for all members of the family to share. Because of this fact, it is a true sequel to the BTTF trilogy, and has earned the title of being called Back To The Future Part 4.Back To The Future Part 1 – 10/10Back To The Future Part 2 – 9.7/10Back To The Future Part 3 – 9.9/10Back To The Future Part 4 – 9.8/10Happy Back To The Future Day! I hope we all ended up creating a better future for ourselves, than Marty did today in the original BTTF2 timeline, before he learned his lesson in BTTF3.			"

												Few movies hold the place in the public conscious like Back To The Future. Since their release in the 80's and early 90's, the Back To The Future movies have captivated generation after generation. There are probably several reasons these movies had such a massive impact and are still being watched today. One reason could be the loveable characters, and another could be that a lot of movies have used time travel as a plot, but Back To The Future was the first to really get it RIGHT.I personally grew up watching the animated series on Saturday mornings, and watching Marty and Doc travel in time always was such a fun time for me. Then at a later age I watched the movies and they have since become three of my favourite movies ever. So naturally, when I heard there was a game coming out, and it was going to be an adventure game developed by Telltale, who have already been responsible for mostly single-handedly bringing the glory of graphic adventure games, such as Monkey Island and Sam & Max, back to gamers, I was pretty hyped. For some reason I waited until all the episodes had been done, which I don't regret since it made me able to get the complete experience right away.To best describe BTTF The Game would be to call it a fourth movie. Story-wise, the game remains incredibly faithful to the canon established by the movies and the plot is very well-written and always seem to make sense within the rules established by them, though this could mostly be credited to the team using Bob Gale and Robert Zemmeckis as story consultants, making sure the continuity would never be broken in any severe way as this could really have ruined the game in a major way. I won't spoil the story for those who have yet to play this game, but all I can say is that it really feels like it could be the plot of a fourth movie, and it has enough twists and turns to keep each episode worth playing. A genious twist is that each episode ends on a cliffhanger that leaves you aching to play the next, and even the final episode has a bit of a teaser at the end, leading us to expect another BTTF game some time in the foreseeable future.Another great aspect about the game is obviously the voice acting. While they couldn't get Michael J. Fox to reprise his role as Marty, they found a very great replacement in AJ LoCascio who sounds eerily similar to Fox. Thankfully, Chris Lloyd is back, great and funny as ever as the old Doc from the movies. It doesn't really feel like he has aged much in the last 20-30 years, and he does a great job bringing Doc back to life, though I doubt anyone else could really have done it. The acting feels natural and unforced and unlike many games where the voices could feel robotic and like they were simply reading a script, the voices in this game really adds tons of personality and flavour to the rich gallery of people that are featured thruout the episodes.Those looking for realistic graphics though should probably look away from this game. The game opts for a more cartoony style that feels very reminiscent of Monkey Island, another franchise that Telltale has ""reanimated"". However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing as the animation is great and adds even more personality to the game and gives its a very unique charming style. I did notice some issues with the graphics though, such as black lines appearing randomly, however the game ran perfectly smoothly even with everything maxed out in 1080 HD resolution, so it did not detract too much from an otherwise enjoyable experience.The controls feel highly reminiscent of a classic point-and-click adventure game where you use the mouse to make Marty look at things and pick them up or examine them. Everything has been simplified to a simple intuitive click of a button and the game feels really easy to play. The inventory screen is easy to use and you can make Marty examine items for clues and such. Another helpful feature in the game is the hint system, which greatly helps if one gets stuck, which often tends to happen with people who rarely play these games or are new to the genre. The game also lets you view what goal Marty has, which in of itself gives you a clue what to do.Overall, I can't really find anything negative to say about this game. If you like adventure games like Monkey Island, Grim Fandango or Day of the Tentacle, then I highly recommend this. Not only does it continue the BTTF franchise in a way that no new movie ever could, it's also a blast to play and should give the fans of the movies tons of laughs and an overall great experience. Some moments felt a bit tedious, but in total it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience for me.Summary:Story: 10/10Great story that sticks faithfully to the rules and plot points established by the movie trilogy, with great voice acting from AJ LoCascio and Christopher Lloyd as well as a whole cast of great characters.Graphics: 9/10Aside from a few glitches here and there, the graphics are great, colourful and with tons of personality. Has that typical Telltale charm that no one can replicate.Controls: 10/10Nothing bad to say as the game offers several control methods and all of them are a blast to play with.Presentation: 9/10A few moments in the game felt tedious, which detracted slightly from the overall experience, which was great.Total score: 10/10If you haven't played this, but love either BTTF or adventure games, then this is a must-have title.

												It's hard to deny that Back to the Future games have had a sordid history. When the best game based on the series up until now was a Grand Theft Auto: Vice City mod, it doesn't speak very well of the efforts that came before it. Still, with Telltale's new effort, the series finds what might be its first good commercial adaptation. With excellent use of the movies running jokes, themes, and soundscape, and Telltale's clever writing and puzzle-crafting, Back to the Future manages to be the first commercial Back to the Future video game worth the name.Taking place shortly after Back to the Future part 3, in the wake of Doc Brown leaving Hill Valley, the game opens with Marty McFly and his father preparing Doc's possessions for an estate sale. However, when the time-traveling DeLorean returns to 1986, empty save for a cassette recorder, a lady's shoe, and Doc Brown's dog, it's up to you, as Marty, to uncover where and when Doc is, what kind of trouble he's in, and how to rescue him.The games dialogue is pitch-perfect, with Christopher Lloyd reprising his role as Doc Brown, and AJ LoCascio stepping into Martys role with an uncanny interpretation of the character that I could barely distinguish from Michael J. Fox. Telltales writing is spot on, hitting many of the movie series running jokes, while being more than clever in its own right. Whether it's a soup-delivering do-gooder announcing that she has to run food to the asylum because the inmates are just crazy for it, or Doc Brown warning that eating at the soup kitchen will cause permanent damage to Martys digestive system in the same panicked tones he uses to refer to the destruction of time itself, the writing is spot on, and the dialogue is delivered expertly.The games graphics are charming; with a cartoonish bent that pervades the game. The character designs fit their roles in the game, and while the differences in the level of caricature can be momentarily alarming, as the comparison between Marty and Doc Browns proportions took me aback when I first noticed them, the interpretation works better, and the characters have more life and expression to them than a more realistic approach would have. Meanwhile, the music draws its cues from the films, with numerous familiar themes coming back around, and fans of the movies scores will find a lot to recognize and enjoy.The gameplay itself is a relatively simple adventure game. The puzzles are all either dialogue-based or involve using items straight from the inventory with little combination or other elaborate inventory tricks to be found. A robust help system will ease players who can't boggle through the solutions through the game, though the puzzles are straightforward enough that veteran players might not find much to challenge them. Still, the focus is on the story rather than the puzzles, and they manage to succeed brilliantly, especially with a surprisingly tense set of puzzles at the very end.Telltale Games' legions of fans have every reason to fall in love with it, because it's a cross between the developer's trademark point-and-click gameplay and the excellent story of the Back to the Future series. Telltale managed to make me feel eight years old again. It may not be time travel, but it could be the closest you can get without a flux capacitor.			"

												Yet another good adventure game from Telltale Games. Not the same quality as The Walking Dead/Wolf Among Us, but way better than Jurasic Park.If you like the movies, you will probably like this game aswell. It is true to the story and it brings back many of the same feelings that the movies did.It is a very fun game, with plenty of jokes, and it does have pretty good graphics for beeing an Telltale adventure game pre. Walking Dead.The puzzles is easy to figure out, and the QTE's are not hard at all.It took me close to 10 hours to complete it, each of the five episodes took about 2 hours.			"

												GREAT SCOTT! A GREAT MOVIE GAME! Marty, we have got to go back to the past to stop the horrid NES game version of our movie from coming out! Set date to September 1989, to destroy LJN for making horrible movie games! - Doc BrownIf this game was created and substituted for the Back to the Future game on the NES, everyone would be super happy. THIS GAME is awesome, point and click, who gives af? It has great narrating, and the Art style is SWEET. This game is like a Sequel, taking place after the events of the first 3, starting off in 1986, Doc is missing, and Marty has to find him back in 1931! It explores the past of Hill Valley. That's all I will go into, since it is WAY more in depth than that, I recommend this game, STRONGLY if you love or like the BTTF series, and it is very cheap too, and it will go on sale for even cheaper. I give it a 9.5 out of 10 for a final rating, sometimes it is a LITTLE confusing, and somewhat buggy, but otherwise it is solid for a release from 2010, they could do much more with this series now, seeing Telltale's success with The Walking Dead Season 1 and 2, which are very in depth too.  BUY THIS GAME. Thank you for reading my review, this is my first in-depth review.			"

												""Back to the Future"" all-time fan here.This game is as good as the movies: it's split into 2hrs or so long, 5 Episodes.The new story begins at Twin Pines Mall, soon after Doc's sent Einstein into the future and then continues by a logical thread over the following episodes.""Back to the Future: The Game"" is quite a simple point and click adventure but that's its strong point, in my opinion: quests are pretty damn logic, no weird stuff to be done and an easy inventory mechanism (no need to combine items).There's also a very well done in-game hint system which gives you advices and suggestions before actually telling you what to do next, so you won't get spoiled too fast and will have some time to try and figure out the ""problem"" yourself (yeah, I used it a couple of times).Put that together with a solid story line, cute graphics and never boring characters and you get ""Back to the Future Part IV"".

												I can't recommend this game enough. There are a few groups of people for whom this is a no-brainer: adventure game fans and Back to the Future fans. But just about anyone should be able to enjoy the mix of action, humor, and sentiment present in this episodic adventure.This game gave me about the same feeling as the Ghostbusters video game from 2009: it feels like a true sequel to the movies, with enough of the original cast involved, and with strong enough writing, that it fits right in with the films. In fact, in some ways, the adventures here are superior, simply because they're not really restricted by budgets, set design, etc. They can do whatever they want, and they take advantage of that fact.To be fair, there were a few points that I got a bit frustrated with the solutions, because they seemed nonsensical, or it seemed like I had already tried them, but those weren't too frequent at all, and there is a hint system that will dole out more and more obvious clues if you're really stuck. On that note, it's important to backtrack and double check things if you're not sure what to do, as oftentimes events will trigger changes in the environment or characters where you wouldn't expect them.The story itself though, is amazing. The game starts out a bit slow, taking a while to find its groove, but is pretty solid throughout. You'll end up jumping back and forth through time many many times throughout the adventure, and have to fix and refix situations that go from bad to worse. The best episodes are probably three, four, and five.You will probably get about 15-20hrs of gameplay out of the entire series, with the final episode having a pretty hilarious finish that left me with a huge grin on my face, and a teaser that there could yet be more to come. It's been four years since the game came out, so that might be nothing, but still, I could definitely see them drawing out quite a bit more from this deep well of stories. Overall, anyone with a passing interest in the genre or the movies will be well pleased.			"

												A quite moving game!Back to the Future is my favourite science fiction trilogy, and after eagerly traversing all 5 episodes of this game, I must say it makes an inspiring and amusing sequel. Although not much effort was made to fill the environments with many citizens, as it would have been expected for a more realistic recreation of each era, the main characters, including new ones, are remarkably well polished in personality. The original ones were given the same personality and vibrance as in the films, in fact. In addition, Marty McFly feels just the way he's meant to be from the very beginning: a cool-yet-sloppy teenager. And even though he was played by a different voice actor, his voice sounds extremely similar to Michael J Fox's from a few decades ago.The gameplay is quite similar to the Monkey Island series'. Attempting to slash the frustration of getting stuck, we are given a hint system that provides clues on demand without spoiling it immediately. These are entirely optional, so in general, it is a plus. Those who are used to the old sk00l point-and-click adventures may not need this anyway. The UI could have been made slightly better by adjusting the character movement by keyboard, which sometimes did not behave as expected. I also got myself into a strange bug in chapter 5, in which Marty may get into a place he's not expected to go to. Not saying where, but a reload doesn't hurt much here.The story was both fascinating and touching in many parts. As Marty and Doc visit past and present instants of time, they find their own reality suddenly changing, often to the worse. It's like visiting the corrupted Hill Valley from Part 2, except that all alternate timelines are different, and they must figure out new ways to get back in time and save their reality. All this while helping past selves, avoiding running into other past selves, persuading alternative selves and making your opinion become heard on what spices to put on a week-old cabbage soup. Indeed.I had relatively quick game sessions in this game, and now there isn't much reason to replay it. I guess these kind of games must come to an end, unless they make alternate endings like in The Walking Dead. I'm not sure whether I would have liked that in BttF, though. To conclude, I guess I'll go for 7.4/10. I would certainly send a friend back in time. *Back in Time song*			"

It has great puzzles and gameplay and doent seem to bore me. Once again Telltale have made a great game.

												Back to the Future: The Game is a dialogue & story focused adventure game. Unlike other Telltale games I've played & liked (Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us, a bit of Game of Thrones) it strays a bit from their formula. There are no choices whatsoever (not even the illusory ones) - the story is strictly predefined without even the tiniest of detours. The general quality of the game seems to be subpar at best in comparison to their previous titles. The controls are clunky, the graphics lacks detail and overall polish, the UI elements are huge (mobile like) and obtrusive (even after turning off everything the game allowed me to). And unlike other Telltale games, where you don't really need to know the source material - here you do. You should be familiar with the movies, as the game starts sometime after 3rd movie ended, and not only doesn't explain who is who, but also casually showers you with references assuming you remember everything in detail. If I haven't re-watched the movies recently to refresh my memory, I feel like I would have been at a disadvantage.For some weird reason the game is split into 5 separate entries in the Steam library, forcing user to re-apply their settings every time they start a new chapter. No wonder no decisions can't be made here, because nothing carries over to the next chapter, since each has to be started as a separate game. The only thing you decide upon in first chapter - your fake name you introduce yourself in the past, is instantly invalidated in chapter 2, where other game inhabitants insist on calling the protagonist what seems to be a default name from the ch1 list. Also I've noticed the time played is not summed up. Chapter 1 time is displayed as total time (which in my case was around 14 hours total, not 3.3 as shown).The default movement controls require you to left click and drag to move, and on top of that right clicking makes Marty run. Thing is, the right click also skips dialogue, so gods forbid you bump into another character while running like that - you will immediately skip first few lines of dialogue without any option to go back and listen to them. Thankfully you can also move with WSAD and use Shift to run to avoid accidental skip, but the game doesn't tell you that. The environment is so littered with invisible walls that it borders on ridiculous at times & trying to walk can be an exercise in patience. You'd think that in an open area you can cross the road wherever you want - well nope, just in specific nondescript junction points. Rarely you're allowed to just walk up to something in a straight line. Most of the time it feels like being forced into invisible rails.Clickboxes (clickable areas that allow interaction with objects) are inconsistent. Sometimes they are so huge that clicking several cm from an object still triggers an interaction. Sometimes they are so tiny, that even when you know for sure that they should be there somewhere, you still need to comb the screen carefully with your mouse. Sometimes an object had more than one clickbox separated by empty space, and even though you'd think that the 2nd one is for a different object it still triggeres interaction with the thing you already checked. Whenever I found myself stuck, it usually turned out later that I missed one vital object that was either hard to pinpoint or overshadowed by a bigger nearby object with a huge clickbox. This was particularly frustrating when I had to do a lot of back and forth between several locations. The difficulty mainly came from finding all the interactive objects. Once you pinpointed where everything was, it was quite easy from there.After first two chapters I was convinced I will be giving this game thumbs down. Even though I liked the story and character development, I wasn't enjoying it and instead I was just irritated most of the time due to game's several issues and disappointing quality & mechanics. The events past chapter 3 raised the stakes, so I became determined to push though & finish the game to see how it all ends. And even though there were so many time jumps, fixing one thing resulting in messing up another and spawning yet another fubar timeline, that there should have been bajillion paradoxes already (not to mention a silly explanation where did the DeLorean came from in the first place), despite all that I'm glad I've played though it. Mainly because the final chapter was indeed great, and the ending was so adorably self aware of its own plot shortcomings, that it put a wide smile on my face and basically redeemed the rest of the game in my eyes :)If you're planning on playing this game and like me you thought ""I like Telltale games and I like Back to the Future movies, so this game should be no-brainer"" be aware that this might not be the case. The overall quality & design is disappointing compared to other major Telltale titles. The story is really neat with satisfying finale, but one might consider just watching a let's play instead of having to deal with game's clunkiness and irritating issues. Myself I prefer playing instead of watching, and I'm still in good mood after having beaten the game, so my ""on fence"" stance is slightly tipped towards thumbs up :) Buyer beware though :)			"

												As a whole these 5 episodes are a must have for any BTTF fan.  The writing and the voice acting are of professional grade.  The story is stupendous, so good that BTTF The Game could of been the next BTTF movie.  I could do without several of the puzzles but OTOH others were very well staged and fun to solve and were integrated nicely into the story.			"

												Back to the Future: The Game is a point and click adventure game which takes place roughly 6 months following the events of the third movie. In it, you play as Marty McFly, dealing with a variety of puzzles as he attempts to set right the past - largely dealing with the 1930s Prohibition-era Hill Valley.This is a good game, but it feels like it could have been so much more. It was released prior to Telltale's The Walking Dead success, so it largely relies on their older formula of having a large inventory where you collect items, then use those items to solve puzzles, along with having a large number of items which can be interacted with, many of which are extraneous. There's nothing *wrong* with this, but given they were trying to provide a story more on-level with feature films, it ends up feeling like the gameplay is getting in the way of what they were trying to accomplish as opposed to complementing it.Voice acting is excellent, the story was actually better than I expected (except for one or two areas which don't really ""mesh"" with how time travel is supposed to work in this universe). So basically, if you don't mind the way older point and click adventure games tend to play, and if you're not TOO invested in the storyline/mechanics of the BttF universe, it's probably worth a look.

												It took me a little while to really get into the game, mostly because I was a noob  at using this type of controls (I've always been a playstation girl as opossed to a computer gamer), but after the first hour, I was entranced. And the whole series, they all just keep getting better. The dialouge is spectacular and the voice acting is totally spot on, it truly does keep the feeling of the movie. In the early chapters the mini games/puzzles aren't as great as in the later chapters but are still a ton of fun. Now that I've played several adventure, point and click games, I realized that this series is my favourite so far. If I have one complaint it's that the hints are sometimes pretty useless. For each topic/scenario they give you 5 different ones, supposedly getting more clear as you advance, but I found they generally just say the same thing, like I know I need to use the pipe, (you didn't need to give me 4 different clues pertaining to that) but never a hint as to 'how?'.

												Back to the Future: The Game does a reasonable job at creating a story adaptation of the original movies. Like most Telltale Games, this one is polished and offers excellent voice acting. The chapters are roughly 3-4 hours each providing a respectable amount of gameplay. Having played many of the other Telltale games, this series slips in as my least favorite, but that's mostly because it's a similar plot as the original movies, not because the game or story are bad.

												This is an ""old school"" Telltale game, designed before the release of the Walking Dead.  As such, the gameplay is really different.  In the newer Telltale games, you're basically playing a story generator with minimal puzzles to solve.  In Back to the Future, you spend much of your time trying to solve puzzles like an older adventure/point-and-click game.  I would recommend this game, but there are probably people who are fans of the newer Telltale games that wouldn't like it.  If you played (and liked) the Sam and Max games, you'll like this one.			"

												Another example of where Steam needs a neutral button.Short:  I would recommend this game if you love the movies more than tight gameplay or it's on sale.Long:  I haven't played an adventure game like this since the old LucasArts ones.  The story is decently well-crafted thus far and the voice acting and direction is tremendous.  My issues with the game are MOSTLY technical:1) The camera is obnoxious and spastic at times.2) The movement controls curiously keep their memory as you walk despite the 'stage' changing orientation.  For instance, if I travel from a north/south stage to an east/west stage walking 'right' and Marty ROTATES 90 degrees in the transition, I would expect when my frame of reference changes that the 'right' arrow key continues moving Marty to the 'right' of his new orientation.  This isn't the case and you end up with some stages where you are pressing the right arrow key to move 'down and to the left' for instance because of some quizzical initial orientation during the transition.3) Poor continuity in parts.  In the first episode you choose a 'fake name' to give someone back in time.  When I saved and later reloaded my game, the game had forgotten my choice and I was momentarily concerned maybe I had missed something.  Nope.  Thinking 'well that must be the default' I was proven wrong again when the name changed to another option in EP2.  For a game literally all about the 'details' that seems really... lazy?4) Every episode apparently has its own 'game' shell which requires you to change ALL your settings each time you play a new one.Here's where the line between 'technical' and 'design decision' get a bit blurry though:5) The inventory randomly deletes certain items which, fine, I wouldn't need a key to one door later in the game provided I never go back.  However at one point you get a tool and a few minutes later when you are presented with a situation where the tool is a good solution, it is mysteriously missing.  It didn't get removed via story elements, just deleted from the inventory because the 'scene' changes.6) The puzzle solutions are not robust.  Whittling down the gameplay, you must select the right choices in the right order.  Dialogue options do not 'matter' in the sense that saying 'smart' things (maybe offering some dialogue that's generic and some that, if you were paying attention earlier in the game, would give you an advantage) makes no difference.  It's somewhat disappointing that there does not appear to be more than one way to solve any puzzle, just in some cases you can solve a few concurrent puzzles in a different order to the same outcome.Here's where it's mostly a minor gripe with the story, though:7) The game (thus far) obviously plays homage to the original trilogy, however it almost entirely avoids it.  It would have been nice to at least have had better 'woven' timeline.Overall, it's a game worth the sale price if you are an afficionado and I don't regret picking it up for ~$6 even if I struggle to f inish with some of the technical oddities.  I would not recommend it for full price, however.			"

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 19Back to the Future - The GamePurchase Date: 9/15/2014Normally I don't really play adventure games, but I've always heard good things about Telltale games.  So when I saw this on sale in the Humble Store I decided to go ahead and pick it up.   At first the art style threw me off a little, but I was quickly sold on the colorful, cartoony art.  I was also concerned about the voice acting, but that proved to be not an issue at all, as Telltale got Christopher Lloyd to once again voice Doc Brown.  And although Michael J. Fox isn't voicing Marty, the actor still does a good job.  It was also nice to hear familiar music.Going in, I was concerned this would end up not feeling authentic.  But between the acting, the sound, and the art, the game does a good job of making you feel like this is another Back to the Future adventure.  I didn't find myself being distracted by anything that felt wrong.The gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from a point and click adventure.  I didn't see any Quick Time Events in the hour I played, so really the gameplay is focused more on solving puzzles.  I found the challenge to be pretty easy overall, but the game has a built in hint system to provide help if you get stuck.  It gives a set of 4 hints, starting with a vague suggestion, and the final hint telling you exactly what to do.  So it doesn't really seem like it's possible to get stuck in this game.  I could see where those looking for more of a challenge might be disappointed here, but really these types of games are all about the story.Speaking of the story, I don't really want to spoil any of it, but I will say that it has everything you'd expect from a Back to the Future game.   I enjoyed the beginning of the story and how it sets up the initial time travel.  I liked the time period the game chose.  It's one that the movies didn't visit, but the choice makes a lot of sense.  I only got part way through the first episode before my hour was up, but I liked where the story was going.Overall I think Telltale has done a good job here.  I admit I had some trepidation when I first started playing this.   With a game like this that's based on an existing property, it's pretty natural to have some set expectations going in.  But my fears were unfounded, as Telltale hasn't given me anything to be disappointed with.  This is definitely worth picking up if you like adventure games, or even if you aren't much of an adventure gamer but still liked Back to the Future.			"

Disclaimer: Due to how the game was uploaded to Steam, only the play time of the first episode is displayed.Short version: 81%Back to the Future is an enjoyable point ‘n’ click, featuring a great adventure and an astonishing cast, but it couldn’t deny it was a TellTale game even if it wanted to: all of the studio’s old trademark design elements are there in abundance.Long version:Before TellTale switched to creating interactive cinematic miniseries, they were largely known for their classic style point ‘n’ click adventure games. Back to the Future: The Game was one of the last ones that used this format.In a sense, this was a match made in heaven, since the movie trilogy itself was one of the last large-budget adventures on the big screen. It was a large task to try and match it, but for the most part, the creators did a good job.The story begins not so long after the movies, when Marty finds Doc’s distress signal sent from 1931. This sets off a chain of events that involve a run-in with another troublemaking Tannen, and a woman who accidentally becomes young Doc’s girlfriend, leading him on a path that results in Hill Valley turning into a police state. And the episodes themselves have even more twists and cliffhangers, keeping up your interest.On the other hand, it needs these tricks to keep you in the game, because like all old TellTale titles, it is very slow, and most of the events take place at one location (in this case, the town square). The studio’s formula is also present in full force: all episodes have the same structures and similar solutions to similar problems, always including a multi-choice puzzle where you need to run back and forth until you stumble upon the right combination.The dialogues were always TellTale’s strong point, and Back to the Future is no exception. The entire series is a love letter to the movie trilogy, and the return of Christopher Lloyd (and Michael J. Fox for a few lines at the last episode) really helped to make you feel that this is as close as we can get to a fourth film without an actual fourth film.			"

Posted: November 5, 2016
												This is a review for the entire season of Back to the Future:  The Game, not just for the first of the series.  I would only recommend this series as a complete season (As there's cliffhangers at the end of every episode, so that's the best way to review the games.)I'm recommending the game for the following reasons.  It's Back to the Future (And a sequel) if you haven't seen Back to the Future, you should because it's amazing.  If you don't like Back to the Future for some reason, then you probably won't like this game.  It's also a Telltale point and click game, and I don't believe they can really make a bad game as long as they tell a good story, and this is a good story. It's a good game, if anyone other than Telltale made this game, it would just get a glowing review.  But Telltale has a history in this space so there's both good and bad. The first big thing to note is voice actors.   Christopher Lloyd is back!  That's huge and the voice is spot on.   Every scene with him you feel like this is really Emmett Brown and that works wonders!   The down side, Michael J. Fox isn't back as Marty.  That's not as big a negative, but Marty always sounds like he's someone doing a Michael J. Fox impersonation.  He's not awful, but often times he doesn't sound just right.   Granted there's a lot of dialogue, and only about ten percent of it is bad, but still noticeable in my opinion.   Not a huge negative though.   To me the real negative is the locations in the game, or lack of them.  While there's a lot of variety of the locations, the player really only deals with two time periods.  Over 15 hours of game play, you're going to see a lot of the same areas even though they're going through minor changes.  This isn't a huge deal breaker, but by the fourth or fifth story I went ""Really?""  I wanted to see something different, and mind you there's nothing amazing here.  There's a few interesting versions of the locations but I want to see the future! I mean 2015 in Back to the Future's timeline is fun, let's go to the better version of ""now"".The story is a mixed bag, while it’s usually pretty good, there’s a few points where I went “Really?”  at least four episodes of the series is really good, but the reuse of locations wears on the player.  It isn’t a huge turnoff either, but the series goes on a long time on a specific topic, when they could have had two mini arcs. The puzzles are the one thing I will say is a “huge negative”.  There’s three problems with the puzzles.  First they’re too easy.   Often times it’s as simple as listen to some text, and then go grab an item that’s in plain view.   The second is that the game is extremely linear.  Often times you have to do X Y and Z in order.  If you want to try to do Z too bad, you can’t because something has to happen before it happens.  The game gives you a flat goal that’s clear on what it expects you to do next, but it’s a story progression most of the time. Finally the game has a hint system, and unlike the Sam and Max games.  So that’s both good and bad, but unlike sam and max, there’s not a huge need for the hint system and no penalty to using it. With all those negatives, is it a bad game?  Well it depends what you want.  If you want a deep Point and Click game, this isn’t it.   If you want a story based game though, this is perfect.  There’s no Pixel Hunting, there’s no very hard puzzles, and there’s a hint system that makes it exceedingly easy.   Still it’s a rather fun game, and I enjoyed the experience, so it’s an easy recommendation. "

												Define irony...Buying the first episode only to later find that you can get it for free simply by going to the tell tale website and downloading it direct.Define irony...Living in 2016 and playing a game off a franchise which envisioned 2015 way cooler than what it really ever was.Define irony...Playing a game about characters who worry that their actions will disrupt the space time continuum, only to find by accident mid game, that there is a glitch where if you instead of walking past cueball (the  barman) stop and talk to him about everything and then walk around the corner and prop up the door. Your characters will really forever be stuck in 1931 as the game will not be able to register you hitting a red pipe to open up a secret door as 'you never saw the secret door in the first place'. The whole game time continuum collapses and your stuck forever in 1931. The only way out is restart and dont talk to cueball until he shows you secret passage.I'm personally a huge fan of the franchise and like me if you are old enough to have seen back to the future at the cinema you would have been deeply sorrowed when you heard that the entertaining rumours of a back to the future 4 aka back to the future rides again was canned largely because the main actor Michael J Fox had been diagnosed with a debilitating illness known as Parkinsons. With that in mind according to credits it seems that a charity dealing directly with parkinsons benefits from the sales of this game, So with that in mind, how could you ever give this a thumbs down?The game is a point and click adventure which unlike tell tales other franchises like the 'walking dead', which adds a layer of illusion that your choice matters, here it simply doesn't matter. Instead you just solve puzzles by playing around with things you picked up and placing them at the right place at the right time.The game continues on 6 months after back to the future 3. The delorean lands back at doc brown residence unmanned with the exception of 'Einstein' doc's dog. (How the delorean survived is explained in one of doc brown's many speech bubbles in game). Marty when he opens up the delorean finds out that the automatic retreival system kicked itself in and that Doc must have got himself into some type of trouble. The only problem is the date system display isnt working properly and Marty has no idea where doc went. The only clue is a womans shoe on the floor of the delorean. From that Marty MUST find out where doc went to and save him.Because the game storyboard is written by back to the futures original script writer Bob Gale and the voice acting and appearances are from many of the original crew including Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox the game plays true and is a fitting tribute to the fluxing back to the future fellow time travellers. There are literally hundreds of easter eggs planted just in the first episode alone which many will miss without a keen eye and a trigger happy screen shot shooter. Also there are MANY speech bubbles with dialogue gems that a impatient person might miss. Take for instance when Tannen is getting his shoes shined. Instead of accepting shining his shoes, decline doing so and then walk up to him again and repeat. His speech changes MANY, MANY TIMES. My personal favorite is, ""tell Ma she will get her cut next week!""The best thing for me is the musical score. I just cant get enough of the music. Amazingly it is even more fitting for a game than it is for a movie. It has the magic of turning a humdrum objective into a 'yeah that's right man I just saved the human race' and on the flip side the other music which has the feel' whoops did i just wipe someone out of existence? My bad!' If god created this world then we have all been jipped. He should have made it so back to the future music follows us everywhere with everything we do. Life would just seem so much more meaningful.Finishes review with a posted GREAT SCOTT thumbs up!Cue back to the future music that makes it feel like i've corrected the whole space time continuum.

												The first thing I noticed is how dated this game is. It is a 6 years old game already so I didn't expect it to be state of the art but it looks and plays like something from the 90's. Then again, it is based on a franchise that started on the 80's so it's oddly appropriate. Plus this game does not just repeat the story of the movies but adds an entirely new adventure which makes it rather intriguing.The game runs without a problem in my below average windows 10 pc and I didn't encounter any glitches or crashes.The animation isn't that impressive and neither is the voice acting. I'd say it's the less refined telltale game I've played so far but it's still somewhat ok even though the animated characters sort of slip to the uncanny valley at times. The controls and especially walking around could use an improvement though now it's too late for suggestions to the developers I guess. I still wish navigating the map would be less awkward.The story however is pretty interesting and fits the movies. The over the top personality of the characters, the god-awful clothes, the DeLorean, all bring back nostalgic memories from the movies.The movies themselves weren't technically masterpieces themselves either. It was the concept and the characters that I liked back then and the movies that didn't seem to take themselves too seriously and weren't even apologetic for focusing less on science and more on fiction. On that regard this game could be considered a spiritual successor to the films. It's not polished, not well thought of and reeks of cult which makes it fit to the franchise.It is a risk creating content for or trying to add to an old franchise when people have already immortalized it and worship it. I'd say this game compliments more the back to the future movies than star wars episodes 1-3 compliment episodes 4-6 and considering it is not written by the same person I find the effort pretty good.So If you've never watched the Back To The Future movies I'm not sure if you will enjoy or even understand this game but for an old fan it's like looking at childhood pictures. Or, more accurately, like learning what happened to old classmates after graduation. With all its flaws I still recommend this game mainly because it picks up the story from where the movies left it and takes the DeLorean out for a few more spins. I did not get the ""this should never have been made"" or the ""they destroyed the franchise"" feeling while playing the game. No, it is not great. It does feel part of the franchise though. Part of the classics. I don't know if they made the gameplay dated for even when the game came out intentionally or not but it somehow felt appropriate. And as a stand alone point and click game I would probably just pass it by but this game is what it is and the story redeems it a lot in my eyes which is why I end up recommending it.There's a lot of exposition and character building if you get into dialogues which is sort of the point of these type of games. The objectives are clear for the most part but I actually got stuck a few times which made hints come in handy. Most of the time hints are useless because it really is better to just figure out how to progress on your own but it's still nice that they're there.What you usually see in telltale games is little reminders that a character will remember something and it will matter later on in the story. A cheap illusion of choice making you believe that every player gets a unique highly personalized experience. Here the story is as linear as it gets and very few responces actually matter and give you a slightly personalized experience. I don't feel strongly about it either way seeing how in every one of their games you get the same ending regardless of how you play. Here you just go around, solve puzzles and party like it's 1931! It's more or less a conventional point and click game and a conventional video game based on a popular movie franchise. But since it adds a bunch of new content to the old space travelling mythos many know and love I say go for it. I am wary of people unfamiliar to the movies so if you're reading this and you've never watched the films, don't intend to watch them but still want to buy this game I'm not sure what advice to give other than this: Watch the movies and then based on how much you liked them you decide whether you want to play the game or not. To me this game earns the right to be considered a sequel to the films and this is how it should primarily be viewed as. It is ok as a standalone experience but it really can't be enjoyed properly and judged fairly out of context.This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												Back to the Future: The Game is quite possibly the best movie-based game ever made. If you are at all a fan of the films, you will definitely enjoy this title.The story picks up after Part III, where Doc Brown has disappeared, and when his DeLorean appears out of nowhere, you must take control of Marty McFly and travel through time to find Doc and prevent the destruction of the space-time continuum. As the story really is this game’s main selling point, I won’t spoil it for you – find out what happens as you play through. At one point Bob Gale, the producer for the films, stated that the game’s story can be essentially considered Back to the Future Part IV.The gameplay is highly reminiscent of the old LucasArts SCUMM adventure games such as The Secret of Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion, with the only major difference being that you control Marty directly with the WASD keys and not by clicking where you want him to go. To progress, you interact with characters to learn new information, and pick up and use items in appropriate places to complete goals. Those goals are visible in your inventory, and if you get stuck, you can ask for up to 3 optional hints (depending on the puzzle you are on). The game is divided into 5 episodes, and each one is a separate game that must be downloaded individually. This is fine, but just a heads-up - your play records won’t be combined.You can save at any time you’d like – IF YOU AREN’T DOING A PUZZLE. If you are in an action sequence of any sort, or doing a multi-step puzzle, you cannot save until it has been completed. This is a slight flaw in that it sometimes forces you to play for extended periods of time if you don’t want to scrap what you’ve been working on.Each episode will take you 2 to 4 hours to complete, and the game in total will clock in at around 15 hours. It’s a very fun adventure and a surprisingly thoughtful story. The difficulty level isn’t too high, and you won’t be forced to go to the Internet for a walkthrough more than 2 or 3 times if you’re familiar with point-and-click games and have good lateral thinking skills. Unfortunately, the replay value here is very low, simply due to the type of game Back to the Future is. Once you’ve completed the game, there really isn’t a point to going back and playing through it a second time, because it will just be the same story over again. But for a single play-through, it’s a lot of fun.In conclusion, I would highly recommend Back to the Future: The Game to anyone who is a fan of the films (or the LucasArts games) and is looking for another story featuring the characters they know and love. It’s a true BTTF adventure from start to finish =) "

												It's not a common issue for games to sincerely laugh because of game's humor, nor it is a common issue to make a very good game on existing intellectual property that is loved for thirty years. Yet Telltale accomplished the mission. Not being a fan of quests, but being a fan of ""Back to the Future"" it was an honor for me to buy this game. I was very satisfied with the very first minutes of the game where each detail was put with love and care to the original movie trilogy. Yet story repeats itself in many ways, and having watched the movie dozen times you'll hear dialogs, that would never be original in a movie (if part 4 would ever be filmed), but for a game it seems like a miracle. Music, sound effects, voices of actors and finally the time of gangsters will make smile anyone who likes original three movies. Yes, some story lines leave questions, one can say that the game is not perfect. BUT! It seams, that Telltale made the final appearances of the actors that we love so much and whom we'll never see in a big blockbuster movie. For me, it seams that it is a goodbye to Marty and Doc. I'm gonna miss you guys			"

												If you're playing this after some of the newer TellTale masterpieces you will probably be disappointed. You can tell they were still experimenting with a lot of things while making this. The game feels less intuitive, the character development is not as good, the story is not as captivating(to me) and the art style is not as developed. Even as a fan of the movies I find this a bit hard to get in to.I'm not saying its a bad game for what it is, but keep the things I've said in mind as far as expectations, if you've played TWD or The Wolf Among us before considering getting this.

A Screenshot of Back to the Future: Ep 5 - OUTATIME
By: Gao Li




Back in the Hill Valley of 1986, six months after the third movie, Doc has been missing for quite some time and the bank decides to foreclose his home and belongings. While Marty McFly rummages through Doc’s stuff, the DeLorean appears in front of the house with Einstein, Doc’s pet sheepdog, in it. A tape recorder inside the car explains that the time machine’s automatic retrieval system travels back to a certain time to call for Marty’s help, should the Doc ever end up in any kind of distress. Marty then sets out to find out to what time his friend travelled to and how to save him.Back to the Future: The Game is one of those productions where the people behind it went all out; they knew what the fans loved about the original and tried their best to allow fans to relive the adventure and excitement. And given the studio, you know the game will have a strong narrative. It is an episodic point & click adventure from the time before Telltale Games, the developer and publisher, made episodic graphic adventures. What’s more: Back to the Future: The Game serves as an official fourth instalment to the series and the developers even received help from the original cast in its production. For example, Bob Gale, co-writer and co-producer of the original Back to the Future film trilogy, helped in creating the script, Christopher Lloyd reprises his role as Doctor “Doc” Emmett Brown Ph.D., Michael J. Fox makes two cameo appearances – once as future Marty McFly and once as his great-grandfather William McFly – and finally, since an update from October 2015, Tom Wilson once again plays the role as Biff Tannen, who was previously voiced by Kid Beyond in this game.GameplayI played BttF:TG on the trusty 32-bit Windows Vista toaster with an Intel Core 2 CPU, 3070MB RAM, and a GeForce 9500 GT graphics card. As with other point & click adventures, there aren’t a lot of gameplay mechanics to talk about in this one, however, Marty McFly can be controlled either with the classical mouse, the keyboard, or a gamepad. So, pick your method and explore Hill Valley to your heart’s content.


This little doggy is my favorite character in the game 
A Screenshot of Back to the Future: Ep 3 - Citizen Brown
By: Gao Li




Each episode will take players around two hours to get through, resulting in around 10 hours of gameplay. Generally, the puzzle can be quite hard for novices and are definitely more aimed at people familiar with point & click style puzzle solving. Genre veterans, on the other hand, might occasionally feel that a number of riddles are too easy, especially given that there is a hint system. On a personal matter, one aspect I always find sad about the Telltale games is that they got rid of inventory puzzles that require players to combine items with one another. One more little subtraction is for how few puzzles there were in the latter part of the adventure. Despite that, none of this deterred me from enjoying this experience.Back to the Future: The Game proves to be an eminently enjoyable game that, unlike many other adaptations, sequels, or reboots, provides decent content instead of leaching off of fans’ nostalgia. As it was co-written by Bob Gale, an Academy Award nominated, Hollywood screenwriter, the plot of the game is well thought out and, for the most part, manages to walk the fine line between good movie and good video game. That is until the climax. While the overwhelming majority of the BttF:TG is loads of fun, the story’s high point exchanges puzzles for filmlike segments that are great visually, but not fun to play. Instead, it leaves players slightly disappointed, because the road leading towards it did so very well.What surprised me about the game is that the writing had a much heavier focus on the effects of time travel on individuals. Even though Marty and Doc only travel back and forth between 1931 and 1986, changes in the past drastically altered how the personalities of the Hill Valley residents in the “present” developed. In defiance of this being logical, it did become rather unsettling at some point and I applaud the writers and actors for conveying that feeling of unease. The other intriguing aspect was that the story focused far more on Doc Brown’s history, wherein the movies centered mostly around Marty and his family.


I really like this shot

By: Gao Li




ConclusionBefore you consider buying this one, remember that it takes place after the movie trilogy, so watching all three films beforehand comes highly recommended, despite that not being necessary to understand the plot. Visual novel enthusiasts might find the puzzles a bit too hard, while point & click fans will feel that they have … hills and valleys … and are typically easier than the ol’ Lucas Arts brain twisters. With all that in mind, Back to the Future fans will have a great time. The story is good, the voice acting great, the visuals stunning, and fans of the series are most definitely going to play through this more than once, I know have.			"

												Back to the Future: The Game is the Back to the Future Part IV we never got. The story is pretty much what you'd expect from a BTTF film: the Doc got himself trapped in the past, and it's up to Marty to rescue him. Sure, some might say that's a rehash of the third film, but it's much, much more than that, as the story quickly takes some interesting twists, and Marty must make sure he's able to return to the Hill Valley he remembers.The game features great voicework thanks to Christopher Lloyd returning as Doc, and A.J. Locascio doing a fantastic work as Marty, due to Michael J. Fox being unable to perform. Even then, Michael J. Fox has a nice cameo in the final chapter, and it's great to have the original time travellers in the same place again.As far as the gameplay goes, it's a somewhat simple point-and-click adventure. It's not as complex as Telltale's later games, like The Walking Dead, as this game isn't heavily focused on choice; and, to be honest, it's good that it doesn't, considering the nature of the story, you don't want to add branching storylines on top of messing up the timestream. Even then, it's good some nice puzzles, some which may have you scratching your head if you're not used to playing games in this genre. However, the game is good enough to provide hints in case you become stuck. Still, I'd place a greater emphasis on the story when recommending this game, as I consider that to be the best part of it.About the story, while some people might have found it a bit confusing (and I don't blame them, that always happens when time travel is involved), I must say I really enjoyed it. It really feels like BTTF4, and I guess that's only natural, considering that Bob Gale (who wrote the films) contributed in the writing of this game.Well, I don't know what more to say. If you're a big fan of BTTF (like me) then go ahead and try out this game, it's great!			"

												It’s really nice to still see point and click adventures holding their own in today's market, I think overall it is a genre that is sorely under appreciated. However, this is primarily due to the fact that the overwhelming majority of modern game developers seem to completely miss the mark when it comes to compelling narrative and an art style which complements the game.Back to the Future is a fun little dive back in time to the good ‘ol days of point and click adventure but with a very pleasing 3D skin overtop. As much as I've enjoyed my time with this game so far, I wish I could say it was a must buy throwback to the days of old, but I can’t.I don’t think there is any one aspect of this game that is detrimentally flawed but when I step away from the game after a play session I find that had it not been based upon a movie franchise I loved as a child, nothing about this game would stand on its own and draw me in. That’s not to say I don’t think it’s good - I love this game - but my recommendation must be taken with a grain of salt because unless you were/are a fan of the Back To The Future franchise, I don’t think there is that much here for someone just looking for a great Point & Click.

												""Back To The Future: The Game"" is a ""point and click"" adventure from TellTale Games, coming from the famous ""Back To The Future"" movie trilogy franchise. The game is composed of a total of 5 episodes, each of them smartly connected between each other (like a TV mini-serie).As a fan of Back To The Future, I think TellTale did a really amazing job to be authentic to the movies. From a graphic standpoint, however, it looks different to the movie but it has that usual charm you can encounter in TellTale games that still make it classy enough to not complain about it.From a gameplay perspective, you have to manage mouse control and keyboard for moving, which is bothersome to me, but it is still OK to manage. I am not a big fan of inventory that are not available right away in front of your eyes, which sadly this game have. I believe the inventory system a little annoying in the game.Story wise, it is very likable and rather similar to the movie structure, which is great. Actually I tend to even prefer what TellTale did with Dr. Emmett Brown than on the movie, he looks more human and not only kind of like the crazy scientist he was on the movies... Also, Marty McFly is definitely a great hero to play with and he is super awesome in the game. I like the introduction of new characters like Edna Strickland, Trixie Trotter and another family member of the McFly with Arthur...I am not a big fan of the chase sequence at the end of most the episodes, it is certainly reminescent of the movie endings but it lacks any fun gameplay in my opinion. I adore however some sequences such as in Episode 1 in Emmett's Lab, this was thought very smartly.I definitely felt in love with this game, despite it not being perfect, it has some kind of funny and yet enjoyable adventure that I was expecting to have with Back To The Future for a long long time ago.

												Back to the Future: The Game has its moments... I'm a Telltale fan, I've loved the Walking Dead, I enjoyed Wallace and Gromit, but sadly this didn't work for me. All 5 chapters together make for a fairly long story, it's interesting, but theres also a lot of walking around and not a lot of doing for a large part of the game. As a puzzler point and click title I feel like I should be solving puzzles, but a lot of the time I felt as though I was running errands and just going back and forth between them, rather than reaching an end goal?My advice, if your a huge fan of the films, you will find time for this, if you want to play something similar but gets you a bang for your buck - Walking Dead. No two ways about it. Also as a short point - voice acting is insanely good for this, but the characters are horrendously unlikeable. I know thats what they're going for, but I just found them grating on me more than they should. Anywhere between £5 -> £12 would be appropriate to me. Full price is a bit steep in my opinion.NotesNo Steam Achievements, No Trading Cards, Controller Support - but only fully integrated in later episodes.			"

												Telltales Games, you have done an outstanding job of bringing back some old and hyper appreciative feelings of one of my favorite sci-fi comedies. Ever since I saw the movies on TV, I have always loved seeing the DeLorean, especially when Doc turned it into a stylish time machine. And it's great to be hearing those sounds, the lights and the effect of time travel in this additional storyline. Which happens to follow up the original films. The puzzles are mind boggling as I had a tough time deciphering many of them! If you want to test your meddle with Telltale's amazing work of Back to the Future: The Game, you are in for a ride. Hearing some of the old cast from the movies was so great! It was especially a surprise when I heard/saw that Michael J. Fox, the original Marty guest star on one of the episodes of Telltales' Back to The Future game!I got this on the Holiday sale so it was worth the $6.24 pricing! OR if you feel like supporting Telltale Games at it's full price, what are you waiting for pal?!			"

												Oh dear... I really like the Back To The Future trilogy and this game certainly feels like a part of the franchise, but while the voice acting and presentation is great, the game itself isn't.The presentation of the game is really great. Animation and design of the characters feel like a well done 3D cartoon version of the original cast. The voice actor for Marty is very close to Micheal J. Fox and you won't feel a difference most of the time.The story starts out interesting and the first two episodes get you hooked to the setting. Sadly this stops working during the third episode where events just become a bit too convoluted and the story grinds to a repetitive halt. I can see what they were going for and while the idea isn't terrible, it's not executed very well in this game.So far I would recommend the game as a whole, but sadly the most important aspect of a game is the one that doesn't work here at all: game play. There's a good amount of inventory and dialogue based puzzles in here and théy aren't too bad, but sometimes feel like a lot of busy work and/or guessing. The main problem with the game play are the sequences in which you have to do certain things in the right order to get past it. There are too many of those scenes and they are not fun to play at all. Most of the time you'll end up just trying everything until something finally works, but it never feels satisfying to find the right solution.Overall it's a close call and I certainly would rather give it a neutral rating if Steam had that option. It's not a bad game and if you like the story it might be well worth your time. For me it was just slightly not entertaining enough, so I'll give a thumbs down. By all means pick it up on sale and try it for yourself :)			"

												This game perfectly captures the feeling of the original stories of the movies, especially the orchestral music background helps bringing back the nostalgia and cinematic atmossphere. The gameplay / riddles were okay, nothing too special and sometimes I just used the in-built hint functionality after trying out some things to get a solution I would never have found on my own.. Story-whise the game is confronting the player with multiple timelines when changing the past throughout the game (in a linear way admittadly). Without wanting to spoil to much: There are some interessting ideas how Hill Valley and the known characters develop under certain circumstances and many little situations or objects you may or may not remember from the movies.The graphics are okay for a 2010 game I would say, of course not up to todays standards as it even was 2010 not the graphically advanced game (its more of a cartoonish style and had just a p&c game budget after all).What annoyed me the most is:The controls and camera views.. They're utterly bad in my opinion, and even after getting into it a bit they still felt clunky and frustrating.I had a hard time getting hooked on the game. I played Episode 1 and 2 and then dropped the game for half a year. Then I continued with Episode 3 which finally gave the story a bit of a motivation kick, where you want to know more.Other then that I would have liked a bit more depth and more interessting riddle mechanics (maybe a mini game every now or then). Regarding the depth I mean: Often they missed out on interessting reaction when trying out an item with an other object or person, for example (little spoiler:) when using the picture of Marti's dad with his Martis grandfather as a young person.Every of the five episodes lasts for about 3 hours which is a good amount for an adventure game I think.All in all, pretty solid p&c click adventure. I can only recommend this game, if you both like and watched the back to the future movies AND like point & click adventures. Plus you should get it on sale if possible. Otherwhise look up gameplay or sth if you don't want to risk it.~~~Basic rundown of the episodes (spoiler alert):Episode 1 was more of an introduction into the game mechanics (tutorial so to say) and basic setting of the plotEpisode 2 was a first real plot start introducing most main charactersEpisode 3 had a plot twist in an alternate reality from the one Marti knowsEpisode 4 was the escape of that reality and trying to find a way to get back to normalEpisode 5 Final end, you'll see :)			"

												Telltale never disappoints. I have yet to play a Telltale title I don't just dislike, but am not amazed by. What a fantastic and mindblowing game! Some parts left me extremely confused, especially the ending, but the story got me really hooked and I still want more. Time for a sequel, Telltale! And make it with choices this time! I had also never watched the movie before (yeah, I know), so this motivated me to do it and I must say it remained loyal to the story, with a few minor differences here and there.			"

												Recommended for any fan of the films. Telltale has one a great job of preserving the feel of the films whle adding their own artistic twist. The game is a lot of fun, and feels like canon! But, yes, this is a typical TT title, and as such, it is quite easy for an adventure game, but I don't think that that's a bad thing.			"

												Fun game. Glad I played it. Puzzles can be a bit confusing even with clues and story sometimes felt a bit tedious. Otherwise a fun game that you can just sit back on your couch and relax while playing.			"

												It’s from Telltale, so it’s most likely gonna be good. The game is divided into 5 episodes and each goes for about 2 hours. It’s also a point and click.  You can’t combine an inventory item with another inventory item but it’s still quite difficult. I thought it was really nice of the developers to include a hint system, but I’d only recommend using it when you have absolutely no clue so you don’t ruin the experience.The story goes along pretty good and makes sense, which is probably because the team got a writer that worked on the trilogy.  A really fantastic game that uses its movie predecessors as a foundation, but still adds stuff. Christopher Lloyd also voices Doc, which is great. Although, from what I’ve seen, this is not exactly the best telltale game.Note: you can actually enjoy almost all of the game without watching all the movies. True, I didn’t ‘get’ a few references, but I still found the game to be really entertaining. "

												We re-watched all three movies before playing this, and I gotta say that overall the game does a great job of capturing the magic of the movies.  Graphics aren't the best, but they suit the art style.  Animations can be a little rough.  Voice acting on the other hand is fantastic.  They got Christopher Lloyd from the movies to voice the Doc.  They weren't able to get Michael J. Fox, but the voice they got is so good, that he does a more convincing young Marty McFly than the original actor could.  Michael J. Fox does make a cameo in the final episode though.I was a little disappointed that there weren't more locations and eras visited, but considering that this is really one big story carved up into five episodes, it makes sense.  There are a few dull spots, but by episode 3, they kick it up a notch and it keeps you playing.  The series ends well, but I think more episodes will be coming.  Well worth playing for BTTF fans.

												I wasn't a big fan of the movie but there's something endearing about this game. Even though the first two episodes start off a bit slow you grow to love the characters and their interactions with each other. There were some tough puzzles and once or twice I needed to utilize the hint system to figure them out but nothing brain scratching or exceptionally challenging. What would have been nice is if there were slightly different branching to the story, like in The Walking Dead. None of your actions carry to the other episodes and when you think you can do something different or get a different reaction with your choice the game just forces you to choose the ""correct one"".  Excellent that they could bring some of the voice actors from the movie. Even the new guy doing Marty was good. But overall this was a cool adventure that I enjoyed until the end and left me eager for more if they ever decide to make a sequel.			"

Theres a lot done right in this game and a lot you will see in more recent titles like The Walking Dead from TellTale. My advice check it out i think you will enjoy this five episodic adventure.			"

This game makes it easy for me not to get frustrated with the hints and timeless essence of it. This game has little playthrough value, but is great if your bored and you want to play it with some friends or family! Especially the last episode.I recomend getting it on sale worth at least ten bucks.			"

You're late! Do you have no concept of time? Twenty years! Twenty years we'd waited to find out what happened to Marty after events in final instalment of the Back to the Future Trilogy.And then, finally, Tell Tale stepped into the breach to satisfy our craving with their 5 part episodic adventure,  Back to the Future:  The Game.But was it worth the wait or should the franchise have remained a fond memory, unsullied by this digital resurrection?I saw it on a re-runWhen you fire up episode one, the aptly titled ""It's About Time"" , You'll find yourself (Marty) standing in the familiar Twin Pines Mall Parking Lot with Doc and Einstein.The Delorean is hooked up to a remote control, It's nearly 1:21 AM, October 26th 1985 and Einstein is about to become the worlds first time traveller. The recreation of this scene from the first movie does an excellent job of sucking your right into the Back to the Future universe. You'll find yourself quoting the lines from the movie, comfortable that you've been here before and you know what is coming next...Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a Delorean? It's here that the story throws its first curveball. Things don't pan out the way you expected, and its at this point that you know it's not just the nostalgia that's keeping that big grin on your face. This isn't just a trip down memory lane, This is Back to the future 4!Whatever you've got to tell me, I'll find out through the natural course of time. The ""Present Day"" Time line in the game takes place in 1986, a few months after the end of the final movie in the trilogy, although it won't be long before the game has you heading back in time to help Doc out.Let me say now that, for the most part, the story in this game is excellent. It may get a little silly towards the end, but then you'll be so invested that it just won't matter!In the spirit of avoiding spoilers, I'm not going to cover any of the story in this review, but I will say that if you enjoyed the movies, you will enjoy the twisted, rollercoaster of a narrative that awaits you here. I didn't have time to build it to scale or paint it. So we know we know there's a cracking story waiting for you here, but how does it look?It looks just fine. Released at the end of 2010, the graphics show their age a little, but they're perfectly serviceable.The characters we know and love are all instantly recognisable and their facial expressions are spot on.  As I said, it looks just fine. Ronald Reagan? The actor? The voice acting here is of the highest quality. Christopher Lloyd reprises his role as Dr Emmett Brown and whilst Michael J Fox doesn't provide the voice for Marty McFly in the game, A.J. Locascio, the actor who fills his vocal shoes, does an outstanding job of sounding every bit the Marty McFly we know from the movies.The superb Michael J Fox, does make a cameo appearance later in the game, providing voices for past and future McFlys.The musical score is also true to the movies, I defy any Back to The future  fan not to be swept up in the atmosphere of the game when the theme start playing.Maybe you were adopted. So this is a Tell Tale game, should we expect a quick time event extravaganza like the disappointing  Jurassic ?Thankfully No. Back to the future s game play is a pleasing mix of puzzles , searching for items and picking your way through the snappily written and often funny dialogue options.If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anythingThe writing is witty, the atmosphere is spot on and the continuation of the story is worth the price tag alone. If you're a fan of the franchise, then you owe it to yourself to play this game. If you haven't seen the movies (shame on you) then you should go and watch them first, go on... ""make like a tree and get out of here!""Whilst some chapters play out better than others and the ending is a little ""silly"" I still have no hesitation in recommending Back To The Future: The Game.( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ )			"

												If you like Back to the Future, you will love this game. If you don't like Back to the Future... well then you are probably a bad person, with a shriveled, blackened iguana turd where your heart should be. The guy doing Marty's voice is so perfect, I keep forgetting it's not actually Michael J Fox. Christoper Lloyd is playing Doc, so the voice acting is about as perfect as you could ever hope for. The puzzles are clever and organic, the art style works quite well, and there are so many great little jokes and running references continued from the movies. The Weird Science movie poster on Marty's bedroom wall is great, as is the continued gag of the various aliases Doc and Marty pick. (or let you pick)			"

												Back to the Future: The Game is a humorous (move&)point&click adventure game in which you take control of Marty McFly, who has to go back in time to save Doc from early demise. In so doing the timestream pretty much gets wrecked up and Marty has to fix things in several places (and times) to restore the original timeline. Actually, if it wasn't obvious: the game makes so many references to the Back to the Future movies that I'd pretty much make it a prerequisite to have watched them to appreciate all the details and humour.It has been separated into 5 parts, all of which take some 2-4 hours of play depending on your urge to explore and how swift you're at completing puzzles (I reckon there are no truly difficult ones anyway). Gameplay is at times weak, for the camera moves and changes directions often, which results in the movement requiring some time to get used to. There are sound glitches in some places and fire glow sometimes stays burning despite the consumable disappearing. One could also speak to an invisible character inside a phone booth. These glitches were in times amusing and sometimes annoying but nothing gamebreaking. After all, several original actors from the movies make a comeback (especially Doc), and the most important factor, the story, is true to the movies.There are car chases, crazy science experiments, made-up-names for time travellers, ridiculous escape schemes and of course the-ever-so-present danger of changing the timestream. The story flows seamlessly, and whenever you got stuck, you can always check your present goal and, if you'd like, get a hint within the game on how to advance further. Tension and surprise is maintained well until the end. All in all this game is a very nice sequel to the movies.			"

												If your a fan of Back to the Future and wish there was a forth movie, THIS IS IT! While the gameplay isn't the most intractive, the storyline is VERY engaging! While one or two of the set pieces are reused a little too much for a few of the episodes, the level design is very good. Also coupled with the multiple hidden and more obvious refrences to the original trilogy, it will keep almost any big fan of the movies happy.We most likely will never get an offical Back to the Future: Part 4, so this will have to do instead. And boy does it do it's job well.			"

												Back to the Future: The Game manages to perfectly capture the style and the characters of the movie-trilogy and once you fire up the first episode and hear the awesome soundtrack you're instantly taken back in time (haha) when you've watched your very first BttF movie.The game focuses a lot on dialogues and with Christopher Lloyd as Doc (known as the real Doc from the movies) and AJ LoCascio as Marty it's fun to listen to all of them. Unfortunately, due to his Parkinson's disease, Michael J. Fox only has a short cameo appearance in the game but nonetheless AJ LoCascio did a brilliant job as Marty.The puzzles in the game mostly just require the power of deduction rather than actual thinking skills which is okay, even though I personally hoped for some actual challenges.Total playtime per episode, depending on how many dialogues you skip, is around 2,5-3 hours, totalling around 12-15 hours. If you haven't watched the movies yet I HIGHLY recommend to do so before you play the game!			"

Each episode is a fantastic trip into the time-travel exploits of Marty McFly and Doc Brown, adding more background to the trilogy and taking root as the perfect fourth installment. While the graphic-style is a little on the goofy side, it somehow works ... and soon you are engaged within the universe.I cannot recommend this game enough, especially to any fan of the films.Top notch ...

												Telltale makes genre games, and this is one of those. I feel like it's solidly representative of pre-Walking Dead Telltale- kind of a mediocre-to-good game that never really impresses. It's a 5 episode series, about 10-12 hours in length. It's a point and click adventure game with some QTE-ish action sequences sprinkled around. It's never really challenging but sometimes interesting.The plot's decent, typical hop-around-in-time BTTF faire, but they manage to make the gameplay pretty samey despite the time difference. The high point is probably the whole dystopian-future Citizen Brown plot, which is a pretty decent departure from the tone of the series. Maybe that's why it works.The music is great, of course, it's the BTTF soundtrack, but it really starts to wear out its welcome the 20th time you hear the main theme or ""back.. in.. time.."" They managed to find a voice actor who can do a pretty passable Marty, even.The game's loaded with fanservice, so I'd say that if you're a fan of BTTF it's easily worth a play, and that you might not enjoy it very much if you aren't. The gameplay isn't that great to carry interest beyond that.			"

												If you are looking for adventure games like those of the golden age of point and clicks  games from Lucas Arts and Sierra  this is as close as you are going to get.  Telltale Games is one of the master of this new era of what is adventure games.  With what amounts to a Seqeul to the Back to the Future movies, they  have managed to make the gameplay fun and enjoyable while balancing it with a nod to fanboys of the movies.(Which is always a difficult thing to do)  The voice acting is awesome and the fact that they managed to get some of the actors from the original movie to reprise their roles for the game was beyond amazing. The story is original and I loved the intro that tied in to the the movie.  I wish this title had achievements.  But other than that for those who want more of back to the future or have a need for adventure games.  Wish there was a sequel to this game sadly more and more unlikely as time goes on. "

												From the first moment I started the game and that familiar overture started to play, my heart jumped with excitement and I was ten years old again seeing Back to the Future for the first time. Each episode is a fantastic trip into the time-travel exploits of Marty McFly and Doc Brown, adding more background to the trilogy and taking root as the perfect fourth installment. While the graphic-style is a little on the goofy side, it somehow works ... and soon you are engaged within the universe.I cannot recommend this game enough, especially to any fan of the films.Top notch ...

												I really wanted to give episode 1 a 'thumbs down'. I don't want to turn people off to the game though. As a whole, the BttF game is great. Episode 1... is not.There are many problems. Generally related to bugs. I experienced them constantly in episode one. (Luckily none of these appear in the other episodes!) I have a lot of complaints. That will be the focus of this review. However, I still recommend the game as it has a great deal of entertainment value.Often I would be unable to click on certain people or objects. The game would randomly decide I hadn't clicked on what I clearly did click upon. Instead, it would pick a random clickable person/object instead. Sometimes mouseover caused odd results. The pop-up text (on-screen description) would rapidly flash between what was highlighted by the cursor, and a nearby object.The dialog trees are all messed up. It seems like a part of the story was removed... or maybe it's just bugged. I'm not sure. I would frequently find that the dialog I was part of was way ahead of the story. Events (cutscenes) were always in order. The dialog rarely was.The story itself, is good. It is very much a BttF-style story. The character models were given a distinctly cartoony appearance. There is also a lot of adult humor. (The kind you should expect based on the film series.) This is sharply contrasted with the fact that the characters look like they originated in a modern animated film. (See: The Incredibles, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Frozen, etc.) They kind-of look like anime versions of the real-life actors of 'Back to The Future'.The mouse controls are poor. You have to hold Left-Mouse-Button(LMB), then drag to make your character walk. If you want to run, you have to hold RMB. However, if you hold RMB before you hold LMB, then you don't run. I can use the keyboard to walk, but I'm not sure how to run. Which means I'm stuck using the mouse for just about everything in this game.Probably the most disappointing thing is that animation was reused from the 'Sam & Max' games. Marty walks with the exact same motions as Sam. When people are talking, their mannerisms will follow the same patterns used in 'Sam & Max'.Lastly I want to mention that if you have a Nvidia card, you'll need to turn on 'Antialiasing - Transparancy'. If you don't, the shadows will look terrible. Personally, I find them so bad that it distracts me from the game. Then again... it might just be my particular video card. You never know.Most of these problems do not carry to the subsequent episodes. So, I happily recommend this.			"

												do not expect it to be ""Walking Dead"" or other great TellTale games. its kind of warm up before them. So keep your expectations based on this.it's simply a puzzle game. Your choices does not make any difference at all. Basically, U choose your sentence untill u get the right one. And there is only one way to solve the puzzles. İt's very very linear game.Very limited places, very limited characters. almost no irrelevant person in anywhere. So, streets etc may seem quite empty.Sometimes controls are very annoying. But once u hear the music u forget all and say ""Hell Yeah"".It's great to travel at BTTF universe, travel through time.However only BTTF fans MAY enjoy it.			"

												Time Period of Review:FridayMay 262016While my Dad seems to like the Back to the Future Movie Series, I think Telltale have done a great job with their Point and Click Adventure Games, Back to the Future: The Game or Back to the Future: Part 4 is by far a neat game which contains Time Travel. Set 6 months after the events of the third film, the DeLorean Time Machine mysteriously returns to Hill Valley driverless. Travel through time as you meet up with McFlys, Tannens and Browns through the ages to right wrongs, amend timelines, and prevent terrible terrible mistakes by going up to 88MPH & Who needs roads we're When going to.Episode 1:Marty McFly is just getting re-acquainted with the 1980’s when the DeLorean Time Machine he saw destroyed by a speeding train materializes before him. He finds out that Doc Brown is trapped somewhere in the past and that he must travel back in time to save the Doc's future!Episode 2:Marty is keeping an eye on young Doc Brown's proverbial date with scientific destiny when he and 1980s Doc must prevent gang boss Kid Tannen from wreaking havoc on Marty's family and erasing his girlfriend from the future! Episode 3:A time-stranded Marty has a rough and tumble return to the 1980s and finds himself in a topsy-turvy or should we say Politically Corrected version of the world lorded over by the enigmatic ""First Citizen Brown."" Episode 4:The Hill Valley Expo has arrived! Back in 1986, Marty and First Citizen Brown must join forces to create an epic invention so that he can prevent the young Emmett Brown from making the worst mistake of his life.Episode 5:In the Series Finale of Back to the Future: Part 4, lives are changed, mysteries are solved, and paradoxes are avoided as Young Emmett seals his fate, sending Marty and Doc on a climactic chase through Hill Valley's past, present, and future.

												Love yourself: buy this game.If you're a fan of the original series you're in for the perfect sequel. If you aren't then you're still gonna get a wild, comprehensive, point-and-click adventure that is hilarious, wickedly cheeky, and so much fun to play.The graphics are a little haphazard and the game glitched a few times with the voices cutting out, but other than that it's well put-together and very clever. Exactly what you want from a Back to the Future homage, and more. Can't recommend highly enough.11/10			"

The hint system though is quite good and I only had to resort to using game guides on the net about 3 times. The 5th part to the game is great. If you like this type of game I would pick this up.

												A return to one of the greatest adventures ever created. BttF:TG is a direct sequel and a worthy one at that. Fans of the franchise will love it, but fans of the point-and-click adventure style may be disappointed by the lackluster puzzles. From episode 1 to 5 the difficulty seems to hit highs and lows with no logical sense. It's good for some hours of fun, but not enough to entrance you.Also, they are very short individually.			"

												If you're a fan of the films, then you will enjoy this. I've only finished the first episode so far, and will be starting on the rest soon. I'm not too sure about re-playability though because there's set events that happen regardless of your actions in game. It's half and half point-and-click asking/answering questions, and running around solving puzzles (which actually can be fairly challenging if you choose not to use clues). So I recommend it especially if you're a BTTF fan.			"

												Well if you liked watching the movies then you must play through this. It was more of a movie you have to do stuff in than a game.. but im fine with that. No dying and retrying like in walking dead so all you have to do is interact with ""New but familiar faces"" and learn about the time period that ties the movies together. Its hard to really say to much about the game without giving anything away. So all I have to say is this is a must play for anyone who liked the movies. Cameos from the movies right up to the end. Voices that you'll remember from the movies, and a story line that may be the best one so far. I have only one bad thing I can say and it may have been more my fault for being impatient. In the first episode theres a part where your movement through the room triggers a scene that took me a while to actually trigger cause i kept leaving the room. GREAT GAME - MUST PLAY			"

												If you are a fan  of BTTF and have played other Telltale Games and have enjoyed them, then this is a no brainer. I have played through all 3 seasons of Telltale's Sam & Max games, so BTTF: The Game felt like familiar territory. So far, I have completed the first 2 episodes of this point-and-click adventure series, and I have enjoyed them. The story is well written, picking up where the movie triology left off, and feels like it fits quite naturally with the movie story line. The plotline is very much in line with the movies, where time travel inadvertently, and disastrously, messes up the time line, which then needs fixing. This time, Marty and Doc need to visit Prohibition-era Hill Valley to fix history. The voice acting is pretty good and the actor portraying Marty does a pretty good Michael J. Fox impression.Now on to my gripes...the puzzles are very sensical but they are almost too easy; at times it's almost spelled out for you what you need to do. So far I haven't needed to use the game's built in hint system. Next, the navigation in the game's quasi-3D environments is frustrating. Getting Marty to negotiate his way around the scenery is clunky. This game has the same annoying navigation that was introduced in the last season of the Sam and Max games.Other than those 2 gripes, these games are enjoyable for BTTF fans who want more stories with the characters they love and who, are interested in exploring more lore about Hill Valley, the McFlys, and the Tannens. Oh, we also get to see Doc when he was much younger.			"

												Back to the Future: The Game serves as a well written sequel to the cult film franchise.The game is a classic Telltale game, 3rd person adventure style with controllable walking and interactive objects while moving the plot forward. The plot across the five episode are well thought out. Marty travels to 1931 to find Doc, who has disappeared and is delcared dead in 1986. The main events of the game take place in alternate time period of 1931 and 1986 while also unraveling mysters of Hill Valley. And in the end, everything is actually tied up, from Edna and Tannen to discovering who Trixie Trotter really is and meating Marty's ancestors. The game does leave an ambiguity for a possible second season that Telltale haven't opened up about....yet.The graphics are pretty standard for Telltale, a soft textures and average polygon models that sometimes look a little off. It does give a vibe of adventure in the style of how the characters were modeled though, I really like how Marty and Doc turned out.Music and audio are great, nothing too special about them though.Overall, this serves as a great add-on to the films and are just as scientific with theories new and old. Great game.9.0/10			"

I recommend playing through all 5 episodes, so pick them up as a bundle if able to.  Game has different levels of handholding if you wish for it, so you can play through it for the challenge of the puzzles, or more so just a Story mode almost, so you can enjoy it as an addition to the Back to the Future movie series.  Felt really good to see Marty and Doc in some form again.  Each episode took about 2 hours to complete, so worth the time.  Hoping there will be a continuation of this at some point.			"

Too many people didnt understand the pun and the demand for more was so huge, they actually made more.This game, or these games, are a great little extra which sneak in well within the storyline that we already know. Another Tannen, another McFly, it all fits in and gives us a few more romances to fixNow I played these one by one as they were released seperately, just enough to keep you going and wanting a bit more.

The games preserve the feel of the movies, and Christopher Lloyd reprises his role by peforming the voice of Dr. Emmett Brown. You can't take five steps through Hill Valley without bumping into a reference or throwback to the old movies either, so if you're a fan you can test yourself on how many references you catch.			"

												I thought the story for this was very interesting and I had to play it all the way through this first part without a break. I do like that they give you hints so you can figure some of the puzzle stuff out. I liked the Walking Dead game they did and when I noticed they had this for my fav movie I had to buy it.			"

												Telltale Games are onto a winner with their recent selection of adventure game ""seasons"".Back to the Future is no exception.The acting is great, with some returning cast members.  The guy who voices Marty McFly makes a fine proxy for Michael J Fox - something that could have been a game-breaker had it not been handled well.The puzzles require some thought, and push the story on well.Definitely one of my favourites of the Telltale stable.

												While a little easy for hardcore adventure games and despite controls being kinda awkward, this game is a must have for any fan of the Zemeckis franchise. You will find familiar characters from the series, a greatly written story that will keep you engaged (although I suggest not to overanalyze the plot cause there are more than a few paradoxes in there). The acting is superb and will make you quickly forget you are playing a game and bring you inside the world of Back to The future.			"

												Great game. It basically builts on the story known from Back to the Future movies, so it's mainly made for BttF fans. Puzzles are quite good and overall experience is just a lot of fun! Only drawback for me is that the game installs as 5 separate episodes, so you get a mess in your Steam library. But it's hardly a big drawback rly!			"

												If you liked the movies, then you'll love this series. There's plenty of plot twists and references to the movies to make the fanboy in you jump for joy. I felt a few of the references were a little over-played. Christopher Lloyd voices Doc throughout the series and Michael J. Fox comes in to voice Marty in the final chapter. A lot of fun, not too difficult, but can make you scratch your head a few times. I totally recommend this to fans of the movies.			"

												Pretty enjoyable story and gameplay. At times the puzzles were too simple and at other times the solutions to the puzzles were pretty obscure. The story was fun but the overuse of the “hey look over there!” trope was annoying(although it did allow for some pretty funny meta humor towards the end of the game.) What I really didn’t care for is that you visit the same town multiple times and only once is there any major difference in architecture(minus the very brief trip to the 1800’s.) With a time travel plot line you can do a lot of things, why confine yourself to one place and time period. But verall it was pretty alright.			"

												I started playing this game after playing Telltale's, The Walking Dead. The same company behind the awesome zombie story game helped create this game. For fans of Back to the Future trilogy movies, this is a must, as the story continues right after the events of the end of the 3rd movie, where the Delorean is destroyed. However, this is not a pure action game. It plays exactly like Telltale's The Walking Dead, so it's at your own pace solving your way through the game's storyline. Some can be turned off by that but I happen to enjoy it, especially since the story is great and the world of the Back to the Future franchise brings back so many nostalgic memories.			"

												Well if you liked watching the movies then you must play through this. It was more of a movie you have to do stuff in than a game.. but im fine with that. No dying and retrying like in walking dead so all you have to do is interact with ""New but familiar faces"" and learn about the time period that ties the movies together. Its hard to really say to much about the game without giving anything away. So all I have to say is this is a must play for anyone who liked the movies. Cameos from the movies right up to the end. Voices that you'll remember from the movies, and a story line that may be the best one so far. I have only one bad thing I can say and it may have been more my fault for being impatient. In the first episode theres a part where your movement through the room triggers a scene that took me a while to actually trigger cause i kept leaving the room. GREAT GAME - MUST PLAY			"

												If you are a fan  of BTTF and have played other Telltale Games and have enjoyed them, then this is a no brainer. I have played through all 3 seasons of Telltale's Sam & Max games, so BTTF: The Game felt like familiar territory. So far, I have completed the first 2 episodes of this point-and-click adventure series, and I have enjoyed them. The story is well written, picking up where the movie triology left off, and feels like it fits quite naturally with the movie story line. The plotline is very much in line with the movies, where time travel inadvertently, and disastrously, messes up the time line, which then needs fixing. This time, Marty and Doc need to visit Prohibition-era Hill Valley to fix history. The voice acting is pretty good and the actor portraying Marty does a pretty good Michael J. Fox impression.Now on to my gripes...the puzzles are very sensical but they are almost too easy; at times it's almost spelled out for you what you need to do. So far I haven't needed to use the game's built in hint system. Next, the navigation in the game's quasi-3D environments is frustrating. Getting Marty to negotiate his way around the scenery is clunky. This game has the same annoying navigation that was introduced in the last season of the Sam and Max games.Other than those 2 gripes, these games are enjoyable for BTTF fans who want more stories with the characters they love and who, are interested in exploring more lore about Hill Valley, the McFlys, and the Tannens. Oh, we also get to see Doc when he was much younger.			"

												Good adventure game from Telltale era before Walking dead etc. Hint system is also useful, but puzzles mostly seem logical and easy to reason. Not as sophisticated game system as future Telltale games have had, but good story and if you're Back to the future and adventure games fan a must have.			"

												Great game and it does work as a true sequel to the movies. Too bad it ends with yet another cliffhanger, but it's been 5 years since the game was released so I guess another sequel is unlikely by now, especially if it didn't come out last year on the 30th anniversary of the first movie.I just hope Hollywood never messes with this by doing a remake, but there's nothing sacred for them. They're worse than the Tannens.			"

												Apparently, from what I hear from other fellow ""reviewers"", this is one of those Telltale games before the heavy-hitters like ""The Walking Dead"" and ""The Wolf Among Us"", and as such, you would expect certain nuances of this game, contextual to its development, compared to the general expectations these days.Having said that, I'm not a big graphics man, and I generally don't expect too much when it comes to these point-and-click adventure games. But it's Back to the Future! Made by Telltale! And has Doc's original actor (Christopher Lloyd, from what I recall)! So what's not to love? Unless you're not a BTTF fan, or just hate the game in general.The premise of the game is to explore Doc's disappearance, requiring you to go back in time and find him in some time in the past. From there, the plot kind of goes in some strange but enjoyable turn of events, thus propelling your role to fix up time paradoxes and whatnot, so the future normalises itself. So plot-wise, the game seems to make sense mostly. Characters aren't too detailed, but you can make sense of what they're like, which is important in some parts of the episodes. But the plot starts to get interesting from Episode 3 onwards, especially that part where you have to mess up young Doc's love life.Controls can get a bit weird with the camera panning around sometimes, so you might find the down button moves you left, and some others unusual orientation of movements.Now, I played the ""Wallace and Gromit"" games (were they made by Telltale as well?), and what I mainly don't like in these episodes is the item panel system. In ""Wallace and Gromit"", you'd just right click to bring up your items and pick something out. Here, you have to click on the item icon, pick your item, and if you need to pick out another item, you have to do the process again. Sure, you're never really using objects mostly, but it is always nice to hotkey these things.Additionally, some items never actually serve a useful purpose and kind of just loiter around your item space. I guess red herrings are interesting, but if you're stuck in a certain part of the game, you might think these items are useful, but the're not. So be aware of that, but at least they disappear (mostly) in the next episode.Also, walking speeds are a bit slow. I found that holding Shift makes you ""run"", which is just a sped-up animation of Marty with a slight speed increase. In certain areas, you will actually run, and even so, if you phase out of an area, you have to re-hold the Shift key again to ""run"". A bit of a pain, but it's manageable.The puzzles are interesting to solve, like that guitar battle with Leech, the SoupMo guy, where you can't actually beat him in skill, but you have to sabotage his performance and win that way. In some instances, you'll be likely to be in a situation where you're wondering ""What do I do now? I've done mostly everything... What am I missing?"". Here, hints can come in handy. I've only ever had to use the hints once (mostly due to my adamance of finding the solution myself), but sometimes it can really get to you and make you kinda rage at the game, because you don't know what to do next.And some instances, you'll actually solve the puzzle using sheer coincidence, where your actions just happpen to fall together into a solution that works out. But mostly, you'll have to recall certain information and use objects to help you coordinate the environment to your will and get things done.In terms of play time, each episode took around 2-3 hours each, which equates to about 10-15 hours to finish the series. So if you're a casual player with a few hours to spare, I guess this is one avenue to spend your time on. See what I did there, eh? But $24.99 is a little steep for only 15 hours, I suppose. You might want to wait until this is on special (I got it in a Humble Bundle) or something. But in short, I'd give this a 7/10. Not too bad, but still a bit rough around the edges.			"

Was travelling through time:WingOne basic thing, I've never watched a Back to the Future movie, so I can only think that game is based on a film.Back to the Future is point-&-click game made by Telltale Games, as we all know, it must be episodic, game itself has 5 episodes that were released from 22 December 2010 to 23 June 2011. Game action takes place in fictional city Hill Valley. Here's the list of episodes and short description of what is going in them(I will try to include as little amount of spoilers as I can)It's About Time - We begin game in 1986, but when we find out our best friend is missing, we are looking for him, after that, we are going back in time to 1931 to rescue our friend! Get Tannen! - When everything seems ok, our friend finds out that our grandfather is going to die and we need to rescue him AND make the most dangerous criminal in Hill Valley, will go to jail!Citizen Brown - Everything looks fixed, everyone is happy (except that one guy in jail), but then! We are transported to Future Hill Valley or Pure Hill Valley or, as I prefer to say Alternate Hill Valley. In this episode we need to make problems in Pure Hill Valley to meet Citizen Brown and convince that HIS Hill Valley is bad and people are unhappy!Double Visions - After rescuing Citizen Brown and destroying his ideal vision of sad Hill Valley we need to rescue him again from his enraged wife, then go back in time to 1931 to find his younger self and convince him to break up with his future wife, after that is done, episode ends.OUTATIME! - We are still in 1931 and we must find Younger Brown his older self kidnapped him and then we must take care that Younger one, will do his presentation at Science Expo. After that, everything seems ok, but then! The Woman who broke with Brown, stole his DeLorean and went back in time, and we need to find out to what date she travelled, after that, we are going to 19th Century to stop arson of the Saloon and in consequence, destruction of wholeHill Valley. In the end, we must manipulate with stolen DeLorean and then make sure that she'll land in 1931... And in the end is kinda funny plot twist but discover it by yourself :)And now's time for few most important characters:Marty McFly - Main protagonist, time traveler, also known as Sonny Crockett, Yakov SmirnoffEmmett 'Doc' Brown  - Best friend of Marty, time traveler, inventor, also known as Carl Sagan - The Infamous ArsonistEdna Strickland - And here are 2: - Young Edna - Cute, manipulating, desiring power and control over people She's the real arsonist - Old Edna - Alone, miserable, spends days on yellingBiff Tannen - Typical bully, in the right timeline he works for Marty's father.Arthur McFly - Only seen in 1931, our Grandfather, he makes kinda big role in Marty adventureKid Tannen - The most dangerous gangster in 1931, he needs to be arrested (Episode 2)Einstein - Our cute and lovely dog <3 Citizen Brown also known as Alternate Emmett - He thinks that HIS Hill Valley is perfect, we need to convince him that this city is Town of fearCitizen Edna also known as Alternate Old Edna - Manipulates with Alternate Emmett, after Marty destroys her husband's vision of perfect city, she tries to manipulate with his memoryYoung Emmett - Young inventor, feared of his dad, in sick love with EdnaTrixie Trotter also known as 'Sylvia' - Our (unknowingly until end of game) Grandmother, speakeasy stage performer, cuteLet's see how it looks...Gameplay - 8/10 - Typical point-&-click, with annoying camera sometimes, yet still, gameplay is greatAudio - 6/10 - Not bad, not good, decent, BUT with soundtrack from movie I thinkGraphics - 8/10 - Nice, clear, not-eye hurting, except characters sometimes look like dead (I mean, without emotions)Story - 10/10 - Great! Just Great!OVERALL - 8/10 - Game itself has a few bugs here and there, and sometimes can be harder or easier, but this is one, great, funny story with lovely characters and with unfortunately decent audio, I can recommend it for fans of point-&-click or Telltale Games loversGreetings, Wing "

												So far so good! I'm neither big on point and clicks or a big back to the future fan but this game has me reconsidering both. I think it's well made, even if the puzzles are a little on the easy side --- this coming from someone who uses ""hints"" a little too often.I suppose the thing that stands out the most to me is the ""movie style"" animation. With the cut scenes (and general atmosphere) you feel like you're playing along with a film and sometimes I have the lazy need to do that. Just kinda relax and let the story unfold with some effort on your part. Defintely recommend! Not sure if I'd pay the full price but be sure to grab it on sale. You'll have your moneys worth!			"

												First of all, i dont exactly recommend this game, i just cant say its horrible. I didnt really enjoy it verry much, and this is not due to the few graphical issues encountered or the awfull controller support. Its a  classic point-and-click adventure, and it picks up shortly after the film trilogy ends, as you play Marty McFly going back in time to 1930s prohibition-era to save Doc from his latest pickle. The game rests on a fun plot and sharp dialogue in a beautifully recreated Hill Valley, with terrific voice acting featuring many from the original cast, yet ultimately, it's sadly let down by lightweight in-game puzzles that lack invention and complexity. My real frustration though is that I'm a  100% sure  that Telltale can do better than this. You can still give it a shot, as i said the game is not horrible, but it is overpriced for sure. You could easily pick a much more entertaining game for this price.			"

												Very poorly optimized, lip sync is off, the art style of the characters clashes with the semi-realistic textures and proportions of the environment, but the sound quality is what ruined the game for me. You can hear static on the higher notes in the dialogue, no idea if it's the way the audio was recorder or if it's a bug in the game. Overall, this game is VERY representative of Telltale's ""expertise"" in game development, I was equally unimpressed by The Walking Dead, despite the raving reviews. Only The Wolf Among Us looks and feels like a finished product that's worth any money (but not $20 mind you, it's way too short). Why these guys make such a killing with their games and get such good reviews is beyond me.			"

												Intro:I honestly thought I would just be replaying the movies. It is aptly named Back to the Future: ""THE GAME."" There is enough material in the first 30 minutes of gameplay to warrant a weekly Television Show. With that said, if you haven't seen the movie (WTF? - It is possible I am told.) Go see it first. The game story relies HEAVILY on the fact that you've seen the movie 'more than once.' It is absolutely made for fans of the movie and not designed for people who will not get the references. You could play it and solve the puzzles but it wouldn't be half as fun. In my opinion this was definitely made for die-hards as expressed in the tremendous detail and love of the franchise. xD~Game Review: (pros and cons)Graphics: ""Cartoony"" style. Simple and quaint. A cool twist on beloved characters.Sound: Fantastic! High Quality. The voices are stellar and when the theme hits it gives you goose bumps.  Interface: Point, Click and Grab. Simple and straight forward. Dialogue text. ... Clever Puzzles. Object Manip. (*Note: Some people have reported sporatic issues of not being able to: ? - move to a certain spot, problem clicking and/or manipulating a certain item/element in the game world, etc. Obviously if this occurs on an object needed to continue the story it would be a major problem. ~ I myself have thankfully not encountered any of these issues.)Story: Here's the kicker for me... I bought this game as a die-hard fan with an open mind of expecting any and everything. (Mild Spoiler Upcoming...) In the first 30 seconds, I thought I was simply going to be replaying the game (it was just the intro... duh xD~) and I was fully satisfied with the thought that I would just be playing out the movies. ~ It's Not. ~ It is a totally unique and original story. There is enough material in this game to write an entire Television Drama series. From the best Sci-Fi that we are all familiar with; Guess what? As George Lucas found out the hard way... It's not the pretty graphics, it's not the 3D interface with a bunch of peripheral toys, it's not the high priced actors and the gorgeous women. What is the 'IT' Factor that makes something so spectacular? It's the writing. Always has been, always will be. And this game HAS IT! =) If the writing sucks, the 'whatever it is' tanks. It's that simple. You can throw all the money in the world at something but if you don't pay someone with a brain five bucks to write a good story, people are going to know it and they are going to know it QUICK. Unfortunately in these days, =) like plutonium, good writers are a 'little hard to come by.' xD~ What is/was a $10 steam sale game; hits upon a Serious IDEA. They only made three movies. This should Really be made into a TV television series drama. (NBC/Universal I'm talking to YOU!) Quantum Leap part 2 so to speak. Guy who bounces through time with his buddy. They already have all of it; it's all on the Paramount lot, even the costumes. It would take nothing more than a producer with the nerve. I'm sure there's a demand. All of the cost is taken care of because the props are all there. It would be... SO EASY it's unbelievable. The only thing they NEED: are Writers. =) So... you heard it here. xD~ To be cliche: Well, here's hoping the idea doesn't magically vanish. At least 'The Future' is: whatever we make it, so we'll have to make it a Good One, ALL of US! ~ Enjoy Life the best you can, wherever you are, because we're all stuck In ""Good'Old"" Two Thousand and Fifteen.Conclusion:If you don't have B2tF: The Series to watch on NBC...the next best thing is to play ""Back to the Future: The GAME""5 Stars. 10/10. Thumbs Up.Highly Recommended.			"

												Very poorly optimized, lip sync is off, the art style of the characters clashes with the semi-realistic textures and proportions of the environment, but the sound quality is what ruined the game for me. You can hear static on the higher notes in the dialogue, no idea if it's the way the audio was recorder or if it's a bug in the game. Overall, this game is VERY representative of Telltale's ""expertise"" in game development, I was equally unimpressed by The Walking Dead, despite the raving reviews. Only The Wolf Among Us looks and feels like a finished product that's worth any money (but not $20 mind you, it's way too short). Why these guys make such a killing with their games and get such good reviews is beyond me.			"

Product received for free
												Not my cup of tea at all. If there is one thing I do not like it is games full of cut scenes and boring dialogue.  Unfotunately that is all this game comprises of. Was never a big 'fan' of the movies and only have this game because I was gifted it.The graphics and  especially the audio suit the game down to a tee, but unfortunately the gameplay and the mediocre puzzles just do not float my boat. The puzzles I had to solve in my short stint all seemed to rely on trial and error. That just does not cut the mustard with me, I would prefer something that had a logical solution. I am guessing that this game is aimed at younger peope.While not a terrible game in any respect, I cannot find myself recommending it to anyone. This is the first Telltale game I have played, so I don't know if this is their usual modus operandi. If so, then I suppose that if you like their other games you may like this. As for myself, I will be uninstalling episode 1 and will not be installing any of the others in a hurry. This will go into my 2 star category, and maybe if I am bored enough one day, I might take another look just to see it through to the end.			"

												If you had played the recent telltales games and wondering if this is the same.. no! its not!The recent telltales games from walking dead onwards are really more of a story and choice selection game. The story goes on and your character moves as per story unfolds. There are only few situation where you get to actually control your character to move around.However, this is more of a story puzzle game, where you actually control your character almost all the time to solve puzzle and then the story moves on to another puzzle. I am at the near end of episode one and I got really bored as I am expecting more of the recent type of game telltales have but sadly it isnt.So save your money for other titles if you are looking for the same as what I am looking for.

												If you've loved the Back to the Future Trilogy for decades as I have, this game will NOT disappoint! Christopher Lloyd reprises his role as Doc Brown, and while Michael J. Fox allowed his likeness to be used for the game, he wasn't able to reprise his role... but the guy they got to impersonate him is eerily good.The game is a point and click puzzle adventure and while the controls can be a little irritating at times, the sheer joy the BTTF universe brings me makes it easy to overlook. This is a new, original story which takes place after the third film in the trilogy. While I haven't yet figured out how the DeLorean suddenly exists again after getting smashed by a train just outside Eastwood Ravine, I've only played through the first two episodes, so I am assuming that explanation is forthcoming... along with why Doc Brown is in 1931 (he mentions this in Episode 2 when Marty asks, but says he'll explain when they've set the time streams back to normal once more.)Tons of fun!

												This game was great fun! I got it as part the TellTale catalog bundle, but it would be worth to pay for it by itself. I've never seen the original films (yes, its on my to do list) so this was my introduction. The story is great, the voice acting is great (yay Christopher Lloyd), and the puzzles are not too difficult to figure out. A very fun title that I think would have made a good fourth movie. Note: expect 3-4 hours of play time per chapter.			"

												as a fan of the movies its hard to get into Back to the future games. over the years various ones have came out and most of them were garbage. Now i wished there was 3 options to choose for a review for games such as neutral. there are sometimes where we feel a game was decent but lacked on certain things. for me this is one of them. I enjoyed the voice acting. The story was not too bad. I'm one of those people that came off playing Walking Dead, Wolf among us, Game of Thrones before this game. So i was thinking there would be something similar.  But i tried their game Sam and max before this one so then i realized not all of their games would be like that. First thing that annoyed me was the controls and the camera. this was using a 360 controller. Sometimes it wouldn't react or i couldn't figure out what to use my buttons on. So i would have to actually use my mouse. So that defeated the controller purpose. the game being broken into 5 titles is only a small annoyance.So i only did complete one chapter atm but im mixed at the game. I'm not sure if this will be one i will finish because of the controls and camera annoying me. Now don't get me wrong if you can get it to work then it might not be so bad. i can't recommend this at full price. bundle or major sale maybe.			"

												The game would be nice if it wasn't so glitchy.Having startup issues when changing resolution and switching to full screen, bad controller support, terrible camera movement. Sometimes you'll be walking forward, then the camera will switch directions and you'll start walking in the opposite direction. The controller has lost functionality. You can see that they tried to add controller support, but it's incomplete. You can't use inventory items with a controller, you must use a cursor, so that's a lost functionality.Weird dialogue glitches where the camera will be behind a wall and you can't see the characters.If they fixed these issues, made the camera movement flow better instead of randomly flipping directions, and completed the controller functionality, it would be a fantastic game.

This is the Back to the Future game? Why didn't you tell me?Now don't get me wrong. I LOVE the Back to the Future trilogy. It's literally one of my favorite movie series.Yet, this game just didn't really stick out to me.*Pros*: Somewhat interesting story, okay voice acting, kinda funny characters, and simple game mechanics.*Cons*: Controls are buggy (Making Marty seem like a bit of a derp...), the camera is spastic, the dialouge can be tedious, and this isn't the game's fault, but more the company who made it. (TellTale games.) No matter what you do, it's just one path. No decisions, nothing. Just walking around... It just gets a bit dull. Overall, I wouldn't really recommend this game if you're looking for a fun adventure game. If you're a die hard BTTF fan or it's really cheap on Steam, then you should probably get this game.

												Honestly, this game is nothing like the movie. This isn't a bad thing. Actually, it only works wonders for this game. With the ability to not care for the movie's plot, they created a whole new story. The plot of the story is just amazing. The gameplay is pretty nice, but it can get a tad bit boring after a while. The audio is nice too, althought it did give me a bit of a headache after playing for long periods of time. If you loved the movie and head into this game expecting the same thing, you'll most likely be disappointed. Don't misunderstand me though, it has a very similar feeling which is great.Hit 88 mph and dive in!9/10			"

												Having played enough to be familiar with this game, I cannot recommend it for serious adult gamers because it comes across as a game for young kids.  It reminds me of a kids cartoon.  The graphics are very simplistic and the overall feel of the game play is childish.  Unfortunately this is one of those games that I uninstall.  It's a shame because I love the original movies.			"

												If you're a fan of the BTTF franchise (I haven't met anyone who isn't), then you'll enjoy guiding your favorite characters through a story that more-or-less captures the feel of the series. It's a little more Saturday-morning-cartoony in both visual style and tone, but the vibe is pretty much there. The puzzles can be a little too simple or revolve around finding some random object, two or three areas away, which gets a bit annoying. Not challenging but still fairly enjoyable. Play it for the story.			"

												One of the best, if not the best, movie spin-off game I've ever played. As far as point and click adventures are concerned, it's pretty elementary, but by no means does that imply that veterans of the genre should stay away. The humor is terrific, the story is very well written, and the one-liners, as usual with Telltale, are hilarious. Buy this game.			"

												A sequel to the renowned film series from way back in the day, when we had proper entertainment not what you blasted kids have on your intermenets, is surprisingly well-written and in tune with the source material. Christopher Lloyd reprises his role as Doc Emmet Brown and newcomer AJ LoCascio is almost identical to Michael J Fox's Marty McFly.Telltale does a great job of taking the Back to the Future fan down memory lane and delves deeper into the backgrounds of such characters as Biff Tannen expanding quite well what has been come to be known as the Backfutureverse.Ok, I made that up.It's good.

												I believe that this is the best representation of Back to the Future you could ever ask for in a Video Game. There are many laughs, interesting characters as well as old ones being acted brilliantly and, just like the origonal series, what starts out as a simple action to fix things with the time machine makes things far worse. I origonally bought this as soon as it came out on the PS3 as a percentage went to a charity for parkinsons, which Michael J Fox unfortunatly suffers from.This is a labor of love and that's obvious when playing this game. I highly recommend it to any fan of back to the future.			"

												I picked this up as part of the Telltale Games pack when it was on sale. I was mainly after the Sam & Max series so this was more of a bonus than anything.Having finally got around to playing it I have to admit it's much better than I thought it would be. The attention to detail and the sympathetic way they have stayed faithful to the original premise makes it a pleasure to play. The story is fairly well constructed and (without giving too much away) the way the series ending pokes fun at itself made me chuckle. The whole series doesn't take itself too seriously and that is to its credit.The good bits: The voice acting is superb. Christopher Lloyd! Even though Marty wasn't voiced by MJ Fox (who does do some cameos) I would not have known without looking. It is that good. The story holds together well with some nice plot twists not all of which are obvious.  It's a Telltale point-and-click adventure which I tend to like anyway. It doesn't penalise you for exploring or even trying something stupid. Fans of the films are going to appreciate the faithful reproduction of the BTTF universe with plenty of references to film trivia.The bad bits: The graphics aren't exactly photo realistic but they are good enough in a cartoon spin-off way. Some of the puzzles are just a case of going through the motions rather than any significant problem solving ability. I don't think you'll get stuck very often so if it's a challenge you want then this might not be it. Each episode is probably only 2 or 3 hours of gameplay depending on how many of the dialogue options you explore.If you like this type of game then you could do far worse. If there were a second season I would buy it although I might still yearn for a little more depth to the puzzles.  As I'm generally a miser when it comes to paying for games I'd say its full price is a little too high, but if you like this sort of game and see it in the sale I'd go for it. Recommended.			"

												I am a HUGE fan of the Back to the Future Trilogy so I decided to try out the games. I found them quite fun but the amount of times I shouted at the screen because the character models and their animation is over 9000. Even though the animation wasn't the best in the world I still enjoyed the games a lot. The only other problem I found was that the first four games I found quite a bit harder than ""Outatime"" the fifth instalment to the series. This game was very bad and the fact the SPOILERS Edna was the speakeasy artist was a cool idea but WHY IN THE WORLD DID THE GAME DESIGNERS THINK ""ooh I know lets get Edna to steal a time machine"" This made the fifth game short and boring and unlike the other games which took a total of atleast 3 or 4  hours, apart from the second game ""Get Tannen"", other a long period of time I was able to complete ""Outatime"" in 2 and a half hours. This disapointed me ;( but I would still look past that and recommend this series of games to any of my Back to the Future loving friends!!			"

												If you are a fan of Back to the futurer thrilogy you will probably love this game.It's more an interactive movie, no big puzzle to solve but I'm loving the story.I just finished chapter 3 and this was the best episode so far. The gameplay mechanics are not impressive, would have been better have a bigger world to discover, you can't really move around freely that much.  Everything feels really essential and directly tight to the linear story but the movie atmospere is there and I really love so far how the game make you feel to be inside a new Back to the future movie.After finish the other two chapters I think I will do a nice Back to the future movie night, it just make me sad that they made just 3 movie....After this game, I want more of them          ;)			"

												I want to thank Telltale Games studio. It's been a pleasure to play throughout all 5 episodes. Although there are some things, that I want to mention: sometimes it's not clear what to do and even hints are not making it easier. There are not too much characters and sometimes you think that the story wouldn't have been that long. But nevertheless, I recommend this game to all the fans of Back to the Future films. It is cool to have old good pals brought together in their new adventures			"

												As dialog and story goes, this is not bad... but as a game this is just awful.You got to guess constantly how the developers want you to solve every single situation and even with the clues they add it can be frustrating and boring.Point and click games are not my kind of genre I will admit, but the dialogs and story are good (telltale signature) However I also have to consider the game part, as a game I cannot honestly recommend it, because its not fun. The gaming part is infuriating at times, since there is only one correct answer and one correct flux, if you dont follow the developers planned script you wont advance.My recommnedation? see the youtube gameplay and dont bother playing it yourself, you will have a better time that way.

Yeah, so, my game time isn't accurate. I forgot I had it open! Anyway, I'd say the total game time for one episode was right around 2 hours. This is an older episode game from Telltale and it does show, to a degree. The Telltale engine works well and it has carried them on through recent releases, and it holds up rather well in that respect. In this, you can set your expectation to what you would (in terms of graphics) for a game released around this time - it looks pretty good, but certainly not what we expect in 2014, but still fun to look at! Some things haven't held up this well, at all. The good and the bad are in equal supply with this, I think it looks adorable and the characters and voice acting are fantastic. Telltale really has a talent for making things like Back To The Future, The Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead, etc., really come to life and be fun again. The light touchings of ""pick your own adventure"" stylings were already perfected in that ""Telltale Games"" way, even when this came out. The biggest negative to this I have to give to the controls. They're clumsy. Extremely clumsy, and this has been fixed to a degree in recent releases, but it's probably my biggest complaint with any of their games. I'm sure if this were early 2010 and I were playing this, my complaint would be the same with the wonky controls, but I'd probably think the graphics were better by comparison, but we've all become a bit spoiled. I didn't experience any problems with gameplay whatsoever, and again, the overall feel and fun-factor of the game (this episode, anyway) is huge. Finally, the graphics, even if dated, are lots of fun to look at and very adorable. Everything considered, 7.0/10 - As with a lot of this type, pick up the whole series on a sale or get it as a gift (like I did! :D: ) and you'll have tons of fun with it. I'm likely to play through it again, but replayability is most definitely limited. Good job, as always, Telltale.			"

												The game fails to capture the magic of Telltale's later games while simultaneously failing to capture the nostalgia of the original films. While I heavily enjoyed the first episode, the remaining four were a slog to play through (mostly offline). Play through the first episode if you get it in a Humble Bundle. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.			"

But this game I really REALLY enjoyed!From the first episode to the last, this was a great story game to play.Voice actor of Christoper Lloyd made it legendary!!! The voice actor of Marty McFly did a great job.Michael J. Fox does make a cameo appearance in ep5, but when you hear him talk, he does not sound the same as Marty. Ages does that to people, but nonetheless definitly a GEM of a moment when he does appear.			"

												Well, I don't quite know what to say. The game feels like ""Back to the Future"" all over again, focused on 1931 as the origin of the time problems, switching through various incarnations of 1986 until the timeline is fixed... in a way. As a bonus, this time around we get to meet young Emmet Brown as well.The game itself could use a few improvements, like merging the 5 parts into just one game or at least sharing the settings between the parts, but the story is pretty much top, and I liked the voice acting too. And heck, the ending... if you liked the movies, the ending is just heavy. If you didn't like the movies then you probably shouldn't play this at all. "

Garbage with a side of nostalgiatl;dr - The only value of this game is the desire for Back to the Future feels. I'd grab it on sale merely for this purpose. If you're looking for a remarkable game and have no designs on the movies, don't waste your time.The game opens with familiarity. Doc is testing his time machine then something goes awry. Lo and behold the true story begins. Now you're in the mix and you're in point and click mode, which is the only good part about the controls to this game. Once you have to navigate off screen, you're forced to click, hold and drag to move your character. After my play through, I went back and tried asdw and the arrow keys to move and it worked. Something not explained through regular gameplay, but I digress. The puzzles aren't inherently hard. With enough dialogue and random clicking, you can figure out most of them without a hint. The first episode brings you back to the movies. The second lingers on the same familiarity. By the third episode, I wanted to rush through just to beat the game. The fourth pulls you back in a bit and finally, when you know it's finishing up, the fifth brings you back to feels. Until the end, when it drags feet again, but it's okay because it will wrap up soon, the Delorean will drive into the screen and you will wish you could have it back all over again. The episodes don't link from your gameplay so items you collected do not transfer and neither do your choices. No matter what you name yourself in the first game, your name will be changed in the following.Speaking of episodes, who's idea was it to make you buy a game then repeatedly buy the same game multiple times. Well, it's not an entirely new concept, DLC has been going on for a few years now to rehash old sh**, but for this type of game? I'm not quite sure how much they forced you into spending in the long run, as I bought the game with all the episodes on sale for $4.99, but come on. The listing price was $19.99 and for the life of me I can't possibly think of how it could have been sold for more than $5.00. I spent about 2 hours per episode, with the exception of episode 3 where I walked away to eat and bullsh** for a while bringing my total to around 6 hours. Edna and young doc, separately and together, annoyed the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. The dialogue wasn't completely terrible, but I'm not sure as to why there were so many Star Wars references thrown in. There were also quite a few glitches in the episodes which made dialogue and entire scenese skip. All in all, I'd say for the $5 it's worth the nostalgia, but the game as a whole is doodoo. Good luck!			"

												This was VERY hard for me to say, because there really is a lot to like about this game (I wish Steam would allow us a third option when voting).  The problem is, overall, the pros don't outway the cons.  As far as the GOOD things: the story feels very much like a BTTF movie.  Fans of the movies will no doubt love the fact that some of the original voice actors returned.  The story is good, some of the new characters are interesting, and overall, it's entertaining.  Now, why don't I recommend this game?  If you take off the nostalgic glasses and look at it for what it is, it's not that great.  While I said the storyline was good, it's not GREAT, which is what you would hope for from a game based off the iconic movies (which I myself love).  The plot is very linear (there's not much in the way of choice), and the story doesn't get really interesting until much later in the game.  Also, the setting of a prohibition-era Hill Valley just isn't very captivating.  In addition, the puzzles vary from being either too easy or too vague to get through without hints (the guitar battle is a good example).  Also, and I know this is minor, but the animation is like something out of a kid's cartoon, which contrasts awkwardly with the adult humor and cussing.  There's more I could say, but that would just be rambling.   Overall, if you're a big fan of the movies and can get this game on sale, then YES, buy this game!  But if you're an average Joe looking for a game as good as their later efforts (The Walking Dead; Wolf Among Us), you'll be disappointed.  You'd be better off spending your money on a different title.			"

												1.21 JIGGAWATTS!  If you're expecting to hear that line somewhere in this game, prepare for disappointment.  While the game starts off with you in the shoes of Marty McFly, you're soon transported to a parallel dimension where a bunch of kids are trying to blow up nuclear reactors as part of an eco-terrorist cell.  After you blow up a bunch of innocent civilians you get out of town and team up with a talking dog and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, then fight Biff Tannen as he attempts to summon a meteor to destroy all of Hyrule.  I thought the writing was okay but there were a few lines like ""this guy are sick"" that really stood out as evidence that the translators Atlus hired were probably not paid very well.

												This is a point and click game based on the Back to the Future movie franchise. It has everything going for it, the music straight from the movie, the nostalgia, the amazing voice cast and the immersion that lets you explore a lot from the movie. This is some good interactive fiction and a point and click was the way to go to tell a story. The only real problem here is the genre just isn't all that fun.The story has you going back in time as Marty McFly from the movies to find Doc Brown and really puts a focus on Doc's youth instead of the movies that put the focus on Marty's family and him saving it. Most of the characters are here from the movie, Marty, his dad George McFly, Doc Brown, Einstein the dog and of course Biff Tannen. It introduces more characters, but they're not the stars. Biff's voice actor could have sounded more like Biff, but Marty's voice actor is fantastic and Doc is played by Christopher Lloyd as always.Since this is a modern point and click game that lets you walk around an area instead of being confined to one screen like the older version of the genre. You'll be able to collect items and use them. That's one of the problems, the tedium of using the items. Going into the item menu, selecting the item, using the item and if you fail then you need to do it all over again. Over and over. , You'll be figuring out what dialog choice you need to make, which character to distract so you can do something with them gone. At least with this and other modern point and click games they accentuate what to click on.I can't say the game is fun and to be honest it feels like a chore to sit through the story. There aren't any crazy moments like in the movie so much as dialog and wandering around. I can't imagine non gamers that are fans of the movie franchise sitting down to enjoy this game and play it all the way through. I can't imagine gamers saying wow that was fun, unless this was the 90s when point and click games were more accepted, before technology left them behind.For the most part, the game is a series of cut scenes to say even the simplest of things. Potentially over and over again. There is some interactivity when you chat with someone, but it feels more like how much flavor dialog do you want to hear? There is always a logical choice with dialog and there are no wrong choices, so much as do you want to listen to all 3 - 5 responses or pick the most logical one to get it over with and progress? There are no real consequences like in Walking Dead where it can change characters and or events. You'll always get through the game. There is no death, there is no failure, there is just pressing on until you figure out what to do next.I've always been a big fan of the Back to the Future movie franchise, and I really enjoyed my first play through of Walking Dead, which is also from Telltale Games, but this game is a chore. The story and the nostalgia just aren't enough to make me want to see what happens next.			"

												Not for me, was incredibly bland and boring for the hour I played. Feels like you're just clicking on random things that somehow arbitrarily move things forward. It's especially frustrating when it appears there is supposed to be a unique order to interacting with things which means you basically interact with the same things multiple times in different orders in the hope of moving things forward.Perhaps the game picks up and gets more interesting but the time I spent with it didn't leave me with much hope. I wasn't a fan of The Walking Dead either so maybe I'm just not into Telltale's storytelling style and 'gameplay'. I'd rather just go back to other point and click games such as Broken Sword than play any more of this... there are just so many games out there and I don't want to waste more time on this.5/10			"

												Im a huge fan of telltale, and my friend is a huge fan of Back To the Future. How could a Telltale game about Back to the Future go wrong? Easy, by not being a Telltale game to begin with. I dont know if they outsourced this game, or if the art department took the day off and left it to the interns but wow... this game is ugly. The lip syching is awful, and the characters faces lack the complexity to properly emote. But how does it play? Again... nothing like a Telltale game. Instead of a story on rails where you get to occassionally switch tracks to fit your preference, Back to the Future is a point and click puzzle game... do you know how unexciting it is to play a puzzle game coop? The story moves like molassus because your constantly moving back and forth, reading the same dialogue, trying to figure out what item you need, or what line of dialogue will reveal the clue. The pacing was so bad me and my friend quit before chapter 2 was even finished because it was soooo slow.In short, this is a slow, point and click puzzle game, NOT a typical Telltale game... because those are entertaining, this game is not.

												If you come for the story, this game is right up your alley. If you come for the gameplay, you'll find it HELL. There were many times during animation when you can see it changing from the sequences. There were times when you could see the characters clipping.  At the end of the final episode, theres a rare point when there is a bug not allowing you to beat the game because you need to get something out of your inventory. As much as I hate to put it on a negative, there were just too many things that could bug a fellow game dev. My tip, if this is your first Tell Tale game you are planning to purchase, just don't. It will give you a bad idea on the entire company and they are awesome. To conclude this, the story was good, the gameplay not so much.			"

												It almost hurts me to give a bad review to a Telltate game since I usually love their games (Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, The Wolf Among Us, Jurassic Parc, etc...). Even if this game has an interesting story from a great movie, it has a GAME-BREAKING BUG in the first episode. I read that if you don't do exactly like they programmed it, you won't trigger an important cutscene and you won't be able to hit the pipe in the soup store ...I lost about 30 minutes trying everything and nothing ever happened. I had to trigger a certain conversation with the bad guy but since I already talked to him, I can't talk to him about the thing that i need to ... If you ever buy this game, just know that if hasn't been fixed since years. I won't encourage something like that. The game was fun and I was really hoping to play throught the 5 episodes fast but I have no choice than asking a refund for a broken game.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of the Back to the Future franchise. I remember watching them in theatres when they first came out. I find this game dull and boring. You have to go all over the place finding things to progress the story. Currently I'm stuck on getting the supoena to Artie McFly, and getting some alcohol from the Soup Kitchen, and no matter what I do, nothing works. This game is way too tedious, and not true to the franchise at all. And the fact that you can't skip dialogue really lowers my opinion. Definitely not worth the $25 they're asking. Maybe $3-$5 but not $25. This game may just end up taking up space in my library. Such a shame too. I was really looking forward to it. Haven't tried all Tell-Tale games, but the ones I have, have disappointed me. Imo, they're not a very good company. Maybe I'll come back to this someday when I feel like being bored out of my mind.Edit: Had to look it up. Finally beat Episode One. Still not that great.			"

Still, it can be a nice ride, if somewhat simplistic and stuttering.Cons: Very linear, kinda repetitive, annoying as hell episodic format.Pros: It's good to have the franchise kept alive, I guess. Voice acting is okay.I'll give it a barely deserved two out of four timelines.			"

												This is my first Telltale game I have played. I just bought the whole collection. Now let me start off with this: I have never been an adventure game fan. This is why I have stayed away from Telltale games. However, hearing just wonderful, awesome, best game ever reviews I finally let my guard down and purchaseed THEM ALL! Here is my verdict so far.TL;DR - Adventure game still aren't for me. Wow, that was a really easy, yet expensive lesson, for me to learn. In a FPS if I shoot someone, they die. If I shoot their arm, they die. If I shoot their face, they die. If I shoot their leg... you get the picture right? Of course you do, you've played FPS b4. Adventure games suffer from constantly having to do exactly what someone decided was the right thing always and conforming your mind to be set completely in track with that person's idea of mindset. Basically, in adventure games, if I shoot your leg first, but the programer thought I would aim for the arm, they do not die. If I shoot the arm, but there was a hint to shoot the face, then leg, then face, then arm, they do not die. You see why I do not like adventure games? I can't just play them. I have to spend hours figuring out every nuance that some other geek decided was the right way. BttF is no different. 1.5 hours in and I'm just clicking on every highlighted item, in a static world, wondering what logic the programer decided would work to make a damn barrel of alchohol fall from a shelf. AND THAT is exactly why I wish I had never bought any Telltale game. Definately not ALL OF THEM! So much buyer's remorse! What have I done?!			"

												This game has HORRIBLE controls.  There, I said it...*sigh of relief*.  It's sad that I've completed this episode and that's the primary thought that I'm left with.  The story is interesting at times, but gets boring and dragged out at others.  The gameplay is also mediocre, leaving me feeling lost, spinning in circles at times.  Sure, there's a thorough hint system, but that just feels like cheating (as a player and for the developer too).  Overall I didn't hate it and I'll be playing episode two...but I'm not in a hurry.

The game play is dated compared to their more current games.  I would only recomend this game if you are a fan of point and click games.  Another reason to get the game is if you are a huge fan of the back to the future story.  The game basically takes you through one more adventure in that world.  Enjoyable enough.			"

												I do not recommend this game.  I enjoyed it for a short time but the formulas for the puzzles quickly become redundant and predictable.  And I'm sorry to say, the length of all five episodes is just too much for this story.  By the 3rd episode I just kind of wanted to get it over with, not even making an effort to solve the puzzles and just using the hint system to tell me how to solve everything.  I enjoy Telltale Games, especially Sam and Max, and thought that this was a major disappointment.  Again, it's major problem is its length.  If they had stopped at episode 2, this would have been a more enjoyable overall product.			"

												As much as I like the Back to the Future franchise, I can't really recommend this game. Although you can see that Telltale Games put a lot of effort into this project (voices, music, design...), it certainly does not compare to their newer games. There were some episodes where I really had to force myself not to quit because the story was pretty mediocre and the tasks were boring. Episode 3 (Citizen Brown) was probably the best episode of this series.The biggest issue I have with this game are the bugs, particularly in episode 5. Pretty much at the beginning, in the Glass House, I managed to encouter two game-breaking bugs, which meant I had to do everything all over - twice. That sucked... Plus, the German language version has some serious dubbing problems, i.e. sentences get cut off suddenly, and some sentences haven't been translated at all. Is this a big deal? Yes, if you pay 23 bucks, it certainly is. Fans of the franchise, however, might want to take a look at this game, if it's on sale.			"

												After purchasing the complete collection of Same and Max games on Steam, I had high hopes for Back to the Future: The Game. I love Telltale, I love point-and-click adventures, I LOVE Back to the Future. What could go wrong?Answer: A lot, apparently.As later chapters were released, the somewhat thin layer of polish that came from the first few chapters very quickly peeled away. Events happened in the wrong order, characters would suddenly pop into scenes they weren't in before. Voice acting would randomly cut out in the middle of a line. The crowning achievement was during a car chase scene, when you could clearly see some sort of editor handle bouncing around behind the vehicle.The game ends with the tease of a sequel, and I honestly kind of hope that it doesn't get one.

												Okay, I've seen Back To The Future hundreds of times (I'm not exaggerating, I wish I was). I was thrilled when this game came out and I finally was able to buy it. When we arrive at this point I have to admit that I like almost anything BTTF related, even the animated series. But this game... This game makes me angry. I've played two other games by telltale and I quite love it, but this game is outrageous.There is not difficulty on this, in every location you have normally three/four things to interact with, you don't carry many objects with you (you can count it with your hand's fingers) and any conversation eventually leads with what the developers want to. You can't get lost somewhere because there's so little things to do and so little things to talk about that there is literally NO WAY to miss something. What I hated the most were the conversations where you had three options but the three of them where basically the same. What's the point then?So the interesting thing about this game is not playing it but watching it and see how the story goes and... Nope. The story is just not worth it, really simple and plain, full of plot holes and the graphics don't help. They're good enough to be bad and get you out of focus.The gameplay is quite tedious, if you walk from one point to another in some chapters you will cross with somebody and you'll have to watch that terrible animation with that same face with the nodding that EVERY CHARACTER will do. The movement is not the best thing in the world to be honest.Basically this game consists in clicking two things to see the next animation. Kind of LA Noire but with worse graphics and even worse gameplay.The only good thing I have to say about this is that this game came out 5 years ago. They released after that Jurassic Park and The Walking Dead and they clearly improved so hey, let's just consider it just a big mistake (praised by the critics and the gamers, I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY).My veredict: Sadly disappointing.

												Its a point and click adventure game, but the puzzles only come in two flavours, ridiculously easy (Put the key in the lock) to just bizarrely obscure (working out how to get a barrel of booze from one end of the room to the other without interacting with it) so while about 40% of the game can be solved in seconds the other 20% of the game is just half an hour of watching the same cut scenes over and over again till it triggers the next section of game play...the remaining 40%? walking...just slowly or moderately walking back and forth with little to no extras to carry the game along. the Easter eggs are forced and very literal (Any excuse to force the names of the directors of the film can and will be used)The game glitches. Alot...sound randomly drops out or amplifies sometimes the cut scenes will glitch through buildings leaving you watching a black screen while they just talk very very slowly...on at least 3 occassions the game completely bricked and wouldnt let me quit so I had to force my computer off and back on again.the first part came out in 2009 with the rest coming out in 2010...and the graphics...are not great. I wasnt expecting cinematic graphics for a 5-6 year old game...but the graphics are on a par if not marginally better than Late PS2/Very very early PS3 graphics...they all have flappy mouths as well rather than synching the dialogue so sometimes cut scenes just end with a load of flappy heads...I only point out the graphics because the likes of Fallout 3 came out between 2007-2011 and are utterly astounding in terms of quality against this...The only good things I can say about it is the plot itself isnt terrible. Its got quite a back to the future  ""feel"" but it does come across as boarder fanfic at times (Making up ""mary sue"" characters and making the heros almost untouchable in terms of having any bad attributes) and that Martys soundalike is really quite good...Doc sounds good...everyone else sounds iffy...I Payed a £5 for all 5 parts of the game during the summer sale and for a pound a part I'd say it was alright...but avoid paying full price at all costs...Its really not worth it. 4/10			"

												LOL. Please no. I knew this game wasn't going to be very good (the price fell too quickly), but wow. This game feels so generic. It has a whipser of nostalgia that is strong in the familiar opening scene, but that soons gives way to uninspiring point-and-click blandness. It lacks the polish or atmosphere of TellTale's effort with The Walking Dead.The Walking Dead plays out like a well-done effort by a developer's first team based on a popular franchise in a very popular genre while BttF:TG plays like a rushed effort by a developer's second or third team based upon a franchise that was huge 30 years ago in a genre that has outgrown its boyish charm.tl;dr My Steam library is bloated and neglected but I like the vast majority of what is there. I keep my games in several categories. One category is for games I would pay Valve to remove from my library. Welcome Back to the Future: The Game, inductee #7.			"

												If you're too dumb to play a proper adventure game, enjoy hearing someone impersonate Michael J. Fox for hours on end, and are thrilled by the idea of spending 2 hours in a single location, Back to the Future: Episode 1 is the gaming experience you have been waiting for! Based on the outrageous intellectual challenge provided herein, I can only speculate that Episode 2 features such mindbenders as helping Marty navigate his way out of a bathtub, or making Pop-Tarts when the directions on the side of the box are missing! As Episode 1 gave me such severe mental fatigue, I'm not confident I'll ever get around to knowing for sure!			"

												I was very much dissapointed with the game (all 5 episodes as a whole). The  gameplay as ""Quest"" is very primitive (for example much progress is done just making conversations all over again, items never need to be combined, some actions could not be performed but after some progress in the game the same action may be performed, but the progress is not anyhow linked with an action! - I will not give spoilers though),  the storyline is messed up.

												Back to the Future: The Game consists of five episodes which are a sequel to the movie trilogy.Doc Brown the inventor of the time machine has gone back to the '30s and he will die via mob justice. Now its up to you to change his fate, but as we learned from the movies, screwing with the past mucks up the future. The goal is to make sure the Hill Valley of 1986 is just how Marty left it. Telltale fail miserably at making their own circa 1931 Hill Valley anything more than a studio lot full of comedy gangsters.The gameplay is traditional adventure stuff. You walk around as Marty, talk to citizens and use items to solve puzzles. Unfortunately the puzzles are very easy, uninspired and boring.The characters are just as bland, also most of the characters are cardboard nobodies. At least, in some cases, the acting is good. On the most basic level, the actors sound like the original characters.The graphics do not render smoothly and the worst part is that these tech problems distract from the cinematic gameplay.The sounds of the game are pretty decent. Music is mostly in the background and not too distracting and actual sound effects also take a backseat in favour of the voice acting. The voice acting is definitely the best part in the game. If you are a big fan of the movies, then you could think about getting Back to the Fute: The Game. However, if the franchise does not really appeal to you, then this game may not be in your interest because the game practically relies on the player knowing the characters and the setting.Sound 7/10Graphics 6/10Gameplay 3/10Atmosphere 3/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												For fans of the film series that long craved a quality video game experience, Telltale's take on the Back to the Future lore treads almost no new ground. When I imagine a Back to the Future game, I see a freeroam experience where you can hop into the Delorean and drive to any time period you want. This point and click adventure is something best left to development teams equipped with quality writers. The Walking Dead narrative pairs very well with the decision based game format. But here frustration abounds.			"

												I picked this one up because of Telltale's Walking Dead series.  Walking Dead was an awesome experience.  I was not impressed by Back to the Future.  It came out before they did Walking Dead and it seems like a lackluster experience.  I was only around a half hour into it before I was bored and done with it so take this review with a grain of salt.  I am looking forward to Telltale taking on the Borderlands series.  I think now after Walking Dead they have a team that is up for the challenge.			"

												I'm a fan of Back to the Future, and I don't think this does the license justice. From the obnoxious puzzles to the terrible dialogue; it all just feels like it's been phoned in. This is extremely apparent at the beginning of the game, since they redo a very integral scene from the movie and it doesn't have the same punch. Overall, the problem is that the story isn't interesting enough for me to be invested. It's like an episode of the cartoon at it's best, and terrible fan fiction at its worst. This game was what kept me from purchasing The Walking Dead for over a year despite multiple sale opportunities. A truly terrible experience.			"

												It's back to the future, the game!  Anyone who loved the movie will love this game!  The voice acting is superb, though the game should be considered ""a long movie"" and not a game.   I got really excited after finishing the first episode, but then the game dragged on through 4 more episodes; without opening up any new plot directions, only re-hashing the original plot.  You learn a bit more about doc's past, but other than that, it recycles many of the jokes, comments and actions from the movies.  See the 70 minute star wars review for more: http://www.slashfilm.com/watch-this-70-minute-video-review-of-star-wars-the-phantom-menace/Honestly, after going to four different hill valleys throughout the episodes, you kinda wanna drive your fist through a wall and never hear about this game again.1/5			"

Love the movies, hate the games.Although this game had a great representation of the movie unlike any other games did (NES, SNES, etc.) I find that the puzzle solving and running around aimlessly made it a really un-interesting and boring game. You need to know the exact dialogue to say when talking to people to progress. If I'm required to look up what to say much like in L.A. NOIRE just to find out how to properly do it, f*ck that.I didn't bother to complete this game, or even attempt/install the other four episodes.3/10 "

												This was a game I have to admit I REALLY enjoyed. It has everything a graphic adventure should have - the freedom and choice to turn the plot around a little (although it is fairly linear) and comedy. There are so many points within this that will literally make you laugh out loud, and other points where you'll fear for the well-being of the characters.Thankfully, for those like me who struggle occasionally with some of the plot devices, there are hints that will help! Sometimes this can be used to clear up a miscommunication between you and the game, or in other times, to check that you're doing the right thing.It also keeps an up-to-date summary of the story so far, so when you feel like you want to resume playing after an extended break, there is the ability to remind yourself of what's already happened.I recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzles, has a good sense of humour and those that want a game filled with nostalgia to remind them what the good ol' days were like (even though I wasn't born close to them!)

												I usually hate PaC games, but this is Back to The Future! Its more interactive then a typical PaC and that helps, but then its the story. I'm an old head and fell inlove with the movies when they came out, not when my parents brought them home on DVD :) If you like any of the movies, you will like this game. The story is pretty solid. Gameplay is soft but its PaC so IMHO thats never really exciting. Some of it feels buggy, like being able to solve problems without the problem arising yet so you infact have to complete the task again when it fits the plot. On sale this is a great buy to extend the DtTF timeline. At full price, I hope you are a Brown or McFly. One sale?

I have always been a huge fan of the Back to the Future films and the games perfectly capture their spirit.  Granted it is not the most challenging adventure game I have played, but the story line, the familiar faces and voice talent (particularly great to have Michael J. Fox in the final episode) more than make up for it.  I hope it really is ""To Be Continued""  Great work Telltale Games - the love is evident.  Highly reccomended			"

												Working with such compelling proprietary content, Telltale, the reigning champions of turning licenced properties into enjoyable adventure games, could only do so wrong.  And they almost do that wrong, but they salvage a playable experience through a fun story, strong voice acting and writing, and impeccable faithfulness to the tone and spirit of the beloved Back to the Future franchise.To stress, the gameplay itself is not the draw.  Puzzles act as minor speedbumps on the way to advancement of the story and dialogue.  The control scheme, identical to that of earlier Wallace and Gromit and Monkey Island offerings, clearly favors a console/controller over a mouse/keyboard setup.  The bulk of content is a bit too dialogue heavy which eventually causes the games to drag.   Unlike the aforementioned W&G and MI series that could rely heavily on absurdism humor in the dialogue, Back to the Future conversations are generally coherent --though certainly funny in their own way .  So a surfeit of quality writing and acting --especially by Christopher Lloyd! -- does truly feel like too much.Nonetheless, the game gets a thumbs up, albeit a very tepid one.			"

												This may be the best casual point and click game I have played thus far. The story could not have done a better job of sticking to the Back to the Future setting and mainting the style that fans love so very much.

												The story for this is really good and I'm going to say that the story in this is better than the Back to the Future movies. Gameplay is good. Puzzles, puzzles, puzzles. And the places you go in this game (even if it is Hill Valley) are very interesting.5 Episodes all up and so worth your time!			"

												Back to the Future: The Game is now over 5 years old. It was released in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of the first film. Now that the 30th anniversary is behind us, and 2015 came and left, can this game survive on its own merits?As a ""Back to the Future"" game it hits all the right notes. References to the films aren't clustered too close together and surprise you when you least expect them. It feels more like ""Back to the Future"" than any other game that shared that title before. The characters are familiar and their portrayal in this game feels very authentic. In many ways this game feels like a genuine piece of the film's legacy that had been lost to the ages. As a point and click adventure game it is a bit too simple. The puzzles seemed too easy at times and there were very few times when I needed to consult the in game hint box. Every puzzle has an obvious solution and the game's objective reminders guarantees that the player doesn't get too far off the path.Simple though it is the game is fun and I would gladly reccommend it to any fan of the series.

												Love this game, great story and action in it and lots of puzzles to solve minus the quick action buttons of some of telltales other games,but a few things I didnt like were the faces that looked dopey and goofy sometimes and also one huge thing about the 3rd episode (slight spoiler) Why dose Doc disapear but not Marty? even the time machine should not have exsisted though maybe the fact its a douplacate made somehow they explained at the begining has something to do with that but still Marty and Doc should both have disappeared as both of them were altered in the timeline thus from then on the whole things story itself is a time paradox that only exsists for the point of story line.

												It's painfully short, but that's to be expected for an episodic game.  It really does feel true to the source material.  The humor is genuinely funny, though the setting takes a while to get used to.  Most of the voice actors are dead on.  The puzzles themselves are pretty simple, or they should be if you can pick up on some patterns.  Overall, I get the impression that this series will be worth the money.  My only regret is the lack of TF2 hat.  I mean can you imagine the possibilities?  A delorean themed hat would be awesome.  And you could give it the description ""When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're going to see some serious crit"" I mean how could anyone pass that up?			"

												I can't complain considering I'm a BTTF junkie, but I'll have to say I expected alot more. This is really more one of those Click-and-see-if-you're-right games, like the Freedi Fish games I played as a small child. The storyline can be considered canon considering Bob Gale is on the storyboard, but it doesn't stand up to the story the movies had. There is literally almost no action in the game. This might not be so hard to understand, but I've never played a TellTale game before and this might be the norm for their games, but it won't appeal to hardcore gamers, mostly casual,Overall, an OK game but only reccomended for fans of TellTale and/or Back to the Future. Also, watching the movies is pretty much a necessity.			"

												Telltale are improving at their adventure games. They're trying different things (like conversations while you're walking through a large area and cool action sequences but in the adventure game mould...) but still fall down on old issues. Lip-synch is a little off, environments are a little empty, sounds are sometimes missing, the engine is slow, and there are bits where you wish they spent an extra week or so polishing because the hasty production shows. But there is a lotta love in this game. Lots of call-backs to the movies abound. The music and voice acting is spot-on and they totally nailed the DeLorean. Heck, they even got real science-y words in there. I'm interested to see what they do in future episodes.			"

												Working with such compelling proprietary content, Telltale, the reigning champions of turning licenced properties into enjoyable adventure games, could only do so wrong.  And they almost do that wrong, but they salvage a playable experience through a fun story, strong voice acting and writing, and impeccable faithfulness to the tone and spirit of the beloved Back to the Future franchise.To stress, the gameplay itself is not the draw.  Puzzles act as minor speedbumps on the way to advancement of the story and dialogue.  The control scheme, identical to that of earlier Wallace and Gromit and Monkey Island offerings, clearly favors a console/controller over a mouse/keyboard setup.  The bulk of content is a bit too dialogue heavy which eventually causes the games to drag.   Unlike the aforementioned W&G and MI series that could rely heavily on absurdism humor in the dialogue, Back to the Future conversations are generally coherent --though certainly funny in their own way .  So a surfeit of quality writing and acting --especially by Christopher Lloyd! -- does truly feel like too much.Nonetheless, the game gets a thumbs up, albeit a very tepid one.			"

												Very few movie liscense games are good. Even fewer are good after it's been years since the release of the movie. This Game is one of the few good ones. By no means is this the best movie liscensed game but in my honest opinion it still has the ability to stand on it's own. Back to the Future is set after the events of the last film in the franchise and as such there are plenty of references to the original movies. The writing still has charm, yet at certain points the game has a different feel to the story of the films, even if it is the same story line. The sound is somewhat subpar in certain places during the game, but at the very least the original soundtrack returns. At times thought, I felt as though I was playing a game for the 6th generation consoles (wii, ps2, xbox). Indeed, the graphics don't have the best polish however if you don't mind the cartoony stylization of the game it shouldn't bother anyone. The gameplay is your average point and click adventure which works in the games favor because making a fps or third person shooter out of this style of game would have been horendous Overall, as a story that expands the lore of the movies this game is pretty great, but stand alone it just okay. I'd suggest that mainly fans of the franchise play this game.			"

With the original writers of the series on the team, the game 100% fits in to the BTTF canon set after the third film with many little subtle nods to things in the trilogy, and Chris Lloyd  the original doc reprises his role in voice form.Very funny and surprisingly well written, I would say the only downside is it's very easy for a TellTale point and click, you won't get stuck really, but this is more so aimed at the fans, good at games or not.

												If you've played the first episode (available for free through Telltale Games) as a demo, don't base the rest of the series on it. While I totally geeked-out (I grew up on BTTF), the first episode is pretty slow and basically just sets the tone for the remaining episodes. By the time you get to episodes 3 and 4, though, you'll realize the story is perfectly versed for the BTTF universe, and even makes up for the lacluster sequels they released in theatre ;)			"

If you're wondering what the gameplay is like, download the demo for Wallace & Gromit (Fright of the bumblebee)  also by telltale. Play time (depending on your puzzle solving) would probably last you 45 minutes to 3 hours per episode.			"

												Going ""Back To The Future"" with these episodes was totally an adventure that I thoroughly enjoyed. The style and gameplay is outstanding and keeps you wanting more of the story. Its a tough one to stop playing. Each episode lasts for about 2 hours on average. There is a hint system that really helps when your in a jam and don't know what to do or were to go. I totally loved the hint feature it helped me out a ton. The story is a must see for anyone that loved the movies of Back To the Future.The images with the story don't shy away from the heart of the movies, they have kept the attitudes and feelings of the original movie. The voice acting is incredible and lets the main actors from the movies to play roles in these great episodes. This is a Telltales game not to pass up if you like clicking games and a great story. I have very much loved playing this series and I know you will too if you loved the movies. Come ""Back To The Future"" with this awesome series!			"

												BttF is a solid entry into the Adventure games genre by TellTale. The writing is compelling at times, mostly coming to its most resounding point on the last episode,  but that's to be expected by Telltale. It's standard Telltale fare, and while not their best series (I give that to Tales of Monkey Island, so far), it's certainly a great series to play through. 8/10			"

It is one of their earlier installments and in comparison to the new games awfully rough around the edges but wow the story and the acting is amazing as you would expect from a tell tale game. Im about to start the final episode and im sure Im going to happy with my experience and upset its over. At $20 its more than worth it. if you catch this on a sale your insane not to give it a go!

												   I've just finished episode 5 and I can say that I really enjoyed this game.   First off, lets keep in mind that it's clear that the Telltale formula wasn't fully developed here. There's no moral dilemmas because there's no choices to be made in this game. It's not a branched narrative.   The graphics aren't 2016 worthy and it crashes a lot. BUT there's an amazing cinematic feel to every episode.   It's extremely difficult, even impossible to play without using the hints that are given to you. You will be stuck in a puzzle for a long time because most puzzles make no sense.    The most important aspect is obviously the story itself. I'm not a Back to the Future fan but I really enjoyed seeing all these characters that we got to meet on the big screen.    It's a fun game that I don't regret playing. "

												these games are annoying as f.  You figure it out really early on than just look for the sequence of events to move the story a long.  The bulk of the puzzle is making the game procede (regardless of narrative).  Graphics and animation are subpar.  Controls (point and click) are still subar as they fiddle with how to move the player around their virtual space.  I loved spacequest and stuff but I'm just used to more freedom by this point.			"

												So 10/21/2015 was just here a few days ago, and I had to dive into this game again, just cause f***ing BTTF is amazing. As for the actually games, it's a price that is worth for all 5 episodes! The story is very original, creative, and ties in well with the movie franchise for where it left off on Part III!Using Telltale Games' gaming engine to incorpurate a very beautiful and emersive world (along with the choice making we all know and love from their games), it brings in for a very amazing and delightful gaming experience! If your looking into experiencing a story that will tie in into being a legitimate plot or a 4th film (even if it will never come out), this is the closest you can get for Part IV, maybe even better than how the original 3 movies were plotted out!Just play it!

												Dear Reader,I watched the trilogy in airplane and played the game (all 5 episodes for 15 hours) throughout my Holiday on Maldives.Cons: TellTale - they tell the story though your choices don't affect the ending or whatever.Sometimes you feel that the story was made longer for more episodes.Pros: TellTale do tell an interesting story that adds a lot of content to the ""Back To The Future Trilogy"" Which I was a hell of a series. Also the story has many fun jokes and many interesting choices (in case of fun, not story itself - lookup *Cons*). Though prolonged story is not always good, but they did tie all the ends together. The overall ending doesn't state the universe to be finished, so you can work at whatever next episode or TV series you want.The Voice acting of heroes is done by the actors from Films.The music will bring you back to the 21st of October 2015 :3Overall - 9/10			"

												Video Review (for those who don't like reading): 


YouTube™ Video: LittleZbot Reviews: Back To The Future: The Game (Spoiler Free) 

			Views: 41		

			What? LittleZbot made something serious for once? What kind of alternate universe is this? We reviewed this as filler content for next week, but we did enjoy making this, so we might do more. Might.		

Back to the Future: The Game is a puzzle-adventure game taking inspiration from point-and-click titles. You click on various items to interact with them or investigate them, and use the items and your surroundings to solve puzzles that advance the story. Does it work? Well, yes and no. When it comes to video games, there’s an age-old question: Gameplay or Story: which is more important? Well, if you’ve ever been on the fence about this question, then Back to the Future: The Game will solve it for you in the first half an hour.First, the story is astounding. It manages to fully capture all the magic and feel of the original movies while still being its own thing. After playing through the whole game, I, and I’d say most other people who played it, felt the story alone made it worthy to bear the title of Back to the Future Part IV. Considering that it was a collaboration from the people at Telltale Games, the people behind Tales from the Borderlands, and the guys who made the original three movies, and the story writer for this game happens to be the very same person who wrote the original three movies, I’m not all that surprised, though I am impressed that they managed to capture the same magic of the original movies more than twenty-five years after they released. The voice work is fantastic all-around, unsurprising since they got some of the original actors to play their parts, and every new character feels like they always belonged in the Back to the Future universe. For the most part, the dialog is well-written, the graphics are surprisingly fitting and work well, and the music is…directly stolen from the movies. Of course, the soundtrack of the movies is fantastic, so that’s not necessarily a bad thing. In addition, the puzzles are clever without being completely unfair. My favorite part of the game was during the last episode, where you have to jog somebody’s memory through giving their brain certain stimulations to represent what happened in the past. A mop head on a cactus makes a grandpa, a sign on an outhouse makes a saloon, and so on. I only ever had to look up the solution to one puzzle in the very first episode, and that ended up only being because my controller didn’t recognize a required object as an item.And that’s where we get into what’s wrong with the game. After all, when you get a bunch of movie producers to make a video game, you can expect the story and dialog to be good, but the game itself? Not so much. Where should I start? Well, the camera is among the worst I‘ve ever seen, being annoyingly hard to control, and since most of the time you never need to manipulate it, you end up forgetting you can entirely, which makes parts of the game later on when you do need to manipulate it very confusing. It also picks these strange moments to suddenly switch perspectives, which throw you off whenever you’re trying to go somewhere across town. There are invisible walls everywhere, giving you a sort of fake-3D experience, but then often you can move around freely, and you just can’t tell the difference. Despite Hill Valley feeling so big, I feel just so constricted because of this. Plus, Marty is so slow! Even when he’s running, which, if you’re smart, he’ll always be, it still feels like it takes forever to get anywhere. All three of these aspects combined makes traversing the world around you a chore. That’s not mention the terrible controls. Here’s the thing: you’ll spend half of your time clicking, and the other half walking. Initially, it seems that a controller is the best option for both of these, as one of the control sticks can be used to skip from one clickable item onscreen to another with ease, and the other can be used to walk freely, whereas you have to drag the mouse a couple of inches away from Marty in whatever direction you want to go if you want to use the mouse. However, as I mentioned earlier, sometimes your controller will skip right over items, because it doesn’t recognize them, and very often, those items are required to solve a puzzle in the game. So you end up constantly switching between two means of controlling, using the controller to move and the mouse to click, and, trust me, it gets REALLY annoying. Also, if you hold down either the mouse or the button for more than a half a second during dialog, it sometimes acts like you clicked twice, and skips important pieces of dialog. Also, just a tip: in the first episode, a reporter will ask Marty for his name. Just tell her it’s Harry Callahan, because no matter what, everyone is going to refer to him as that.Is playing the game a chore? Not necessarily. The music and characters keep the atmosphere up, the puzzles are fairly good, and the story makes you want to keep going. It’s more of a whether or not the story is worth drudging through the terrible camera and controls. I’ll tell you this; if Chuggaconroy ever made a let’s play of this game, I’d recommend watching it well over playing the game yourself. However, when you look at the other Steam reviews for the game, you’ll see that the vast majority are positive, and most of the negative ones simply say that the game is “meh,” and the story and gameplay cancel each other out. Many of the positive reviews say that the story is what makes the game worth playing. And here’s the thing: I think they’re right. The game is going to be really annoying to play through due to the controls, but the feeling you’ll get when you solve a puzzle is never to be underestimated, and every resulting cutscene is a reward in and of itself. I certainly wouldn’t recommend watching a walkthrough over playing it, but if you have a character of interesting personality doing a let’s play, you might want to stick to that. Still, the story, music, dialog, characters, and perfect capturing of the feel of the movies makes this game more than worth the while. On the gameinformer scale of 1-10, with 7 being average, 10 being perfection, and 1 being the Ouya controller, I’d give this game a 4 for gameplay and 9 for story, which rounds off to 6.5, and I‘ll bring it up to a 7 just so I can recommend it officially.Back to the Future: The Game, gets a 7 out of 10.

												There are two ways to look at this game. One way is if your a fan of Telltale games. The other is if you are a back to the future fan. In this case, I am the later half. Telltale perspective: I have played their more well know games such as TWD (both seasons) and The Wolf Among us. Both of which felt a little more creative. The Game also took me about 10 hours which seemed a little short for their games. The one thing that stuck out the most was that if you played their other games, get ready for a change, granted this is one of the first game like TWD or any such, so do cut it some slack.Back to the Future Perspective: Let me start off by saying I LOVE these movies (yes, even part 3). Had they decided to make a part 4, this would have worked in my opinion. They refrence the movies through out the episodes and try to stay true to everyones personalities in them. I was also surprised to see Christopher Lloyd play Doc Brown throught the whole game and see Micheal J. Fox play William Mcfly (Marty's Great grandpa). They even got Tom Wilson to voice Biff on home consoles. How ever there were a fair share of things that couldve been fixed/ would be nice but not need to fix. (No spoilers) The end of episode 5 completly falls apart and then leaves it on a cliff hanger most notably.There is rumor that the sequal is being made, but is bottem on the priority list, but hopefully Telltale will publish it soon.Overall, I would say definitly try it your a BttF fan, even if you dont like it, you'll probably like some of the refrences to the movies. It certainly beats BttF on NES. Its a maybe for you Telltale fans, like I said, this was the first of their style of games. But regarless of what you think, where you're going, you dont need roads			"

												Back to the Future: The Game is mostly a point-and-click puzzle-solving game spread over 5 episodes.I completed it in about 11 hours.  The regular price seems rather high to me, but I got it on the Steam Summer Sale for something like $5 which was totally worth it.Gameplay is not the greatest.  Most puzzles are relatively easy, but there were a couple that I had to go online for a walkthrough to get past.Story is fantastic and true to the movies.Voice-acting includes some of the actors from the movies.Graphics are in a computer-animated style (think slightly lower-quality Pixar).Overall, as a game by itself there are better point and click puzzle solvers out there.  But looking at it as the fourth movie in the series, it is epic.  If you like the movies I highly recommend this.  It gives you that one more adventure with the characters we came to love 30 years ago.			"

												Pros: - Young Doc was terribly adorable.- I appreciated that Christopher Lloyd reprised his role as Doc (and MFox did a cameo in Ep 5)- The Opening/Ending mirrored the movies (which made everything feel lovely)- The story was interesting - Playing the game got easier to navigate Cons:- The story stopped being interesting after Ep 3- It was hard to control Marty in Eps 1/2- Ep 5 can be summarized as: 'finding/killing doc then being the inbetweener between a familly argument because no one is willing to talk to one another' (no spoilers in that sentence, don't worry)- Ep 3 can be summarized as 'doing nothing while you run around talking to people then the story ends'- The animation was so off at times. Sometimes simple things like a WALK CYCLE was not done correctly and Marty looked like he was walking with straight legs- Sometimes the animation stops or the dialogue stops while the animation catches up- The ending feels like an absolute cop outI know this is one of TellTales older games but I was expecting development from ep1 to ep5 (such as game mechanics getting better). But it feels unpolished. Simple things, such as making sure that a walking cycle looks believable shouldn't be neglected in any game, even if it's coming from an indie developer.  I really love Back to the Future but this didn't feel like what the franchise deserved. It's more of a causal game than an 'adventure game' since I basically did nothing but walk Marty from place to place. tl;dr: Doc gets a new girlfriend and then the story gets dull. The end.			"

												If you like Back to the Future, get this right now. It's the best possible Back to the Future game and infinitely better than any movie sequels that will inevitably happen once both of the original creators are dead. The story is great, the dialogue is well-written, the art style looks amazing, all of the returning characters sound just like they do in the films. The only complaint you could have is that the puzzles aren't that hard and there's really no consequence for messing up but are you really buying this game for the puzzles?If you don't like Back to the Future what the hell is wrong with you			"

												Completely blew my expectations. Story is just epic and is the most underrated game of the decade.If you enjoyed the trilogy movies, this game puts the films to shame. If you enjoyed other Telltales games  Walking Dead, Game of Thrones and Wolf Among us (I've played & finished them all), this game also puts them all to shame. This is how good the game is.Wasn't expecting the writers to match the story and complexities of the trilogy movies, they've completely outdone themselves. WELL DONE! Ignore all the negative reviews complaining about the graphics. The story, humour and plot twists overshadows all the negativities and makes them moot. To sum up, its a 12 hour rollercoster ride I'll never forget. They don't make games with these types of narrative and story anymore. Read my other reviews on Steam, I have extremely high expectations and don't ustally give high scores)My score for this game 9.5/10 for entire season(Ep1 - 5) Absolutely amazing! Game is worth the full price, felt bad buying at discount.			"

												Before stumbling across this series, I had not heard of telltale games.  In fact I was not sure what I was getting myself into when I bought the series.  It was one of those gotta have it, because it's Back to the Future.  I figured I'd play through it and it might be ok.  I will say that after looking into it a bit more I liked the idea that the Bobs atleast had somewhat of a hand in writing the story.  Overall, the series is a good one.  You'll get a good dose of characters you are familiar with, but they will also throw in some new ones.  As mentioned before Episode I relies heavily on the films, but for me that was a good thing.  I was very glad that Episode 1 eased me into the story.  I loved the films, and was hoping this game wasn't going to go and ruin them for me.  Thankfully it did not.  Episode 2-5 really distinguish themselves as breaking away from the film series, but do so in a way that carries on with story.  Overall am I happy with how everything turned out?  Yes.			"

												In terms of the game, I honestly did not expect much before I started playing. As a kid, I remember occasionally watching the Back to the Future movies as re-runs on TV, and, while I was not very enthralled with the series as it was before my time, this game made me reconsider. It plays like your standard point-and-click game, but I honestly felt like I was watching a ""new"" Back to the Future movie with all the twists and turns in the story and its epic moments (like seeing the punk who stole your girlfriend in an alternate timeline fall in the trashcan as he fails to replicate your awesome shredding on a guitar). The overarching boss of the game was a true pleasure to defeat and the story ended on a cliff-hanger that indicates to me that the series will continue at some point in the future... I honestly cannot wait till when it does so now.A definite recommendation from me.			"

												Although Back to the Future: The Game lacks the pinache of The Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us, etc. and the games that have come after, the game was fun in its own right. It's a very linear adventure game where you have to solve the puzzle in a very specific way to move the story forward. There's no story branching and while the game doesn't really have the same awe-factor as the movies, it still holds a charm of its own. The voice actor for Marty is pretty spot on for a Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd reprises his role as Doc Brown. The various versions of the characters you meet in the 1920s and the alternate realities of 1986 are interesting and unique. It's a nice trip back down nostalgia lane to have the crew of Back to the Future take you on one last ride.			"

												Wow, just completed this game.  I have to say that this was one of my favourite Telltale games so far and I've played them all.  So much nostagia, great storyline, lot's of tense moments and some good humour in there too.It is easily the most difficult Telltale games I've played, it isn't also so obvious what needs to be done which makes it more fun.  Unlike the new Telltale games there are no split second decision making elements in the game and no decisions that you make follow on through the game as each 'episode' is a different 'game' to load in your steam library but non the less I really enjoyed it!If you haven't bought it yet, look at the overwhelming praise for the game and buy it, you'll not regret it.  It also helps if you have watched the movies so you can follow unlining jokes and nostalgia			"

												My son and I just finished playing through the game.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the story - it was like watching Back to the Future part IV!  If you are in any way a fan of these wonderful movies, we recommend that you play all five episodes.  It was great just for the story alone.  As a kid who saw all three movies in the theater, it was a special treat for me.  I only wish I could have seen this in the theater as well, but this is the next best thing.  Thank you TellTale for a great story.  I now consider the story told in this game as part of the Back to the Future story.  Five Stars! Grade A+!			"

												Back to the Future: The Game does a stunning job of recapturing the feel and flavor of the film trilogy that inspired it. Despite lacking some of the functionality Telltale's become known for in later games, especially regards to consequence, BttF is a solid adventure experience through and through with only a few bits I found frustrating. Set (initially) in Prohibition-era Hill Valley, the bulk of Back to the Future: The Game is an exploration of Doc Brown's past, and how he became the eccentric genius scientist we know him as in the movies. After tracking down Doc following a journey gone a bit awry, Marty McFly's stuck juggling multiple eras of Doc and eventually having to deal with a much different Doc than he's used to. The consequences of minor changes are even more evident this time around than they were in the films, though the quests to fix those changes show a wide variety of Hill Valleys that were and could have been.First things first, I need to commend all the performers they got to fill the various roles. Marty McFly's voice actor is a dead ringer for 80's-era Michael J. Fox, and the rest of the familiar cast is well-represented. New characters abound without overwhelming familiar faces, and are all established firmly enough that you care about them, be it out of love or of loathing. It's nice that the game manages to give Marty's history some time in the spotlight as well, despite all the focus on Doc.Progress in the game is based primarily on conversation, working your way through options to figure out what's going on, what to do next, and how to get people to do what you need. There are several points where this can get tedious and/or unclear as to how to proceed, but those bits are few and far between, especially as you get into the later episodes. There's a bit of item collection and use, but it takes a back seat to the dialogue trees, which makes for a great showcase of Telltale's writing skill. Action sequences pop up from time to time as well, which add to the cinematic feel of the game but are also the weakest, gameplay-wise. Several times, I found myself going in circles trying to figure out how to finish an action sequence, only to find I was missing a single, relatively tiny (visually and figuratively) piece of the puzzle. I guess my best advice for these bits is to look up. Always look up.Other than that, Back to the Future: The Game is absolutely worth your time. A fitting tribute to the films, these five episodes could easily be considered canon if they aren't already.			"

I only recommend this game on sale to fans of the BTTF movies. It is a a bare bones point & click linear adventure game with many mildly infuriating components, but is a faithful 5 episode sequel to the BTTF movies.  You play as Marty McFly in 1985 which starts with an homage to the first movie, but takes place after the 3 movies.Cons::One track linear story: Your actions don't affect what happens in the story other than progressing it linearly and definitely do not carry over between episodes.  Choose Your Own Adventure books offer more choice.Dialog selection not consistent with voice acting: On a regular basis I select a dialog choice, and Marty says something that differs in tone and/or content from what I selected, as if voice script was rewritten after the dialog UI was setup.Movement limited between areas: In 1st episode movement is limited from the front of the courthouse to either side of the courthouse.Graphics same as lowest common ported denominator: Aside from antialiasing, I may as well have run the game on a Nintendo Wii.  Low poly counts on characters is a bad choice for such a character & dialog driven game.Episodes have separate settings and launchers: Ever change any of the game settings? Be prepared to change them for each new episode that you launch.  There is no central UI for accessing each of the episodes.Pros::Story and atmosphere: This is a story that fits the franchise well and has a number of nuanced details that fans will appreciate.Voice acting: Telltale found an impressive Fox soundalike actor and Christopher Lloyd's return is great, along with decent supporting voice acting.Hint system: Great for casual players.

												I bought this game years ago but just now getting around to leaving feedback on it. I love the Back to the Future trilogy, and this game is much like having a Back to the Future part 4. They even got Christopher Lloyd to voice the Doc, and the actress who played Jennifer in the first movie (Claudia Wells) voices her for this game. Michael J Fox also makes an appearance in the last episode, albeit a very brief one.The puzzles are way too simple for the most part, but the story kept me interested the whole way. I wouldn't mind a season 2. It's not as good as Telltale's more recent games but definitely a solid 7 for me.			"

												If you're a fan of Back to the Future, YOU NEED THIS GAME. SERIOUSLY!The gameplay is a bit annoying. While I did enjoy a couple of the puzzles because they were creative, I must say most of them were the dumbest thing I've ever seen. I've seen drunken psychopaths who came out of a wardrobe that leads to Middle Earth, because purple is their favorite number have more logic then these puzzles. However, the gameplay isn't really the selling point of this game, it is (of course) the story.I was literally grinning from start to finish in this game. The story definitely honors the movies and if you don't laugh or grin widely enough that you could be a creepy pasta character at least once per episode, well then shut up because you're lying.This game is easily worth the money just for the perfectly directed story.

The story line is hard to get into because the pace can get thrown off by small things. Once you get used to the enviroment and the game style the game has some good content. The music, visual, and character form are all well done. Recommended for BTTF fans,  and telltail gamers.			"

												This game is a must have for fans of the movie trilogy and just fans of these types of point and click games in general. It has quite a few flaws that i will detail below, but the good triumphs over the bad if the game is on sale. Good aspects:Detailed and well thought out story that links all five episodes together - Each story has logical and believable writing and execution in relation to the movies. The motives of the characters is similar to that of what was in the movies and it is told well enough.Great voice acting/dialogue/characters - the person portraying Marty sounds so similar to Mr. Fox in the movies that i kept on actually believing that it really was him doing his best vocal impression of himself at that young age. Christopher Lloyd was also a delight to listen to. As were the other lead characters for the most part. Nostalgia - The game nails it when it comes to bringing memories back from the movies,  referencing certain aspects of the three movies and just celebrating the most memorable lines, moments and scenes in the movie trilogy without over doing it. Bad aspects:Presentation/animation - The character renders and overall presentation is quite bad in comparison to other games that celebrate famous movies (such as Ghostbusters: The Video Game, which came out a year earlier and which looked well detailed and thorogh in its visual appearance snd actually lets you roam around freely with very few issues) Roaming around in the Hill Valley in this game can seem like somewhat of a chore at times with the limitations on where you can walk and the camera angles nearly impossoble to manouvere. That doesn't change whether you use the keyboard controls or your mouse. The design of Hill Valley looks decent enough, but the whole presentation and animations of the chatacters could have been way better if the right time and money was invested. Still, it was still ok and not game breaking for me. Graphically, the game doesn't look as if it reaches its potential.Choice-based gameplay being limited - The choices that they let your character make are very limiting and don't really add much to your path in the story because whichever options you pick, your character will ultimately go always go in the same path. That is because with the options they provide you during interaction with various characters, you almost always have to pick all of them to move forward in the story. For example, playing as Marty, as you're interacting with Doc Brown you need to find out a specific piece of information and are given four or more choices of questions or phrases you can ask/provide, but you have to ask pretty much all of them to get to where you need to so there isn't really a huge amount of choice involved in actuality.Overall, it is a very good game for what it is that would be most enjoyed if you're a fan of the movie series that could have been amazing if a little more time and money were invested into this. Probably not worth it for the full price, but is great value when on sale.However, if they released a sequel to this (whether in episodic format or otherwise), then i would definitely buy it especially if they fixed the flaws that were in this game.

												One fantastic video game based on ""Back to the future"". It brings back memories of good old times plus a ""new"" story.The story is fantastic and offers a spin-off to the original story. You're goal is simple: get back home - if only the timelines wouldn't shift and something unexpected happens. Explore the timeline and find your way back to 1986.The graphics are nice to look at, the animated sequences fun to watch; TellTale Games used professional voice actors for the characters, most of them from the original cast of BTTF.It's a point and click puzzle game, yet after playing it, it felt more like an interactive movie.Luckily I was able to play the 5 chapters in one go, otherwise I would have been desperately waiting for each sequel.This game gets 11/10.

												Another episodic game from Telltale. It'll take about 2-3hours, but i found it quite enjoyable compared to other point and clicks .Pro:It's Back to the Future!Visually appealing/colorfulThey actually have Christopher Llyod as a voice actor (from the movie)They have a hint system. It pretty much tells you what to do. It's great if you suck at these games Story is pretty good. The ending has a few issues/gripes, but otherwise it's pretty good.Con:It's easier than other point and clicksStill a good game with nice storytelling in a fantastic universe.

Its like the next movie i have always wanted. I highly recommend this game to any Back to the Future fans out there. The puzzles are tricky at times but you wont go mental trying to figure them out. any news of more of this from Telltale? i sure hope they do continue it as they say after the credits in ep 5!			"

												Having never seen the 'Back to the Future' movie franchise, I was unsure what to expect with this outing from Telltale. However, what ""Back to the Future: The Game"" delivers is a charming, humorous, and at times, gripping point & click adventure. If you have seen the original movies, then I'm sure the added references and familiar characters will be a bonus. Indeed, some of the original cast provide the voices for the characters, to add further authenticity. The game sees the player take on the role of the movies' protaganist, Marty McFly, as he and the eccentric, 'Doc' Brown experience misadventures in Marty's home town of Hill Valley, in different times and time-lines. The gameplay centres on solving multiple 'puzzles', by using the environment, collected items, and dialogue with a variety of in-game characters to progress the story. If you are a fan of Telltale's most recent 'Monkey Island' release, then you'll certainly be at home. If you are a fan of the movie franchise linked to the game, which is set following the events of the third movie, incidentally, then I can only assume that with excellent voice-acting delivery from some of the movies' original cast at the very least, you will consider this game a welcome addition to the franchise.

I will say that I think part 3 though 5 was probably the most addicting.  Part 1 just gives you a taste.  A quick tip - if you get stuck, try the in-game hints (sparingly) - sometimes you are just missing a small detail and these help.			"

												If you are a fan of the BTTF trilogy then you are doing yourself a disservice by not buying this game. It is obviously created with a lot of love and zeal for the series and all of the episodes were thoroughly enjoyable to the point where I did not want them to end. Took 2 hours to complete each episode so you can think of them as 5 brand new plots to add to the original three and they interweave fantastically as well as exploring some interesting new concepts for Marty and Doc to explore, Overall I would give the series as a whole a solid 9.5/10 for a fan of BTTF as it really captures the spirit of the films and has a wonderful art style whilst remaining really undemanding on the hardware seeing as how my laptop could run it at 4k with no dips from 60fps.

												This game is extremely faithful to the movies. The voice acting is spot on and always brilliant. There are so many references and the story goes completely out of control, in good way that is. Its just like the movies. Something gets changed in the past and completely screws up the future forcing you to go back and fix what went wrong. And of course, hijinks ensue. Any fan of Back to the Future MUST play this game because it lets you go even deeper into the chaos that this series is known for. The only thing I dont like about this game is that they never explain how the Delorean is still in one piece. Its a game/movie series about time travailing and time paradoxes so I guess thats how its supposed to be explained but they never even mention it.			"

												I really enjoy playing this game.  If you're a fan of Back to the Future, you will love it.  They stay true to the characters and fit the plot around the films.  The game is set after the third film and has a fantastic plotline which jumps between 1985 an 1931 - you play as Marty McFly trying to stop Doc from dying in the 1930s, but then obviously it gets more complicated (that's timetravel for you!)One thing to keep in mind is that you have basically no control over anything, unlike Telltale's later games like Walking Dead and TWAU.  Every choice you make is either meaningless, or a filler answer until you reach the one you need.  But that is my only critisism of the game, and apart from that, I loved everything!I would highly recommend this game for anybody who likes story-rich games, or just anybody who likes Back to the Future.  It's a lot of fun, a wonderful story, and an all round enjoyable game to play!  I really hope they make a second series at some point!			"

												Review of ""Episode 1: It's About Time""Pro: Keeps with the spirit of the BttF trilogy The fourth instalment you always wanted Amusing scenarios Christopher Lloyd Joypad supportCon: Controls are a teeny bit clunky Much clunkier when using joypad Intense sound track is a bit much when you're stuck on a puzzle More an Interactive Fiction than a Game as such (could be a pro as well!)""You built a time machine out of a De Lorean??"" The conversation between Marty McFly and 'Doc' Brown seems very familiar but something isn't quite right. And it ends up with our time travelling heroes getting stuck in Prohibition Era Hill Valley. Along the way they meet Marty's grandfather Arty, Principal Strickland's aunt, and a 17 year old Emmett Brown. The game is presented with lovely looking 3D cartoon graphics and a voice cast including Christopher Lloyd reprising his role as Doc Brown. The actor playing Marty totally nails the teenage Michael J. Fox voice too! The story is supervised by Bob Gale who co-wrote the films with Bob Zemeckis and, you know, it really does come off in the spirit of the films. (If perhaps on the fan service side of things.)The game plays out like most point-and-click adventure games. You move Marty around the environment and interact with specific elements or characters to move the story along. The philosophy for the game seems to be that the story is important above everything. In this regard, the puzzles are never overly difficult or distracting from the story. The player is never penalised for their actions which means you are free to go through all the character responses which are often amusing. To this end, Back to the Future: The Game ends up being a bit more interactive fiction than a game as such. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. The story and acting are engaging and you find that you want to move along as well.Playing the game isn't very different to many adventure games. I've always found the genre a bit clunky to move around in and while the developers at Telltale Games add a bit of polish to make the controls a bit forgiving, I find it's really an endemic fault of the genre. I was extremely pleased to find that there was gamepad support for the game and I could take advantage of Big Picture Mode. The gamepad is usable, and I used it for about half of the game, but it is also quite clunky to use.Probably the only thing that really bothered me about the game were the few intense scenes where the music swells up and scene gets busy. There is a sense of urgency in the scenario but because the adventure game is to some degree turn based it's difficult to satisfy that urgency. It becomes a little frustrating and you kind of want to turn all the sound off so you can concentrate on the puzzle you're supposed to be solving.Otherwise Back to the Future: The Game, Episode One is a delightful little game and I look forward to playing the subsequent instalments.

With the original writers of the series on the team, the game 100% fits in to the BTTF canon set after the third film with many little subtle nods to things in the trilogy, and Chris Lloyd  the original doc reprises his role in voice form.Very funny and surprisingly well written, I would say the only downside is it's very easy for a TellTale point and click, you won't get stuck really, but this is more so aimed at the fans, good at games or not.

Story: Without running into spoiler land I will give you a brief idea of how this story goes. It takes place seven months after the end of the trilogy. This plays into what happens with life after the last movie. Marty is home and Doc is still in the past. Marty, sad at the loss of his friend to time is suddenly interuppted when the DeLorean suddenly appears and Marty is thrust into another adventure.Appearance: As with many Telltale games this has a cartoon like design. The design is initially off putting with how the movies appear but in no time the art style grows on you. The atmosphere is perfect and captures not only the feel but the over themes of the BTTF movies. This is a perfect continuation.Gameplay: This is a standard point and click adventure. It has a pretty standard 90's P&C feel to it to a fault. It has many of the issues that plagued those games. Issues getting characters to move properly or collision detection. Over all the game feels well done and is really a joy to play.Achievements: The only achievement this game came with is having a wonderful time playing the game. The story is reward enough for that.Bottom Line: This game is such a great deal of fun I regret not playing it sooner. Not only is it the perfect game for a BTTF fan but its a great point and click adventure. Each episode will run you about 2 hours of gameplay for a total 10 hours of gameplay. I picked this up when it was on sale and I would even go so far as to recommend that its even worth the full price. Pick this up at your next chance and give it a go.			"

												This game is really Really REALLY GOOD!!!Even though the gameplay in this game is not good as in TWD, TWUA or any other Telltale games.But story in the game is so close to the spirit of the BTTF Trilogy.I would say this game was the first step towards games that Telltale is producing right now.Buy this game if you are fan of the BTTF or games of the Telltale.P.S. That ending though... Huh? I hope they will make BTTF Season 2 in the near Future. "

												A great addition to the Back to the Future series. Sure it has it's problems and the story can get a little silly at times, but this perfectly captures the tone and chemistry from the movies. The guy they got for Marty is perfect, It's hard to believe it's not MJF. Lloyd comes back to play Doc and does a great job. Even if you're not an adventure game player, I'd still recommed it for the story. I'd never played an advenure game before and I got into it.			"

												I decided to go and play this after playing some of Telltales newer games (Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us, Game of Thrones and Tales from the Borderlands). I found the animation to have resemblences and similarities in cartoonish/comic book style to some of the later games. The dialog is a bit more basic than Walking Dead etc, in regards to the responsive and consequences in the situation. The story was flawed in some ways and a little ridiculous in others. It was however enjoyable. The characters had good arcs and grew on you. The light-hearted atmosphere added to the enjoyment and setting the game gave you. The gameplay was sometime a little repetitive but the game/episodes were the right length that it didn't really matter. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys Telltale adventure games, Point and click games, Back to the Future, sci-fi and story based games. 6.5/10			"

												Great Scott! This game is amazing: great story, true to movies, amazing art direction, it has well written characters, a surpisingly intriguing antagonist and amazing voice-work. The story continues right where Back To The Future part 3 ends, with new adventures and new time periods that neatly fold into a great over-arching story. Folks who love Back to the future trilogy and everyone else who loves Sci-Fi stories will feel right back at home!There are a few downsides, such as low-quality sound effects and voices that appear from time to time, and some of the puzzles seem like a chore, but overall it's a breath-taking adventure game that will put a smile on your face and you won't be able to put that grin away, not until you finish the game :D Two thumb up!!!

												Telltale Games one of their first finest work!It might not be Telltale Games first developed title but, I was pleasantly surprised by this ""Back to the Future: The Game"" episodic series. It follows the adventures of the good ol' Doc Emmett Brown and his good friend, Marty McFly. It's not truly mandatory to have seen the movies BUT, it really helps to have background information of the movies. To put it short, this adventure game has a new story set after BttF Part 3 movie (it could be seen as a BttF Part 4). It ends with a possibility for more content so whether or not it becomes another episodic season or a new movie, but this season/series ended in 2011 so not sure if a sequel is likely... we shall see...The episodic format takes you about 3 to 4 hours for each episode to complete. If you skip conversations and if you use or not, the hint system, the game can be shorter or longer.PROS:+Funny, goofy... just like the movies!+Familiar setting with the visuals, voice cast, music.+Interesting story. It could almost be interpreted as Back to the Future: Part 4.+Hints mechanic to help you if you are being stuck.+Stong voice acting skills of the actors.+Christopher Lloyd voice acting his movie character, Doc Brown. Micheal J. Fox appeared for the final episode!CONS:-Filler between episodes: Seems to drag between later episodes.-Technical issues: Each time I started a new episode, the game kept crashing until a game restart and then another restart once the settings were changed.-Puzzles are somewhat easy but the HUD elements makes it hard at times to see where you have to click and is bothersome.OVERALL:A good adventure game. Not the best of Telltale Games and you cannot compare this to their ""The Walking Dead"" masterpiece series but I quite enjoyed this Back to the Future: The Game series.RECOMMENDATION:If you liked BttF movies and you like point & click adventure, goofy-funny games, you should really enjoy this BttF: The Game. You may want to wait for a sale though... as I did!Just remember... it is not mandatory to have seen the movies BUT it really helps that you do! I watched the three movies just before starting this game and let me tell you that I would have been lost since it was so long ago! At least, read the synopsis of the movies before playing this game or you may feel lost here and there!RATING:7.0 / 10			"

												The good: Great if you're a fan of the original BTTF movie Trilogy, and a helluva lot better than those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ LJN-made NES games. Characters stay faithful to themselves, and EPIC PLOT TWISTS. Also, made by telltale games, the same people who made great point and click adventure games like Sam & Max season 1-3, Strong Bad's Cool Game For Attractive People, and, of course, Poker Night At the Inventory.The bad: Repetitive voice acting, what you're supossed to do can get confusing from time to time, and not a whole lot of freedom to explore. But don't let any of this get in the way as you put yourself in the shoes of the time traveller Marty McFly.Overall: I recommend, especially for those who were actually alive in the 80's and saw all 3 movies back when they were released in theatres (unlike me) "

												If you're a fan of the movie, you're going to love this.Back to the Future the game is everything that you hope it to be and a little bit more. Learning more about the little town of Hill Valley and the pasts, and futures, of the characters fans have come to love. Like all Telltale games you'll find yourself asking a lot of questions, all of which get answered in a timely fashion (pun intended). The delivery of the story is executed extraordinarily well, making you feel something a little different with each episode and leaving you on enough of a cliff hanger that will only make you want to play the next. I guarantee the whole experience will leave you feeling nostalgic and thoroughly satisfied. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Back to the Future. Without question, it is a game that every fan should play. If you've never seen the movie, now is the time to become a fan, so that you can play this well developed and charming game. I rate it a 9.6 out of 10.			"

												I really enjoy playing this game.  If you're a fan of Back to the Future, you will love it.  They stay true to the characters and fit the plot around the films.  The game is set after the third film and has a fantastic plotline which jumps between 1985 an 1931 - you play as Marty McFly trying to stop Doc from dying in the 1930s, but then obviously it gets more complicated (that's timetravel for you!)One thing to keep in mind is that you have basically no control over anything, unlike Telltale's later games like Walking Dead and TWAU.  Every choice you make is either meaningless, or a filler answer until you reach the one you need.  But that is my only critisism of the game, and apart from that, I loved everything!I would highly recommend this game for anybody who likes story-rich games, or just anybody who likes Back to the Future.  It's a lot of fun, a wonderful story, and an all round enjoyable game to play!  I really hope they make a second series at some point!			"

												If you're a fan of Back to the Future, YOU NEED THIS GAME. SERIOUSLY!The gameplay is a bit annoying. While I did enjoy a couple of the puzzles because they were creative, I must say most of them were the dumbest thing I've ever seen. I've seen drunken psychopaths who came out of a wardrobe that leads to Middle Earth, because purple is their favorite number have more logic then these puzzles. However, the gameplay isn't really the selling point of this game, it is (of course) the story.I was literally grinning from start to finish in this game. The story definitely honors the movies and if you don't laugh or grin widely enough that you could be a creepy pasta character at least once per episode, well then shut up because you're lying.This game is easily worth the money just for the perfectly directed story. BACK TO THE FUTURE FANS REJOICE!			"

												I bought this a while ago and now I took the time to play it. This is great stuff! If you like the original movies, you are at the right spot and will love all the references and a continued story. The graphics are fun and the motion capture is so well done that it really catches all the details you know from the original characters. The voice acting is simply awsome (sogar auf Deutsch wurden die Originalstimmen benutzt!) and during the cut scenes I sometimes forgot for a few moments that this is just a game and not an animated movie.If you don't know the movies, sometimes it is probably difficult to keep up, but still a fun game!The puzzles are well balanced and usually work without using the hint system. I would call this intermediate complexity.Recommendation? YES YES YES!!!			"

												As the millennial age broadened gaming to a wider audience, more and more big franchises from the 80's and early 90's began to adapt themselves in bigger budgeted games.  When news of a Back to the Future adventure game created by Telltale surfaced, there was an explosion of fan interest into how it would turn out. They were not disappointed.The story takes place after the movie. Marty goes back in time to rescue Doc Brown, who landed himself in jail in 1931. During this inital event, he comes across many past characters of Hill Valley, including a young Doc Brown. As the story progesses, both Marty and Doc travel back and forth through time to fix an even greater mess on the timeline then the one in Back to the Future II. Needless to say, it gets heavy.Very few of the movie's original cast returns, which is a shame. While the voice actors perform wonderfully, it is obvious that they are filling in for who didn't return. The exception is the voice actor for Marty, who is so convincing that many fans won't notice if not told out-right. It's his performance that make this game feel like a direct continuation of the movie.The game isn't as polished or long as more recent Telltale Games such as The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us, so adventure game fans won't find much challenge. There is, however, just enough content to satisfy any fan of the series and is very well worth a purchase.			"

												Anyone wanting the next installment of back to the future... Here it is... granted there are a few timeline issues and so forth here, however the developers of this series are clearly big fans of the movies... The episodes feel authentic, inline with the movies and being a huge fan of the movies it felt like I was apart of the next movie in the sequence... It took a few hours an episode and some seemed to drag along, however in the movies were similar (Hence why I think the developer is a fan)... This series is great for people wanting more ""Back to the Future"" it follows a timeline after the 3rd  movie and enough references to movies and pop culture (of the time period) interested... not sure if the younger generation will get it... However as stated earlier any fan of the movies this is a must 9/10../			"

												If you are a fan of the BTTF trilogy then you are doing yourself a disservice by not buying this game. It is obviously created with a lot of love and zeal for the series and all of the episodes were thoroughly enjoyable to the point where I did not want them to end. Took 2 hours to complete each episode so you can think of them as 5 brand new plots to add to the original three and they interweave fantastically as well as exploring some interesting new concepts for Marty and Doc to explore, Overall I would give the series as a whole a solid 9.5/10 for a fan of BTTF as it really captures the spirit of the films and has a wonderful art style whilst remaining really undemanding on the hardware seeing as how my laptop could run it at 4k with no dips from 60fps.

												Review of ""Episode 1: It's About Time""Pro: Keeps with the spirit of the BttF trilogy The fourth instalment you always wanted Amusing scenarios Christopher Lloyd Joypad supportCon: Controls are a teeny bit clunky Much clunkier when using joypad Intense sound track is a bit much when you're stuck on a puzzle More an Interactive Fiction than a Game as such (could be a pro as well!)""You built a time machine out of a De Lorean??"" The conversation between Marty McFly and 'Doc' Brown seems very familiar but something isn't quite right. And it ends up with our time travelling heroes getting stuck in Prohibition Era Hill Valley. Along the way they meet Marty's grandfather Arty, Principal Strickland's aunt, and a 17 year old Emmett Brown. The game is presented with lovely looking 3D cartoon graphics and a voice cast including Christopher Lloyd reprising his role as Doc Brown. The actor playing Marty totally nails the teenage Michael J. Fox voice too! The story is supervised by Bob Gale who co-wrote the films with Bob Zemeckis and, you know, it really does come off in the spirit of the films. (If perhaps on the fan service side of things.)The game plays out like most point-and-click adventure games. You move Marty around the environment and interact with specific elements or characters to move the story along. The philosophy for the game seems to be that the story is important above everything. In this regard, the puzzles are never overly difficult or distracting from the story. The player is never penalised for their actions which means you are free to go through all the character responses which are often amusing. To this end, Back to the Future: The Game ends up being a bit more interactive fiction than a game as such. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. The story and acting are engaging and you find that you want to move along as well.Playing the game isn't very different to many adventure games. I've always found the genre a bit clunky to move around in and while the developers at Telltale Games add a bit of polish to make the controls a bit forgiving, I find it's really an endemic fault of the genre. I was extremely pleased to find that there was gamepad support for the game and I could take advantage of Big Picture Mode. The gamepad is usable, and I used it for about half of the game, but it is also quite clunky to use.Probably the only thing that really bothered me about the game were the few intense scenes where the music swells up and scene gets busy. There is a sense of urgency in the scenario but because the adventure game is to some degree turn based it's difficult to satisfy that urgency. It becomes a little frustrating and you kind of want to turn all the sound off so you can concentrate on the puzzle you're supposed to be solving.Otherwise Back to the Future: The Game, Episode One is a delightful little game and I look forward to playing the subsequent instalments.

The story continues right where Back To The Future part 3 ends, with new adventures and new time periods that neatly fold into a great over-arching story. Folks who love Back to the future trilogy and everyone else who loves Sci-Fi stories will feel right back at home!There are a few downsides, such as low-quality sound effects and voices that appear from time to time, and some of the puzzles seem like a chore, but overall it's a breath-taking adventure game that will put a smile on your face and you won't be able to put that grin away, not until you finish the game :D Two thumb up!!!

												Before Telltale games really 'got Adventure Games right for the modern age' with The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us there was this.A funny, easy collection of warped-logic puzzles along with a new setting, plenty of voice talent from Christopher Lloyd, cameo from Michael J Fox, and the writing talent of Bob Gale it's an ideal extension of the original film trilogy that deserves more promotion than it got.Although it may have worked better to be dragged along for the ride as a standalone animated film this title is entertaining enough to be worth the couple of dollars asked for it - even if the linear chapters don't leave you on the edge of your seat.Is it well packaged? Not exactly. Is it perfect? I wouldn't say that. Is it recommended? Absolutely.			"

												With Telltale's impending release of their new Jurassic Park game, I couldn't help but debate if it would be a worthwhile purchase. Trying to grasp a better understanding of how their new product ""feels"", I thought it best to extrapolate from older games in their library and this is where Back to the Future: The Game comes in.As the first Telltale game I've ever beaten in its entirety, the best way to describe my feelings after the long journey is a simple, ""satisfied"". Far away is this game from horrible, but neither is it groundbreaking.As can be inferred by the developer's name, Telltale's work heavily centers on telling a story. They undeniably did a fantastic job with the plot. Prior to playing this, I watched all three (excellent) movies, hoping that the game might reward me for it. And it did. There are plenty references sprinkled throughout, enough to make any fan happy and prove its faithfulness to its predecessors.Grade: (Continued in Episode 2's recommendation)			"

												suprisingly goodi half heartedly installed this game expecting the usual slow nice gameplay of point and click adventure games, with the usual frustrations. but this was different;1-the graphics exceeded my expectations, they're really good, beyond what i see from similar games2-the hinting system is a perfect balance between not spoiling the game and not having you look up walkthroughs online every few minutes(ahem, sam and max). you can have a general hint, then a heavy hint, then it tells you what to do(all accesed manually)3-the gameplay is fairly linear if you want to finish quickly, but offers a lot of exploration if you want to go around.4-character design is unique and spectacular, they are rememberable and believable.5-it's a classic, i didn't watch the original movie, which is a historical landmark in movies.3-the story is actually very very well written, it will captivate you, which is why;I highly reccomend you play the episodes in seccession, it's hard to pick up from where you last left off if it was a long time ago.

												A fun little journey back in time to the  Back to the Future  franchise. Nostalgia along with a new story was fun, but other than a few lines of potentially missed dialogue and a desire to relive the story at some point in time, there's not much by way of replay value.Overall, I enjoyed the game.

												it is like Sam and Max (also made by Telltale), but it empasizes more on the story. Sam and Max was less about the story but more about humor mixed in with puzzles. If you liked Sam and Max and are looking for something similar you should play this game. If you just want a game with a good story and don't want to get to distracted by all the puzzles (which slow down the story) I would recommend The Walking dead of The wolf amongst us.			"

												A little rough around the edges  but having Bob Gale write the story just shows the quality in the story. The game to me felt like I was right in a new Back To The Future movie. Great Voice Acting and pretty everything that needs to be good , was. However if your NOT a fan of Back To The Future I wouldnt recommend it considering the story is the biggest part of the game for me and the universe in general.			"

												In my opinion this is a really good game from Telltale Games, the story fits the spirit of the movies, and will please most of the players, except the one that prefer action over narration, because that's what it is, an interactive story like The Walking Dead and some others, but the line you'll pick during dialogue won't have any impact in the progress of the game and that is the sad part otherwise the game is great and enjoyable.7/10			"

												A surprisingly fun game, even though I'm not the biggest fan of point-and-click adventure games. The plot is silly at times, but fun nonetheless, and the characters are interesting.I felt a little confined as all five games mostly revolve around one square in town in different timelines and there wasn't that many secondary interactive elements, plus you aren't given any real choices. However, the dialogs are complex enough and puzzles are diverse enough to keep you interested.From the technical point of view, it's mediocre. Voice acting is good, graphics and animation are outdated, camera control is terrible. I mean, it'll easily win the contest for the most messed up camera - you'll find camera switching between three views from completely different directions when you move mouse cursor and the main character looks in different directions. Controller is pretty much unusable as it's close to impossible to click precisely.Overall, if you're a fan of Back to the Future even in a slightest, you don't want to miss the game, but it does have some rough edges.

												5 short episodes (less than 2 hours each) which is much more interesting as a parallel story - specially if you are a fan of the saga - than as a videogame itself.The graphics are quite ok, and the dialogues have some brilliant lines.That said, the game seems to be a graphic adventure for dummies. Very few, if any, of the puzzles will need a second thought, and even if you get stuck there are several hints just in case.Pros: nice story.Cons: as easy as abc.			"

												Don't be fooled by my playtime, I also played this on consoles.You can't go wrong when Telltale Games and the very same writers from Back to the Future team up to make a game that easily could be a BTTF 4 movie.If you love adventure games, BTTF or both, this game is a must.One could argue Marty moves slow even when running and the inventory management could be better but as you play those things doesn't get too annoying.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review ANOTHER DISCLAIMER: Back to the Future: The Game has five episodes which are split seperately and are downloaded one by one, thus reviews are more or less the same as the gameplay mechanics are basically the same in all five episodes. So please think before commenting about the similarity in the reviews Back to the Future: The Game is an episodic adventure game with five episodes, developed and published by Telltale Games, the same people behind other such great adventure games as The Wolf Among Us and Game of Thrones. The game is based on the film series of the same nameAlthough the game does not follow the same exact storyline as the first film, it follows the same universe as Back to the Future follows only seeing it in a different point of viewAs mentioned previously, the game is split up into five episodes. The game works as a normal television series. Each length of an episode is roughly one hour longThe gameplay is very simple, you move around, selecting stuff and talking to people and using button prompts when told to. Choices don't really matter as to other Telltale GamesThe game's graphics are okay for the most part however there are some ugly texture work here and there. The sound and music options also vary in quality. Sometimes the sound quality is really good and sometimes the sound quality is bad. I have encountered numerous amounts of glitches which seems as if Telltale Games never got round to fixing them, too many to mention in this reviewTelltale's Back to the Future: The Game pays a good homage to the Back to the Future film series and is definitely better than Jurassic Park: The Game which is another Universal Pictures license RECOMMENDED :)  "

												I am biased to telltail games in a negative way. That being said, I liked this game for it's content. The voices arin't perfect but there good, the graphics are cartoony yet well modeled. The story line is hard to get into because the pace can get thrown off by small things. Once you get used to the enviroment and the game style the game has some good content. The music, visual, and character form are all well done. Recommended for BTTF fans,  and telltail gamers.			"

												I really enjoy playing this game.  If you're a fan of Back to the Future, you will love it.  They stay true to the characters and fit the plot around the films.  The game is set after the third film and has a fantastic plotline which jumps between 1985 an 1931 - you play as Marty McFly trying to stop Doc from dying in the 1930s, but then obviously it gets more complicated (that's timetravel for you!)One thing to keep in mind is that you have basically no control over anything, unlike Telltale's later games like Walking Dead and TWAU.  Every choice you make is either meaningless, or a filler answer until you reach the one you need.  But that is my only critisism of the game, and apart from that, I loved everything!I would highly recommend this game for anybody who likes story-rich games, or just anybody who likes Back to the Future.  It's a lot of fun, a wonderful story, and an all round enjoyable game to play!  I really hope they make a second series at some point!			"

												As the millennial age broadened gaming to a wider audience, more and more big franchises from the 80's and early 90's began to adapt themselves in bigger budgeted games.  When news of a Back to the Future adventure game created by Telltale surfaced, there was an explosion of fan interest into how it would turn out. They were not disappointed.The story takes place after the movie. Marty goes back in time to rescue Doc Brown, who landed himself in jail in 1931. During this inital event, he comes across many past characters of Hill Valley, including a young Doc Brown. As the story progesses, both Marty and Doc travel back and forth through time to fix an even greater mess on the timeline then the one in Back to the Future II. Needless to say, it gets heavy.Very few of the movie's original cast returns, which is a shame. While the voice actors perform wonderfully, it is obvious that they are filling in for who didn't return. The exception is the voice actor for Marty, who is so convincing that many fans won't notice if not told out-right. It's his performance that make this game feel like a direct continuation of the movie.The game isn't as polished or long as more recent Telltale Games such as The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us, so adventure game fans won't find much challenge. There is, however, just enough content to satisfy any fan of the series and is very well worth a purchase.			"

												I am a big fan of the Back to the Future movies, so when I saw this game, I couldn't help but play it.  Back to the Future: The Game contains five games (or episodes) that take place 6 months after the movies.  It has a compelling storyline that kept me wanting to finish the game.  I also liked the cartoony style that TellTale brought to the table.  For all you Back to the Future fans this game is for you.  If you like strategy games or adventure games, this game is for you.  My only complaint, is that the camera angles sometimes make the gameplay difficult.  Other than that, this game was better than I expected it to be.			"

												Another good game from Telltale, plays pretty much like you'd expect from a Telltale game but is done farily well and feels like Back to the Future the whole way through. The story takes place after the three movies and references them a lot and while I don't think you'd need to see them to enjoy the game it certainly adds to the experience if you have. The voice acting is pretty good with Christopher Lloyd voicing Doc, and while Michael J. Fox doesn't voice Marty the actor that does did a good job staying true to the character.If you liked the movies and want to see more then the game is definitely worth checking out.			"

												As a MASSIVE fan of BTTF I can only recommend this game, as once again Tell Tale have done what they do so well by continuing the story without altering the characters or the general ideas of the original trilogy. Voice acting is performed by Christopher Lloyd himself, so the Doc sounds true as the movies. Shame Marty isn't voiced by Micheal J Fox, although he does make an appereance in the final episode.My only gripe with this game is the fact that it comes in the form of 5 seperatly installed episodes, but this really is nit-picking as due to the way they were released over time this can't really be helped.For BTTF fans I simply can't recommend this game enough.

												It really has the spirit of the films down pat. It has a unique style of gamplay. The puzzles are sensical, yet challenging. I really have to give credit to the voice actor for Marty, he sounds really damn close to what he sounded like in the films, despite being a different person. The only thing that somewhat annoys is the fact that the story really only makes sense if you've watched the movies. It makes sense, though. 420/69 -IGN			"

												I like this - a bit of old school ""point & click"" gaming. Some decent voice acting (always helps not to get distracted by poor dialogue) and an interesting time travel story. Fairly linear, particularly as the game is split into 5 chapters, although that's not necessarily a bad thing. Occasionally there are too many dialogue options to work through to move the story along but that's just a minor irritant. Well worth a look especially if at a sale price.			"

												If you are a BTTF fan, this will be a fun game.  Each of the 4 episosed takes about 2 hours to complete depending on how often yu find your self using the in game help system vs just trying to figure it out on yuor own. I got this on a sale, totaly worth it, at full price I am not sure $20 for ~20 huors of game play is worth it.  But while its on sale, just get it, itll be worth yuor time.			"

												It's painfully short, but that's to be expected for an episodic game.  It really does feel true to the source material.  The humor is genuinely funny, though the setting takes a while to get used to.  Most of the voice actors are dead on.  The puzzles themselves are pretty simple, or they should be if you can pick up on some patterns.  Overall, I get the impression that this series will be worth the money.  My only regret is the lack of TF2 hat.  I mean can you imagine the possibilities?  A delorean themed hat would be awesome.  And you could give it the description ""When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're going to see some serious crit"" I mean how could anyone pass that up?			"

As far as I've noticed, there isn't any real way to ""lose"" the game since you're just walking around, clicking objects and talking to people. Clever voice acting and dialog throughout all five episodes! I really enjoyed playing through it and I'm sure any fan of the movies would enjoy it, too.			"

												Dear Reader,I watched the trilogy in airplane and played the game (all 5 episodes for 15 hours) throughout my Holiday on Maldives.Cons: TellTale - they tell the story though your choices don't affect the ending or whatever.Sometimes you feel that the story was made longer for more episodes.Pros: TellTale do tell an interesting story that adds a lot of content to the ""Back To The Future Trilogy"" Which I was a hell of a series. Also the story has many fun jokes and many interesting choices (in case of fun, not story itself - lookup *Cons*). Though prolonged story is not always good, but they did tie all the ends together. The overall ending doesn't state the universe to be finished, so you can work at whatever next episode or TV series you want.The Voice acting of heroes is done by the actors from Films.The music will bring you back to the 21st of October 2015 :3Overall - 9/10			"

												So 10/21/2015 was just here a few days ago, and I had to dive into this game again, just cause f***ing BTTF is amazing. As for the actually games, it's a price that is worth for all 5 episodes! The story is very original, creative, and ties in well with the movie franchise for where it left off on Part III!Using Telltale Games' gaming engine to incorpurate a very beautiful and emersive world (along with the choice making we all know and love from their games), it brings in for a very amazing and delightful gaming experience! If your looking into experiencing a story that will tie in into being a legitimate plot or a 4th film (even if it will never come out), this is the closest you can get for Part IV, maybe even better than how the original 3 movies were plotted out!Just play it!

												Back to the Future: The Game does a stunning job of recapturing the feel and flavor of the film trilogy that inspired it. Despite lacking some of the functionality Telltale's become known for in later games, especially regards to consequence, BttF is a solid adventure experience through and through with only a few bits I found frustrating. Set (initially) in Prohibition-era Hill Valley, the bulk of Back to the Future: The Game is an exploration of Doc Brown's past, and how he became the eccentric genius scientist we know him as in the movies. After tracking down Doc following a journey gone a bit awry, Marty McFly's stuck juggling multiple eras of Doc and eventually having to deal with a much different Doc than he's used to. The consequences of minor changes are even more evident this time around than they were in the films, though the quests to fix those changes show a wide variety of Hill Valleys that were and could have been.First things first, I need to commend all the performers they got to fill the various roles. Marty McFly's voice actor is a dead ringer for 80's-era Michael J. Fox, and the rest of the familiar cast is well-represented. New characters abound without overwhelming familiar faces, and are all established firmly enough that you care about them, be it out of love or of loathing. It's nice that the game manages to give Marty's history some time in the spotlight as well, despite all the focus on Doc.Progress in the game is based primarily on conversation, working your way through options to figure out what's going on, what to do next, and how to get people to do what you need. There are several points where this can get tedious and/or unclear as to how to proceed, but those bits are few and far between, especially as you get into the later episodes. There's a bit of item collection and use, but it takes a back seat to the dialogue trees, which makes for a great showcase of Telltale's writing skill. Action sequences pop up from time to time as well, which add to the cinematic feel of the game but are also the weakest, gameplay-wise. Several times, I found myself going in circles trying to figure out how to finish an action sequence, only to find I was missing a single, relatively tiny (visually and figuratively) piece of the puzzle. I guess my best advice for these bits is to look up. Always look up.Other than that, Back to the Future: The Game is absolutely worth your time. A fitting tribute to the films, these five episodes could easily be considered canon if they aren't already.			"

For the first 30 minutes or so you do about nothing, and it seems to continue on throughout the entire game.

It's funny and has a good story that stays true to the Back to the Future movies.  I couldn't not help myself to push the hint button a few times because some puzzles were challenging.I had a good laugh a few times and could't help smilling when I saw the overboard in last episode !

The voice acting of Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown is phenomenal while A.J LoCascio also does great voice work for Marty McFly. His voice was very identical to Michael J. Fox. This game was such a pleasure to play and the plotline will get you hooked. I found myself blowing through all the episodes just to see what would happen next. The only downside to the game is that I had a few issues controlling Marty with the WASD keys. This is definitely a TellTale game for nostalgic fans of the Back to the Future movies and for newcomers to the series.			"

												There are two ways to look at this game. One way is if your a fan of Telltale games. The other is if you are a back to the future fan. In this case, I am the later half. Telltale perspective: I have played their more well know games such as TWD (both seasons) and The Wolf Among us. Both of which felt a little more creative. The Game also took me about 10 hours which seemed a little short for their games. The one thing that stuck out the most was that if you played their other games, get ready for a change, granted this is one of the first game like TWD or any such, so do cut it some slack.Back to the Future Perspective: Let me start off by saying I LOVE these movies (yes, even part 3). Had they decided to make a part 4, this would have worked in my opinion. They refrence the movies through out the episodes and try to stay true to everyones personalities in them. I was also surprised to see Christopher Lloyd play Doc Brown throught the whole game and see Micheal J. Fox play William Mcfly (Marty's Great grandpa). They even got Tom Wilson to voice Biff on home consoles. How ever there were a fair share of things that couldve been fixed/ would be nice but not need to fix. (No spoilers) The end of episode 5 completly falls apart and then leaves it on a cliff hanger most notably.There is rumor that the sequal is being made, but is bottem on the priority list, but hopefully Telltale will publish it soon.Overall, I would say definitly try it your a BttF fan, even if you dont like it, you'll probably like some of the refrences to the movies. It certainly beats BttF on NES. Its a maybe for you Telltale fans, like I said, this was the first of their style of games. But regarless of what you think, where you're going, you dont need roads			"

												NO SPOILERSThe game is very linear and has no actuall choices for you to go with, your choices are just talking and offers no real difference to the storyline (unlike in The Walking Dead). Past that it is more of a puzzle game than anything.If you like difficult challanges and a good storyline to go along with then, then I would suggest still picking it up. Just don't expect The Walking Dead out of it :) Very difficult at some points and pretty fun.Episode one is a tad bit boring. Starts off rather slow, but it lets you get to know the characters and their stories.Episode two however! That's where it picks up! Left on a cliffhanger, but I have to know what happens next! Don't get discuraged by episode one! Keep playing, it's worth it :3Episode three bleeds into episode four. It gets sooooo much better at this point. I am now addicted and needs to know what happened. Especially with a cliffhanger ending?! So worth it!Episode four is quite a lot longer and more story driven than anything, though it's harder to get through this one without getting caught up on a lot of things with items and the like. Not my favorite but not terrible either.Episode five is the best by a long shot. Went by way to quick even though it took me 2 hours to get through everything. Awesome ending. Overall, best episode!			"

												My son and I just finished playing through the game.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the story - it was like watching Back to the Future part IV!  If you are in any way a fan of these wonderful movies, we recommend that you play all five episodes.  It was great just for the story alone.  As a kid who saw all three movies in the theater, it was a special treat for me.  I only wish I could have seen this in the theater as well, but this is the next best thing.  Thank you TellTale for a great story.  I now consider the story told in this game as part of the Back to the Future story.  Five Stars! Grade A+!			"

												Date: 2/13/16Review Number: 16 (Bank Review #2)Game: Back to the Future Episode 1From (Creator Publisher): Telltale GamesPlayed On: Steambox (Steam Controller)Steam Price as of Review:Total Time played: 2+ Hours (Wife observing for all of it)Review:For the second review of the vacation, I decided to do something else a bit different.   Now a bit of personal info here, I am married (have been for a decade) and my wife, though not exactly crazy about video games, does enjoy a round or two of some games in my collection.  After she was finished with a round, and since there was nothing on TV, I decided to take over for a round.  Looking through a collection for something we both would enjoy, my choice was quickly overridden when my wife noticed that I had a Back to the Future adventure game.  So we took the time to fire up Telltale Game’s Back to the Future episode 1, a point and click adventure game with so many of the original cast and staff involved that it might as well be considered a sequel of sorts, though granted some thirty years afterwards.  And sequel this very well could be; the writing is superb, the voices so on par, with many of the original characters playing themselves (sans the main character, though Michael J Fox does do some cameo appearances as the non-1985-prime McFly family) this is in many ways a continuation of the Back to the Future series that works well in-canon.  The graphics are pretty, and the animations are fantastic.  The controls are fantastic, and work surprisingly well with the Steam Gamepad.  The only part of the interface that I thought was a little odd was the inventory screen, but even with that, I found that the game parts of the game were so unobtrusive that I could often just ‘go through the motions’ of playing the game and feel like I was just watching a movie.  Indeed, if someone is looking for a more robust ‘adventure’ game, they may find this game somewhat lacking for that reason. Even with a  lot of interactable objects in each area, the game still feels like you only head in one direction, moving along a very specific course with interactable objects proving just a bit of flair.  In the end though, this game is a beautiful continuation of a fantastic movie series, and I fully intend to play this all the way through to it's conclusion. Anyone who loves the movies, or loves point and click adventure games, will eat this up.  Buy buy buy! Game’s Fate: Kept on the Steambox, will occasionally play itBuy/No Buy: If you like point and click adventure games, this one isn’t necessarily the most difficult or engaging, but it's enjoyable enough, and fans of the movies will love them.  Buy. "

												It's nice to see a well-crafted point-and-click adventure game of the old-school released every once in a while.  BTTF is one such, bringing together the ridiculous humour of the Telltale gang, a great soundtrack based on the original movies' songs, and fantastic voice acting (though it helps when you get Christoper Lloyd to play Doc again!).  Though while it's entirely worth the $25 price tag ($5 per episode), it's one that I would put on the back burner until there's a good sale on it (that's what I did and usually do anyway).			"

												Going ""Back To The Future"" with these episodes was totally an adventure that I thoroughly enjoyed. The style and gameplay is outstanding and keeps you wanting more of the story. Its a tough one to stop playing. Each episode lasts for about 2 hours on average. There is a hint system that really helps when your in a jam and don't know what to do or were to go. I totally loved the hint feature it helped me out a ton. The story is a must see for anyone that loved the movies of Back To the Future.The images with the story don't shy away from the heart of the movies, they have kept the attitudes and feelings of the original movie. The voice acting is incredible and lets the main actors from the movies to play roles in these great episodes. This is a Telltales game not to pass up if you like clicking games and a great story. I have very much loved playing this series and I know you will too if you loved the movies. Come ""Back To The Future"" with this awesome series!			"

												An excellent continuation of the Back to the Future series, featuring Christopher Lloyd as Doc, an excellent Marty McFly soundalike, and even Michael J. Fox as Marty's great grandfather William.  If you thought Biff Tannen's Hell Valley was bad, wait until you see what's in store here.  Also, the game can't decide what fake name Marty is using in 1931, and there are some voice-recording issues in Part 5.			"

												A surprisingly fun game, even though I'm not the biggest fan of point-and-click adventure games. The plot is silly at times, but fun nonetheless, and the characters are interesting.I felt a little confined as all five games mostly revolve around one square in town in different timelines and there wasn't that many secondary interactive elements, plus you aren't given any real choices. However, the dialogs are complex enough and puzzles are diverse enough to keep you interested.From the technical point of view, it's mediocre. Voice acting is good, graphics and animation are outdated, camera control is terrible. I mean, it'll easily win the contest for the most messed up camera - you'll find camera switching between three views from completely different directions when you move mouse cursor and the main character looks in different directions. Controller is pretty much unusable as it's close to impossible to click precisely.Overall, if you're a fan of Back to the Future even in a slightest, you don't want to miss the game, but it does have some rough edges.

Very few, if any, of the puzzles will need a second thought, and even if you get stuck there are several hints just in case.Pros: nice story.Cons: as easy as abc.			"

												If you're a fan of Back to the Future, YOU NEED THIS GAME. SERIOUSLY!The gameplay is a bit annoying. While I did enjoy a couple of the puzzles because they were creative, I must say most of them were the dumbest thing I've ever seen. I've seen drunken psychopaths who came out of a wardrobe that leads to Middle Earth, because purple is their favorite number have more logic then these puzzles. However, the gameplay isn't really the selling point of this game, it is (of course) the story.I was literally grinning from start to finish in this game. The story definitely honors the movies and if you don't laugh or grin widely enough that you could be a creepy pasta character at least once per episode, well then shut up because you're lying.This game is easily worth the money just for the perfectly directed story.

The story line is hard to get into because the pace can get thrown off by small things. Once you get used to the enviroment and the game style the game has some good content. The music, visual, and character form are all well done. Recommended for BTTF fans,  and telltail gamers.			"

												This review concerns the whole series of Back to the Future.TL,DR; I had a blast with the series and recommend it, more easily so if you liked the movies.+ Telltale game engine+ Back to the Future theme+ Voice actor A.J. Locascio very closely resembles Fox's voice from the movies+ Overall good voice acting+ Believable characters+ Hours of nostalgia0 Puzzles of medium challenge- (the old) Too short, about 2 hours for each of the 5 episodesFirst off, the game uses the Telltale[en.wikipedia.org] tool known from adventures like the three new Sam & Max serieses, The Walking Dead, the current Tales from the Borderlands and a number of lesser known games, e.g. Puzzle Agent.Except for maybe the awful Bone series the tool generally provides easily navigable good-looking scenery. It manages too closely resemble the respective flair and art style of the basic IPs.Same with this adventure, I was seamlessly brought back to the 1985 setting, then gleefully thrown about. The voice acting did it's part with A.J. Locascio closely imitating Micheal J. Fox's pitch and tremble from the movies.Characters are believably written and we get to learn more about the McFlys, Browns and Tannens.The puzzles are not too hard and most of the time logical and with clear intent. This though adds to the episodes being somewhat short. I think I spent around 2 hours per episode making the series roughly a 10 hour experience - an experience of awesome.Thank you, Telltale, for once more providing a high-class adventure and letting me dive back into the atmosphere of Back to the Future including feelings of hope for and fear of the technology of the future.Also, the future is now! 2015 is only days away. I hear self-tightening shoes have been done and the hoverboard works if only just. Now, where is the self-drying jacket and the convincing shark hologram?Five episodes of Back to the Future adventure and reminiscence. Recommended.			"

												Bought this game on a sale and played it with my wife.  Overall this was a fun game to play and we both enjoyed it.  One of the episodes was pretty slow but the game as a whole has a good story throughout. We used a controller to play the game and it didnt work that great in the 1st episode. Seemed like they optimized it better as the episodes whent by.  In a few places we needed to use the mouse.If you're a BTTF fan this is a must have.			"

												I am currently on the second chapter of this series and not in a rush to complete it. This may sound weird but I enjoy the game since it is more of a movie than a game. Sure there are puzzles and common sense in certain situations seem to went home I do enoy the game.There are some complaints, I have notice pencil icons in the game. I learned that events happen in that area and players not meant to see it but it does throw me off. The other is when two people are on the screen they both are talking. I checked other people and they too have this.Other than that, fun game.			"

												If you like Back to the Future, get this right now. It's the best possible Back to the Future game and infinitely better than any movie sequels that will inevitably happen once both of the original creators are dead. The story is great, the dialogue is well-written, the art style looks amazing, all of the returning characters sound just like they do in the films. The only complaint you could have is that the puzzles aren't that hard and there's really no consequence for messing up but are you really buying this game for the puzzles?If you don't like Back to the Future what the hell is wrong with you			"

												Pros: - Young Doc was terribly adorable.- I appreciated that Christopher Lloyd reprised his role as Doc (and MFox did a cameo in Ep 5)- The Opening/Ending mirrored the movies (which made everything feel lovely)- The story was interesting - Playing the game got easier to navigate Cons:- The story stopped being interesting after Ep 3- It was hard to control Marty in Eps 1/2- Ep 5 can be summarized as: 'finding/killing doc then being the inbetweener between a familly argument because no one is willing to talk to one another' (no spoilers in that sentence, don't worry)- Ep 3 can be summarized as 'doing nothing while you run around talking to people then the story ends'- The animation was so off at times. Sometimes simple things like a WALK CYCLE was not done correctly and Marty looked like he was walking with straight legs- Sometimes the animation stops or the dialogue stops while the animation catches up- The ending feels like an absolute cop outI know this is one of TellTales older games but I was expecting development from ep1 to ep5 (such as game mechanics getting better). But it feels unpolished. Simple things, such as making sure that a walking cycle looks believable shouldn't be neglected in any game, even if it's coming from an indie developer.  I really love Back to the Future but this didn't feel like what the franchise deserved. It's more of a causal game than an 'adventure game' since I basically did nothing but walk Marty from place to place. tl;dr: Doc gets a new girlfriend and then the story gets dull. The end.			"

												This Telltale-Game is a pretty sweet sequel to the movie franchise.StoryIn 1986 you play as Marty and witness how Doc's properties are being sold and suddenly the DeLorean appears which gives to the clue that the real Doc has problems in the past and you must help him.And of course like in the movies you will stumble in some excellent adventures (...oh wrong movie :D) including changing the past and the future.Without spoiling to much of the storyline:you will go back to the year 1931 than back to an alternate 1986 and of course back to 1931 and a little bit of the wildwest (only a few moments at the end of the game).The whole story will be told in 5 episodes. (You get all 5 episodes with one buy.)Every episode will end with a twist and a short look to the next episode.The graphics......are nicely done.You don't need a high end cpu to run this game.The characters and environment have a comic book design which looks pretty sweet and you recognize all the characters from the movies.The gameplay......is really simple as you just do point and click und move with mouse or keyboard.The soundtrack......is awesome but hey, its just the same themes as in the movies!!!I'm glad they got the rights and didn't use new themes because otherwise it would be horrible.The voice acting...The voice actors are doing a good job.Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown is the only actor from the movies who does the voice acting on this game.All the other characters are beeing dubbed by different actors.AJ Locascio does a an amazing job portraiting Marty McFly.Michael J. Fox has a voice cameo in the 5th episode!!Only two cons:- no achievemnts- no trading cardsI totally recommend it for young and mature people who love the Back to the Future movies!!			"

												An amusing adventure if you're a fan of the Back to the Future trilogy, this episodic series develops a new story line that takes place where Back to the Future Part III ends.Compared to newer Telltale titles, this series takes a linear approach to story, compared to the branching paths that naturally occur in other games like The Walking Dead or The Wolf Among Us as you develop relationships with multiple characters.If you're looking for something more dynamic, your interests are better suited for Telltale's more modern titles. That said, the simple path of Back to the Future: The Game is still an enjoyable gaming experience.			"

Episode three was really funny and great. Episode four was great and having Doc turn evil was a really cool concept. The final part is by far the best of the five parts. Going back to 1876 was awesome and Edna FINALLY getting what she deserves by going to jail is very satisfying. My hours on this game are about 20 (only the time I've spent on the first episode is shown). 10/10-Love it to bits!!!			"

												Typically I am a big fan of telltale's work. Thats the sole reason I chose to give this title a shot. I was sadly dissapointed. As it turns out, Telltale hasnt always been a ""choice-heavy"" gaming company. While maintaining a similar art style and sticking to their usual adventure game niche, this game doesnt seem to have consequences. Now, that might be okay if there was more action. Let me explain...Another Telltale title I enjoyed was their jurrsasic park game. This game was a pretty straightforward storyline as well. But every turn was exciting! So I was along for a ride but at least it has some bumps and turns. Unofortunately, your on rails with Back to the Future but those rails are on a straight line. No dips...just a striaght forward...slow ride. I felt like I was completing quests on a rushed MMO more than playing something thats up to Telltale Standard.Ah well.			"

But it doesnt matter, you dont play it to be challenging but to enjoy the story which is great and focuses mostly on the fans of Back to the Future trilogy and frankfully, who doesnt love these movies? another chapter from this universe is what we wanted and its story can be compared to movies, Doc and Marty travel trhough future past and alternate realities dealing with problems they cause.

The storyline feels like it's straight from one of the movies, and it seems like a great game for everybody.

												I got hooked to the story just by playing a few minutes of Episode 1. The voice acting of Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown is phenomenal while A.J LoCascio also does great voice work for Marty McFly. His voice was very identical to Michael J. Fox. This game was such a pleasure to play and the plotline will get you hooked. I found myself blowing through all the episodes just to see what would happen next. The only downside to the game is that I had a few issues controlling Marty with the WASD keys. This is definitely a TellTale game for nostalgic fans of the Back to the Future movies and for newcomers to the series.			"

												I know all three movies, word for word.I never want a BttF remake, or a sequel. This was enough of a 'new' BttF fix to keep me content with the fact we'll never see Marty outwit that butthead Biff ever again.All gushing aside, this game is pretty great. The voice acting is fantastic (considering Doc Brown is actually Christopher Lloyd's voice), they had a great voice actor to play Marty and other notable characters. It's a typical point and click that Telltale does well, and right from the getgo it feels like you never left Hill Valley.Though this game is great to me, I'm easy to please when it comes to BttF stuff so it might not be for everybody. The storyline does get pretty damn cheesy from time to time, but it's still fun to see what's going to happen next. There's even a few surprises along the way that make the journey worthwhile.If you love BttF: buy this. If you're not a die-hard fan, or unsure if you'll really enjoy this, buy this while it's still on sale.			"

												This game is a must have for fans of the movie trilogy and just fans of these types of point and click games in general. It has quite a few flaws that i will detail below, but the good triumphs over the bad if the game is on sale. Good aspects:Detailed and well thought out story that links all five episodes together - Each story has logical and believable writing and execution in relation to the movies. The motives of the characters is similar to that of what was in the movies and it is told well enough.Great voice acting/dialogue/characters - the person portraying Marty sounds so similar to Mr. Fox in the movies that i kept on actually believing that it really was him doing his best vocal impression of himself at that young age. Christopher Lloyd was also a delight to listen to. As were the other lead characters for the most part. Nostalgia - The game nails it when it comes to bringing memories back from the movies,  referencing certain aspects of the three movies and just celebrating the most memorable lines, moments and scenes in the movie trilogy without over doing it. Bad aspects:Presentation/animation - The character renders and overall presentation is quite bad in comparison to other games that celebrate famous movies (such as Ghostbusters: The Video Game, which came out a year earlier and which looked well detailed and thorogh in its visual appearance snd actually lets you roam around freely with very few issues) Roaming around in the Hill Valley in this game can seem like somewhat of a chore at times with the limitations on where you can walk and the camera angles nearly impossoble to manouvere. That doesn't change whether you use the keyboard controls or your mouse. The design of Hill Valley looks decent enough, but the whole presentation and animations of the chatacters could have been way better if the right time and money was invested. Still, it was still ok and not game breaking for me. Graphically, the game doesn't look as if it reaches its potential.Choice-based gameplay being limited - The choices that they let your character make are very limiting and don't really add much to your path in the story because whichever options you pick, your character will ultimately go always go in the same path. That is because with the options they provide you during interaction with various characters, you almost always have to pick all of them to move forward in the story. For example, playing as Marty, as you're interacting with Doc Brown you need to find out a specific piece of information and are given four or more choices of questions or phrases you can ask/provide, but you have to ask pretty much all of them to get to where you need to so there isn't really a huge amount of choice involved in actuality.Overall, it is a very good game for what it is that would be most enjoyed if you're a fan of the movie series that could have been amazing if a little more time and money were invested into this. Probably not worth it for the full price, but is great value when on sale.However, if they released a sequel to this (whether in episodic format or otherwise), then i would definitely buy it especially if they fixed the flaws that were in this game.

The story, the characters, the jokes, the world - almost everything could be taken (or are even taken) directly from Back to the Future movies. From the game mechanics it's a typical point and click adventure, although it emphasises mostly on story elements and not on challenging puzzles.    I have really enjoyed this game.			"

												I can only speak to the first episode, but I'm immediately installing the remainder as  I was substantially entertained throughout the entire experience. The comedy stylings is reminiscent of the Sam & Max series that works with the license. Compared to other adventure games, this is fairly easy (and even has a strong built in hint system if needed), so it leaves you more time to enjoy the plot. There's nothing revolutionary about the gameplay (I was thouroughly entertained with the rocket fuel making puzzle), but very few games make me laugh every minute, making it worth the price.			"

												This review is for the entire series, not just this episode.--------------Back To The Future The Game is a great video game and worth every penny if you enjoy point and click action/adventure puzzle story games.I watched the animated series & movies and they have since become three of my favorites. when I heard there was a game coming out and it was going to be an adventure game developed by Telltale responsible for Monkey Island and Sam & Max. I knew I needed to play this game. I was so exciting.Positives:The game features great voice work from Christopher Lloyd returning as Doc, and A.J. Locascio who did an awesome job as Marty, due to Michael J. Fox being unable to perform. Michael J. Fox has a cameo later in the game, and it's very nice.graphics are great, The character designs fit very well. The animation in the game is very good. Gameplay itself is simple, the puzzles are dialogue-based or involve using items with a great help system that'll ease players who are having trouble.Sound and music are very pleasing and make you feel like you're watching the old movies. Conclusion:Highly recommended for anyone who liked the movies, you'll like this game, It is true to the story.			"

												For fans of the movies, there really isn't much of a choice other than to play this series. ""Back to the Future: The Game"" is one of TellTale's earlier games, and it shows, with very limited choices and a linear story. The story itself also hews close to the original trilogy, down to the same feel when it comes to the final resolution.Voice acting isn't bad. Christopher Lloyd is around to voice Doc Brown, and Michael J. Fox makes a cameo near the end. They got other voice actors to play everyone else (including Marty McFly and the various Biffs), but they do a decent job. The music is great, right out of the movies. To be honest, if you go into this game expecting to be playing the movie (or an episode of the animated series), you'll know what you're in for.I really enjoyed this series back when it first came out, but it isn't as good as TellTale's later attempts.

												BTTFTG is firstly a puzzle game, secondly a narrative. I personally thought the narrative was more intriguing than the puzzles because they were getting kinda frustrating (knowing exactly what you need to do but not knowing the specific way of triggering it). Despite the frustration, however, the story kept me going because I wanted to see where it was going.While I found it enjoyable, and I would recommend it, you have to realise that this predates the Telltale Games where you actually get to make decisions that change the story. There are no branching decisions, simply following the narrative. It is not the best Telltale Game ever, but it's an enjoyable one.What really stands out for me was how messed up the time travel started getting, but because each episode is about two hours, you can follow it easily because each episode only adds one layer to the mess which is what lets it reach the chaotic climax.That being said, I wouldn't spend full price on it. But does anyone really buy games on Steam except during sales??			"

												Not the best Telltale game, but after the first two seasons (which are mediocre with confusing controls) It gets a lot better as a point and click game. It feels a lot smoother from episode 3 onwards. Loved it in the end and was well worth the money on sale.			"

												It's one of the weaker Telltale games, your decisions don't really alter much and the puzzles aren't very complex. However, I can't imagine a Back to the Future fan not having a fun time with this game			"
