												As an interesting and somewhat successful adventure game, Alter Ego is the last video game made by Czech developer team, Future Games which we were familiar from the first game in The Black Mirror series. The studio was closed in 2011 due to financial problems after the release of this last game - which was also the probable underlying reason behind the abrupt ending we have here.19th century, Plymouth. The city is shaken with the untimely death of Sir William, a deformed young noble with a handful of speculations running about his nature in the newspapers. At the time his funeral is being arranged, the swindler and street rat Timothy Moor comes to the city on a cargo carrier as a stowaway, apprehended by sailors. He manages to escape to find his childhood friend Brian for a job, only to find himself in an uncanny intrigue concerning Sir William himself. Following Tim's misfortune, Detective Briscol - who has just started his first day on the job, investigating a disturbance in the cemetery just after the funeral - becomes a part of the same uncanny intrigue as well. As the story progresses, our unlikely heroes will cross paths to try and shed some light into the dreadful business.Spoilers for the following paragraph! Firstly, the storyline - being interesting enough during the game - closes up with a dark and unsatisfactory ending; leaving many loose ends which results with the unnecessary demise of our heroes. It is wrapped and misconcluded badly, with stupid mistakes on our ""brilliant"" main heroes' part. The last dialogue between our main heroes is misguiding and uncharacteristic, screaming out ""we couldn't end the game as we intended to due to budget problems"". The whole experience is as good as it lasts, but by the last 10 minutes of the game, you'll be disappointed if you'll be expecting an interesting conclusion.Our main characters on the other hand, are intriguing and well written antiheroes rather than benevolent defenders of justice. They are successfully portrayed with their inner monologues displayed for the player, to reveal some truth to their nature aside their demeanor. They have severe character flaws, somewhat foul natures and an incredible amount of vanity; eventually resulting with their own downfall. Very humane and very well-done.Graphics are made in AGDC, resulting in a successfully grim atmosphere with grayish colors dominating the century. Environment design is probably one of the upsides of the game, alongside an especially satisfactory voice acting with proper accents of the time. Character interactions and facial features are also appreciable. As an adventure game, Alter Ego is nothing extraordinary though. There are hardly any puzzles or actual item combinations. Items themselves are pretty obvious to encounter and gather too. As a mystery and crime investigation game though, it sure is noteworthy - especially the parts where we play as detective Bristol: gathering clues, interrogating witnesses and trying to guess the logic behind occurrences. The parts with Tim rely on story progression rather than mystery mainly and presents loose ends for detective Briscol eventually.If you are to keep your expectations limited, Alter Ego is a nice experience with a really lame ending. It has some imaginative ideas, good character builds and a potentially interesting story if only it would be displayed a bit more elaborately. If you stumble upon it on a decent sale, why not?Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												This is not a yes, it's at best a ""maybe"". If it's discounted and/or you're a big fan of slow, linear point&click adventures of the detective mystery variety, and if you come to it with low expectations, it can offer you some entertaining hours.It's obviously a low budget game, technically lacking, very linear, quite old-fashioned, with logical puzzles that offer zero challenge but also zero frustration. And I use the world puzzles very liberally here, most of the time you point, you click, the story moves on. It is also very sloooooow. Seriously, everything is slow: the story, the movements of the characters, the time it takes for clicks to register - this is one for people with patience, and if you can't deal with that stay well away, you'll hate it.The overall atmosphere is probably the best part of this game. The other big positive for me is the attempt to describe the detective process in a relatively ""realistic"" way for the police detectives of the era, or at least their fictional counterparts. I found the characters entertaining, however they're both rather antiheroes than heroes, and not always portrayed in a positive light, and I expect not everyone will like that. The visuals are allright and fit the mood, the sound is barely there but not annoying and the voice acting is decent enough for this kind of budget. The story itself isn't good, isn't bad. Imagine a paperback period detective mystery, a bit of a guilty pleasure with no real substance. However, the ending is bafflingly unfulfilling. The game ends very abrubtly right in the thick of things - I actually thought I hit a bug. That alone may have warranted a downvote, but truth be told I had very low expectations of this game, and the hours I spent with it were pleasurable, so my approach was... oh well, I had fun while it lasted.Conclusion: There are tones of better point & clicks out there. But if you like these types of games and get it cheap, this is not a bad way to spend a relaxed summer afternoon. Think cold drink in one hand, mouse in the other, minimal thinking required. ;)			"

												Just finished it and I wanted to warn people that want to buy this game.I would not consider this game ""good"" but decent. It could easily have been a great title but there are many things very wrong or badly done (mostly because of budget I suppose) like the cinematics and certain animations that are ""lifeless"" and feels very awkward. But in a point-and-click it isn't a main problem, what you want is a good narration and some mystery to solve. And it delivers in that regard with some really good design of places at the 19th century. I was surprised at how invested I was after a couple hours but that's mostly because I love this style of game and can put aside any type of gameplay to focus on the story. Which has many problems and holes (again probably budget) but still holds up for a decent story.I still recommand this game but certainly not for 20$ and certainly not to anyone. You must be very patient and already like this style of game. It is better after the first hour but don't expect too much. You should almost buy this with an intent to know how can this type of game can go right and wrong as it is very obvious in this one.I would say up to 5, maybe 10$ it isn't a steal, but only if you know what you're getting into.

												A very good game with great graphic style. The gameplay based on the classic click'n'point interaction and almost all puzzles are inventory based. The voiceovers are all fine except Tim who sounds a bit... dull. Almost all his voiceovers are done in the same tone so it sounds a bit out of place at some points.The game will be easy for any player that usually plays these type of games and you can easily finish it in 5-7 hours. The story is good - it starts slowly but it picks up later with all the murders. Even though I've read most of the reviews for this game, and even though they all gave it a pretty bad score - the game really is good.However - the end of the game is really rushed. It does make sense, but the way it's presented is far from what it should be for this type of game. Also - you'll spend the last 30min of gameplay just going from location to location in a very speedy way because (i guess) devs ran out of time or money to make it interactive. The story at that point just rushes up till the point where the detective literally explains everything to you, what was really going on and who was behind the murders. The bad thing about it is that most of the info was never present in the game, or was mentioned very vaguely.All in all - it's a good game and I recommend it to all adventure lovers			"

												Don't let the banner fool you, this game is NOT a horror game. This is a simple PnC game and the puzzles if any aren't that difficult.Set in late 1890s Plymouth, a vagabond gets wrapped in a murder investigation.You play as Tim and Detective Briscol whom you alternate between to progress through the game.There is some good voice acting and the mystery of the murders is quite intriguing.While not the prettiest game ever, the pre-rendered backgrounds look nice and evoke a late PSOne era feel (if not PS2 era).Highly recommended if you're looking for something simple to play through with decent story and voice acting.

												I was eyeing this game for a long time, and when the price was only around $1.50 CD I snapped it up. I was glad I had, as I really enjoyed the game, (I had no idea that it was by the same developers as Black Mirror!) Many good reviews have been written so I will only say that it's really too bad about the ending. It is most probable that they'd run out of money...  edited; Yes Gingergal I too prefered black mirror ! :)			"

Title: Alter EgoGenre:  AdventureDeveloper:  bitComposer GamesPublisher: Viva MediaRelease Date: 3rd August 2010TL;DR, VerdictNot bad, very slow paced. Good for those who like the point and click adventure genres, not good for those starting out in it. I think it's too expensive for what it is. If it was cheaper, it would be probably more worth a recommend. ProsDetailed environments – lots of little things to look atVoice acting is nice, Irish and English accents!ConsReally slow paced Gameplay “Can you climb, naked man?” A point and click puzzle game, your character starts by escaping from a prison via a sewage/flood system, looking remarkably clean, if a little naked and handcuffed. He's a thief accosted by English constables, in a time where racial tensions between the Irish and English are at an all time high. When he picks up objects, they mysteriously disappear into his pants, and some of the animations are very slow ... and the character does have a slight habit of over explaining his actions during a successful “puzzle”, which could get annoying after a while. Yes smash the lock. No need to go further into it. The character has a habit of reminding himself he can't do things or that something happened, or thinking that people are simple and how he needs to manipulate them – attributing to his thief-like character of dubious morals. Who also really dislikes hard work. Or work that requires effort in general. He's not a nice guy for sure, though entertaining in the way he interacts with people. You'll either like him or hate his guts. He seems to try and get around the game with his silver tongue. The dialogue between him and the woman who helps him out at the start is a little unbelievable, it progresses too conveniently. The accents are nice to listen to, though the main character is a little flat toned. But hey! Irish accents. It's very dialogue heavy so you'll spend a lot of time talking with characters and going through each talk option.The environments are well rendered, they're not amazing but thought and detail has gone into it, from dirty basins to rust and pots and pans and objects lying around everywhere, giving the appearance of a run down, shabby and poor area. It's dilapidated and grimy, the less glamorous side of the Victorian style era, and this same level of detail persists in each scene you go into.The game itself is a little too slow paced for me, things take too long to interact with, so I fast start losing interest in the adventure, despite the good environment, potential intriguing plot and interesting voice actors with their own quirks.Want to read more of my reviews?

												In Alter Ego, you play as two characters in the backdrop of late 19th Century England. There are ghastly murders happening, and in this point and click adventure, you will help to solve this case.The character models are fairly well done for a low budget adventure game. They do somewhat clash with the backgrounds, at times not really seeming to actually be in the environment, but more like actors in front of a green screen. The videos are decently made, but the action and animation can look a little silly at times.Character movement can be really slow and plodding. Luckily you can double click to run to areas. However, every time you interact with an object the animations always feel like they take a little too long. Voice acting is not great, but also not in the so bad it's good category, so it's just kind of mediocre. It won't take you out of the story, but it won't do much for you. Puzzles are not too difficult thanks to the option to highlight all interactive items in the scene.I did not find the characters you play as or encounter to be terribly interesting. The dialogue sounds a bit awkward at times. The story wasn't really gripping, and unfortunately, about two hours in, I lost my save. I was not having enough fun and did not care enough about the story to make it through that progress again.There are better point and click adventure games out there. If you get this in a bundle, try it out for a few minutes to see if the story interests you. The setting can be fun, as seen in the Sherlock Holmes games, but I found the story to be a bit lacking.Grade: D+			"

												I recommend playing through this game but be prepared for a really lame and disappointing ending.This game plays like Still Life. It's not a puzzle point-and-click, it's a murder mystery, with evidence to collect and use. You play as two different characters, providing two different points of views and adventures. The voice acting was well done, the story (for most of the game) was interesting and engaging, and the difficulty of the game was minimal.I'm also not a fan of the title and cover art... it's very misdleading. I kept waiting for it to make sense, and in my opinion, it never did.			"

												Alter Ego suffers severly from puzzles that don't serve the plot, but rather bladly carry you from one door to the next key, or whatnot. Picking-up a box from the lowest shelf? Let's turn it into a puzzle! Nothing is too trivial for this game. Many of the items needed to solve the puzzles can't be picked unless a very specific trigger has already occured. You know the key is behind the statue, you can look at the statue, but the character would refuse just taking the key. As for the difficulty, most puzzles are of medium-low difficulty, and just require knowing *when* the time is right to solve one specific puzzle. I had everything I needed to make a certain paste, but it took another 30 minutes of gameplay between 1. Knowing that you need the paste, and 2. knowing where the paste needs to be applied, before you could get *water* to do it. So this should give you an example for both the ""complexity"" and annoyance of the puzzles. Also, both characters are boring, pompous, and are mainly annoying. They pretty much have the same narcissistic personality, it just happen that one is a cop and the other is a criminal.The plot is decent, and the atmosphere is rather good. It is a real shame that none of the puzzles support them. Buy this only if less than $5, and even then.. meh.			"

												Alter Ego seems like a decent point & click adventure where you play two different characters that ultimately cross paths. The dialog ends up being quite dry and slow ending up making the game quite boring. I honestly fell asleep in my chair playing this game on at least 2 occasions. It's got a Sherlock Holmes detective vibe to it which kept it mildly interesting, but reaching the end just left me completely baffled. It's like they didn't have the time, resources, or money to finish the game so they just make an executive decision to end it prematurely. I'm still left with a bad taste in my mouth. Seriously, that's it?			"

												This game is for adventure game fans who are more interested in a good murder-mystery detective story than they are in typical adventure games puzzles. This game is easy and does not burden the player with difficult puzzles, pixel-hunting, or overly long dialogues.It just focuses on keeping the story going. And it's a pretty good story. For that reason, I do recommend it. However, the ending is a bit disappointing. It's not that it leaves any loose ends. You'll basically know what happened. It's just that it ends too abruptly, leaving you surprised and somewhat unsatisfied. It almost feels like it was really rushed.Despite the ending, I think it's $10 very well spent if you are in the market for such a game.			"

												I don't care for point and click games and occasionally I happen to purchase some discounted large pack that includes some. I take it upon myself to at least start and give it a little playtime to get a limited impression about quality.So, it seems visually quite nice though the mechanics and dialogues can be a bit annoying since every time you examine something it ""plays"" through a description scene. I would think first time would be enough and simply stick to written description for subsequent clicks.The story seem to be ok and the interface somewhat ok too.Graphics, animation and sound is not top notch but absolutely decent and nothing I'd complain about.So, if point and click games is our thing, I suspect this might be an ok game to play. Have seen much worse while not much better, so I think it deserves a thump up rather than one down. "

												I just finished this game and although I had a good time playing it, the ending ruined it for me. If there was a sequel, it would be fine; alas there is not. There is a decent story, although towards the end it becomes overly complicated and the mystery is never really solved, or explained. Again, it seems as if a sequel was intended but it just didn't happen. That's really too bad, as there is no story resolution with this single game. After playing all three of the Black Mirror series, I understand how a cliffhanger at the end can be fun... as long as the story continues. I cannot fault the game itself for this, as my understanding is that the studio was closed before that was possible, so I have to give this game a thumbs up, but with the caution that you can't expect a complete story. If you can write your own ending, then go for it. If not, wait for a huge sale.			"

I'm giving it ""no"" just because this game was irritating me a lot of times.What that means?The whole game I was waiting for something to happen and when I thought that it is starting to be interesting and had hopes for something greater... The game ended in a really poor manner. The plot is somewhat disappointing. You go through it looking for something which should feature it amongst a lot of similar games, but you won't find it here. It's just another point and click mystery game with irritating accents like:- places too dark to see some little piece without which you can't progress further- going backwards and searching the same places, because you missed something... and that's happened to me some times when I was forced to search through a walkthrough to find a solution- not skippable locations through which you must pass to go to the desired placesBut those are problems of a tons of other poorly designed point and clicks, right?I wouldn't be so disappointed if the plot wasn't that poor. You expect something more exciting and you find only a repetitive game. Pity.5/10 and negative opinion. Sorry game. You tried.			"

Alter Ego is a decent adventure game. It was branded by its developer as a ""dark adventure game""; I don't consider it very dark, but it is atmospheric. The game is set in Plymouth, England in 1894. Throughout the game you alternate between two characters, Timothy Moor, a petty hood seeking to find a better life, and Detective Sergeant Briscol, a rigid agent of law and order.There are a few technical issues with the game; most notable for me was probably the discrepancy between the character models' mouth movements and the spoken dialogue. Occasionally characters' mouths would move while there was no dialogue, or there would be dialogue, but no mouth movement, or the wrong character would be in sync with the speech. Also, when a playable character reflected in thought to himself, sometimes his mouth would move even though he was only thinking, or there would be slight reverberation to his internal monologue in some environments, as if he had spoken aloud. There were occasional differences between the subtitles and the spoken dialogue, as well as at least one mislabeled inventory item(at the beginning of the game, Tim's manacled wrists are labeled ""lucky horseshoe"", an item which doesn't appear until later in the game), but nothing irritatingly glaring. I think the same sound effect was employed for both walking and running, and there were a few other details-oriented issues like that which should have been polished out prior to the game's release.Much like The Black Mirror (which was also developed by Future Games s.r.o.), Alter Ego revolves around a compelling atmosphere, and I liked the soundscape. I noticed that a few of the sound effects and music samples are reused from The Black Mirror, but I don't consider this an issue, as they are as equally at home in Alter Ego as they were in The Black Mirror. The voice acting was competent, and didn't cause distraction. [quasi-spoiler]Like The Black Mirror, Alter Ego has a f♥ck-you-for-playing ending that hardly rewards for the time invested.[/quasi-spoiler] I believe the game would have benefited from having multiple possible endings. Perhaps a sequel was intended.If you don't enjoy adventure games, you should probably pass on this game. If you do enjoy adventure games and see Alter Ego on sale, consider giving it a try. I recommend watching a few videos of it first, in order to get a feel for it. I bought it when it was on sale, and I do not regret my purchase. In terms of pacing, Alter Ego somewhat reminded me of a few ICOM Simulations, Inc games (such as Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective, Dracula Unleashed, etc), that is to say that it is leisurely paced. As for navigational efficiency, double-clicking on an action item or other point on the screen will cause your character to run to it rather than stroll (Note: Tim can't run until his handcuffs have been removed). Double-clicking on an exit allows you to leave the current screen more quickly, rather than the playable character having to traverse the entirety of the distance to the exit, but unfortunately you can't access the map whenever you choose in order to jump to a different location, first you must exit the current location. When playing, you can display the active hotspots if you abhor pixel hunting, although without using the hotspot display feature I don't recall ever feeling like I had to tediously search around, plus the cursor turns red when hovering over a hotspot. Some of the tasks weren't straightforward, not in terms of being challenging, but in terms of defying real-world expectation, and there are also several tantalizingly unfinished plotlines; however, the story makes up for these shortcomings, in my opinion. For the most part the game flowed reasonably well, although the game does feel somewhat rushed and incomplete content-wise, like the developers had more planned than they had time or budget to execute.Alter Ego was the final release by Future Games before the studio closed. If you enjoyed an adventure game like Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, you might like Alter Ego. And if you like Alter Ego, you may wish to also check out The Black Mirror (when it is on sale), although the graphics of The Black Mirror are more dated. Black Mirror II: Reigning Evil & Black Mirror III: Final Fear were developed by a different studio (Cranberry Production GmbH), and while perhaps technically superior, aren't crafted in a way that is as appealing to me. I would have liked to see what Future Games could have done with more resources at its disposal.SCORE: 53 out of 100 - FairSUMMARY: If you enjoy the occasional adventure game, this isn't a bad game to add to your collection if you pick it up it when it is on sale. If you only buy a couple of titles a year, or don't care for the adventure game genre, this likely isn't the game for you and you should put your money towards something else.ADVISORY: ""Fix for invisible characters in Alter Ego""			"

												Decent point & click adventure game with a storyline that is nice but could have been great if only the developers had more imagination. For the die-hard-old-fashioned adventure gamers this one's too easy. No difficult puzzles or intricate inventory combinations that might have kept you on your toes. The ending is a bit boring, clearly set up for a sequel which was never made (at least I haven't been able to find it anywhere on internet). I'd rate this average to poor if I had to pay full price, but since I got it for a low price it was nice and gets my thumbs up.			"

												Alter Ego is a fantastic Point & Click game.You play as both Timothy Moor - a thief who dreams of escaping to America, and Detective Briscol - who aims to solve the infamous murders committed by ""Mad William"". There are various parts to the game and you will switch between the two characters to get both perspectives on the story as it unfolds - this is the meaning behind the game's namesake, two separate points of view. The atmosphere, voice acting and music are perfect for immersion; and the story is uniquely written - it leads you to believe one outcome, yet it turns right around and you're left with something entirely different and unexpected. The few complaints I have are that it is a bit short, there are still a few things that are left unexplained and I wished that the ending had been left on a more positive note. As for replay value, I can't be certain; but I absolutely loved it and it's worth the price!			"

												1/5First and foremost I find the title of the game misleading. Just looking at the cover you would imagine the game follows some character who lives a double life; one as a good citizen, the other a darker kind of villain. I was expecting something along the lines of a Jekyll and Hyde game.Instead you play as two independent characters one an Irish rascal, the other a straight-laced English policeman. The game doesn't involve any problem solving but more like going from one place to another clicking on different things, and figuring out what to do next. The story is enjoyable whilst you're playing it, it unravells nicely and keeps you gripped.Nothing however can really compensate for how poor the ending is. I'ts not simply that the ending is an unhappy one for both protagonists but it renders the whole story pointless.There is one stupid part where you have to steal the ledger from a shop associated with the villain. This involves:1. Walking outside from the church2. Walking outside the main gates3. Walking from outside the main gates to outside the shop.4. Click on the door.And thats it. After you click on the door you're automatically sent back to the church after a brief monologue and tell you're partner ""Here you go, I've got the account book"" (not the exact wording, but that's basically what happens). Stupid, utterly stupid.There are far better point and clicks out there. Find anohter.			"

												Just finished Alter Ego today and decided to do a quick review of this 19th century England murder mystery pont-and-click adventure. In short, I would only recommend to get this game if it's on sale, as even for the current price (9,99 euros), you won't get much bang for your buck.The pros:+ Decent graphics, albeit perhaps a bit sub-par for 2010; good visual atmosphere+ Decent sound acting+ Switching between two main characters and their different viewpoints on the world is a nice touch; both characters really have their own, unique personality, which comes through quite well+ The notebook feature of the detective (although this and his other utensils could've been elaborated on more to give the game an even more crime-solving touch)The cons:- Short gameplay (I finished it in ~10 hours)- Meagre diaglogues, it seems like they only put in the bare necessities for the game to be playable- Easy puzzles (I can count the times I really got stuck for a while on the fingers of one hand; the ""puzzles"" mainly involve ""pick up item A and use it with B"", ""show item C to person D"", ""talk to person E to trigger event F"", and, in the more challenging parts ""combine item G with item H and then use it with I"")- Few locations (the summary says there are more than 80, but that's only the different SCREENS; all in all, there's only 10 different locations all around town, and the number of locations that your current main character can visit is only a small subset of that at any given time)- Pretty linear, almost railroaded gameplay; which is really a result of the 2 items above; you don't really have many different options on any of the screens / locations and there's only so many locations to visit and people to talk to in the first place; of a really decent adventure game, I expect a few dozen locations in a ""free-roaming"" world and some real crunching about what to do, where to go and whom to talk to, but that's simply not the case here- At some times, especially near the ending of the game, gameplay was reduced to simply clicking on one or two things and then go from cutscene to cutscene- During the game, you have a ""who dunnit?"" feel for quite some time (which is good), but in the end , the game pretty much tells you the plot at a point, and throws it all in your lap just like that, which left me feeling bereft of the opportunity to figure it all out by myself- At some points, you need to trigger exactly the right dialogue or need to use the exact right item to the exact right person before the game allows you to progress (i.e. before new dialogue options with other characters come available or before you can use certain items in a certain way), which, at times, can be a bit frustratingAll in all, the cons sadly outweigh the pros by that much that I can't really recommend this game. Not that it's totally bad (it kept me mildly entertained for a few hours), but there's simply better point & click adventure games here at Steam for roughly the same price.			"

												I love point & click adventures and I don't mind a mediocre one noew and again, but this ...+ decent voice acting (even if the accents seem overdone at times)- both characters are utterly unlikable and without depth. If you're going to have two characters, why make them both egoistical a***holes?- PC/NPC actions and interactions not at all believable.- slooow story. Maybe it picks up later, but 5 hours in it's just plain boring- puzzles, what there is of them, don't make sense at all. The game is utterly linear, you can't even pick up items until you've progressed to exactly the right point. Good puzzles seem logical after the fact, if not before, here it's just one WTF moment after the other. Also, having solved them, you should feel some sense of achievement, but in this game the tasks are just too mundane for that.I'm not at all sure if I'll be able to bring myself to finish this ... stay away.

												Yeah, when a game:1. Is utterly bland and hasn't really got interesting after 5 hours of playtime (apparently, though I idled with this open a lot... because it's boring)2. Has mundane, pointless puzzles that mostly involve ""did you remember to get such and such from before because you need it now"" or ""hit the button that shows all hotspots, puzzle solved"". 3. Has windowed issues, to the point where I had to restart my computer more than once because it froze up and took my mouse cursor with it.It is neither worth my time or the effort it takes to play. I've tried to be the least bit interested in this for over two weeks now, and... nothing. There is no reason to buy this game, there are so many better adventure games out there.			"

												Very poor storyline.  The puzzles for this game is pretty logical for the most part, but the story itself is pretty bland.  The two main characters that you play are thoroughly unenjoyable, and the ending is very bad.  If there had been a sequel to this game, then I can understand as to how they thought ending the game the way they did was a good idea.The ending provides no resolution.  The story is incredibly boring.  All of the interesting things happen to be described to you at the end.  Just not a good story at all.  If you want an adventure game to play and like the puzzles, play this game.  Otherwise, the very bad story will bore you immensely.			"

												Alter Ego is a fairly standard point and click game that also adds some mystery and detective elements in as well. However, while somewhat solid, the negatives outweigh the positives for me and I can’t recommend this.You alternate playing between 2 characters, Tim and Detective Briscol. This is an interesting mechanic, especially in a point and click game. It works well and the two characters stories get intertwined to eventually uncover the mystery as a whole. Game mechanics are ok. It does well with being able to quickly jump from screen to screen. You are also able to click to skip to the next dialog if your reading is faster than the characters speech. Graphics are decent and the pre-rendered backgrounds are pretty. The voice acting is generally good, some lack of emotion in various scenes but hits the mark most of the time. Each character has a different personality and are easy to remember.Puzzles (if you can call them that) only go as far as using items on things and combining items in your inventory and using it on things. This in itself isn’t difficult, but the exact combination that might be needed to reach a point can be frustrating. You may have to speak with someone and ask a particular question and then show them a particular item in order to advance. This is spanned over various scenes many times and ended up feeling like padding in the game. An odd thing I picked up on…the character Tim comes off as a wimpy guy who doesn’t want to do any work or manual labor. This trend is repeated numerous times and doesn’t make him feel dangerous or threatening.One of my biggest gripes with the game is the game speed and overall game pace. It’s very slow. Animations are slow and must complete before something else happens. Voice acting pauses when the subtitles slowly refresh and cause disjointed sentences. The story needed to be told either quicker or with more engaging things. I felt like it was dragging on.The ending and areas leading up to it seem to be rushed. Sudden increase in cinematics, parts of gameplay left out that could have easily been made into a scene. The entire plot is also told to you in sequence which takes the fun out of piecing it together yourself. Native ResolutionThe game runs at an odd native resolution of 1680 x 1050. Running the game on that resolution worked out well and nothing was cut off. Pros+60fps+Alternate between storylines / characters+Voice acting is decent+Characters are all uniqueCons+Slow gameplay and game pacing+Tim comes off as wimpy and not threatening+Ending is poor and last part of the game is rushed+Too much going back and forth between locations4/10 Below average			"

												I almost gave this a positive review. Almost. I was really getting into the game, and mentally planning to leave a glowing review for it because once you get past the awkward UI and the annoying 'Hunt for the plot trigger' scheme, the story really picks up. And then it train wrecks and rolls credits. Spoiler warning, but there's not a happy or satisfying ending. It just gives you a last second plot dump that spoils the tantalizing mysteries and then kills off both main characters. They could still be alive for a sequel, but only because of numerous loose ends that also sour the experience. After beating it, I genuinely went online to find out if I had somehow gotten a Bad End or something. It's just that sour.All that said, for the price it has decent graphics (though the animations are limited and sadly recycled far too often) and great characters. They did a great job with the art design, and the setting is enjoyable and well presented. The characters are annoyingly obtuse and obnoxious, but their unlikable personalities are actually a nice change of pace. Sure they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but why should stories only revolve around likeable people? The thief actually has a nice story arc that redeems him a fair bit. (The detective sadly feels like 90% of his story was left on the cutting room floor.) If the ending hadn't felt like they ran out of budget and just kicked it out the door then I'd have recommended it. If you pick it up on a heavy sale or in a bundle then it's worth an install, it's just you should go in expecting to be disappointed by the waste of a good story and characters. This game doesn't need a sequel, it needs a complete remake that retcons the ending.			"

												I REALLY wanted to say good things about this game, I really really did.  It had fantastic writing, it really did.  I don't care about it's lackluster animations that tended to be awkward, I don't care that sometimes things didn't make sense.  The story was told VERY well and was quite good, it honestly was.  The puzzles were fun too, not too hard, but still requiring thought.But... Alas, I have to not recommend it, and I feel horrible doing so.  The game.. It basically sets you up for failure.  You get so excited reading the description of the game, so excited as you play through, so excited to see the supernatural and horror that awaits, the story unraveling pefectly until...Well, I don't want to spoil it, but it really feels like a slap in the face.  Such an abrupt ending, just everything is done.  All the things you look forward to never happened, nothing really spooky happens, nothing is resolved, it leaves you feeling cheated and saddened. I sort of expected the title to play into the game.  Somehow your alterego played in or something.  I was excited for the dynamics of that.  But.. It just fell so short of all my expectations.  Nothing supernatural, nothing that fun.  I have to reiterate, it did have some great points..  But it just made you feel even emptier when you finish it all.Also, I know this is a small thing, but its title never played into the game at all.  Theres no ""alter egos"" in this game.			"

												Victorian England was not pretty, it was a time of filth and poverty, of racism and sexism, with a cast system that was not official but was nontheless inescapable.  This game perfectly restores that feeling; the two main protagonists are very far from out 21st politically-correct century.  The beautiful landscapes really solidify this grim atmosphere.The gameplay follows the Point-and-Click adventure genre, with subtle differences.  Some actions will not be possible, or will have different outcomes, depending on what actions you have performed earlier.  This makes you re-visit and re-explore places and items that you've already seen.  In exchange, items and locations will simply cease to become clickable once you are done with them, encouraging you to focus your efforts where it matters.  This keeps the possibility space small enough to avoid getting completely stuck.  Important: sometimes, you will need to time your actions properly; for example you will have to wait for someone to look away in order to succeed in your action.The UI is slightly inconsistent, but in no way game-breaking.  I also noticed some unfortunate typos that cannot be attributed to the poor language of the characters.  One extra layer of polish would have been nice, but the story usually captures you again very quickly and you don't remain bothered by it.The story surprised me a few times.  I used my meta-game knowledge to predict what was going on, only to realize later that I was wrong.  It breaks a lot of tropes.  It's hard to say more without spoiling, but I consider it a good thing.It took me ten hours to finish the game (I've got 13 hours recorded because I had to restart playing on another computer after three hours, there is no sync to store your saves on the cloud).  There were no silly puzzles; some puzzles were there just for the sake of being puzzles, but all had a reasonable solution.Overall, I had a pleasant experience, in a dark and creepy way.			"

												I studied in Plymouth for three years at the college of art, so I picked it up for a bit of fun.I was expecting a nice dose of historical interpretation and some nice gritty story telling.  Instead the game just crawled on all fours not leaving a good impression at all.Getting to the second character, the game decided to let me skip an interaction and then wouldn't progress any further.  I am incredibly bored from the slow pace and from walking around in circles for so long.  I ended up resorting to guides and such which is how I discovered there was a missing interaction, it's the only thing that wasn't done, and I couldn't go back and correct it as the character had already up and left.Perhaps the game is just going for a realistic vibe and expects two hours to actually pass before the phone works...Shame really, it's really a very beautiful game, even if it is brain numbingly slow and hasn't provided anything to keep me glued to my seat to play it to completion.The story was possibly starting to get interesting, but I won't know as I don't plan to do it all over again.10/10 to the textures and attention to visual detail.4/10 to the story (to as far as I got)1/10 to the actual game play.

												If you pay $9.99 for this game then you're a bigger fool than you realize.I will say that this game is worth what I paid for it -- 99 cents.  But that's it.The storyline is interesting, though incredibly linear.  I did find the NPCs interesting and the puzzles somewhat interesting, though easy to solve.This game is tremendously TREMENDOUSLY buggy.  You need to save after you figure out each puzzle or you'll be stuck somewhere, unable to use any objects and unable to examine anything.  You won't even be able to re-load, you'll have to quit and begin again.Though interesting at first, the hunt and click gets a little redundant.  Luckily, you can hit the F1 button and be shown all of the ""hot spots"" in the area -- in other words, all of the locations on the screen that you can either use an object or examine.As I said, the game is pretty linear and the puzzles straightforward.  I'd easily pay 99 cents for it again.  But $9.99?  For a game that's five years old?  And buggy?  The developers must think we're all stupid.			"

												The story is definitely the main focus of this game. Playing as two different protagonists, each very well designed with near opposite personalities and extravagant character flaws, yet manage to be extremely engaging while still dis-likable. Easy to play, good controls, characters can run and it'll auto-jump to the next screen.Two complaints, though they cotain minor spoilers.  One major annoyance is that the dialogue keeps referring to the main dead character being buried alive. Buried alive...buried alive...over and over. But he was never buried alive. He was entombed. Above ground, in a tomb. Ugggg.Also WTF happened to the ending. The whole time the story builds towards some alter ego/jeykll hyde type reveal but then ends up going no where. No where at all. There was no ending. Blah!!! Yet, aside from the above two complaints I still really enjoyed this game. I had fun and I'm glad I played it. Totally worth whatever cheapie sale price for which I'm sure it was bought.			"

												Excellent game, at least I enjoyed it very much.  Nice story line. Very good graphics except for minor object handling videos, but that has no effect on the gameplay whatsoever. Think logically and you'll do well in this game.PS. Sorry, can anyone bring back the dog to the manor, I forgot him outside the graveyard in the rain... "

												My recommendation is about as weak as it gets: If there was a Null option, I would have chosen that.I just finished this game, clocking it at 7 hours, half of which, I'm quite certain, was spent walking from place to place. At least, that's how it felt.The game's title is in reference to the fact that the focus swaps between two separate POV characters. One is an Irish pickpocket with plans to travel to America with his best mate (with voice acting that is uniformly and bizarrely listless and monotone). The other is a new detective who is caught up in a murder investigation on his very first day on the job.The story is intriguing and the mystery will keep you guessing for much of the game. Not that you can possibly solve it, but you can at least make wild guesses that will almost assuredly be utterly inaccurate. It's not your fault; that's how it was written.The gameplay is very linear and the puzzles vary from snoozingly simplistic to vaguely difficult, and none of them should be particularly hard to overcome, though some are easy to overlook if you forget to talk to someone or inspect an intem in your inventory properly.Other than the primary POV character, the voice acting is actually quite good, and the art is very well done. (well, other than the point at which the good detective is standing upon the hand of a murder victim, anyway) There is very little music other than during the cut scenes, which are not particularly obtrusive and do serve to fill out scenes between gameplay quite nicely. There are subtitles, so you can skip forward, and nearly all dialogue during gameplay can be repeated, so if you miss something, you can go back through. However, you can't replay cut scenes or a few auto-play moments, so don't skip forward. Especially near the end. Also, there are a number of scenes where the subtitles aren't in boxes but rather are actually cut off at the bottom of the screen, making them rather difficult to read. A couple of ""leave area"" hot spots have that same issue.Speaking of the end, don't blink or you'll miss it and find yourself staring at the main menu (not even credits) wondering what in the everloving hell just happened. To say that it is abrupt is putting it mildly. And even if it were longer, it would be no less unsatisfying and jarring. It looks suspiciously like there was a plan for a sequel, however the studio closed the year after this game was released, so there is no hope of the terrible ending ever being mitigated. (I don't know if they ran out of money and that's why they ended it this way, or if this game killed the studio in revenge for that ending)I'd take the ME3 ending over this and be happy, it's just that atrocious. The Good:* Voice Acting is quite well done, with one unfortunately major exception* Tone is fairly even, despite the swap between POV protagonists* The puzzles aren't terribly difficult, though they can be a bit simplistic at timesThe Bad: * Having music during gameplay would go a long way* Walking takes forever and there's rather too much of it* There are plot threads and hot spots that never get resolved* Neither of the protagonists is particularly likeable, so playing as them is kind of gratingThe Ugly:* That horribad ending... WTF?!?Rating: 58%This game could come in at a solid 75% or so if it weren't for the few notable flaws. It loses a full 10% for the ending alone, plus another 5% for Tim's voice actor sleeping-walking through the entire adventure. The slow pace and uneven quality on the subtitles and controls take out a few more percentage points. It had the makings of a solid, if unremarkable adventure game, and most of the time, that's what you've got. Unfortunately, it's flaws are unavoidable, and thus I can't in good consience give it more than the most tepid of recommendations. If I could give it a Null Recommendation, I would.TLDR: It's ok enough, but you've been warned about the primary POV's sleep-inducing delivery and that ending... that terrible, execrable ending... >_<			"

												So this is a surprisingly hard review to make, largely because there aren't many negative things to say about this game. It's a little old, sure, and with that can come technical problems and dated visuals, but that's something one has to expect. The awkward animations are actually a little charming, seeing how far the technologies have come since then. What is surprising though is how well the backgrounds and settings hold up. Although, yes, they tend to be a little colourless and depressing, they're gorgeously drawn and come in a crisp, high resolution. I'm kind of a stickler when it comes to 2D texture working, especially with these kinds of 3D/2D adventure games, and this one did not fail to satisfy me.The character's are voice acted well enough; some of the lines suffer from being read from a script rather than spoken naturally, but the overall quality is just fine. Not a single character is offensive, even the ones that follow pretty blatant stereotypes. The ruffian, the evil minion, the sassy protagonist. I rather enjoyed them and the personalities they carried. Like the voice acting, the story isn't anything ground breaking or shocking. It telegraphs coming twists pretty blatantly and yet it never feels like it detracts from the game. All of this just sort of exists around the real meat of it.That being, of course, the puzzles. This is a very genuine point & click adventure / puzzle game and I adore it for it. The puzzles are great! A few of them do follow a bizarre sort of adventure-game logic, but they never go without subtle (or overt) hinting, and when you're stuck you can always get past it just by looking around, talking to people and inspecting your inventory. My main driving force in this game was always just to solve the puzzle and get to the next one. Really, this is where the game shines, and I don't regret a moment spent playing it.I do wish there's more I could say about it, really. I've spent hours and hours in it already and I feel like it deserves this big fat review. There just isn't much more to it, and that is in no way a detractor. If you're out for a point & click puzzler, you could do a lot worse than this. :]			"

												The good:Nicely detailed backdropsVery well animatedThe puzzles are pretty logical and won't get you frustratedAtmosphericThe bad:The puzzles are a bit on the easy sideThe mouse is sluggish and clicks take a second to registerSlow pace - not for impatient people.The story and dialogue are pretty ... mediocre. It feels like they phoned in most of itThe main character is a bit of a♥♥♥♥♥♥so not everyone will be able to identify with himThe ugly:The voice acting is pretty terrible - I turned it off in no time and pretended it was an old DOS adventure gameI played this game years ago and it hasn't really aged that much - but its flaws are still there today as well. It's a pretty straight forward adventure games but it doesn't really stand out. The voice acting specifically drags the game down. Your character shouldn't sound like he can't be bothered to read his lines. Even the developers knew this because the trailer doesn't contain a single spoken word!			"

												The story is definitely the main focus of this game. Playing as two different protagonists, each very well designed with near opposite personalities and extravagant character flaws, yet manage to be extremely engaging while still dis-likable. Easy to play, good controls, characters can run and it'll auto-jump to the next screen.Two complaints, though they cotain minor spoilers.  One major annoyance is that the dialogue keeps referring to the main dead character being buried alive. Buried alive...buried alive...over and over. But he was never buried alive. He was entombed. Above ground, in a tomb. Ugggg.Also WTF happened to the ending. The whole time the story builds towards some alter ego/jeykll hyde type reveal but then ends up going no where. No where at all. There was no ending. Blah!!! Yet, aside from the above two complaints I still really enjoyed this game. I had fun and I'm glad I played it. Totally worth whatever cheapie sale price for which I'm sure it was bought.			"

												This point-and-click adventure is full of mysteries and disturbing themes, a true detective story that shows the ugly life of the underworld.The overall mood of this game is ominous. The bad feeling is growing stronger as the game progresses, and when a shocking plot twist finally happens, it's hardly possible to think of any other outcome for both protagonists who are anything but nice. The puzzles here are neat and the visual style is solid, but this is the story that really makes the game undeniably worth playing.			"

												I loved the suspense of this game, which kept me engaged for hours at a time. But I really didn't like the ending. Is there a sequel or was it planned this way. All in all it is worth playing. I would recommend it and have already.			"

												It's hard not to recommend this game though obviously it was done in a hurry in the end. Backgrounds are beautiful and atmospheric. Puzzles are ok, playing as detective is especially good. I liked how they did this investigation thing. Apart of very abrupt ending it is very nice game. Looks like mix of Black Mirror and Still Life			"

												Stumbled upon this gem of a game a few years ago, and its imagery never escaped my mind.  Every scene has such detail and style, with perfect voice acting to go with it, you feel immersed in the story fairly easily.The puzzles aren't ridiculous, and overall the game is pretty forgiving.  It is challenging at parts but incredibly rewarding.  Characters you can relate to and converse with at will.  And a satisfying ending to a fairly decent lengthed game.Recommended to any point-and-click adventure fan out there.  Despite me not being much into crime stuff, this crime-themed game was just unbelievably good.  Give it a shot!			"
