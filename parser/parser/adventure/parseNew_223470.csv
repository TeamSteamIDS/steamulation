												Postal 2 is exactly what you make of it. Yes, it can be a gruesome, unsavory, albeit cartoony, experience, and the game does push you to that end most of the time, but it can also be a open world game that allows you to explore a satirical world filled with both hilarious situations and expectations that speak volumes about paranoid, and in many ways complacent, mid-2000s America. In many ways, it shows how trivial the concerns of the time actually were in the grand scheme of things. Postal 2 needs to be given more credit for pushing the envelope for games; what was once considered taboo was torn apart and amplified in this game. Wholly recommended as an experience.			"

												The prequel to Animal Crossing (Orig. Doubutsu no Mori, released in 2001 for the Nintendo 64), Postal 2 is an experimental first look at how Animal Crossing would eventually expand. Explore a large, bustling town where each NPC has their own schedule, and you can perform menial-but-fun tasks in any way you wish. Featuring many food items, as well as the ability to use the signature 'shovel' item from Animal Crossing, this game has endless possibility for fun. Spend hours gathering all of certain kinds of items, just to say that you did! Fans of Animal Crossing will not be disappointed - I give this game an 11 out of Shigeru Miyamoto.			"

""I know what you're thinking, but the funny thing is, I don't even LIKE videogames...""Postal 2 is a insane first-person shooter that takes place in Paradise, Arizona, yet it's far from being a paradise.The StoryIn Postal you play as The Postal Dude, a tall thin man with a goatee, sunglasses, a blue alien t-shirt, and a long black leather coat. The story takes place throughout one week. Each day you complete mundane tasks created by your nagging wife. As the days go on the town gets progressively worse with protestors, terrorists, and even the undead.GameplayGameplay consists of first-person shooting with a handful variety of armaments. The difficulty scales from Liebermode to Really ♥♥♥♥ing Hard. On harder difficulties, health items are instantly used on pick-up and civilians will attack on site. This game features secret weapons and ammo giving you an advantage on what's to come. There's a plethora of achievements each consisting of a reference like Loverboy's song Everybody's Working for the Weekend and Modern Family[en.wikipedia.org]. Even though this game was created  back in April 13, 2003, the game still gets weekly updates from glorious Running With Scissors, and still can beat today's 'next-gen' games.Pros:Original StorylineComical murderStill gets updatesModsAchievementsReplay valueCons:Combat kinda feels mundaneSome glitchesNo co-op campaignCan't kill Mike J enoughSo, what are you waiting for? Buy the game!Toploader totally didn't force me to make this review. Help. "

												Do you like Postal 2? The first game was a little too Columbine for my tastes, but when Postal 2 came out in '03, I think the series really came into its own, commercially and artistically. The whole game has a clear, crisp level of violence, and a new sheen of consumerate decadence that really gives the mindlessness a big boost. It's been compared to Manhunt, but I think Postal has a far more sarcastic, cynical sense of humor.In '04, RWS released this, Apocalypse Weekend, their most insane content addon. I think their undisputed addition from this was the destruciton of Paradise, an ending so gratifying, most people don't pay attention to the message. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of destroying and moving on, and the importance of the post-Cold War era, it's also a personal statement about how Vince feels about the Middle East in general.HEY PAUL			"

												POSTAL 2I remember when this first came out and I was so amused by it I’ve bought it twice since that long ago day. The developers are testament to the game as they’ve continued to support the title and fix bugs etc. Seriously, whilst the game may be lacking in graphics it makes up for it in crudeness, lewd behaviour and endless laughs of plain stupidity. Consider yourself amonsgt the ranks of a decent gamers if you make it past Saturday. I still have yet to and I’ve played it on/off for 7 years! Something about putting cats on the end of my shotgun for silencer... hmm.. can't seem to resist throwing an officer a urine soaked donut and luring him with, or chasing gimps with my own, endless stream of pee.

												Leave any reservations at the door before playing Postal 2 and you're in for a good time. Cut people to pieces, light them on fire then urinate on them to exinguish the flames or stick a cat on the end of a shotgun and fire away. Or don't do any of this and just be a nice, normal citizen.In this game you're The Dude, going around doing things like collecting milk and a paycheck, but something always manages to go horribly wrong and you're forced to murder everyone in your near vicinity. It's like a poor man's Grand Theft Auto, without the driving, constant cinematics and only mimimal social commentary.Damn good fun for anyone who doesn't have a stick up their butt and the expansion packs and recent DLC are all great also.Full video review:

												I updated this dated review a bit for higher quality standards and updated informations. Also make sure to check out my little bit shorter Paradise Lost review.http://steamcommunity.com/id/xlucyferx666/recommended/360960/Postal 2.One of the best games I have ever played in my life.I mean it serious. I know this game for many years already and played definitely over 300 hours in it (CD & DVD Version). And now it came to Steam. This is the best thing that could have ever happened to it. I bought the game quite often in different editions like the Boxed Edition, Fudge Pack Edition and 10th Anniversary Edition. I also have some other items like a talking Krotchy doll.Its amazing how much work and heart the developers put into this game.It still gets updates 12 years after the actual release. Probably the longest supported game in history? Actually it wasnt updated for several years to be honest. It was quite around Postal for many years. Not even Postal 3 changed this fact, especially because it wasnt as good as the most people wanted it to be. It wasnt developed by RWS anyway. I think this game was ok but couldnt reach Postal 2 in any way. I personally do not recommend Postal 3 because its buggy and glitchy as hell. Maybe wait for some proper patches/mods one day...Now to the actual game review.In Postal 2 you play as The Postal Dude. One of my favorite game characters of all time. A man living with his wife in a motorhome in the city Paradise.You have to do normal things like buying stuff in the store or returning books to the mall. Or getting a christmas tree. Those sort of tasks you have to finish to progress in the game.But this isnt often as easy as we would wish. The crazy city Paradise comes always into our ways. The police, protestors, priests, god*amn even Osama wants us dead. But we can defend ourself and attack back with several weapons. One of the biggest weapon collections ever seen in a game. This Steam versions has even more than the old version. A lot of AWP and ED weapons have been added. Not all but many which doubles the fun. Pistols, shotgun, scissors to rocket launchers. We can also pee on everyone and everything. It was never easier to take a p*ss. Also the gore has been raised extremely. Now you have the same gore amount that was included in the addon Apocalypse Weekend, which is btw included. We can also grab our dog or cat to fight against the citizens but cats are mostly just useful to silence your guns. No, I'm not kidding. There are also other items ingame like ""health pipes"". Yeah, you know what I mean. In addition to that there are a lot of secrets and goodies ingame! The game is actually open world but with several levels that are only visitable on certain days. Yes the game has days. Monday to Sunday actually. The standard Postal 2 was Monday to Friday but the addon added Saturday and Sunday. You can play Monday to Friday or Saturday and Sunday or the whole week. Everything is possible when you start a new game. Oh and because we came to the start a new game part. There are so many difficulties! I cant remember such a big difficulty amount in any other game. No clue how many exactly there are but definitely over 10! Every of those difficulties offers a different game experience. From the people who hit you with shovels to people who shoot with rocket launchers at you and who are insulted already when you look at them. There is everything. I think that should be enough about the game itself.The game also has a multiplayer but I think most here wont care for it anyway, its not much played. Its not horrible but kinda outdated, but no wonder. There are still sometimes a few players to find.The game itself runs with the Unreal Engine 1.5 or 2 when im right. Some hybrid of it.So it means that this game is dated. If you await nice fancy graphics, you are at the wrong address. But the engine does what is should. It has also been updated with the latest patches released on Steam. Before Steam it was kinda unstable and crashed often. This problems are by now fixed. Also Steamworks has been integrated. Also archievements and trading cards. Workshop exists now too. So everything that a actual game needs, right?But there are so many fixes and changes by now, that I cant even say them all.Best to check out the store page. Incredible work by the devs!Well, what else should I say.Postal 2 has nothing really to do with Postal 1, yes I played this also.It was often criticized in the media and banned from a lot of countries due to its gore and seriousness. Doesnt hit everyones taste. I really feel the love the developers put into this game and Postal 2 is between my favorite games of all time. And this game list consists out of Crysis, Fallout etc. I often dare to think about Postal 2 being an Indie game, even if it is. I really love to see this game here on Steam. I bet it will never really die and also todays gamers will always have access to it. It is often on sale for a joke price so definitely a must have! By now there is even a new DLC which adds many hours of new gameplay. I will review this in a seperate review.Positives:- Big free roam map- Includes Apocalypse Weekend- Biggest amount of secrets ever- Unique in nearly every way- Great main character- Gary Coleman- Biggest arsenal of weapons ever- You can pee on everyone and everything- You can finish the game without any violence- GORE- Voice of Rick Hunter (Postal Dude)- Still support after 12 years- Many new features and fixes since Steam release- Osama is ALIVE- Realife Simulator!- Still working Multiplayer with a few players- New addon after 12 years, holy hell!- Steamworks integration, Workshop, MODS!- Best black humor ever in a videogameNegative:- Dated Graphics- Might not hit everyones tasteReplayability: Very HighMy score? 9.5/10Many people may dont understand this rating but thats just how it is.This game really serves as a love letter to fans. I never recall any other developer to put so much work, especially after so many years, into a game.Postal 2 was between one of my first PC games, no crap.For me this game is unique how it is and cant be compared to any other game.And another part, I just felt like I have to add it...THANK YOU Running With Scissors for making this amazing game for us.And even keeping up the support, releasing patches and even a whole new DLC!This is simply so amazing. This is the reason why I think Running With Scissors is the best developer ever. No kidding. Nobody else puts so much work into a loved videogame franchise!Its stuff like that, that I would wish from other developers. There are so many games by now that just wasted to dust and often doesnt even run properly anymore. I dont think it would be so hard to release hotfixes for them. But 90% of all devs dont do this.

												This game is exactly what your parents and elders think about how an average video game look like.Postal 2 it's that kind of game that lets you use a pimp suit while walking in the street peeing random people without any preoccupation.An open sandbox full of lots of hours of twisted fun, im my opinion it's a game that everyone should try, it's a bit old but you'll get an original storyline, mod support (let the nightmare continue), a high amount of weapons and NPCs to make your personal hell, what else can you expect from this game? Wanna use a cat as an assault rifle suppressor?Wanna kick on the balls to Gary Coleman?Wanna make your own zombie army?Wanna run with scissors?Wanna buy it by error realizing that was Portal 2?Wanna randomly throw flying kicks to innocent people?Wanna fly using a shovel while you're under effects of drugs?Wanna see all the higly disturbing and politically incorrect things you can do here?, Just buy it dammit!I regret nothing ...

												Intentionally ironic and satirical, Postal 2 picks up where its predecessor left off – as a game that, while highly controversial, is loads of fun.If you have a twisted sense of humor, if you hate cats and enjoy South Park, Beavis and Butthead, Jackass or any of those other guilty pleasures then you will certainly find plenty to smile about while exploring Paradise.A nonstop tour de force of insulting insanity. And even though I should be disgusted by the potty humor and derogatory caricatures, I had a blast playing through it. Postal 2 just cries out for multiplayer, particularly when you can lay down a snaking path of gasoline for half a block and light it up; what a way to trap and kill your local or online friends! Alas, it's not there.I can take points away from the game for many things, but none of these things really detract from the fun that you can have with this game. The game is about one thing, and one thing only - fun. And it delivers.			"

												Have you ever had one of 'those' days?This is THE violent video game. This game was one of many others that parents all across the United States wanted banned so that their children wouldn't have their eyes spoiled by its horrific imagery. Now you can experience all of its excessive, abhorrent content on Steam.First of all let me say that this game is a personal favorite of mine. I had played it at a friend's place way back and loved it, but never had a chance to buy it. So when I saw that it was on Greenlight I thought 'Hey, why not?' and gave it an enthusiastic thumbs up. The day it released I bought it, pretty excited to experience it again nearly a decade later. I was not disappointed. This game has aged considerably well, considering it was made in 2003. However, its age does show.Pros:+The gameplay, controls, and combat are tight. Being how old this game is, there was no dime-a-dozen cover mechanics or regenerating health, so strafing, bunny-hopping, and repeatedly crouching up and down behind low cover while firing are some tactics that work. Reloading is for losers and newbies, so feel free to waste all three-hundred shots of your AR15.+The comedy of this game hasn't lost its humor. Being an over exaggerated parody of life in the United States during 2003, a lot of the jokes made still hold water to this day. Overbearing banks, corrupt priests, trigger-happy cops, stereotypical Islamic terrorists, religious cults, cannibals,♥♥♥♥♥♥y rednecks, people simply not giving a damn, the whole shebang viewed and commentated from the eyes of a sarcastic cynic just trying to get through a pretty hectic week.+Techincally, this game is pretty stable and has some interesting features. I haven't seen any game-breaking bugs, but I have had a crash or two. If you ever get stuck somewhere in the world (which is bound to happen considering it's a free-roaming sandbox) the game teleports you to a nearby spot free of charge. There are also some small pieces of unimportant mechanics that are superflorus but fun. Exploring around is rewarded with interesting to downright strange results. Attaching a cat to your barrel to suppress your weapon is a neat but useless feature. Placing a donut on the ground and taking a leak on it will have an interesting outcome. Speaking of which, this game still has the best urine physics I've ever seen in a game... oddly enough.+A large, open world to explore and wreak havoc in.+A multiplayer, though I don't know how active it is.Cons:-The gameplay feels old. You've probably seen or played a game that had similar combat to this and that may be a downside to you. The gameplay isn't also 'realistic'. So no aiming down the sights or jelly on your face when you get shot.-The comedy of this game will turn off a lot of people, considering how carebear people have gotten on the internet lately. If you are easily offended by racial stereotypes, large amounts of cursing, ultraviolence, animal abuse, graphic vomitting and urination, homophobia, whatever, then this game is definitely not for you; stick to Gone Home, that will probably be more your speed.-Quite short, with a very simple story so if you are looking for a 'cinamatic adventure' you should probably look elsewhere.All in all, I recommend this game if just for a single playthrough. You want a numbered score? 8/10.I regret nothing.			"

												This is the game that all anti-video game politicians are referring to when they're spewing rhetoric about violent video games, whether they know it or not. POSTAL 2 is a delightful sandbox FPS where the only real goal is to finish your daily To-Do Lists.Now, you CAN simply walk directly to the supermarket, pick up some milk, pay the cashier, and leave; OR you could slaughter your way there, steal the milk, kill everyone in the building, and then urinate on their corpses - it's 100% up to you. For the most part, the game's tagline is correct: ""It's only as violent as you are,"" but there are definitely some parts of the game where you *have* to absolutely kill everything in sight to survive.Oh also in the Apocalypse Weekend expansion you get to go Gallagher on some mad cows with a sledgehammer - definitely one of the best parts of the game, second only to the Tourettes Zombies.This is a game that should be in EVERYONE'S library, because it's the perfect game for letting off some steam. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ day at the office? Go blow up some elephants. Proffessor giving you a hard time in class? Set fire to a marching band. About to shoot up your workplace because you just absolutely can't take it anymore? Please don't, and instead take your anger out on hallucinations of mutated, nightmarish Gary Colemans (also, seek therapy).This game is a bit over 10 years old, but the magnificent mother ♥♥♥♥ers at Running With Scissors are rad enough that they've continued to update it with numerous patches, additional content, workshop support, and achievement support.9/10 only because 10/10 is reserved for Half Life 3.Oh and ♥♥♥♥ Uwe Boll.

												This is definitely one of those games you're either going to love, or you're going to absolutely hate.It's a cult classic and almost a straight parody of the late 90s and early 2000s ""Videogames make people violent"" debates popular of those times. At the time of it's release there was no other game as politically incorrect, dark and downright disturbing as this and... I love it.As an Australian it was even banned here until the R-18+ classification was granted for videogames so the only way to get it back then was to buy it off the Running With Scissors website, which I did and never regretted.Postal 2 is like a B grade movie that knows it's a B-grade movie, it's presentation is dodgy, the writing can use a lot of work but you just adore it anyway. It's humor is great if you like dark humor, it's a great sandbox and the game is even quite a challenge if you push yourself into the harder difficulties.The gameplay is average.The guns and gunplay are extremely poor.The AI is either extremely stupid, or downright unfair.The Graphics, even for it's time were weak.The map design is lack-lusterThe sound design and music is extremely average.Despite all this, Postal 2 is still one of the greatest games I've ever bloody played.And for the $10 steam is asking, you don't really have anything to lose. You at least owe it to yourself to try one of the most, if not THE most controversial game ever made.			"

It's old, clunky, ugly as sin, offensive just for the sake of being offensive, and yet there's a certain South Park sort of spectrum of hilarity to it.That and it's still being kept up to date 13 years later, including the release of a whole new expansion.

												I got a refund for Postal 2 after I felt like my money could be better spent on a bigger game.I regret it, this game was amazing, and I didn't realize it until I stopped playing.POSTAL 2 is offensive, it gives you a lot of options, and allows you to go wild, but at no point, and I do mean at no point, are you forced to do any of those offensive options, the game lets you play passively, even when there are a ♥♥♥♥ton of anti-videogame protesters, tree activists and terrorists trying to kill you, you're never forced to pull out and M16 and shoot them, you're not forced to♥♥♥♥♥♥on someone's mouth, you're not forced to grab a cat and use it as a silencer, they are never even encouraged.If you try those actions, and you say something like ""This game is super offensive and disgusting"" it's totally your own fault for doing it, and suddenly this game felt like pure genius, a game where people are free to be as violent as they want to be. (Within a radius of remaining immature but funny controversial content.)Please try this game, and I give you a challenge, I want you to resist the temptation to♥♥♥♥♥♥on everyone, or shoot any civilians, or in fact, I disallow you to use weaponry.Pacifist.Do it.

The protagonist/antagonist sounds like a f***ing wheezy moron. Everyone else, save the always attractive females, are equally lame. It's redundant, too.+ Wandering and experimenting with the many ways in which a man can die Postal 2 is a really awesome game! I recommend this to anyone who loves violent games.

												The sequel to one of the edgiest games in the 90s, Postal 2 switches to a First Person perspective and has a more humorous story.This game had a big modding community back at the time of release, it was good to be a part of. AWP and other mods added all sorts of new weapons, items and maps. The multiplayer and custom servers were great at the time too. But this is still a great game to play today, so go ahead!P.S - Look for a mod in the Steam Workshop named Nicks COOP if you want to play the single player campaign COOP with a friend!			"

												This game is more than a sandbox game. It's a simulator of a worker who goes postal. That last statement is actually false. You can choose to go through the whole game WITHOUT going postal. So its more of a game of right or wrong. Other than that lets start the review.This game is always being updated so don't worry about that. They usually release a update around a holiday such as halloween 2014. In the halloween 2014 update instead of terrorists there are SPOOKY SCARY SKELETONS THAT COME FROM THE GATES OF HELL (and yes I literally mean they come from the gates of hell). With the steam workshop feature there is a infinite amount of things you can do in postal 2. So this is classified as a open world, fps, sandbox game. If you were to relate this to garry's mod than you're completly wrong. This game is nothing like garry's mod. If you were to relate it GTA you'd still be wrong and besides GTA is third person anyway :special:. Postal 2 is its own kind of game. It's one of a kind and there will truely be nothing like this for decades to come. Hell, Postal 3 couldn't even compete with Postal 2. I'd say the closest a game got to postal 2 would be goat simulator. It goes on the same principle as postal 2. You can choose to act like a normal goat or go around rampaging the city. See how the two are alike? But, still, the two games are completly different.Who said you going postal was a bad thing? You can go and destroy terrorist organizations, Protest/deal with protesters, etc. Or you can go on a rampage with cat silencers and bombs and gasoline. That works too.I would reccomend you to buy this game ASAP. It's worth every penny.			"

												Definitely a good game. Great humor that goes against what the majority of society feels is appropriate. And is definitely very theraputic after a long stressful day of work. Edged weapons are the best choice, screw most guns in this game. Sometimes takes 2 to 3 headshots with a shotgun at point blank range to take out cops and certain enemies. Hedge clippers and machete. Enough said. Play fetch with your dog with a severed head.I definitely recommend this game, especially if you have a special sense of humor like I do.			"

												Postal 2. What can I say. This game is probably one of the funniest games ever concieved by humanity. I can tell not a single ♥♥♥♥ was given whilst writing the story. But I'm warning you. If you can't take a joke, or can't stand the sight of blood, what the Hell are you doing here? Go back to your stupid little ecchi animes, this is a man's game.Pros:-Great humor -Because of this, the game is even better with friends-Funny storyline-Violent combat -Even moreso with weapon mods-Badass protagonist -Developers who at the same time, care about the game, and don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥(in a good way)Cons:-Loading screens can be kinda lengthy-If you can't stand violence or obscenity, you're gonna have a♥♥♥♥♥♥timeSo, there you have it. The pro's heavily outweigh the cons. 10/10. If you're considering buying it, stop hesitating and BUY IT!			"

												Game name: Postal 2 Game score: 9.5/10Reviewed by: WolfIn Summary...Postal 2 is the successor to the contraversial series, Postal, which hit the stores on April 12, 2003. The story features The Postal Dude, or just Dude for short, and his adventures across the week doing various errands. Things more than often turn hasty, leaving a simple chore of ""picking up milk"" into slaying some Al-Queda members. Each day features a list of 3-4 errands to run, across all 5 days of the week (and 2 in the ""Apocalypse Weekend"" mode). The DLC, Paradise Lost, features almost the same layout: 5 days of errands, but no weekend. All in all, it's quite a different experience, yet not in a bad way at all, more of a substantial addition to the FPS family. Controls:WASD - MovementQ - KickE - Holster weaponR - Unzip pants (to pee) C - CrouchK - SuicideG - Yell somethingMouse - LookMousewheel - Switch weapons (scroll)1 - 0 - Choose different weapons if availableLeft click - Primary fireRight click - Secondary fireSpace - JumpZ - Drop weaponE/Enter - Use item or hand it overX - Drop itemM - Map[ or ] - Select item in inventoryGameplay:Each day you're able to do various tasks in order to complete the day. There's usually 3 tasks (some days have added tasks after one is completed, so 4). The days are outlined like a normal week; Monday - Friday, and the option to play a bonus mode called Apocalypse Weekend, which is Saturday and Sunday. Starting from your lovely home, Dude usually leaves with his wife ♥♥♥♥♥ing at him, as the game says, and given a task from her to do like pick up a book or cash a check. These tasks always turn hasty, ranging from psycho video game activists to terrorists attacking you and trying to kill you. Equipped with many weapons, the Dude has plenty to keep him protected, as well as sometimes a helper (like Champ, his dog) to assist you in your quests. Graphics:Graphics are not the games strong point, if only the only thing keeping anyone from buying this. Please, do not take this in the wrong way, the game is everything as interesting as if it was made in UE4. Realize it's a game from 2003, and this should help. Now, there's mods and everything to help things pop, I found one to make the mountains less flat and still doesn't decrease performance. There's also ENB's to reshade everything to your liking to not make it so bright, and also HD textures as well. I'm not saying the graphics are a super huge deal that this is a necessity, but some prefer to have the options to do so. I played the whole game and the DLC before I realised there were these things, and I still loved it. Game Balance:There's 10+ modes to choose from in difficulty, ranging from Easy to Impossible. Changing modes does not hinder your experience, each mode has the same content. Most people just play on Liebermode (easiest of all) just to play through the end. I have played all modes, including Postal. Jesus Christ it was a trip. OtherI need more DLC for this game, or a working Share the Pain for Windows10, please RWS. Final Rating:9.5/10In Conclusion:This game is an excellent example of how an FPS should feel, and with its customizability and humor, I literally did not go wrong buying this game. It was super fun playing through it, and every day was a blast. I wish there was more to it or at least a few more DLC's but that honestly is less priority than the real game. Concider picking it up if you have the money, it's often on sale on Steam for $1. Please feel free to follow my curation page for more recommendations. Thanks for reading!			"

												I have been meaning to do a review of this game for awhile, and here i am doing one.Okay i am going to be totally honest.I LOVE this F-ing game!I love the humor, i love the story, i love the crazy batsh*t insane sh* that goes down.. all of it.BUT... i do sadly find myself wanting to use cheats every time i play it... i'm not very good at FPS games sadly.So even though i have to cheat my♥♥♥♥♥off to enjoy this game, it's still worth the price.Once upon a time, i seen this game talked about on G4 as well as Tech TV back in the day.. and i remember seeing the player♥♥♥♥♥♥on someone.... it was at that moment i thought to myself.. i MUST play this game.Sadly i had NO damn clue where to get it... could not find it sold anywhere physically.So some years later go by, and i am unaware of steam mind you... i sit back and start looking up the game thinking ""where can i get that game?!"" Sadly the first time i owned it was maybe 3 years ago.. i found an illegal copy and i DLed it and went to town... you gotta remember, i had NO clue where to get it.. and i WOULD have paid for it...but could not find it and had no clue who made the game.Fast forward to earlier this year.. and BAM i have steam and it turns out the game IS on steam.. eventually i get the money and i buy it cause.. well.. i rather support the developers, i'm not a thief..I have been playing it since, and wow what a ride.. the steam version is way better and way more stable than that illegal copy, plus i can play the weekend story.This game is really ♥♥♥♥ing funny, especially in what you can do... the moment i♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in someone's mouth and they threw up and ran of screaming.. i laughed so d*mn hard and thought ""wow.. perfect game, right here!"".The dude reminds me of me and my life.. me just trying to live day to day.. and everyone around me crazy in their heads!All i can say is after playing through and fighting the madcow deamon... i sat back going..""okay i need more of this, there has got to be more!"" and sadly Postal 3 i have heard some bad things about so have yet to buy it..Can not WAIT for the new DLC being worked on, and i will be so happy when it releases because it will be a day one buy for me!By the way, i wish to say i am sorry to the developers RWS for basically stealing the game at first... i hope me buying it on steam makes up for it.

												Postal 2 has you play as ""The Postal Dude"", going through a week of various tasks to complete as you roam around the world doing whatever you please. Whether it's you getting some milk at a convience store, getting Gary Coleman's autograph or stealing a X-Mas tree, the variety is surely there. Along your journey, you have a decent arsenal of weapons such as a tazer and gasoline to light people ablaze. The game is fun and strangely addictive. You never feel like the tasks are being forced apon you and you can also do them in any order you like; some errands you can do in multiple ways which gives you some freedom that is needed. Postal 2 is also very humorous and over-the-top, while it sometimes steps over the boundaries, it's a game where you must take lightly. Apart from the ""career"" mode, there is also multiplayer and DLC. The multiplayer has not been working for me, nor is anyone playing it. The Apocolypse Weekend DLC is less of my taste. Going a linear road and more action oriented was a change of pace, it was still hilarious but it didn't enhance the game in any way. Postal 2 often has great moments and hilarity usually insues. While the game isn't polished, the gameplay is certainly there to give players one hell of a time. PROS:+Fun and Addicting+Hilarious+Great Moments+Variety+Cheap Price+Available Freedom+Weapons are satisfying to use+Modding Support(Future SteamWorkshop may be added)CONS: -Broken Multiplayer-DLC (Apocolypse Weekend) isn't that great-No ""real"" storyOverall, Postal 2 was a great buy. I got it for $2.50 while it was on sale, which was one of the best purchases I did in awhile.POSTAL 2 COMPLETE: 8.0/10			"

												This is, hands down, one of the best games - and expansion/DLCs - I have to kill time, especially when I am not in the mood to play anything else. It's ridiculous, over-top-top, requires little to no real thinking, and is full of offensive humor. It's definitely not a game for everyone, and if you don't deal well with extreme violence or intentionally offensive stereotypes then you should probably stay away, but otherwise, it's a fun ride from beginning to end - so long as you don't take it too seriously.TL;DR: 10/10 would willingly slap people with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ until they died over and over again.

												One of the most bizarre and controversial titles of the early 2000s is back and it’s found its way onto STEAM. Postal 2 Complete has been greenlit by the community, which either means that its now better than ever or that we’ve all completely lost our minds.After playing the game again, it would seem as though the latter is true.In Postal 2, you are given a number of errands that you must complete each day. While the errands are similar to what most of us would call “missions”, their objectives are often much more simple than the missions we’ve become accustomed to in RPGs and other titles. In a testament to this, one of the first errands you have to run is to go to the store and get some milk. The atmosphere of the store is hilarious, as the middle eastern music blasts and the shopkeeper insults all of the patrons in his shop. The brilliance of Postal 2 is the non-linear manner in which you can complete your errands. Do you just pay for the milk or do you just grab it and then fight your way out of the store, hitting everyone in your path with a shovel? The choice is yours. I should warn you though, the shop keeper is packing serious heat.			"

												Let me start by saying Postal 2 will let you knock off someone's head, and urinate down the stump.Still interested? Good.Postal 2 is, at it's heart, a game for everyone, that anyone can relate to. You play as a guy who has errands to run throughout the week. How you get those errands done is up to you, but that's only part of the game - the other is, trying to get those errands done while surrounded by dim-witted, poorly dressed psychopaths.What will you do when you get your milk? Pay 5 bucks for a quart, or just walk out with it? Maybe set the place on fire? Maybe set EVERYTHING on fire? Smack people with a shovel to get to the front of the line? Pee in their eye? Drop a diseased cow head, causing everyone in its vicinity to hemorrhage blood from every orifice until they die, while the screaming survivors run out the door, only to be met by a carefully laid booby trap of grenades, blowing them apart in all directions? Maybe ""borrow"" a police uniform beforehand, so the cops don't chase you around while you do this?...not that I've ever done that.Postal 2 is definitely showing its age now, 11 years from its launch. However, unlike a lot of games, it has aged very, very well. The humor is tasteless, the violence is gratuitous, the various goings-on around Paradise are nothing short of pants-crappingly stupid. For all these reasons (and more), it is a brilliant gem of a game. If you have ever bumped into someone in public, been cut off in line, talked down to, or generally annoyed by anyone in your own life, you will find some representation of it in Postal 2.And you can hit it with a shovel.-----On a somewhat more serious note: I always thought it was brilliant what this game provided for players - an outlet to get out all of those ""OMFG IMMA KEEL JOO"" feelings we build up throughout our day, in a safe, harmless environment where no real people can possibly get hurt. For the time, a game like this was unheard of, and provided an outlet for rage that most people didn't have a healthy alternative for. If anything, RWS was years ahead of its time for this. That they proudly support their fans, even as their fans proudly support them, is just a sexy icing on the win-cake.TLDR: Just buy the stupid game, I've got stuff to do.			"

												In Postal 2, you play as a middle-aged Postman who delivers packages to a plethora of zany and creative citizens within the town of Postland, including an old magician, an ice cream man (who you have a funny brotherly relationship with) and a very happy missionary who loves to spread the joyful word of God. Chock full of fun puzzles and funny, clean humor, I would reccomend this game to anyone of any age, but this game is especially fun and educational towards ages 10 and under. 5/5			"

												This game is not for everyone, I will be honest. Most people will either love it to death or hate it with the passion of a super nova.Imagine the world of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas without the use of cars. Now combine this with the psychotic NPCs, weapon/item gathering, and combat mechanics of Dead Rising (only in 1st person). Sprinkle in enough political incorrectness to challenge South Park and you have Postal 2.If that description sounds good to you, this is probably a must play for you. If it sounded terrible, you have been warned.			"

												Aah... Postal 2. I really do love this game. A game I can play time after time after time over the years since it was launched (and I have), and it NEVER gets old. It remains a title that I feel compelled every once in a while to go back to and play right the way through. It's a game that is a testament to the power of good writing with a sense of the anarchic and absurd, which combine to turn acts of extreme violence (that would otherwise leave a nasty taste in the mouth) into a series of dark comedy vignettes. RWS rock.Done and done.			"

												It breaks all the rules, it aims an enormous pi$$-take towards celebrities and groups/cultures, its secretly the game we all love to play. Paradise Lost takes place a decade after Apocalypse Weekend, the Postal Dude awakens from his 11-year radioactive-induced coma only to find his dog Champ is missing and has to go back to his home town of Paradise, which is now a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Paradise Lost also retcons Postal III as it was revealed that the events of that game were just a nightmare dream that the Postal Dude had during his coma. Thankyou devs, for understanding just how bad Postal 3 was!Expect familiar humour and circumstances in this wonderful, entertaining expansion. Its been a long time Postal, we've missed you.EDIT: Also as a sidenote, this game has the best set of achievements I've ever seen in a game. There are so many references inside them, definitely worth checking them out. For example, ""Fear and Loathing"" for smoking 10 health pipes and 10 tins of catnip in one play session, and ""Finkle IS Einhorn!"" Gave a kickoff to a severed head (Ace Ventura reference). Very well done.			"

""I regret nothing."" ~Postal DudePostal 2 is a game about the life of the Postal Dude, a man who's just trying to get some errands done. Go get some milk, pick up your paycheck, return an overdue library book, etc. Unfortunately for the Dude, not everyone likes him, or what he does. You have to worry about doing things wrong in front of the police or armed citizens, not to mention the groups of people that hate you depending on each day, Taliban, and the military. The game proves, however, that you don't need a buff dude fighting aliens to be a badass, all you need is a scrawny ginger in an alien T-shirt and duster.The game itself is one of the most interesting early open-world shooters I've ever seen so far. Different areas of the map open up depending on the in-game day you're on, and there are many hidden areas to discover within Paradise. Exploration doesn't go unrewarded, however, since you can find many weapons, ammo, and other useful items by exploring your environment. Even places that would be inaccessible can be reached by simply walking across telephone wires.Gameplay in Postal 2 is a bit like GTA, minus the Auto. There are cars in the game, but they serve as explosive props rather than drivable objects. You have a wanted bar that lets you know just how much the police want to cuff you, as well as an inventory used to store your items. Aside from that, other things set it apart from most shooters of its style. You can silence a gun with a cat, throw a boomeranging machete, befriend a dog to kill enemies, and more. I like that the game breaks the fourth wall often as well, as Postal Dude makes remarks about the level design and uselessness of the cars. The game devs themselves, Running With Scissors, are a major part of the game's story.I rate Postal 2 a 9.5/10. This is one of the best early shooters I've played, and definitely one to pick up. "

												Postal 2 is the Citizen Kane of video games. Every single minute detail of this game has been expertly tweaked and polished for hours on end to create the perfect gaming experience. Some may call this game xenophobic, racist, violent, mindless and sexist, but I think it really speaks about our current society, and the way that we demonise those we are unfamiliar with. At the end of the day we are all human and must join together to defeat those capitalist pigs that plague our society. We must focus our efforts on reviving Supreme Leader Stalin from his cryogenic slumber and reclaim our corrupt planet in the name of Communists everywhere. Stay strong my brothers and sisters in arms, a war is coming.			"

												You know those stupid overhyped news stories about how violent video games are negatively affecting today’s youth? This is exactly the kind of game that they’re afraid of. However, if you have any common sense (and a sense of humor) it’s pretty clear that Postal 2 is simply a satire of American paranoia and ignorance. You play as the Postal Dude, aiding him as he completes a list of tasks over the course of a week. As you go about your business, you’ll notice increasingly crazy things happening all around you, such as anti-violent video game protestors who seem to love trying to kill you, trigger-happy police officers, hillbillies who apparently love the movie “Deliverance”, and more. It’s all very ridiculous and over the top, but that’s exactly the point. Postal 2 is crude, extremely violent, outrageous, and lots of fun. Avoid if you’re easily offended. Otherwise, go postal.			"

												There is a lot that can be said about Postal 2. It is obscene enough to be banned in Germany, New Zealand, Australia and a few other countries when it first released one decade ago. As a result, eviewer scores, fueled by moral panic, really dealt a blow to its overall score the first time around. Which is why it is a very good thing that this game got a new re-release on Steam 10 years later, because this game is a real hidden gem that deserves a lot more credit than it got.This game, in its original form, is a sandbox shooter with a lot of offensive and crude humor. It is set in the ironically-named fictional town of Paradise, populated by jerks. Players take on the role of some down-on-his-luck everyman, living on a trailer and about to be laid off. His task is to survive the week by taking on various errands. This seems mundane and uninteresting on the surface, however, littered around the town are tools that let the player cause mayhem and destruction, as well as extremeist and special interest groups that are hell bent on killing the player dead. Not only that, but at various points, events happen that put the player in situations that they must come out of alive.Then, we have the Steam edition of the game, which adds a ton of new extra content, as well as canonizing one of the more popular mods for the game as part of the package. This mod introduces even more enemy types for you to blow up, as well a couple new toys to play with. This mod also offers a more linear mission structure, which provides an interesting contrast to the type of gameplay present in the original game.On top of that, there is a third campaign which combines both the original game and the content of the mod into seven whole days of mayhem. There is even a hidden unlock that players can get if they beat this third combined campaign in the very hard POSTAL difficulty mode.What makes these single player experiences so compelling is the inclusion of choice for the player. They have the ability to choose whether they want to survive the errands peacefully, or if they would like to do so causing as much mayhem as possible. They have a vast potential arsenal of weapons and toys that they can pick up and cause mayhem with. Not only that, a lot of the crude and offensive humor is put there as a biting commentary of the then (and possibly now) fast-food culture and excesses of contemporary western culture. Gameplay-wise, I also like how the wanted system is set up so that your wanted meter only goes up when committing a crime in the proximity of law enforcement.This game also includes a multiplayer portion (Share the Pain) for deathmatch mayhem, and all things considered, it would have been a really fun experience, if the netcode was better. Which is a shame, because that means that having a lag-free experience entails getting all your friends together for a LAN party, which isn't exactly viable if all your friends are spread across the world. There is also the minor issue of game stability and intermittent crashes, however this shouldn't be too much of a problem with the smart use of saves.In short, I would highly recommend that you pick up this game, there is no question about it, as its normal selling price is $9.99 which is a steal for a game with this amount of potential enjoyment. And if this isn't a good enough deal for you, this game now has workshop support, which gives you the option of downloading and playing through a plethora of well-made user content.			"

												(Update, my review got on the RWS site! http://runningwithscissors.com/main/index.php?topic=2024 Just scroll down!)Well this game is basically the most fun I have had in games for years, and let me tell you why in pros and consPROS:The Postal Dude!: You are the Postal Dude, and what do you do? Go postal! The whole point of the game is to cause mayhem and have fun with it, plus he makes alot of funny quips and they are even fun to hear over and over again.The Town: You live in Paradise Arizona, how ironic the name is since the place is full of idiots, gun toting idiots, or bomb toting idiots, but that's the best part about it.Characters: The characters you meet are just so funny and rude that it's hard to find anything bad about them, they are all hilarious.Guns: The guns in this game are so much fun to use, even though you have absolutely no reload, I don't see how a m16 can carry 400 bullets in the clip but I ain't complainin.Peeing on people: Yes, you can do this, you can urinate on somebody till they vomit or just to be a a$$ to them.Dogs and cats: You can use the dogs are friends! They fight with you! And as for the cats...well...you basically put the barrell of your gun up their a$$ and guess what you have? A Kitty Silencer!Gore: This game is very very gorey, blood, chopped limbs, guts everywhere, decapitation, it's fun!Exploring: There are guns and ammo lying all over the place, as well as melee weapons you can find rummaging around, and each day most of the weapons change and won't be there, but new weapons will be in other places.The Errands: Each day you have errands to do, get milk, go to bank, etc. but the fun part about this game is it doesn't feel like a boring old errand, you actually do something in it, for the bank when you go there you can wait in line or Pee on everyone to get out of the way so you can go first.Quotes and Easter Eggs: Easter Eggs are hidden throughout the game, as well as the achievements, the one I seemed to notice in a instant was the Bates Hotel with ""Murder free showers""The civilians: The civilians are just all around hilarious, some are nice, but most are just complete a$$hats, so if you walk through the town and you notice 2 civis fighting each other with guns, you're first thought will be ""What the heck is wrong with this place"" But later on when you start seeing it more you think ""Just another day in Paradise...""Breaking the 4th wall: This is the best part, or one of the best parts, the Postal Dude knows you are controlling him, and he makes quips over it too, if you quick save 2 times in a few seconds he'll sometimes say ""Didn't you just save?"" Or ""My grandmother could beat the game saving as much as you do.""Still being updated: Yes, you read that right, Running With Scissors (RWS) is STILL updating this game even though it's 10-11 years old, they are even making a workshop with it one day too, they extracted ""A week in paradise"" mod and put some of the guns and weapons in the main game itself, these guys must love their fans!Now for the Cons:CONS:Guns: Some guns are highly dangerous, even on lower level difficulty, Rockets can kill you almost instantly, even with armor and full healthGroups: Throughout the game there are groups that end up hating you for doing something to them, IE you go return a book to the library and these Tree Protestors burn the place down while you are in it and you have to kill them to get out and they hate you for the rest of the game, but it's fun as well, it keeps it's pace and when you run into them you can easily run away...or kill them.Saving: Do this alot in the game, cause if you started a level and it auto saves, and you did everything in that area, and died without saving, you have to go through it all over again, so be a Spasstic saver, don't be afraid.Unskippable cutscenes: It gets annoying if you die after watching a cutscene and you didn't save, and you have to do the whole thing over again, seriously? It's not hard to make a skip cutscene button you know.Overall this game is fun as hell, and if you start saving all over the place you can get through those cons with ease, this game deserves a 9-10/10, and it is well worth it, can't wait till they get the Workshop running.

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Postal 2 skip to Results and read from there.Running with Scissors creates a game so brutal and offensive it was banned in many countries upon its original release. Postal 2 offers more than just comedy by providing a fun and intense first person shooter in an non-repetitive environment. Story:The game starts with The Dude, clearly a play off the Big Lebowski who has moved to a small town to take up the career of being a video game star. But life isn’t so easy for The Dude, who must also live his day-to-day life. When playing Postal 2 your missions are to complete the tasks The Dude’s wife gives him, how you do this is up to you. You play The Dude’s life for up to an entire week, and somehow things just get drastically more ridiculous as you move forward. Campaign:Depending on your sense of humor you may love this game, or absolutely hate it. Interestingly Postal 2 is able to achieve dynamic levels of comedy with blatant racism, sexual innuendos, extreme violence, tv/movie references, and much more. Remember this game was made back in 2003, so if you can’t get past older games graphics then this may not be for you. The campaign is as long/short as you make it, if you gun through it you can do it in an hour and a half, if you take your sweet time like myself it’ll probably last 8-10 hours. The game also comes with a variety of different difficulties, I don’t know all their names but there are about 15 or so difficulty levels. Hopefully this should allow everyone to be able to enjoy this game, from the casual relaxed to the extreme. Gameplay:The game is focused around completing errands off a to-do-list that ends up leading to a crazy adventure of terrorists, strip clubs, religious radicals, military, local law enforcement, and even the demons of hell. The game plays like a standard FPS from the early 2000’s. Kind of more a Half/Life style combat as if it could have been made using Gary’s Mod. The map is open world, with directional quests. Sometimes quests will pull you into an area which is more of a guided level, but when you come out the campaign goes back to open world. Overall with the DLC offers a relatively decent length campaign on typical FPS standards. With the incredibly unique weapon choices, from putting a cat on your rifle as a silencer to lighting your foes with gasoline “Postal 2” offers an array of fun and creative ways to go Postal. Hints:>In the police station all the way on the top floor in the locker room is an officer uniform. IF you grab this uniform you can go nuts killing people and the cops won’t care. This uniform will last one day, its well worth if you want to make one day incredibly easy.>You will get multiple weapons that occupy single slots – for example: you will have a sign post, sledge hammer, hatchet, police baton, scythe all occupy number 1. To switch them just keep pressing 1 on your keyboard. This applies to weapons in other slots as well. This may seem obvious, but I didn’t realize I had multiple weapons until the Thursday.  Results:I’d definitely recommend this game, even at full price; although, if you’re hesitant it goes on sale frequently. The campaign is a good length, and even when you’re done you may want to just go back and try playing the game with a different flare. It has a decent difficulty curve, and the optional gameplay style provides a dynamic experience. Not I’d avoid this game if you’re not able to take a joke or are overly sensitive regarding politics and religion. Pros:+Open world map (for 2003 that’s quite impressive).+Funny campaign with amusing story.+Loads of weapons to choose from.+Secrets, got to love those old game secrets.Cons:-Have to keep running with his annoying wife’s errands. I mean really, does she need Milk or Gary Colemans autograph?			"

POSTAL 2 = THE MORE OTT FPS VERSION OF GTAso whats to say, this game puts you in the place of a guy called ""the dude"" in a town where you need to do some simple tasks, but this is where your inner sinner (and no im not religious, ♥♥♥♥ religion) kicks in, you can do whatever, whenever you want wanna kill someone, go ahead, you can use a cat on the end of a shotgun and fire bullets out of its mouth, then the cat itself afterwords, you can kill gimps in super mario land, you can pour petrol/gas on ppl and set them on fire, you can    install a ♥♥♥♥ton of weapon mods and go crazy just like in gta, and more just buy the game if you've not and experiance it for yourself :D 8/10PROS +Nice character +nice guns (both mods and normal ones)+funny asf+GIMPSSSSSSSSSSSSS+Steam Workshop+if you like gore you'll love this+Achievements are funny and there is alot+Loads of places to explore :) CONS-crashes sometimes-wish guns could aim -annoying error where arrow keys scroll through the weapon menu when i want my mouse to do it.

												A heart-warming adventure. Fun for the family. Especially if said family enjoys hacking off someone's limbs, kicking them while you hear their agonized screams, and then promtly lighting them on fire with napalm,  p1ssing on their dead and charred body, and mutilating it beyond recognition.

												There was a time in gaming history when 'worried' politicians and parents were sure that games cause violence. Many of the classics were stomped by suit'n'tie men and women: Quake, Doom, GTA... but one game was known for being the most violent, depraved, senseless depiction of lunacy - POSTAL.First one was isometric shooter and it introduced us to the concept of senseless violence. We've needed to kill everyone and everything to pass the level. Killing was mandatory, and those enemies were no aliens or demonic creatures - they were all (mostly) innocent humans.POSTAL 2 arrived sometimes around 2002 or 2003, can't really tell, and it brought the violence into a 3D world. The game went FPS and Postal Dude fans went nuts about it.Considering that today we have more violent games people play and no one gets mad and there are basically no more politicians, senates, governments and parents deeply worried about what their children play, Postal 2 still stands out as a prime example of total, senseless violence. This game is still 0% politically correct, madness-driven insult toward everyone and everything. It plays nicely on cliches, prejudices and morals - it doesn't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about religions, races, social, economic or sexual orientations - it's against everyone and everything.But is it a good shooter? No, it is not. It is full of glitches, bugs and the reason why it stills stands the test of time is the amount of insults its dispersing every time you launch it. If you're a grouchy intellectual, you might find the whole thing tiring and repetitive, but putting people on fire,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on their corpses or in their mouths until the point they vomit, using cats as silencers, chopping off heads with a shovel is still pretty fun, if you're open-minded, clever person knowing it's all bad humor.

												Surprisingly fun for a 10 year old title. Didn't expect much from it getting it for $0.99 but this is a great game that still holds up. You're let loose upon the politically incorrect, offensive, and amusing world of POSTAL. Given objectives to complete each day (level), you can go about the game as a normal person, but who the hell wants to do that. Lines taking too long? People getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because you walk by them? Pull out your shotgun and blow their heads off. Combat is SO SATISFYING. It's great for blowing off some steam decapitating people with hedge clippers, dousing them in gasoline and lighting them on fire, and urinating on someone until they vomit. Some may call it immature or that you have issues, but this is a hell of a game. Satisfying, BRUTAL, combat.It also has some of the best achievements out there. They're aren't too grindy and are actually very fun to get. Lure a cop with a♥♥♥♥♥♥soaked doughnut, play fetch with your dog using a severed head, kill members of the Taliban in a suicide blast, etc.Due to the open nature of the levels it's pretty replayable and you can lose yourself for hours screwing around.Worth base price. Definitely worth sale price.C U Next Tuesday!			"

												The most artistic indie game I've ever played. In Postal 2, you must resist the urge to be a terrible person in a world that mirror's our own. Guns are everywhere in Arizona, and everyone carries them because of the damned Republicans and their concealed carry laws. The game shows you what can go wrong in such a society, as things get progressively worse every day. It's also a pretty good simulation of life. You can pee in the toilets, (can't flush them though, no use key). You can collect stray cats and deposit them in safe places, You can also find tanks of gasoline and fuel up people's cars. Neat! You can do almost anything your imagination can think of!			"

												Postal 2 is an extreme, unrestrained, and deliberately shocking fps action game with open world elements. Postal 2 is a game that panders to nobody, makes no effort to disguise its crude, satirical humor, and makes every effort to be as violent, repulsive, and entertaining as you want to make it. If I had to describe Postal 2 in two words, they'd be ""consciously repugnant"". That might sound fantastic, and it might sound terrible; it all depends on who you are, of course. Now, before you form your opinion, allow me to describe this in a little more detail:This day in age, Postal 2 is not an outstandingly controversial and/or offensive game, so there's little discussion to be had there. For the squeemish and easily offended, however, this certainly isn't the game for you. Postal 2 is a notably violent and innovatively disgusting game, so much so that it gives the game a certain, revolting charm. If you find that you are not easily offended, nor easily deterred by obscenity, violence, or the somehow comical use of urination, then you should strongly consider playing this game. It is a very unique experience, and if you ask me, an equally enjoyable one. This game earned it's infamy, and it did not disappoint me.Overall Rating=6.8/10 Good, unclean fun			"

												Postal 2 is an openworld-esque game in roughly the same sense that Deus Ex is: Fairly large maps with a loading screen every now and then. It's an errand objective based game spanning across 7 days in where you do a different set of errands in (mostly) any order each day. Errands, which go incredibly wrong most of the time, and involve very much violence.The game has an inventory system of sorts with pretty much no limit except for ammocounts, items include things such as: Healing items ranging from a simple doughnut, to an overpowered health capping drug, as well as catnip which can be used as a bullet time drug, and cats which can literally be used as shotgun silencers. There's also healthkits you can pickup and use immediately, but not carry around in your inventory. The Postal Dude would rather carry an armada of cats and enough fastfood to kill America, but not something sensible like healthkits. Absolutely no complaints here.This has something in common with Shadow Warrior and the Jedi Knight Star Wars games, in that they both have firearms and a really awesome melee weapon(s) you use all the time because it's more effective and more fun, and tons more of decapitations.There's tons of melee weapons, guns, and things to set on fire. If you catch on fire, you can♥♥♥♥♥♥in the air to put yourself out. You can also pour gasoline everywhere in funny shapes and set it on fire to display something stupid, and then set everyone on fire. And then♥♥♥♥♥♥it all out.At one point I got some soldiers I rescued from a secret terrorist base to sign a petition to make whiny old congressmen play violent video games. I couldn't be any happier when this happened.The game's feel and engine is somewhere between Half-Life and Deus Ex and something else. Old crunchy feel to the levels (but not quite that old), and the silly movement bob when you move. Except Postal Dude can take seemingly even more damage than Gordon Freeman himself. All those years of drug abuse must have weaved some sort of kevlar equivalent into his skin or something.Also, at one point, the developers amazingly decided to release an expansion for this game 10+ years after it came out, kind of like how Age of Empires II got new DLC itself. Still can't believe either of those happened.Game kind of runs like trash at times, especially when too many NPCs are thinking, like fighting things and just generally freaking out. I've had 2 crashes in the main game in my roughly 12 hours of playing, so the game is stable enough.So yeah, it's a violent classic. Go buy it and cause chaos, or be a pacifist and just do errands, or something.			"

												This game has been reviewed plenty to give a good idea of what it's like, although I feel like POSTAL 2 does not sell itself as well as it could - mainly since the main joke of their trailers is how bad the game is. It makes it seem not just like a game where the devs didn't take it seriously, but one where they didn't try and this is not the case. I've recommended this game to friends before and they worry that the game will be boring - since there is no plot and the tasks seem bleak. This is just the gimmick though, and I must stress that the actual gameplay goes on way deeper than many other games do. I feel like RWS just don't give themselves enough credit for what they have created.I hope my 150 (current) hours of gameplay is enough to prove this. I've explored basically everything the game has to offer, yet the built-in workshop allows other users to keep providing more content to the game, and is still active, much like the community, despite the game's age. The game's soundtrack also introduce me to my favourite band - Jesus Loves Junkies - which I will always be thankful for.I would definitely recommend buying it, at least to try it out. If you're not so certain, wait for a sale since the game is usually very cheap then, and I believe that 2 hours of gameplay should be enough time to help you decide, and will do a much better job than watching gameplay can, as a weapon always feels better when it's in your hands.

												Postal 2 is where you can do whatever you would like to do irl but cannot because of your pathetic mind set, it's like an early day GTA but with more jokes and racist stereotypes. It brings you into the life of the Postal Dude where you have to do all the chores he gets to do in his everage life. But you might run into a few ""misunderstandings"" on the way...Overall a great game where only your consciense can stop you from mass murder			"

POSTAL 2 Review - Rating: 8.7/10General ImpressionPOSTAL 2 is an adventurous game, mostly fitting to people who enjoy violent games. The graphics for 2003 are spectacular, the soundtrack are enjoyable, the atmosphere varies from outside to buildings and houses in the city called Paradise, AZ (in the USA). The gameplay is an open-world type, having the ability to do whatever you want, such as walking through the town, killing civilians/gangsters/police, beating animals, urinating on anything you want, a pretty rebel gameplay. The story is about The Postal Dude which just moved to Paradise, AZ with his wife, and his dog, Champ. He will have to go through 7 days (from Monday to Sunday) where he will have to accomplish many risky takes, which mostly have unwanted consequences. The engines are well optimized, very rare crashes, and generally good engines.GraphicsThe graphics are spectacular for the year 2003, being a huge improvement over the first POSTAL game, by bringing the three dimensions feature and brining in the First-Person and the Third-Person. This game can be run even on low performance computers, which would still be able to run this game on Medium-High. The sky is mostly blue-yellowish, nights are very rare in this game, the cars, the guns, the buildings, and the nature things are well designed. Humans are being randomly deployed, being pretty well designed too. The buildings and houses are also well designed, giving more reality to Paradise.AtmosphereThe atmosphere varies from being outside to the ability to walk in every single building or house of this game, being a huge advantage for explorers. We may also see desert, because it’s located in Arizona. In the south of the town we may see higher altitudes, which also contain some forests. The game mostly happens during the daytime, very rare during the night time. We may see people everywhere, even animals, cats can be attached on shotguns, which seems pretty funny. There are many places to visit, also the DLC expands the areas even more (underground areas and even a new Paradise, a terrorized one. The population is very scared due to the atomic explosion which happened years back then.Audio/MusicThe soundtrack of this game were composed by RWS, proving that the developer has truly put effort in making a completely original game. During fights, we may hear some dynamic soundtracks, which encourages you to fight even better. While doing missions or just exploring the city, no soundtracks will play. We may hear birds singing, people talking, and sometimes the wind. We may also hear animals, such as dogs chasing cats, etc. The sound of the bullets are pretty alright, the voice acting is also very nice, especially for The Postal Dude.GameplayThe gameplay is about The Postal Dude who does many tasks for his wife, such as buying milk, returning an overdue library book, getting Gary Coleman’s autograph, etc. This game is Open-World too, you may walk everywhere, and you can do what you want, anytime. You can even buy pizzas, donuts, drinks, etc. Also, there are some vending machines which sell heal kits, drugs (for health), etc.  (the health vending machine) and guns, grenades, vests, etc. (the weapons vending machine).  You can also talk with people (only the ones which have connections with missions). Overall good gameplay.StoryThe story Is about The Postal Dude which just moved in Paradise, AZ with his wife and his dog, Champ. He has to go through many adventures, among tasks given by his wife.  He needs to buy milk, steak pay his debts, return overdue books, and pretty much everything about violence/killing. After Friday, his wife will shot him in the head, causing him a tumor. In the next 2 days, he will make his way out of Paradise. In the new DLC, The Postal Dude came back In Paradise, but most of the town was already terrorized by the past atomic bomb, detonated by The Postal Dude himself. He will have to deal with many nations, such as Arabs, the Coleman family, etc.  The difficulties are way too many, nobody would need to choose from that many.EnginesThe engines on this game are well optimized, almost no crashes or bugs. The people's movements are pretty good, starting from walking calm through the town to running due to being alerted. The sky does not move, but in the DLC we may find snowing. In the cities there are cars which stand on the edge of the road or in garages, however, none of them is ever moving. When you shoot down somebody to death, I feel like their falling is not realistic. They just simply fall, not like in reality.  Also, I did not like how the sand is behaving. Instead of flowing in the air, it simply stays on the ground. This game can be played even on low performance computers, which give it a huge advantage.Other FeaturesThe multiplayer is pretty nice, it has some awesome maps and modes. However, it’s not alive anymore, making it pretty useless. If you have some friends who play it as well, play with them, you won’t regret your decision. The user interface is well-designed, being detailed with some blood additions, making it perfect for this type of violent games. The controls are well-chosen, which are a little complex, but you will have an easy time learning them. Some of the controls are displayed in the top-left screen. The mechanics are pretty nice, even though you get stuck in random objects sometimes, they are still pretty well-optimized. Everything around the city moves well. Overall, it’s a really enjoyable violent and dark-humor game.Positive PointsWell-designed graphics for 2003Almost no bugs or crashesNice audio and musicAwesome voice actingPretty Well-optimizedGood and coordinated AIA big city to exploreA great sense of dark humorMany weapons to choose fromAn open-world gameLong storylineMuch Steam Workshop contentGood and long DLCNeutral Points Too many difficulties to choose fromThe multiplayer is not alive anymoreBeing able to drive cars would be greatNegative PointsFrequent loading zonesYou get stuck in random objects sometimesThe multiplayer is not so alive anymore "

												What can I say about this game....? If you are sick enough to even buy this game, you have a serious problem  That you are too damn awesome . I cannot even see why anyone would ever buy such an old game in the first place,  unless you are still very very awesome . To go around, on a serious killing spree like this, cannot be healthy at all for anyone -  But it sure is fun! . 3,99€ is NOT worth buying this game for -  It should actually be much more expensive for this kind of entertainment . So look away and search for other games elsewhere,  if you are the biggest loser in the entire world - NERD! .Cheers!			"

POSTAL 2REVIEWPostal 2. What do i say about a game, launched more than 10 years ago, that created a lot of controversy, was banned in more than 13 countries, where you can pee on people, kill dogs and cats, and decapitate, explode or cut in pieces everything you see, using dozens and dozens of weapons, including shovels, tazers, RPGs and everything you can think of. In this game you control the Postal Dude, and you live as him in one ""normal"" week of his life. You have to do some work, like getting milk and easy things, getting Gary Coleman autograph. What could go wrong? The game is very funny, have a great gameplay and even a good time of campaign. It includes too the Apocalypse Weekend DLC, so, zombies and more playtime. The game graphics are outdated of course but are ok. The game contains a lot of bugs, they are funny but some are game breaking at some times, and the Apocalypse Weekend is very boring. Voice-acting is a funny thing: Postal Dude have an amazing one but the other characters suck. The game also have a soundtrack that have some cool musics sometimes but the game almost have no music. Postal 2 is very funny overall, and there is a cool multiplayer, but few people play it.+Funny comments of Postal Dude+Amazing voice-acting for Postal Dude+Funny and easy gameplay+Good length campaign+You can pee on people and use cats and dogs for a lot of things+Apocalypse Weekend DLC for free+A lot of guns+Open World+Unique Multiplayer+Still updated by Developer+Many items-Poor Soundtrack-Voice-acting for NPC's suck-Many loadings -Boring Apocalypse Weekend DLC-Poor animations and cutscenes-Big amount of bugsBesides it's flaws, Postal 2 is one of the funniest and controversial games ever made 8/10 BUT, I have to say: I do not recommend this game for EVERYONE. The game is very, very offensive for...everything. So, if you hate someone offending something you like, or hate nonsense violence, etc. Do not play this game.  "

												Postal 2 in a sense is kinda like the grandpa of GTA but hella more offensive in terms of it's portrayal of blood, gore, stereotypes and so on. When it was first released to the public back in the early 2000s, it received major criticism for gore and violence as well as getting a zero rating with several game critics.However, Postal 2 is one of those games that was able to shine later on when people were able to appreciate the message the developers wanted to portray. ""The game is only as violent as you are..."" and RWS is right, you DONT have to go through the entire game killing everyone in sight (you can anyways). This level of freedom gives the player a variety of challenges from going POSTAL (manslaughter) on everyone to going about objectives peacefully on Hestonworld difficulty. The game offers a variety of challenges for many types of gamers and it wouldn't hurt to buy this game and play it yourself. Also the game offers mod support so if you're into making mods, contributing to the growing modding community would help a lot!			"

In Postal 2, the player takes on the role of the Postal Dude, a tall and thin red-headed man with a goatee, sunglasses, a black leather trench coat, and a t-shirt with a grey alien's face printed on it. Postal Dude lives in a trailer park in the small town of Paradise, Arizona, with his nagging wife, who is identified in the credits as simply, the 'Postal Dude's ♥♥♥♥♥'. The game's levels are split into days of the week starting Monday and finishing Friday.At the beginning of each day, Postal Dude is given several tasks to accomplish, such as 'get milk', 'confess sins', and other seemingly mundane tasks. The object of Postal 2 is to finish all of the tasks throughout the week, and the player can accomplish these tasks in any way he or she wishes, be it as peaceful and civilly as possible, or as violent and chaotically as possible. It is possible, if occasionally difficult, to complete most tasks without engaging in battle, or at least, harming or killing other characters, as evidenced by the game's tagline: ""Remember, it's only as violent as you are!"". The daily tasks can be accomplished in any order the player desires, and the game also includes one task that is activated only when Postal Dude urinates, in which the player is tasked with getting treatment for gonorrhea after Postal Dude discovers he has the infection.Throughout the course of the game, Postal Dude must put up with being provoked by other characters on a regular basis. He is given the finger, mugged, attacked by various groups of protesters, and is harassed by an obnoxious convenience store owner/terrorist and his patrons who cut before Postal Dude in the ""money line"". During the game, Postal Dude also encounters a marching band, a murderous toy mascot named Krotchy, the Paradise Police Department and its SWAT team, overzealous BATFE agents, the Arizona Army National Guard, an eccentric religious cult, cannibalistic butcher shop workers, fanatical Al-Qaeda terrorists, and former child actor Gary Coleman, among many others.By Friday afternoon, the final day in the game, the apocalypse occurs and societal collapse soon follows, with all law and order breaking down. Cats begin to fall out of a darkly-colored sky, and almost everyone in town becomes heavily armed, with random gun battles breaking out in the streets. Despite this, Postal Dude returns home to his trailer as normal, where he then gets into an argument with his wife, who demands that Postal Dude explain why he never picked up the ice cream she asked for at the beginning of the game. Postal 2 then ends with a gunshot being heard, before being kicked to the end credits.			"

												Postal 2 isn't a particularly polished game, but don't allow that to dissuade you from purchase.The game is only as violent as you are. It was built entirely around being able to play through it without killing a single person in the game, and being able to disembowl random civilians whilst urinating on them. It is filled with humor and satire and bares a lot of resemblances to what politicians believe all video games are like.It's a really fun game to play, plus along with the expansions it becomes a fairly lengthy one as well. Definately comes recommended from me. "

												This game is one of the many reasons I'm so ♥♥♥♥ed up, what other game can you chase people around the streets, urinating on them until they throw up, whack their heads off with a spade then p*ss on their severed heads?Postal 2 at it's base is actually a surprisingly well designed game (if you can refrain from wreaking havoc), giving you an open world with multiple objectives to carry out in any order you please. Postal 2 also has solid, fast paced FPS core mechanics but what it's really notorious for is its messed up humour, everything in this game cracks me up, from the sound of the spade clanging against peoples heads to the many obnoxious references to real life occurences.The graphics are really impressive keeping in mind that this game is from 2003 as is the level design which gives you lots of areas to explore and tons of secrets to find. Don't expect a ""Catch(h)er in the Rye"" this story is a melting pot of fetus discharge which adds to the hilarity that is bound to offend many people, especially people who hate violent video games and Muslims.I recommend this to people with issues.

												IF you have a twisted/morbid sense of humor, IF you hate cats (which you can simply catch and attach to the end of your gun as a silencer in this game) and enjoy South Park, Beavis and Butthead, Jackass or any of those other guilty pleasures then you will certainly find plenty to smile about while exploring Paradise... It's the most hyper-violent game I’ve seen since ""Soldier of Fortune"", the expansions suck (although Silent Hillish opening gives me the creeps), there's a bunch of loading screens and annoying crashes, but I had $h!tloads of fun!

There are so many controls, but once you are good at using it, the game gets so fun. Much like GTA, you are a character who can choose to follow a story or make up one of his own.ProsFreedom to roamStorylineGraphicsPeopleControlsConsMap is disorienting, but it is not impossible to figure out.Health Packages are hard to find, and anyone with a rocket launcher is too overpowered----------------------------------------Overall: I would say, no matter the price: get POSTAL 2.10/10			"

												This game is awesome! I got all of the achievements in 60h of playtime.I will do some pros and cons for the gamePROS-This game is 13 years old and it is still a blast of fun to play-The graphics are excellent for the game which is 13 years old - it sometimes lags on my PC-Story is awesome, never gets old-Gameplay never gets boring because there are many secrets to find-There are a lot of weapons in the game which look awesome-Awesome character models and voice acting-The game is violent as you are-The achievements aren't hard to get(it only takes a lot of time to get them - but it's not hard)-The community is alive and healthy-Workshop is included. A lot of new stuff is made there and that content is awesome-POSTed Development Kit is also included with the game. You can make your own content easier then before-You will also get POSTAL 2: Share The Pain. Share The Pain is the multiplayer for the game. I don't know if it works because I had never tried it out before. I think it works but the only problem is that the Game Spy is dead and servers may not pop-up. But there are some fixes for it onlineCONS-Apocalypse Weekend is sometimes unstable and crashes in level transitions or it crashes because there are a lot of dead bodies aroundI recommend this game. 10/10 would be Postal Dude again!

												A fun half open-world half linear action game with sandbox elements, but not for the fainthearted- for example: you can use a cat as a scilencer for your shotgun or pee in peoples' faces until they vomit, not to mention achievements that your friends can see and then ask themselves 'should I remove this person?' I like this game as you can see from my rating- not because of the excessive violence, but just because it's a fun game, but has some boring parts (loading, walking everywhere, etc.). Also the devs are still supporting this 13 year old game (a new easter egg was made in 2016) and the community is still pretty active. Another good thing about this game is that it can run pretty smooth on most computers. I don't want to get into the ""story"" because it's quite the experience... The actual gameplay is walking around doing chores and errands and things that can be normal (buying milk) or crazy (blowing up cows with grenades). In conclusion, I personally think it's a fun game, but you should consider watching a gameplay video or two and see if it's your cup of tea.			"

												Despite the game being very dated... and so far has aged very well compared to modern shooters that are... well... copy paste mechanics and gameplay in every single release, this one however is a bit more unique.I don't know why, but I can't stop the urge to seldomly just kill or shoot someone... just right out of nowhere, boom boom death everywhere. Not sure if that's me releasing my frustration on the world or the side of me that wants the whole world to burn and bathe in their blood like the psychopath I may be. It's up to debate honestly...Anyway, game's good, can be a massive time waster without even realizing it. It's like watching a train-wreck with explosives and deaths and fires and... more explosives. It's impossible to look away once it starts. You'll be glued to it forever. The weekends are the longest ones, however, than Mon-Fri. I thought Sunday would never end.I've had a few issues of crashing here and there... not sure what exactly is causing them, but was purely random and at least rare. Too much going on at once?It's worth the price. Wouldn't wait for a sale. Get it now.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.			"

												Running With Scissors released this controversial mess of a game a long time ago, and it continues to be a fun way to relieve stress. The game has a style of humor that is fun for the most part, though a bit dated at times, and gives you tons of ways to kill your foes because, let's be honest, killing people is the definitive way to beat this game, though you can be a pacifist if you want to. Along with the base game, which lasts for 5 days, you have the Apocalypse Weekend expansion free of charge, which adds 2 more days. You can merge these to blend their weapons and stories together in a separate mode. Along with this LONG campaign, there's workshop support, achievements and trading cards. This is a remarkably full featured game. Now, we have all that, but what if I told you the main character talks Duke Nukem style and has the coolest voice I've heard in a game since... Duke Nukem.Postal 2 is a mostly funny, expansive and enjoyable game with a bunch of supportive and friendly developers as well. I'd say get it. Its cheap, so there's not much to lose.			"

												Possibly the greatest game to ever exist in all of time. The 100+ hours that I've spent have all been pure enjoyment (till I completed the Week on POSTAL difficulty, I hated my life at that point.)There isn't really anything about this game that I hate. I love just about everything about this game! Keep in mind this game is NEVER to be taken serious. This is a Dark Humor game, and it shows. It pushes the limits like no other game dares to try. Hell most of the achievements have some sort of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the images, or swears. Now coming after Postal 1, which was ""Kill everything,"" this game gives you untold amount of options. You can complete the entire game without killing anyone!The fact they even made a true Expansion for this game 11 YEARS LATER says a lot. The brilliant minds at Running With Scissors are amazing people and LOVE their fans, and they prove that with the Paradise Lost Expansion. Yes I'm calling it an Expansion and not DLC, that is how much content is in it!Everyone can have their Call of Dudes, Battlefields, Arsarsin's Creeds (Steam censorship), and what ever cash cow big AAA companies produce *cough*  EA, Ubisoft, ♥♥♥♥ Konami  *cough*, or what ever cheap low live scam artist Indi Devs *cough* ImminentUprising *cough*, but I will stick with games that are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥FUN!

												I'm going to be honest. The first time I played Postal 2, it was two years ago and I hacked it. Just the three first days, nothing else. I loved it. I stopped playing because I felt like this wasn't right. This game is amazing. I want to give those guys my money. I didn't even have a bank account back then, I couldn't buy anything. And with time, I forgot that game. Until recently, when I saw it on Steam and I was like ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ wait... Wait wait wait wait wait, THAT GAME ! I REMEMBER IT !"" and bought it. With his DLC Paradise Lost. Because those guys deserve money. This game is often said to be ""one of the worst"" but honestly, no. Just no. This game is really good. Here's why.THE GOOD STUFF1) The gameplay. The game is an FPS with a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of differents weapons, from standard pistol to Rocket launcher, gasoline, napalm launcher and lots more. You can even♥♥♥♥♥♥on peoples. Litteraly. The gameplay is pretty fun and responsive, it never gets boring. Good stuff here.2) The graphics. This game came out in 2003 and for the time, it was okay. Not amazing, but it was nice. It has it's own charm. The DLC Paradise Lost ads lots of visual effects too, such as snow, water, rain and light effects. Good stuff.3) The humour. By god is that game funny. Yeeeeeah it's offensive, but that's the point : the game has no limit. You wanna kill Ben Laden before decapitating him and♥♥♥♥♥♥on his neck ? Go on. Wanna burn Gary Coleman before♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on his burning corpse ? Go on. The situations the game puts you in and the freedom the player has are freaking hilarious. Yeah, it's offensive, but it's hilarious.THE BAD STUFF1) The lack of music. Even though Paradise Lost added some musics, the normal game is pretty silent. And it can get REALLY BORING. some music in the gunfights would've been nice.2) The loadings. They are horrible. yeas it's necessary, but they are everywhere, it breaks the flow of the game and you end up not wanting to explore the town because there's two loading screens up ahead. That sucks.Appart from that, this game is great. It's funny, violent, you are completely free, it has the best DLC EVER MADE... Don't listen to the peoples calling it the ""worst"" because it's offensive and give it a try.That was my review. And before you start bashing my like ""THIS GAME IS♥♥♥♥♥♥HOW DARE YOU SAY IT'S GOOD"", just know this. I wrote it. I think everything I said. And I regret nothing.			"

												There is no way to sum up the gloryness of this game in words. It's just amazing. The developers of this game were not afraid to go out there and it's very clear that this game was thoroughly thought out, made with love, and most importantly, made for the player.You're a random guy who tries to go about his day and finish some errands. Each errand can be completed in a number of ways, just one of the things that increase the replay value of this game. You can choose to live through the game as a good guy, doing the errands the ""right"" way, paying your bills, respecting civilians, etc. Or you can be a bad guy and kill anyone you see, steal anything you want, break stuff, etc.Then there is the amount of things you can do. It's almost endless; You can pee on people, you can pour gasoline on them and light them on fire, you can kick them, cut their heads off and play fetch with your dog (oh yeah, you have a dog, and you can get more dogs by giving them dog treats), taze them, sick your dog after them and so many more.The interactivity. The AI is pretty smart. Some will hide, some will run, some won't even be afraid of you, some will attack. They all react exactly how you think they would when being chased by your dog or set on fire or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on or shot at. They are even aware of the minor details in the world such as sound, doors, cats, dogs and eachother. If something in the world can't be destroyed, then it can be pushed around. Ragdolls also have amusing and sometimes funny results as usual.This game has the mentality of ""it's your game, play it how you want to"". You don't have to do the errands in order, you don't have to do them right away and there's many things to do besides the errands, but that's for you to discover. If you are one who goes for achievements, this game will certainly provide you with achievements that will take you for a fun ride, and some are not so easy. Like I said, there is no proper way to describe the gloryness of the game, you just have to play it.I highly recommend this game. 10/10.			"

												My opinionated breakdown review of: POSTAL 2Gameplay: POSTAL 2 is set in a small town in Arizona named Paradise. You will play as Postal Dude (actual name) completing various day to day activities such as: getting milk, getting autographs from Gary Coleman, retrieving mail, and many other trivial activities that end up turning into an all-out gore fest. You see, this game doesn't care. Anything offensive you can think of, it'll probably be in this game. This game is a sandbox set in first-person based off of the Unreal engine. When you first start playing you will notice how open-ended and interactive the world is. Some sections are cut-off due to plot restrictions but usually, you won't get bored of one area. The combat is fairly dumb, but fun. The game's idea of difficulty is more enemies, and as you progress, you will become rivals with many factions. If I had to describe this game in two words, I would say ""Murder Simulator."" There are many weapons to utilize each with unique effects. Simple things such has scissors can be used as a lethal ninja star immitation. The game is very creative with how you want to kill or torture people (urinating on someone until he/she throws up). Play the game for it's killing, not the story.Art: The game manages to look decent, even by today's standards. There are a lot of copy and paste areas, but each section of the map feels unique enough to grab your attention. You will mostly be looking at blood, vomit, urine, and more blood.Music/sound: The game does little in the music department, other than atmospheric radio. The sound design is decent, most weapons sound like you would expect them to and the screams and remarks of bystanders add to the joy of murdering for no reason.Entertainment Value: The game is short. It would not be uncommon to beat this game in one day (if you did nothing but missions) but based off of the interaction, humor, violence, mature themes, and freedom the game presents, I can see a player coming back to it again and again if they want to murder and pee on people for no reason for some time. It isn't exactly and in-depth game.Score: Based on everything, the game offers nothing but a good murder simulation. The story is lackluster, the sound and art is decent, and the overall missions just consist of go to location, kill everything, leave. For what it's worth, the workshop support does add to the gameplay by giving you new weapons and maps, but at the end of the day, it is a very well done murder sandbox with extremely controversial subjects and content. Play at your own risk.3/5Thank you for reading.			"

												I have bought this game on numerous occasions.  From physical media, GOG, and now Steam.  This is an older title so don't expect to be wowed by the fancy graphics.  Besides, if you're reading my review you want 2 things.  Violence and more violence.  This title delivers in spades.  The social commentary is a little dated now, but still relevant for the most part.  You can be as wicked or as sweet as you want.  Being sweet is a challenge.  Being wicked is a blast.So you enjoy:1.  Sticking a shotgun up a cat's butt to use it as a silencer?2.  Urinating on random people?3.  A firefight VS. Gary Coleman?Then this just may be the title for you.This game includes the Apocalypse Weekend and the Share the Pain (MP) add-ons.  The graphics are dated, but it's still a FPS that I like to play.Finally, DO NOT GET POSTAL 3!  It is an a horrible abomination of a game.  RWS gets no cash from the sale of that piece of ****, as I understand.  I bought that game at retail...   Grrr.....			"

												POSTAL 2 is a brilliant game. It has fantastic replay value (I found myself beating the game quite a few times). It's very funny, and whilst the humor may be no longer topical, you have to remember this was originally released in 2003. Nevertheless, it's still funny. The physics in the game are very well done too, especially the♥♥♥♥♥♥effect. The gore is possibly the most violent and well done in gaming history. The fact that the developers constantly update the game even to this day (the dismemberment feature was originally only in Apocalypse Weekend, and there were a lot fewer weapons in the original release) is astounding. The game does take a while to load each day, but the loading inbetween sections of the town take mere seconds. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who's not easily offended or grossed out. It's well worth the money and I can't wait to see what kind of game RWS makes next.			"

												The shooting is average. The graphics dated but perfect for this game because the sadistic things you'll do to people wouldn't feel right if it was too realistic. The crazy humor, achievements and fun weapons make this game a whole lot of fun to play. Make sure you'll buy the DLC Paradise Lost. It's called a DLC but it's a whole game on it's own and just as big and good as the main game.  I got both on sale for 1,94. For that price the best game/fun/value for me in the last 10 years and I bought more than 200 games the last decade. ps I'm mentaly quite stable and a loving person who wouldn't hurt any living thing on purpose in normal life. In this game you'll have to go totaly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on people to get the achievements. Love it!  :  )    sorry.ps ps don't play below average difficulty. It's even more fun if you'll have to work for it.

The fact alone that the setting is like a cheap-cheap version of Fallout 4.

												This game is so much fun! It keeps me laughing through the whole game. I've only played for about an hour so far, but the game definitely has my attention. The controls are a bit confusing in the beginning, but you'll get used to them eventually. There are a few minor glitches here and there, but I'm sure the devs will get working on those asap. The weapons are a bit repetitive as so far I've only been able to use a shovel, pistol, machine gun, and a shotgun. Not sure what the rest of the game holds though. So far, it seems like I'm limitless as to what I can do! I've set someone on fire and haven't even been playing the game for 3 hours!  The achievements and trading cards for this game are pretty funny imo. Navigation is a 10/10 for me, as is the gameplay. This game sorta reminds me of GTA, so if you're a fan of GTA, I definitely recommend this game for you. The blood and gore isn't as intense as I thought it would be, which is a good thing because I don't like too much blood and gore. If you don't like it at all, there is an option to toggle it on and off. So far so good. Can't wait to see what the rest of the game holds! 9/10 Weekend deal so grab it fast!			"

												Postal 2 challenges players to survive a week as The Postal Dude. His week isn't spent behind enemy lines as a guerilla soldier, or fighting off an alien invasion. Postal Dude is spending this week around his own neighborhood, doing mundane errands like cashing his paycheck, buying milk, grabbing some meat for a BBQ, and so on. As it turns out, everyone in Paradise, Arizona is either a jerk, a maniac, a terrorist, or Gary Coleman. On top of that, you're one sandwich short of a six-pack.To give you an idea of how the average play-through will go. I'll describe one of my misadventures.-On the way to getting Gary Coleman's autograph, I murdered several people and batted their heads around with a shovel. The police showed up and threw me in prison. They didn't see the murders, but I couldn't suppress the urge to urinate on them. -Escaping from prison was surprisingly easy. On the way out I scored a police uniform, raided their armory, and...urinated on everyone. I don't have issues, honest!-I doused a club in gasoline and set everyone on fire. There were a couple survivors, thanks to my quick thinking. After urinating on them to put out the fires, I revived them with the stun gun. They have 4th degree burns though so...hmm.-Finally I arrived at the mall. There was a long line for Gary's autograph. Instead of waiting I killed someone that just got their book signed. No urinating was involved this time.This is an open-ended game, and there are always non-violent solutions for every task. In fact you can even complete the game without killing anyone. Taking the easy way out tends to be more fun though. At the very least you'll have to break into a few houses and swipe everyone's kevlar vests, fast food, and crack to keep yourself alive. Saturday and Sunday make up the expansion portion of the game. This...well..this really isn't good. Every other day is open-ended, there's a sense of exploration, and fun to be had in goofing around. The weekend consists of more traditional FPS levels. They're really linear, and you have to deal with almost constant gun-fights. This gets old very quickly. Postal 2 is very much a product of its time as well. The jokes are tasteless (says the guy that urinates on burn victims!) and not at all timely. This version adds a bunch of achievements, with most of them being named after memes. Essentially this game was dated when it came out, and dated even more with its re-release. It's still entertaining and hilarious, just be careful who you talk to when you describe the game.			"

												Do not purchase this game if your friends, children or spouse have easy access to your Steam account. That aside, Gary Coleman is in this game and that is the factor one should use when deciding to buy any game. Fun for the whole family, buy one for your Boss , buy one for your Mother-in-Law, buy one for your Dog! Buy one for the Mailman, buy one for everyone you meet!......Disclaimer this is not fun for the whole family and should be kept out of reach of the easily impressionable and offendedBuying this for your boss will get you firedBuying this for your mother-in-law probably won't change the relationship but it can get back to the misses/misterBuying this for your dog will cause them to steal your car and buy liquer and ciggarettes with your walletBuying this for your Mailman is not appropriate simply because the title says Postal but it will inspire a Mailman rampage which will devistate the tri-county areaBuying one for everyone you meet will probably cause an increase in Gary Coleman activity "

This game is the best game I have ever played in my life! I love games that keep me laughing, show complete and utter randomness that you forget that there's even a storyline behind it.Usually in games, I like to do what I'm supposed to do and try not to kill the A.I. this game however, it was just so entertaining to run around killing people with the dumbest sh*t imaginable. I would really like a Postal 2. I don't care about the graphics. In fact, you will end up having so much fun on this game that you will completely forget how bad the graphics are. It's like going back to the original Half Life but now it's actually fun.The voice acting is hilariously stupid but I love it! Especially the main character's voice. The females on this game make me laugh my a** because they sound like (and I'm pretty sure that they actually were) they were used on 11 year old girls. The males also sound like they were acted by a teenage boy. The main character is just... just... Chuck Testa... And Chuck Norris combined.This game is so fantastic that it also deserves a list of the pros and cons:Pros-Can use cats as gun attatchments-Can again cop niorety.-Can be jailed and escape unlike GTA where the cops just kill you-Can go in nearly every single room in the game.-Includes drugs-Steam Workshop-Variety of Game Modes-Different story lines-Killer cats-Pet dogs-Different weapons-Can remove limbs from bodies-Your drug trip without getting high-Can get high on cat nip-Police actually give you a chance to drop your gun unlike you know what-Police have different guns-Some civilians supprise you with a gun hidden in there a** crack.-Can rob a bank unlike you know what-Can have some good physics unlike you know what-Can blow up cars and make them go flying-Can kick people in the face-Includes Achievements-Can kick open doors-Includes zombies-Can stick sledgehammers up cows a**'s-Can die by cats-Can't die from stupid hights like in minecraft-Can lose limbs and still be alive (unless it's your head).Cons-Bad GraphicsBare in mind that I've only played half of the first day out of seven on only one game mode...This is my largest review so far and this game deffinately deserves it! Well done to whoever made this, this is the best game I have ever played. I would reccomend this to anyone unless you're some boring fart who just wants to play World Of Warcraft all day.Overall I would rate this game:21/10Would smoke cat - nip again.			"

												Let's get a bit of context first, shall we?I do like this kind of humour, (especially political satire), and controversy isn't an issue, as long as it's done well. I like TV shows such as Archer or films such as the brilliant Team America. Probably the most obvious comparison to this game, South Park has always seemed to be more of a hit and miss whenever I've found myself watching it. So having heard a reasonable amount about the POSTAL series over the years, I was mildly interested and picked this up for a dirt cheap price the other day during yet another Steam sale. After playing it for a bit, I was disappointed. Quite simply, I don't find POSTAL 2 funny, or even interesting, to play. I understand what it is trying to do, as well as the appeal and success of the game. But controversy for controversy's sake is a huge error when it comes to this kind of humor. Gameplay itself is nothing more than average for the mid-2000s period and I doubt you're here for graphical fidelity. Placing my own thoughts aside though, hats off to RWS for having the balls to continue to release and support the series.. it's a good thing that the gaming industry has this kind of thing, even if it doesn't work for me personally.But chances are you'll still enjoy it, so if you're in the mood, ignore my review and by all means, enjoy. It's not a ""bad"" game. I don't hate this game, and no, I'm not a religious conserative or lobbyist. Quite the opposite in fact. I just didn't find POSTAL 2 enjoyable. Find out if works for you.

												I never looked into this due to thinking it was just the normal Postal 2 I had on disc still. But nope they had added achievements, some new voice audio, some updated graphics and to some objects and character models (such as them wearing sun glasses) and added a few new weapons such as knuckle dusters/brass knuckles, A shiv (I think thats what you call it) and from watching the trailer I see there is loads more (Im still early in the game at the moment). They have also added the weekend add on into the one game, you get a choose from doing all 7 days in the one go, or the default mode of Postal 2 where you play from Monday - Friday. They have also added in a lot of new difficulty options from you to choose from.There is also updated graphics/video options to set, it supports all 4:3, 16:9 or 16:10 resolutions, which can be all setup before you go into the game or while you have booted up the game.It also comes bundled with a Single Player and Multiplayer level editior! Also steam cards if your into those!If you loved Postal 2 STP or had seen the old postal 2 and liked it, I highly recommend this game!			"

												I was honestly scared that this game would suck (the ""Proffesional"" critics said it did) but I have to say I love this game, and I don't regret buying it at all. The game is of course offensive, but it's very funny, and even though on the surface it may appear to be offensive for shock value,  there are actually messages and commentary behind the very offensive stuff (for the most part.) Postal 2 is funny, however, for more than scripted scenes; the random shenanigans that can happen in the open world can be quite amusing and fun to watch, especially doing something like kicking someone, having them pull a gun on you, then have them (and possibly the whole town) get into a fire-fight with the police.The story in Postal obviously isn't the important part, it's simply a big fetch quest around the town of paradise, however it's not hard get lost on the way there, as it's easy to get caught up in the fun of slaughtering people. The game has a wide selection of weapons, which makes attacking random civs and police interesting. Some weapons such as the pistol, baton, shotgun, and assult rifle are common, while some are area specific, rare, and for the most part more interesting. You can get an axe to hack at peoples limbs. If they survive a hit to the arm, they run around screaming until you finish them. Or how about a can of gasoline, to light anyone you want on fire? Burning someone causes them to run around in circles, igniting anyone or anything they touch, eventually (unless killed or extinguished first) they collapse in a pile of searing charred flesh, barely clinging to life, free to be kicked to death as you please. But the best weapon in the game is one you start with: urine. The ability to♥♥♥♥♥♥on people, believe it or not, is one of the most powerful weapos, as it causes people to stop what they're doing and rub their face. Or, if you get lucky, they might puke and completely stand still for 5 seconds or so, leaving you plenty of time to kill them. Postal's gore is awesome, and with so many varied ways to kill (My favorite is hacking all of someone's limbs off, burning them to a crisp, then as they beg for you to end it, kick them until they explode) you never feel bored travelling between areas. Definetly ignore whatever stupid 0/10 reviews you see, this game is awesome! Oh, and it's still getting updates, which means you can bet on even more cool content coming.			"

												Honestly the greatest sandbox fps game in the whole everywhere.Unlike in Postal where your goal is to just slaughter everything that breathes, Postal 2 sees you living out the life of Postal Dude. All you do is simple errands, and whether or not you want chunks of decapitated human heads sprayed all over the landscape is completely up to you. The game is a FPS, rather than a isometric shooter, and you can do pretty much just about anything imaginable. You can put a cat silencer on your guns, set fire to everything,♥♥♥♥♥♥on people, or just go on a generic rampage.But then again, you can also act like a normal person, fulfil your common errands, and not be a general jackass psychopath to everyone around you.The game's tag line is ""It's only as violent as you are!"". This is one of the most brutally violent games in existence, which means its one of the absolute best games in existence.			"

												POSTAL 2, where do I have to start? Well, let's put it in this way. If you have a annoying bully at school, and you just want to like, chop his head off, POSTAL 2 is great to practice that. Just kidding, but POSTAL 2 is a madness simulator to me, you can basically do everything. You want to fetch with your dog? Done. Are you in for kicking someone's monitor into stuck into a wall? Possible! You want to pee on your ex-wife Melissa? A-Okay!  Do you want to walk on electrical wire at 8 feet high while hoping not to be shocked? Maybe.  You want to steal your neighbour Daniel's taser and taser him to death? Why not? You want to throw a molotov-cocktail at people in a gaybar? Okay, now you've crossed the line. Seriously. So, are you ready for some crazy crap coming up in a small village in Arizona made by some developers which run all the time with scissors in their hands? The game is actually from 2003, but POSTAL 2 is still played by many across the world. Running With Scissors made even a totally new DLC for the game, called POSTAL 2: Paradise Lost, not so long ago, in 2015. I highly recommend this game, and this is one of the best games I've ever played. It's definitely worth your money, especially when it's on sale. And when it's on sale, you should buy Paradise Lost too. Great game. 10/10			"

												Postal 2 teaches some very important life lessons... I'm serious, though... Just hear me out on this. Running with Scissors has sprinkled life lessons to and fro in this glorious game of theirs that yes everyone, even children, will benefit from (Now, far be it from me to say that the parents who see this game and think it's nothing but trash-talk and gore, not ""worthy"" for their feeble-minded children to suffer through are evil, but any parent who would deprive their children of these life lessons, are well... evil). ""Well,"" you may be wondering, ""what are these life lessons that you go on about? Will you ever get to the point?"" My answer to the first question would be ""SHUT UP, I'M GETTING THERE!"" and my answer to the second question is... ""Yeah sure, whatever...""THE LIFE LESSONS1. If you ask a celebrity to sign a book for you and they turn you down, it's okay! Just dump a load of gasoline on their heads, light them on fire, pee the fire out, steal the signature of the celebrity from someone else as they run away in terror because you just lit a guy on fire, hide from the cops in a well-concealable water fountain until they give up, and laugh as you run all the way home to sell the autograph on eBay because, as you know (maybe...), celebrities signatures are worth much more after they are deceased...2. YOU HATE MALLS, YOU ♥♥♥♥ING HATE THEM, THEY'RE CONFUSING AND SCARY AND YOU HATE THE LEVEL DESIGNER(S) OF THIS GAME, IF THERE WAS ANY WAY TO SKIP THE MISSIONS WHERE YOU HAD TO GO INTO THE MALL, YOU WOULD!3. If you feel frustration at the level designer(s) of a game, go down to the company building and take your wrath out on them with that shotgun that you found behind a dumpster! It's better than holding it all in! :D4. It's okay to kill someone you hate! Just make sure the cops are not around! :D5. If someone makes fun of you while you are wearing a gimp suit, PEE IN THEIR MOUTHS IMMEDIATELY, THEY DESERVE IT!6. Never wait in lines. If you want something but there is a line, just pee on everyone (unless if there's a cop... God, I learned that one the hard way... (-.-))! *EXCEPTION* If there is a cop in the line, pull out your gun and start firing until you or everyone else around you is choking on their own blood and vomit!7. If you are on fire, DO NOT PANIC! Tilt at a slight angle and pee on yourself! If you are a woman... lol, good luck with that...8. It's ok to show the ladies your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in public, but remember our rule about the cops, k? ;)9. If you see one of those Running With Scissors guys running around, throw scissors into their eye sockets and laugh at the irony.10. Don’t have money to pay for some stupid traffic ticket? Rob your local bank! The cops will be glad to take your stolen money. :3In conclusion, these examples and more have all proven to be knowledge that a young man/woman will need on this journey that we call life. This is why I believe that all parents should purchase this game for their young children immediately. If not for the awesome blood and gore… buy it for the life lessons.			"

												While I say I recommend this game, it's hard to say if this is a good game or not. It's a masterpiece in one man's hands and a disgusting, horrifying putrid mess to another. It all FUNCTIONS well, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If your definition of ""beauty"" is a murderspree game that was meant to cause controversy.The story is simple - you're a lower class guy with a goatee and a gross set of clothes doing your job as a regular citizen with a wife living in a run-down trailer. You try to make it through your week in the most mundane way possible - walk everywhere doing errand to errand. Get milk, return a book, cash a paycheck. Normal stuff. Your week is however, ruined. Protestors at the game company you work for (also the devs of the game you're playing), protestors at your library... Everything just goes badly. Murdering everyone against you helps.The gameplay is a minor issue with the game. The controls are absolutely fine, everything works well enough, but walking from point A to B is monotonous and boring. Once you get to the action though, everything is a little bit better. However, most characters you fight against are programmed with awful AI and the only way you die is either in suicide, a  few cheap shots or fighting at close range when they have a gun. It's only challenging on the higher difficulties because of high damage guns on them and low damage guns on you. It's far from a game that you use your mind with.The graphics are pretty meh. The in-jokes put in by the devs sometimes are just .jpegs with a lot of compression. It was the early 2000s though, so it's excusable for the time.But you don't care about that stuff, right? You want to play this game to feel like an immature child and cause as much murder to take care of your anger as fast as possible. That's what I did. Content that can be regarded as offensive can be poor depiction of protestors, hyperviolence, optional animal cruelty,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on terrorist graves... It's too much to list. RWS thought of what is basically a  lot  of offensive stuff. There's even Nazi-istic comments you can get The POSTAL Dude to say. Like I said in the beginning of the review, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If you think exploitation is all for laughs, go for it. If you just want to♥♥♥♥♥♥off your parents or your boss, go for it. This game is a subjective masterpiece or a subjective pile of garbage depending on who you ask. Reviews won't do much good in describing the game.			"

												A game that up to this moment is continuously supported by it's developers, which are always around to help when any issue pops up.The world is free for you to explore and roam around. In fact, you'll end up raiding the whole city as you are trying to reach a certain location just because you can.Every day you get a few errands to complete and multiple ways to do so. Unlike other games, the errands seem to be very simple, some tasks that anyone could face- buying milk, paying a ticket at the police station, get steaks- nothing could go wrong.The game is as violent as you are, you can either go postal and kill your way out of anything, or try to peacefully make your way out of trouble without getting killed (that's the real challenge).There are tons of secrets hidden by the map designers that contain either easter eggs and/or hidden weapons and items that will help you as you progress trough the game.Aside from the fun gameplay, badass one-liners and humorous jokes, the game is not entirely flawless. One of the most stressing features is the loading zones, meaning that whenever you will go around a corner or trough a tunnel you will most likely face a loading screen. The wait time isn't that long, usually taking ~10 seconds, but for a game where traveling is a key feature it starts to get on your nerves pretty quickly. Another flaw is the not-so-great hit reg system, which will cause weapons such as the m4 and m5 to be nearly useless at times, but with an old engine like p2 is running on, the game itself can't be blamed for these.However, unless you're an actual fan of old games that is used to such issues games used to have, you should probably stay away from it. I just can't get enough.Just don't forget the Rocky Road.			"

												I never looked into this due to thinking it was just the normal Postal 2 I had on disc still. But nope they had added achievements, some new voice audio, some updated graphics and to some objects and character models (such as them wearing sun glasses) and added a few new weapons such as knuckle dusters/brass knuckles, A shiv (I think thats what you call it) and from watching the trailer I see there is loads more (Im still early in the game at the moment). They have also added the weekend add on into the one game, you get a choose from doing all 7 days in the one go, or the default mode of Postal 2 where you play from Monday - Friday. They have also added in a lot of new difficulty options from you to choose from.There is also updated graphics/video options to set, it supports all 4:3, 16:9 or 16:10 resolutions, which can be all setup before you go into the game or while you have booted up the game.It also comes bundled with a Single Player and Multiplayer level editior! Also steam cards if your into those!If you loved Postal 2 STP or had seen the old postal 2 and liked it, I highly recommend this game!			"

												 Postal 2  is a first-person shooter video game by Running with Scissors, and it is the sequel to the 1997 game Postal. Both are intentionally highly controversial due to high levels of violence and stereotyping. Unlike its predecessor, Postal 2 is played completely in first-person based on the Unreal Engine. Scenes of the game can be seen in the music video of the Black Eyed Peas single ""Where Is the Love?"".In 2004, New Zealand banned Postal 2 due to ""gross, abhorrent content""  and Australia later banned the game due to ""excessive abhorrent content"". On May 1, 2007, Malaysia banned the game outright due to ""very high impact violence & offensive depictions of cruelty"". The game is also banned in Germany, France and temporarily banned for sale in Sweden. The games were later legally made available worldwide through GOG.com in 2009 and later on Steam in 2012.The game received a mixed reception from critics upon its release in 2003, with some reviewers going so far as to give the game a score of zero, while others argued in favor of the game's concept and implementation. Regardless, the game was successful enough to receive several expansions and to be included in multiple compilations, and a film adaptation of the game and its predecessor was made in 2008.Plot  In Postal 2, the player takes on the role of the Postal Dude, a tall and thin red-headed man with a goatee, sunglasses, a black leather trench coat, and a t-shirt with a grey alien's face printed on it. Postal Dude lives in a trailer park in the small town of Paradise, Arizona, with his nagging wife, who is identified in the credits as simply, the 'Postal Dude's ♥♥♥♥♥'. The game's levels are split into days of the week starting Monday and finishing Friday.At the beginning of each day, Postal Dude is given several tasks to accomplish, such as 'get milk', 'confess sins', and other seemingly mundane tasks. The object of Postal 2 is to finish all of the tasks throughout the week, and the player can accomplish these tasks in any way he or she wishes, be it as peaceful and civilly as possible, or as violent and chaotically as possible. It is possible, if occasionally difficult, to complete most tasks without engaging in battle, or at least, harming or killing other characters, as evidenced by the game's tagline: ""Remember, it's only as violent as you are!"". The daily tasks can be accomplished in any order the player desires, and the game also includes one task that is activated only when Postal Dude urinates, in which the player is tasked with getting treatment for gonorrhea after Postal Dude discovers he has the infection.Throughout the course of the game, Postal Dude must put up with being provoked by other characters on a regular basis. He is given the finger, mugged, attacked by various groups of protesters, and is harassed by an obnoxious convenience store owner/terrorist and his patrons who cut before Postal Dude in the ""money line"". During the game, Postal Dude also encounters a marching band, a murderous toy mascot named Krotchy, the Paradise Police Department and its SWAT team, overzealous BATFE agents, the Arizona Army National Guard, an eccentric religious cult, cannibalistic butcher shop workers, fanatical Al-Qaeda terrorists, and former child actor Gary Coleman, among many others.By Friday afternoon, the final day in the game, the apocalypse occurs and societal collapse soon follows, with all law and order breaking down. Cats begin to fall out of a darkly-colored sky, and almost everyone in town becomes heavily armed, with random gun battles breaking out in the streets. Despite this, Postal Dude returns home to his trailer as normal, where he then gets into an argument with his wife, who demands that Postal Dude explain why he never picked up the ice cream she asked for at the beginning of the game. Postal 2 then ends with a gunshot being heard, before being kicked to the end credits.Gameplay  One of the major concepts of Postal 2 is that it is meant to be a ""living world"", a simulation of a tongue-in-cheek off-kilter town. Game characters live out their lives completely separate from the actions of Dude; walking around town, buying and selling merchandise, and even engaging in random shootouts with each other and the police.The town features many cars but they are all ""useless exploding props"", according to Dude, and cannot be driven, although they can be blown up and sent flying into the air. In addition to cats and dogs, other animals present are elephants; these animals can be shot or set on fire—or simply annoyed by the player walking into them—causing them to trumpet with rage and attack anyone within stomping distance. A bizarre feature is the ability to pick up cats as an inventory item. When used, Postal Dude shoves the barrel of the currently equipped firearm into the cat's♥♥♥♥♥♥ as a 'silencer'. Every time a shot is fired, the cat meows in apparent agony, and the gunshot is muffled. After nine shots the cat has run out of lives and it will fly from the end of the weapon. Most dogs have the ability to befriend the Dude if he feeds them a continual supply of dog biscuits or feeds them any other food . Once a canine's loyalty has been earned, the dog will attack anyone who attacks the Dude, or alternatively, anyone whom the Dude attacks. Dogs will also chase and kill cats, and play fetch with the Dude's inventory items and also severed heads. There were also going to be cows included in the game, but they were left unprogrammed. They did appear in Apocalypse Weekend and the A Week in Paradise modification.The game also features a cameo by Gary Coleman, acting as himself, who appears early on as the objective of one of the game's tasks . The player can choose to fight and kill Coleman or simply have the book signed peacefully . If the book does get signed, the Dude remarks to Coleman that he really loved him in Facts of Life . Regardless of the Dude's actions, the police storm the building in an attempt to arrest Gary Coleman and a gunfight ensues which invariably results in Coleman's apparent demise, with or without the player's help. Later on in the game he can also be seen in the Police Station, when the player escapes from his cell he also frees everyone else—including Coleman, who can be seen running alongside Krotchy. Coleman apparently survives as he can be seen in the Apocalypse Weekend expansion, bandaged up in the hospital .Release   Expansions    Share the Pain    The updated edition of the game, entitled Postal 2: Share the Pain included a multiplayer mode. The Macintosh and Linux versions of Postal 2 shipped only as Postal 2: Share the Pain. Share the Pain has since far eclipsed the original production version of Postal 2 in all markets. As part of a promotional effort to advertise the Postal film, in 2008 RWS released the multiplayer part of the game as freeware, minus the unrealed based level editor PostEd.Apocalypse Weekend    Apocalypse Weekend is an expansion pack to Postal 2 released by Running with Scissors on August 1, 2004 for Microsoft Windows, and September 28, 2005 for the Mac OS X and Linux versions. Apocalypse Weekend expands the reaches of Paradise with new maps and missions, set on Saturday and Sunday, adds new weapons and foes, and raises the gore and violence to an even greater level. It was later included in both the Postal Fudge Pack and Postal X : 10th Anniversary compilations alongside Share the Pain and several fan produced mods, including A Week in Paradise which allows content from Apocalypse Weekend to appear in the original game as well as allowing the expansions levels to be played as part of the original five day campaign.

												Postal 2, an old classic brought back to life. A game where a dude goes postal. Oh and his name is Postal Dude, too! What happens when your day goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Well, you might tase a dog. Or perhaps shout at people's faces telling them they're going to get killed unless they get to the ground, and yet they stare back at you clueless of how big of a psycho you are. Or perhaps you light some folks of fire, immediately regretting that you did, you try to get the fire out by peeing on them. With the addition of Multiplayer and constant updates(and workshop as well), what could go wrong? Find out for yourselves in this hilariously comical game and unleash your inner psycho.P.S: If you enjoyed GTA:SA you'll like this, too. And if you're a fan of Postal1/2, Manhunt or similar, check out Hatred on Greenlight.(user discretion is advised). Oh and all the random events that go on... reminds me of Bad Day LA.>I'd give it a 10/10>Pros: Despite old it still gets updates, achievements and cards, updated graphics and all, humoristic and dark, violence is optional... but we know you'll do it, fair price.>Cons: None so far.

												in postal 2 you play as the son of the faithful mail carrier from the original gamesome say this change in character is a negative turn for the story but i think that it's good that RWS is exploring new horizons in character developmentif you remember properly Postman Patrick (original protagonist) was a genial, happy-go-lucky man who deeply enjoyed his careerhowever, Postman Patrick II has a bit of a dark background (being half filipino) but still retains the happy go lucky nature of our beloved patrick Ithe gameplay is mostly the same arrow keys to drive truck mouse to throw mail but the addition of brand new enemies such as champ the roving dog makes it a bit more of a challenge than the original gamedefinitely still a game open for anyone though the new dog petting mechanic appeals to all sorts of casual gamers (i.e. children)of course i would reccomend this game steam 5/5 best postman simulation out on the market right now (at least until Mail Carrier 2k7 is released!)

												Postal 2 is the beloved sequel to the game where a guy in a trenchcoat heard voices in his head tell him to murder the entire population with military grade weapons. Having last been committed to a mental asylum, we find the Postal Dude strangely sane with a much more placid view on life. Also, he seems to have married a bossy wife, moved into a trailer in Paradise, AZ gotten a job at a video game design and publishing company (RWS Inc.) and even still has his dog! Way to go, P. Dude! Unfortunately, Paradise seems to be about as stable as the cauldron of chemicals where gunpowder was accidentally invented.     Postal 2 has a free-roaming environment with goals to be accomplished in no particular order, or even in no specified way. You, the Postal Dude, are given an errand list by your wife each day and must go accomplish your goals, like confessing your sins at church, picking up milk from the store, etc. However, every time you get close to accomplishing these things, something insane happens, like video game protesters raid your job office when you go to pick up your paycheck, or rednecks try to murder you when you buy somebody's favorite Christmas tree (in July). You then get to decide whether you want to be the pacifist and flee the scene, be the hero and fight off the bad guys or be the psycho and murder everyone you see. As RWS Inc. so proudly advertised, the game is only as violent as you are.      The graphics in this game are much more polished then the previous game, this time giving us a 3D first person environment to roam around in and a much more accurate targeting system. The music in the game, instead of only being frightening experimental percussion music like the first one, was actually collected from local bands in Tucson, the hometown  of Running With Scissors Inc. Being the sequel, the game also has a much bigger arsenal, ranging from military weapons to a variety of firearms, to many blunt and sharp objects to scissors and so on. The only real problem I have with this game is that nobody seems to be doing the multiplayer when I jump on, but maybe that's just me. Aside from that, if you have a strong stomach and are okay with offensive jokes delivered in a gruesome yet silly way, I highly recommend this game.			"

												Had a bad day at work? School? Life in general and you want to take it out on something or someone, but don't want to spend time in jail? Then Postal 2 is the game for you. A few hours of playing and you will feel much better. This game however, is NOT for those with no sense of humor. I picked it up on sale just to see what all the controversy was about and I love it. Yes, it will offend some, but what you do in the game, we all have wanted to do in life to others at some point. I would recommend this game to those with a good sense of humor and who doesn't take things so seriously.			"

												Postal 2 is exactly what you make of it. Yes, it can be a gruesome, unsavory, albeit cartoony, experience, and the game does push you to that end most of the time, but it can also be a open world game that allows you to explore a satirical world filled with both hilarious situations and expectations that speak volumes about paranoid, and in many ways complacent, mid-2000s America. In many ways, it shows how trivial the concerns of the time actually were in the grand scheme of things. Postal 2 needs to be given more credit for pushing the envelope for games; what was once considered taboo was torn apart and amplified in this game. Wholly recommended as an experience.			"

												Oops ! I forgot to write a review for one of my favorite games of all time ! I got this game when it first came out and had to buy this one when it came onto steam. I have the GOG version too and the Postal 2 mod called A Very Postal Christmas v1420 hosted on my website with permission from the creator Oagh. Naturally I've been a fan of this awesome game ever since it came out. Free roam and do whatever you want in it. Try not to play the game. I mean just try to NOT go and try to get that milk or check or errand done. If you do try and do an errand you might as well kiss your ♥♥♥ goodbye to being a nonviolent person. Huuuuummmmmooooouuuuurrrrrrr ! I mean id rather make a woman with a boob as a weapon mod sometimes with this game. I mean that is my next mod idea that i want to make for this game ! It just sounds so slapping funny ! I've played this game so much through these years that i even made some mods/levels/errands for this game too recently ! I have not done that with any game on steam yet except this one ! That is because this game is the best on steam !			"

												Postal 2 is definitely in my top 5 games of all time. There are so many features in this game that can strike awe, shock, joy and disgust within the hearts of so many people. It's the one game I will possibly always play. It's been around for about a decade, so there are some limits within the gameplay that can be distractive; Such as loading zones and the character and npc models (you can see their heads being detachable behind their necks.) but personally I'm indifferent to those negative sides. I reccomend this to anyone who likes FPS games, no exceptions (Besides those who regard a game's release date as what makes it good.)			"

												What can I say. I bought Postal 2 11+ years ago in a gamestop store for $50 when it was only a singleplayer game and I was just freshly addicted to pc gaming. Was hooked on the game from the 1st 5 minutes in as it was the most outragous game I'd ever played at that point. Hacking heads off with a shovel and kicking them around like soccer balls,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in people's faces until they puked, pouring gas all over a bunch of ""alternative lifestyle"" people dancing in a gay bar and setting them on fire, training stray dogs to attack anyone who attacked me.....and that's just during day 1.  Basically you live 5 days in the life of ""The Postal Dude"" and although you have a few chores to do each day that allow you to progress to the next day, the game is totally non-linear and open world. You play how you want to play and at what pace and spend as much time as you want exploring and discovering (and there's lot's to discover) as you want.   Then they finally released ""Share the Pain"", the version of Postal 2 that included multiplayer. Even though the network code wasn't the greatest and it was always a little buggy it quickly became my most played game for the next couple years. I started a clan, started running game servers for the 1st time, and eventually learned the unreal editor and made probably around 30 custom mp maps for the game.  Anyway to make a long story medium, even though the multiplayer community is scarce and pretty much nothing but super modded servers, the single player part of the game is well worth $10 any day of the week. The game is still being updated and patched often more then 11 years later and RWS is about to release a new expansion to the story/game which is looking even better then the original.   If you aren't easily offended, love to laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off, and want to♥♥♥♥♥♥in a cops face then buy this game now!			"

												HEY, BABY!

The game may market and structure itself as ""bad or stupid"", but it is definitely talented and smart in executing that.Sure, it's a stupid game. But so are Metal Gear Solid, Devil May Cry or Dead Rising.That doesn't matter. What matters is, as lord Plinkett would say, how well it resonates with the audience. Play Medal of Honor: Warfighter and Postal 2 and tell me which experience stuck with you the most.Postal 2 is great in the same ways Deadpool and Jackass are.

I love it.The gameplay is average.The guns and gunplay are extremely poor.The AI is either extremely stupid, or downright unfair.The Graphics, even for it's time were weak.The map design is lack-lusterThe sound design and music is extremely average.Despite all this, Postal 2 is still one of the greatest games I've ever bloody played.And for the $10 steam is asking, you don't really have anything to lose.

												Its pretty clear why this game got so much grief when it was originally released. I remember some of that and didn't play it back then, cuz, well it wasn't on store shelves that I can remember. Plus it just didn't look that interesting.Well, finally tried it and I gotta say that it does offend just to offend. To be fair, much of what you see in this game, you find as easter eggs in major titles nowerdays (like GTA, which borrows a lot from Postal).  And of course the whole open world, shot who you want type of thing is GTA's bread and butter.So, does it work? The game is entertaining and if you can get past the old graphics, its definately worth playing. On all max settings its ok. Gameplay is old-school, but fun.  Has crashed to desktop a bunch of times, which sucks.Final word, play it to see what the fuss was all about and see if you still think its that offensive. Definately worth picking up when its on sale.7/10			"

It has some problems like hit detection, lots of load screens (on the plus side, they do load fairly quickly) and a mildly annoying warning screen when you first load the game up - Every time.  That being said, this game is just stupid fun.  It seems like every day you come across new weapons, my favourites being the hand axe and the sledgehammer.  The squidgy noise when someones head explodes is insanely satisfying.  You can light people on fire,♥♥♥♥♥♥on them to put them out, shove the barrel of you gun up a stray cats bumhole, chop off limbs, and use the world as your toilet.  You can also shoot terrorists if you're into playing the role of world police too.  Or if you picked up this game thinking it was your typical FPS and you can't go thirty seconds without shooting someone of a different race in the face.All in all, Postal 2 is a stupid game that's meant to be stupid and succeeds very well in being just that.

												POSTAL 2, the rightful winner of the 'Best game which got a massive game-changing patch 11 years after its release'.With all the recent controversy about Hatred hitting Steam and causing some massive outrage by some moral guardians for reasons not even related to the game, I thought that it was about time to take a look at the title which caused a boatload of outrage from the moral guardians a decade ago.After the modest success of Postal 1, both at gaining a fanbase and receiving media outrage alike, Running with Scissors decided to take a totally different direction than the unhinged and distressing tone of the original game with Postal 2. In a valliant effort to not♥♥♥♥♥♥off as many people as possible, RWS decided that Postal 2 should start with the most harmless thing they could think of: Going to the store to buy a carton of milk. Unfortunately, stuff goes rather south in almost every way in Postal 2 in the most hilarious of ways.To start about Postal 2, the base game is split up into five days, wherin you must perform totally mundane-seeming tasks in the open-world sandbox town of Paradise, Arizonia, such as buying milk from the store, going to your job, and getting people to sign your petition to make whiny people play more videogames, for example. But stuff goes never the easy way in Postal 2. Such as arriving at work, getting called to the office to hear that you are being sacked on the spot as a dozen of outraged people storm the building in a violent protest against videogames. Or what to think of taking a wrong turn while walking around the open-world town ,as I somehow walked straight into the local terrorist base. Two hours and five signs and a bigger killcount than Hot Shots:Part Deux, I walked out with enough weaponry to arm a town at least thrice. Stuff rapidly escalates in Postal 2 like that in the most absurd kind of ways.While Postal 2 at its core is a very peaceful game. Or at least, the base game can be played though without killing anyone. You can be pretty much the only sane guy in the town as stuff rapidly goes more to hell and people get madder and madder as the days go by. It is more of a game of how long it does take for the player to snap and to play ball sports with the heads of the troublemakers, to say so. The game is as violent as the player. Which still♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the moral guardians off, as did it♥♥♥♥♥♥off many reviewers back in the day giving the game straight zeroes for it.And boy, does Postal 2 give the player a lot of choices in literally going postal. While in the first day of the game the weapons are pretty on the cookie-cutter and boring side, as the week passes, more and more interesting weapons and ways for harm come up. The player's arsenal range up from the usual FPS stuff like Deagles and M16's with the SPAS-12 threwn in, to the insanely unconventional stuff, such as scissors, napalm launchers, cow heads, chemical rockets and boomerang machetes. Along with the even more unconventional functions of the game, such as being able to use toilets for their real purpose, kicking everything and using catnip to slow time, Postal 2 sets up the scene for interesting sandbox action. Throw in AI getting more on edge as the game progresses and the map being chock-full of secrets rewarding exploration, and you got yourself a sandbox you can entertain yourself with for quite a while.Included in the game is also the first expansion pack of the game, Apocalypse Weekend. Unfortunately, Apocalypse Weekend isn't  in the open-world sandbox style of the base week, and focuses on two more days, where you are railroaded in small 'kill stuff' errands and long levels you have to battle yourself through. The pacing is unfortunately all over the place. The small errands with its maps shouldn't take you longer than 10 minutes each, and they are quite frankly pretty boring. The long levels are really chock-full of enemies to blow to pieces with your varied arsenal, and some of them are long enough to get eventually tiring on the higher difficulties to get through, mostly because of the enemy variance in those levels being stale. Even though Apocalypse Weekend added many weapons to Postal 2, which then have been put in the base game, Apocalypse Weekend shouldn't warrant more than one playthrough.Luckily enough, Running With Scissors is busy making their second expansion for this game, Paradise Lost, which will go back to the open-world sandbox spread over a week, which is due to come out next Spring. Along with the huge number of stuff they added in last year's patches, including new weapons, Workshop functionality and the official-making of some popular mods, Running With Scissors is still showing their dedication to their flagship title even 12 years after its inital release. Postal 2 might not be an absolute world-beater, but it is sure one of the more unique games to have come out, despite the stigma against it.			"

												I beg to you, DO NOT underestimate this game. People call it ''Boring'', because they probably not have finished the first three objectives. The people who find it ''Offensive'', may or may not know it's a comedy/satire, and take everything personally. The ''Gross-Out Humor'', is not as common as critics exaggerate.  After the previous game where he kills everyone in town,''Postal Dude'' moves to Paradise, Arizona with his darling morbidly obese wife. The only problem I had with this is that in the ending of Postal 1, has The Postal Dude get a psychological breakdown, then end up in a mental hospital. Everything about that is forgotton. Anyways, The Dude's wife nags him to do common errands, like buying some milk from a ethnic store. There are many outcomes to this.1.Buy the milk like a legal individual, and get insulted for being, ''unclean''.2.Shoplift the milk, which activates security, and fight Habib and the terrorists in the building.3.Get the milk, and kill everyone.4.Shoplift the milk, and find a secret underground area where mutant dogs try to kill you.5.Shoplift the milk, run upstairs and break through the window like a badass.Of course, the law enforcment can arrest you for being a Maniac.You Could:A: Kill him.B: Bribe him.C: Accept your arrest.D: Run away.E: Stand there like an idiot and get killed.Your actions have consequences, so be wise before♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥everywhere. There are more than♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and cussing, so give this game a try.Don't trust the overly harsh reviews from know-it-all professional game critics, if you like social/political satire, GO BUY NOW, YOU MIGHT BE DIE BEFORE YOU KNOW IT. That is all.  "

												Phenominal.You have to try the mod ""A Week In Paradise"" or AWP.2014 Edit:Postal 2 was updated to incorporate the A Week In Paradise mod officially into the main game with slight changes, and the update added and changed quite a few things aswell.Steam Workshop support was also added and users can now easily download mods.The game is set in the open free-roaming world of Paradise, Arizona. The player is given a set of optional objectives each day and once the player completes these objectives the game progresses to the next day which unlocks more areas and brings more variety in terms of random AI spawns.Each day also changes weapon spawns, too.The game really thrives on over-the-top comical bloody violence, I personally wish there was more to do other than shooting things in the face and getting milk at a small grocery store. I want side activities and better exploration.			"

												Im going to be blunt with this game, no tagine or anything, if there was the option on here to give BOTH a thumbs up and a thumbs down, that would be the best way to go along with it.This is because that this game happens to mix some really great gaming goodness along with a whole load of poor design choices mixed in with a heavy dose of content that pushes the taste boundaries heavily.Lets take the good first. The design of the main game is great, wandering around the town feels great, theres plenty to explore in the sandbox world, plenty to see and find and loads of hidden easter eggs. At no point does the gamespace feel samey or confusing. The actual structure of the main game works brilliantly too.Each day you are given seemingly 'Mundane' tasks to complete such as 'Get Milk', 'Get Paycheck' and the like. However it openly gives you the option on what YOU want to do to complete the missions. Do you want to be a pacifist and try and run through the game without killing? You can do that! Do you want to just go 'Postal' and shoot up the place? Yep! Do you want to cash yoyr 'Paycheck' by robbing the bank? Its all there.Where the bad comes in however is some of the gameplay, the actual engine isnt smooth, there isnt really any music of any note at all and the graphics have aged quite badly over the years. Bugs are aplenty as well, both annoying bugs and gamebreaking bugs are present with plenty of clipping, invisible walls, AI bugging out and wanted levels that refuse to vanish no matter what you do (or dont do). The other big 'Bad' comes with the weekend addon that destroys the open ended gameplay of the original week and forces you down a specific path.Oh and lets not forget the 'Offensive' nature of the game which may put some people off totally. Here we have blood, sex, drugs, using cats as silencers, camp stereotypes, arab stereotypes, urine, feces and the (now made even more potentially offensive given he is dead) appearance of Gary Coleman (And yes, you can murder him ingame too). Essentially avoid if you are offended easily or even moderately.And that about wraps it up. Once again. Thumbs up, Thumbs down and hard to just say right out if its bad or good. Hope this description has helped with things if you are planning to buy!			"

												This is a great game for anyone looking to blow off some Steam (pun intended). Released back in 2003 it still holds up after 12 years, both gameplay and entertainment wise. Postal 2 actually supersedes a lot of current releases when it comes to it's fluid physics for water, gasoline and even the p-i-s-s physics. The Steam version of Postal 2 includes the core game of Postal 2, Postal 2: Share The Pain (The Multiplayer Component), Postal 2: Apocalypse Weekend (an expansion pack for the original Postal 2 released back in 2005 which adds Sunday and Saturday), and finally Postal 2: A Week in Paradise (A mod developed by Resurrection Studios which adds the ability to play through both the core game of Postal 2 and Apocalypse Weekend in one sitting, with additional weapons such as the Chainsaw).If you want the Eternal Damnation mod you will either have to pick up The Fudge Pack (which also includes Postal 1, and other additional content like game trailers released prior E3), or download it for free and install it as an addon for your Postal 2 Steam Version of the game. This also doesn't include Akella's officially unofficial Штопор Жжот addon released back in 2005.Share The Pain could USE some (a lot actually) updates, it doesn't seem it has been updated ever since it's release as freeware in 2008; resulting in terrible connection problems, frequent disconnects, and barren list of servers. But Postal 2 is all about the Singleplayer experience, however, a mod or an expension implementing Co-Op would be a long-awaited and a welcome feature, allowing you to play the entire week with your friends would be a blast and add a lot of hours to anyone's playthroughs with additional replayabilty value to it's Singleplayer ""campaign"".The game overall runs at a steady framerate, whether you're playing it on a PC or a Mac. The only issues I had were some hard crashes of the game due to some missions getting stuck and the entire Steam client crashing - but with constant auto-saving this isn't a big issue. Overall, this is a great game and still gives me a massive nostalgia boost.			"

												Another game that would really benefit from a ""mixed"" recommendation.  This is a hard game to rate, because it's based on the player more than the game.  But there is a game behind it that needs to be reviewed.So the game is an old 13 year old game (released in 2003 so the future people have the actual time scale).   When Postal was popular with the mass murdering gameplay, Running With Scisssors worked on a sequel, and took their time, 6 years later, Postal 2 came out, and it's certainly different. 3d graphics versus an isometric game, story instead of random murder, and actually a very different tone as well. The problem is similar to other games it hasn't aged amazing.  13 year old 3d technology is quite interesting to see.  At the same time, Postal 2 is unlike any other game, and that's both a positive and a negative. Postal 2 tries very hard to be edgy, but it does so in a way that definitely makes it almost a time capsule.  Putting muslim suicide bombers in the game in 2003, was extremely tasteless, now... Not as much?   Osama Bin Laden's name is in the game, is that edgy any more?   Shooting bullets through cats (in oddly enough not as tasteless a way as someone would do now) I think a majority of the humor of the game has actually fallen away.   I mean there's a voting joke and it's referencing the 2000 election... It's actually a little funny, but that's one kind of humor you're going to get.   The other?  Well there's a way to pee on, anyone you want.   You have a very juvenile humor in this game, and yet it kind of works on some level.  The thing is the entire game tries VERY hard to be edgy, so if you can be offended, you will be.  Almost every woman is big breasted, and I don't mean 'there's a lot of Buxom characters'.  No, there's like ONE female player model and it's a big breasted woman, there's two males that I noticed, a skinny and a fat guy.   If that's going to offend you you're going to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  The only Muslims in the game are the terrorists/taliban who will attack you on sight, if you're going to be offended, you'll have a problem.  The list goes on.   If you can get offended, this game will try to find that button. But overall, I mean it's insults from 2003, that kind of don't hit any more.  I don't know, I can't really be offended by it, because it's made to offend, not because it's an honest opinion expressing itself. There is a bit of cognitive dissonance when you get to the trophies as they were added recently.   There's numerous references to both the League and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia as well as other recent pop culture in the trophies.  It's actually a weird touch, but you know what?  It kind of helps. As for the technical parts of the game, the majority of the game works perfectly, with the exception of the sound.  Ugh, the sound.  I'm going to guess this was the beginning of 3d sound technology, and maybe something's changed since then, but the main character speaks VERY loud, and every other important character is near impossible to hear.  A shame.I could go into more, but honestly.  If you want to see what got a lot of people's panties in a bunch in 2003 this is a perfect game for that.  It's not an amazing game, it's not going to blow you away.  This isn't going down in the hall of fame of gaming (except for its attempt at offensiveness) but I've played a lot of worse games, and Postal 2 seems to understand it's not a top tier game and has priced themselves at a realistic number.  Overall there's a game that works well (though I did see a few crashes).  It's both incredibly playable and interactive.  It actually has a lot of choice involved in it (you can beat the game without killing anyone or ignore the story and go on a murder rampage, the game allows both options).  And with the exception of the sound issue that was an annoyance, it's still a solid game. If you're unsure, I would probably not recommend the game, but for what it is, it's a positive gaming experience.  Just be sure you know what you're getting into and aren't going to get offended by 13 year old jokes (that are probably also aimed at 13 year olds)			"

Unique, offensive, violent, crazy, gross, crude,  rude and just great fun.So don't pay attention to the so called professional reviews and judge for yourself. Or if not sure get it on special like I did for around $2. Iam glad I did I would even pay full price for it as Iam having fun with it. Even when completed it's likely a game that I will come back to.I'd reccomend and rate it 7/10			"

Nothing is off limits for Running With Scissors (The guys who made the game).  It's really offensive in so many ways.  Wanna put a cat on the end of your shotgun to use as a silencer?  Go ahead.  Wanna throw pairs of scissors at people?  Why not? Wanna chop somebodys head off and then pee on their corpse?.......Well yeah, you can also do that.  I think everybody can find something in this game that they enjoy.  There are so many weapons and so many movie references that that fill this game that I just couldn't stop playing it till the end.			"

I think everybody can find something in this game that they enjoy.  There are so many weapons and so many movie references that that fill this game that I just couldn't stop playing it till the end.			"

												You can't judge 100% whether you'll like a game or not just from a review as everyone has different tastes.I found this game more fun than playing some other games that were highly rated but were overhyped and not as good as the reviews made out. Unique, offensive, violent, crazy, gross, crude,  rude and just great fun.So don't pay attention to the so called professional reviews and judge for yourself. Or if not sure get it on special like I did for around $2. Iam glad I did I would even pay full price for it as Iam having fun with it. Even when completed it's likely a game that I will come back to.I'd reccomend and rate it 7/10			"

												Postal 2 is one of those games, sick, tasteless, and certainly not afraid to offend people. Postal 2 will definatly be considered a guilty pleasure by many players who enjoy the game. Postal 2 is a PC only game first released in April of 2003 and was developed by Running with Scissors. In Postal 2 you play as the Postal dude, a guy who lives in a caravan with his wife in a city known ironically enough as ""Paradise"", that's really it as far as story goes, it's pratically non-existant.The game is divided up into 7 days; monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday and Sunday. In each day your objectives are to perform menial tasks such as buying milk, paying your speeding fine, all that kind of stuff. What makes each day interesting though, is that you have the freedom to go through these objectives as you see fit, do you try go through the game not laying harm upon an NPC? Or do you go Postal and kill everyone in your way, or kill as many people as you see fit.If you do go the POSTAL route, there is a large varity of weapons ranging from shovels and mechetes, to M16 rifles and Remington shotguns, Jerry cans and stun guns, hunting rifles and Napalm launchers, the list goes on. If you are unsatisfied of the look of the M4 Carbines and/or Remington shotguns, you can always decorate them by putting a cat silencer onto the barrel.At the end of most menial tasks something can go horribly wrong, such as while confessing your sins at a church, the church will be attacked by terrorists, and you gotta escape avoiding all the enemies, or kill all of them. I gotta say, the hit detection of most of the weapons are sometimes pretty hit-n-miss, for example using the shotgun isn't always an instant kill upon headshot, even at the closest range possible, the same case applys to the hunting rifle, although this issue never became too big or annoying enough to make me quit the game or yell in anger. If you get caught by the police doing things you shouldn't you'll gain a wanted level and you gotta hide to reduce it until it runs out and you're free to roam about again, unless you get arrested in which case you gotta escape from prison, the cool part is that the wanted system also applies to NPCS, so watching other NPCS going postal never gets old.Speaking of a wanted system you can also find a policeman's uniform and become a cop and perform all the crimes you want that aren't against cops.Oh yeah you can pee in this game, I'm not joking, at any moment you can press the R key and start♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on things as much as you please, and if you forget to zip up your pants NPCS will remark at it saying things like ""No one's impressed"", ""I've seen bigger"", and ""Hey! Mr Peepshow! Put your hands in the air!"".Also, I gotta mention the impressive fire system, when you got a Jerry Can, you can pour gasoline and pour pools of the stuff and ignite it when ready, when NPCS walk in the fire, they will often run at other NPCS which will set them on fire, until they turn into a burnt corpse holding on to their life.I gotta say though, the voice acting apart from the Postal dude is just horrendous, all the NPCS sound like they have the same voice just with a different pitch and often talk like this; ""Hi, That'll be. 400. Bucks."". The Postal dude, while has some bad lines, still makes up for it by having a sort of personality with many lines, such as ""Somebody stole my donut! now you're all gonna pay!"".The A.I. is also pretty bad, regularly forgetting to shoot their gun at me and getting in the way a lot.The world itself is very open and you can go anywhere as you see fit as long as the game lets you because some areas are inaccessable until a day such as friday or wednesday, if you're out of money and you don't feel like getting it the legal way, you can always head to the Paradise Bank and go inside the vault and empty it out stealing hundreds of $. You pretty much can do whatever you want at anypoint of the game. Also, 90% of buildings in Postal 2 you can enter, so if you feel like it, you can go around and literally kick open most doors in the game, or if you're too cool to go through the door you can always kick through the windows. Since the world is so open, it encourages a lot of exploration, which rewards explorers with weapons, items, and some secret areas.Soundwise, there isn't really any music in the game aside from some ambiance inside of a store, all the weapons got a nice ring to them, and the voice acting is again terrible.Graphically, the game for it's time looked ""okay"", by today's standards it definatly look's dated but never really subtracted the experience for me.Also Garry Coleman is in this game, no seriously check it out.Overall, I can't say I can recommend this game to everybody, I mean I've enjoyed it a large amount and I'm glad it focuses more on fun rather than fancy graphics or voice acting, but much of the humor is usually about toilet humor, homosexuals, rednecks, Arab-Terrorists, some sterotypes, animal cruelty that kind of stuff. I mean hell this game is known as one of the most offensive games to come out for a reason which caused it to get outright banned in countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Althought if you can get by the of childish humor, I'm sure you might have a blast with the game, I know I did.Did I mention Uwe Boll made a movie about this game?Postal 2 sure defines the term ""Guilty Pleasure""7/10			"

												Some of you may be thinking,""What could be so great about a game from 2003?""I'll tell you what's great about it.It is the only game I know to date that you can meet Gary Coleman, get his autographed autobiography, decapitate Gary Coleman, burn his body, and then urinate on his decapitated head.This game is great if you don't mind vulgarity.  If you are easily offended then DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  This series is so offensive to some, 2000 Vice President nominee Joe Lieberman ran a campaign against the first one.Long story short, this is a game to sit down with a couple of friends, and commit random acts of violence, and have a long laugh.

												Probably Postal 2 is the only game that was banned in most countries for its gross, abhorrent content. I'll elaborate what this means: you can unzip your pants and pee on all the citizens you encounter, there's animal cruelty, all kinds of racial and ethnic stereotypes you can imagine, there's even vomiting and wherever you go there's a lot of violence.In the game you play as the Dude (cool but not as cool as Big Lebowsky's Dude), a fellow who needs to survive one week. One week in his small town with the general daily tasks such as picking up the hard-earned wages or buying milk or taking back the book to the library. But something always happens: when you go to the church to confess your sins, for example, Arab terrorists attack. The game allows you to go wherever you want and whenever you want: essentially, it feels like a non-linear game. Once you reach your destination a cutscene takes place and you follow a linear path after which you are back in town free to go to the place you desire.The game looks horrendous but it is understandable as it is a more than 10-year old software. Even at the time of its release it looked outdated. Still, it is a fun game and the Steam version comes with expansion packs and achievements. If it is discounted, it is easily the best purchase currently on Steam!			"

												I got Postal 2 on a whim after voting it up on Greenlight. I can safely say:I regret nothing. You won't either, go get it.Postal 2 is actually smarter than it looks at first glance. Sure, you can go through it in a ""normal"" way where you go through, shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥up, and be a complete ♥♥♥♥ing psychopath... but you can also play as a complete pacifist. Seriously. You can complete the game without killing a thing. You get a special message at the end.It's also a bit of a satire on the way that society was going at the time. And it's hilarious. It's stood the test of time. In fact, it's been vindicated by history in my eyes. It's a blast to play.It's definitely better than Russian Postal... er, Postal 3.			"

												It's an age old game that's more of insanity bordering on the welcome-to-the-asylum line than anything else. It's what you would expect from a FPS game but at the same time, there are parts of it that I enjoyed more than anything else I've played in a long time. There are still some bugs within the game, despite being out for such a long time. One such bug I encountered was that I cut off both legs from an NPC, she got up and started to run away on invisible legs. If you go to jail, you lose everything; your guns, money, food, anything that's not your matches since you need that to break out of jail. Also, if you catch on fire, pee on yourself to put yourself out. It's not much of a sandbox although you can treat it as one if you disregard the mission that you are currently on sometimes. Other times, the mission does not allow you to freely roam and you must stick to the mission in question. All in all, I do recommend this game.This game truly entertained me for quite a while as I ran around the maps throwing my machete and waiting for it to boomerang back to me. Not only that, I loved going on a rampage and killing everyone with my insane weapons. You could say the same for GTA and Saints Row games but there's just something about peeing on someone, watching them throw up out of disgust, then kicking them until they die. Another entertaining thing to do: throwing a sledgehammer at the♥♥♥♥♥of a cow. Trust me...I spent half an hour doing that until I died from being rammed by the same cow I was ramming.			"

While you perform the daily rituals of an average guy, such as getting milk or cashing in your paycheck, you may decapitate annoying protestors, dismember Taliban terrorists, or fetch with your dog with a severed head.

												Great game for those who want to just turn their brain off every once in a while and enjoy something twisted. Postal 2 is a (almost) sandbox first person shooter that is meant to offend. It is meant to be sick. But here's what the angry parents don't tell you. You have the freedom of choice in almost every scenario.Feel free to pay 5 dollars to Haji for that carton of milk. Or you could simply wax everybody in the store and walk out with a carton of milk and 5 dollars. That being said, (and I must agree with the angry parents) this game is not for children (or easily offended, pansy, liberals.)Silly, violent, funny, quirky, violent, politically topical, and violent; Postal 2 is for the adults who want a sick yet enjoyable experience.

												Postal 2 is not a good game. It's a very rough, outdated and primitive game. This doesn't mean it's not worth your time or money. Postal 2 is simply phenominal. The story is almost non-existent, you play as a middle aged american badass doing chores for his fat wife. You can do this peacefully like a goody two shoes or you can show some balls and shoot the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone with plenty of unique and awesome weapons. You can♥♥♥♥♥♥on people, you can meet and/or brutally murder child star Gary Coleman, you can do just about anything you want. Postal 2 might have been poorly made with simple and glitchy graphics and gameplay, it may have horrible acting and bland characters and story events, but it captures anything a game would and should ever have to. Fun. 9/10 personally7/10 as a game itself			"

												You will find Postal 2 on numerous sites and gaming lists as the most conversial game of all time. I recently obtained a newer PC & after finally getting this game again I can happily say, it has aged gloriously! Postal 2 completely blows it's nose with the first game and it's story and starts something hilarious. While Postal was about the dude going on a city wide killing spree featuring dark psychotic tones, the sequel is the dude just trying to live out a week in his city while dealing with a completely exaggerated but hilarious enviroment. The levels are broken up into days of the week and it's semi free roam, meaning you can go where you want but certain areas don't open up until a later day. The game, at first on the easier difficulties, really is as violent as you are until your forced to deal with one of the many hate groups you encounter over the week. Postal 2 has alot of replay value too, when you beat it you can play through again in Enhanced mode which just makes the game pure gold.The Steam Support for this game is incredible. 68+a few hidden Achievements,Multiplayer,Workshop Support, and Steam Cards. Also comes with a Level Editor!Performance wise the game looks great for being over 10 years old! Win 8.1 No complaints			"

												Postal 2 is one of my favorite games of all time.There are quite a few misconceptions regarding Postal 2. I've talked to people that have never played the game and they thought all you did in the game was kill people. That is incorrect. Yes, there is pretty much no story, only mundane tasks like cashing in your check from work, and picking up your laundry. A lot of the time, something crazy happens, like while you're cashing in your paycheck, the bank get's robbed and the cops and robbers get into a shootout, or video game conservatives raid the game developer's HQ that you just got fired from. Yes, there are tons of weapons. Yes, the game is VERY gorey. But in a way, Postal 2 is less violent than Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto has missions that literally tell you to go to X, kill Y. Postal 2 doesn't. It gives you a very large arsonal of weapons, but that's it. They never tell you to USE those weapons.""The game is only as violent as you are.""Now, onto why this is one of my favorite games of all time...It's bloody fun, no pun intended.There have been days where I have just felt awful. I had a bad day, and just wanted to release some stress. So I'd hop on Postal 2, and go on a murderous rampage. About 30 minutes - an hour later, i'd feel refreshed and in a better mood. This game is the greatest stress ball ever created.The combat is fun, the AI isn't very good, but still serviceable. The enemies range from angry protestors, rednecks, and of course, police.I really like the police in this game. They act like actual police, unlike Grand Theft Auto, where it's more of a parody of police. Also, you have the option to surrendor and get arrested. You are then placed in a cell, with all of your weapons stripped away. You can break out and steal your weapons back.I also really like the map. It's not very big, but certainly not small. Especially considering you only walk in this game, there are no vehicles. You can find some pretty messed up things through out the map. I once found a backyard that had an entire family with their bodies burned to a bloody crisp, with a rotting cow head placed on; what looked like a religous artifact. This game is very bloody and gorey, but you can disable it if it's too intense for you.Running With Scissors earned my respect from this game. They didn't give a damn about political correctness, or what people thought of them and the game. They simply made the game they wanted. While I absolutely love this game, and know a few people that do as well... I also know a few people that despise this game. I really can't recommend this game to everybody.

												This game describes your basic Monday: Wake up, go get your paycheck, murder a bunch of protesters who don't like what you do for a living, pee in a cops face till they puke(R. Kelly style!), go to cash that paycheck, murder some cops who think your robbing the joint, go buy some milk, ask people kindly if they would sign my petition, agressively yell at them to sign it when they refuse to the first time, kill them when they don't sign it, then go to the library to return an overdue book. Ah, Monday, when did you become so fun. Oh, and you still have the rest of the week for fun as well.			"

												I've always heard a lot about this game, and been intrigued by it due to it's credentials for controversy. Finally decided to buy it and try for myself. I wasn't expecting much in terms of gameplay but am I in for a surprise. 10 years on and I have to say I haven't played a game this fun for a long while. Yes, it's very crude and sets out to offend, and production values are pretty low, but that's actually the point, and in fact where the wacky fun comes in. I don't play video games to be polictically correct!The very wide variety of weapons and items in an open world with plenty of NPC in-fighting allows for creative play which IMHO is unmatched by any game in recent history. The fact that you can wee on yourself to put out a flesh fire is unprecedented (and dare I say, unlikely to be replicated) in gaming history and reason enough to experience this game. They simply don't make games like this anymore. If only someone has the guts to make and, most of all, publish something like this today!			"

												Postal 2 Is a game which was developed by a super high and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ team that tries it best to cinically mimic and make fun of American cultuer and weidspread Ideologies . In this game you play as the Postal Dude who basically wanders around this town doing a series of stupid and weird objectives for several groups which are based on real American Ideolgies. Pros : + semi-open world game+ A huge weapon Arsenal + Murder your neighbours+ Steam WorkShop + A really long and funny story ( 10 Hours long )  + You can use cats as gun silencers   ""Maskeen GUCCI :(  ""+ pee on people you hate + Meet the game devlopers  "" in-game""  + Jihad Milk + Kill Osama Bin Lopez and destroy Al Qaeda Militarry base + You can incciate World Peace + Zombie extermination Simulator +You can♥♥♥♥♥♥on a cat and then taze it to death+Gore 2.0 + Realistic Brutality ( you can cut all body limbs)+ Super Funny + You can commit genocide+ Alot of Fun +9.99 $Cons : - Terrible Graphics ( old game ) -  Super Racist- You can kill the developers xD Verdict : 9 / 10Imagine the world of Grand Theft Auto without the use of cars. Now combine this with the psychotic NPCs, weapon/item gathering, and combat mechanics of Dead Rising (only in 1st person). Sprinkle in enough political incorrectness to challenge South Park and you have Postal 2.Postal 2 is one of the funniest and most entertaining games out there with story , gameplay and entertainment .It's worth every penny. "" Note : This is an 18 + Adult  game that might be too Violent and disgusting to some players "" Go buy it now if you love GUCCI and Environmental Agencies  xD			"

												One of the best games I've ever played in my life, but pretty hard. This game isn't suitable for little children, because this contains lots of violence. In this game you can kill people with lots of different weapons and p*ss on everything, for example. I haven't still completed saturday, because the guy with a rocketlauncher is too hard and I think that sunday will be even harder. Indeed, this is worth of all money and this is my way to make bad day better. I recommend!			"

												First off, this isn't something you want your kid under the age of like 14-15 playing.  This one is for YOU,The original game from 2003 - Postal 2 - based on the Unreal Engine is a satire-laced adventure into the open-world fps genre.  If you like to laugh, like to hunt for secrets (think Doom type secrets), enjoy trying to find 'others ways of doing things', or just wish to blow off steam while getting a good laugh - this game is entirely for you.  Do not hesitate.A few things you can do in this game:Kick or throw cats through a window or use them as a silencerLure cops with donuts (or dress up as one)Lure dogs with dog treats or bags of foodRob the bank (more than one way)Be a pacifist and don't hurt anyone who doesn't try to hurt you.Go on a murderous rampage with any number of over a dozen different weaponsPee on someone and make them barf (or shoot you, or run away)Douse a person or people in gas and well... you know the rest[enhanced game] Give cats catnip, and then pick them back up and then throw them onto someone and they become a taz-style dervish.  Catnip normally just attracts cats in the basic game, or you can smoke it!Find a Chris-Mess tree in July (in Arizona!) for your nagging wife[this next one is for all the guys involved in Operation Iraqi Freedom/Enduring Freedom]Find the secret taliban base and exterminate them and get the WMD!also....Roam around accomplishing nothing but exploration or mayhem ignoring all the mission objectivesBlow off a whole-lotta-steam from a hard days work with a good laugh...this is barely a comprehensive list... many many more things to do, I won't spoil it allBest of all - it runs on even the more basic computers available today!  You don't need an incredibly powerful gaming machine!Seriously - you'll want to try this one.The PARADIS LOST DLC:  GET IT, if you enjoyed the base game, YOU MUST GET IT.  Higher res textures, more detailed level design (duh), new missions.  It's making up for all those years since the Apoc Weekend DLC game out.  So reasonably priced too!Running With Scissors, I cannot thank you enough.  This is awesome.  You don't know the redeeming quality that is massacre-ing a GINGER that loves Chris-Mess.  That aweful holiday rhumba got me in the mood for war quicker than anything!  Peeing on Gingers, Animal Abuse, Impersonating a cop, exploring the run-down mostly abandoned mall, and little monkeys with guns that are half-robot or something.  It's all just so awesome.You keep making DLC's,  I'll keep buying them.  GREAT WORK!  Oh, and if anyone reading this is Irish... no offense, I just happen to have one after me in real life who is trying to illegally track me.  Don't take it to heart unless you're that one person.   This is a well made game through and through, DLC and all, don't pass it up, especially if you have a sense of humor.   Just bring that 320$ for a roll of TP otherwise you'll have to hawk cats for money :)			"

												This is a fantastic game so long as you aren't easily offended by its humor or have problems with blood and gore. I would recomend this when its on sale its like a more violent and goofy kind of Gta but better cause of its funny weapons and characters. Again Keep in mind this is not  a game for kids or the easily offended. This was easily a fantastic $2 well spent for this game.			"

												Postal 2 takes everything you love in video games (like peeing on enemy corpses that you've slaughtered and playing fetch using a severed head with your best friend to name but a few) and integrates it seamlessly in an open-world anarchist humour-fest.Do I pay for things and conform to society? Or do I smash their heads in and get things done however I see fit? Do I set them on fire then proceed to pee on them to extinguish the fire only to stab them repeatedly with a pair of scissors? Do I run and hope for the best or do I shove a shotgun barrel up a kittens sacred region as a make-shift silencer and take everyone out? These are but a few of the vast choices you will be making, and at the end of the day who said anyone had to die? It's all about completing the tasks, whichever way you see fit.While the regular Postal 2 gameplay is quite mellow, if you're looking for serious action (Resident Evil meets Silent Hill) from start till finish that will keep you on the edge of your seat and which resembles more of a quick-paced Half-Life run I'd thoroughly recommend the Apocalypse Weekend mode (after you've completed the main Monday-Friday run of course, to get into the swing of things as Postal 2 isn't your normal shooter and takes a bit of getting used to).All in all, for a game that was released in 2003 (over 10 years ago!) the constant updates (up until this very year, over 10 years later) have only improved the content tenfold, from better graphical support (widescreen now available!) to bug fixes and gameplay improvement you're guaranteed a smooth transition into what is certainly one of the best first person shooters around. Do yourself a favour and give Postal 2 a try, you can't go wrong.			"

												Postal 2 is a game that tried very hard to ensure that if you don't leave completely offended, you will eithera) have a good chuckle and laugh a great deal or,b) see the completely flawed game mechanics and truthfully... abysmal game veiled under some uncreative, yet funny, game comedy.So obviously this game is not for everyone, specifically anyone who is easily offended, by either the ability to urinate as an attack of sorts, maybe the odd run in with drugs as a major health increase, or perhaps the major idea of the game being that life's ultimate short-cut is extrenous violence.But if you can take this game with a good humour, it is a very odd corner of the video game world that should be experienced once in a while.Yes, as a game, its pretty bad, the shooting is clunky, you have many different items in your inventory and yet no real way to easily access them, and the goals are a bit vague and confusing at times, making you guess or give up and drop a few pedestrians and urinate on their corpses.It has a charm though, very quirky, and with a few really interesting points in the days, usually ending in hilarity or a side-ways look of judgement from whomever notices you playing it.If you can get it for around 5 bucks, it can be worth it, but don't expect an award winner.5.4/10			"

												As said thousands of times, Postal 2 is a game that isn't recommended for the easily offened. I, being a average white male, found this game hilarious. You can do thousands of things like. Asking people to sign your petition then if they decline, peeing in their mouth. Or fighting a quiki-mart manager for calling you a ""infedel"". Then finding out he has 21 virgin terrorist babes with guns upstairs. And even burning a whole marching band, watching them burn alive, then stand there as they all try to crawl away charred and mangled. This game is hours of stupid fun. And it has a workshop page where people upload thier own levels for you to pee on even more people.			"

												One of the most fun and addicting games I have ever played. The game has clever, funny satire. It rewards you for exploring, having lots and lots of hidden areas with weapons and health items. I'm still finding new things after well over a dozen playthroughs. It has fun, entertaining tasks to complete. Be it getting milk from a store or committing genocide on an unsuspecting town using shotguns and machineguns fitted with silencers made out of still living cats, Postal 2 will surely provide you with hours upon hours of entertainment.

												Postal 2 Is a game which was developed by a super high and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ team that tries it best to cinically mimic and make fun of American cultuer and weidspread Ideologies . In this game you play as the Postal Dude who basically wanders around this town doing a series of stupid and weird objectives for several groups which are based on real American Ideolgies. Pros : + semi-open world game+ A huge weapon Arsenal + Murder your neighbours+ Steam WorkShop + A really long and funny story ( 10 Hours long )  + You can use cats as gun silencers   ""Maskeen GUCCI :(  ""+ pee on people you hate + Meet the game devlopers  "" in-game""  + Jihad Milk + Kill Osama Bin Lopez and destroy Al Qaeda Militarry base + You can incciate World Peace + Zombie extermination Simulator +You can♥♥♥♥♥♥on a cat and then taze it to death+Gore 2.0 + Realistic Brutality ( you can cut all body limbs)+ Super Funny + You can commit genocide+ Alot of Fun +9.99 $Cons : - Terrible Graphics ( old game ) -  Super Racist- You can kill the developers xD Verdict : 9 / 10Imagine the world of Grand Theft Auto without the use of cars. Now combine this with the psychotic NPCs, weapon/item gathering, and combat mechanics of Dead Rising (only in 1st person). Sprinkle in enough political incorrectness to challenge South Park and you have Postal 2.Postal 2 is one of the funniest and most entertaining games out there with story , gameplay and entertainment .It's worth every penny. "" Note : This is an 18 + Adult  game that might be too Violent and disgusting to some players "" Go buy it now if you love GUCCI and Environmental Agencies  xD			"

												Go to the shop and buy some milk - How many people will you kill along the way? How many cats will you penetrate? Will you need that chainsaw? Where did you get that severed head? When did you become addicted to crack? These are just some of the questions you'll have to answer in Postal 2.If you've ever wanted to cut someones head off and then urinate on it, guess what? You're NOT alone! In Postal 2 you can meet like minded people, share tips on how best to humilate, abuse, mutilate and cause general suffering to.... Anyone!Personally, I enjoy urinating in someones face untill they start vomiting violently, then I give them a full charge from a tazer and watch them lose control of thier bladder while convulsing on the floor in a puddle of thier own vomit and urine. Then I take a lovely little break, smoke a crack pipe, eat a slice of 'za, maybe even have a doughnut and then it's back to work. I'll take the hedge trimmers I borrowed from a neighbor (after I cut his head off with a machete) and remove thier hands and feet one by one, if they survive that I'll take off thier arms and legs and sometimes, they even survive that, so I'll cut them in half.Once a cop survived! No arms, no legs and cut in half, as his guts slowly started to seep out and he was crying, I thought I better not miss an oppertunity, so I dropped my trousers and bust one out up the wall, when I was done, shame ejected, I covered him in petrol, throw a match on him, and left. I had made it to the shop and bought some milk, now I just needed to get home......But that's another story........Postal 2! It's ****ing bat**** crazy! You'd be crazy to not play it! You'd be crazy if you played it! You'd be crazy to listen to me! I'm off my med's! You'd be crazy too if your wife ran away with your grandma!

												Are you tired of playing as that lone single survivor mowing down legions of moaning zombies with a sawed-off shotgun? Perhaps you're sick of being that dynamic hero who saves the town/planet/universe/whatever from thousands of enemy soldiers/aliens/demons/zombies/whatever? If you said yes to any of these, perhaps maybe you should give Postal 2 a try...quite possibly one of the wackiest and most offensive FPS games out there.The game takes place in a corrupt town called Paradise, where you play as the Postal Dude, a henpecked husband running errands (missions) all over the town for his nagging wife. The game plays on a day-to-day basis (monday through friday for the postal 2 mode, saturday and sunday for apocolapse weekend mode, and all 7 days for the AWP mode), and missions can range from just about everything from picking up your paycheck, getting people to sign your petition and picking up milk. Sounds like nothing could possibly go wrong, right? Well...you'll also encounter plenty of enemies, ranging from crazy cannibal butchers, rampaging rednecks, corrupt cops, the taliban and even violent video game protestors.The game itself is actually very non-linear in design, which is a treat. You can complete the errands you have to do at your own pace to have time to explore your envoirnments to find plenty of weapons and other collectables, or you can simply complete your missions as quickly as you can to beat the game as quickly as possible. Also you can make the game as violent as you want---you can go postal and kill everyone and everything with a variety of different weapons, including gasoline, rocket launchers, firearms, grenades, shovels, knives, and even your own urine...or you can try to be a pacifist and not kill anyone (though it's heavily encouraged at times).In short, this game certainly isn't for everyone: Postal 2 tries really hard to be as offensive as possible, and there's plenty of ridiculously over-the-top violence. However, if you're looking for a unique FPS to play, or simply have a dark sense of humor, Postal 2 is worth a buy...and the $10 price tag is hard to beat. 4.0/5.0			"

												I first played this game when i was a little kid, like i was 6 or 7 years old . I played it for the first time in 2004 in the cyber caffe in my town . I loved urinating on random people, hitting them with a shovel and tasing them . I finished that game with cheats back in 5 years, i loved it absolutely so much . It`s worth to buy it on Steam, it has so much new features, new weapons and etc . It`s my chilhood game :)			"

												-Starting the game for the first time-Nice intro! puking people ok uhm oh, that's me, let's play ~* 5 secs later*I killed my dog after peeing on his face, starting a new game... that won't happen again.* 15 secs later*My dog was killed by some random dude with a shotgun. I killed him using a shovel and proceed to profanate his corpse.---------Now the actual note---------An old game, sure it is. Poor graphics? yeah, also some bugs and errors BUT, beside all those flaws, is still being an awesome psycho-simulator! The gameplay is the important thing here.There are some things in gaming that can only be accomplished in POSTAL 2, and also the price isn't excesive.Well... there was a time I felt actually bad: I chopped both legs (using a scythe) of a female cop that happen to look like my gf; she crawled a bit to then stop only to cry. And keep crying, so I did something humane to stop her suffering: using a gas tank and matches I set her on fire, and after a minute of sorrow the postal guy proceed to kick her on the floor to the death.JustPostalThings... if you play it, you'll know what I was talking about ~			"

												Now with Steam Workshop support, along with recent patchwork, there's no reason not to go back to this game once more! Honestly, when it came out, it was pretty groundbreaking at the time. In the early-mid 2000's, games were finally able to ""let loose"" shall we say with regard to more adult content. Postal 2 definitely had a lot of firsts in that regard.While Postal 2 is not as shocking now as it was in the past, it's still the one and only game I've played which allows for the player to urinate on people. When this came out a little over 10 years ago (and granted, I was still in High School then), all someone needed to tell me was that you can♥♥♥♥♥♥on people in this game. It reminded me of when I was a kid in Elementary School, and a friend of mine told me about this new game Duke Nukem 3d (at the time). He told me I could pee in toilets and pay women to show me their boobs; I was sold. This is the kind of thing that will be immediately off-putting to some, while immediately endearing to others. With this kind of game, it's a ""love it or hate it"" situation. Even when we're older, sometimes it can be nice to just go back and unwind for a bit. We need to experience what it's like to be a kid again in silly ways, and this is definitely one of them.Unfortunately, Postal 3 was a flop, but hey, more reason to go back to this one! If you've never played it, and if absurd, over-the-top, politically incorrect humor sounds appealing to you, go for it! Have a blast with this one, and don't take it (or yourself) too seriously.			"

												As said thousands of times, Postal 2 is a game that isn't recommended for the easily offened. I, being a average white male, found this game hilarious. You can do thousands of things like. Asking people to sign your petition then if they decline, peeing in their mouth. Or fighting a quiki-mart manager for calling you a ""infedel"". Then finding out he has 21 virgin terrorist babes with guns upstairs. And even burning a whole marching band, watching them burn alive, then stand there as they all try to crawl away charred and mangled. This game is hours of stupid fun. And it has a workshop page where people upload thier own levels for you to pee on even more people.			"

It rewards you for exploring, having lots and lots of hidden areas with weapons and health items. I'm still finding new things after well over a dozen playthroughs.

Be it getting milk from a store or committing genocide on an unsuspecting town using shotguns and machineguns fitted with silencers made out of still living cats, Postal 2 will surely provide you with hours upon hours of entertainment.

												Honestly what is there to say about this game? It's chaotic, its got *really* dark humor and it's fun. But even with all of the crazy stuff that you can do in the game, there's a more peaceful route. Despite its name ""Postal"" (means becoming extremely and uncontrollably angry), you can play the entire game like a normal person and not kill everyone (which I highly doubt you will.) And the DLC is fantastic to play as well, and it's shame that the third game was a mess. Give this game a try if you like see a cat being used as a silencer.			"

												Postal 2 is an enjoyable game in which you can carry out the tasks of a week from either Monday to Friday, Monday to Sunday or just the apocalyptic weekend, depending on what mode you play. Despite dated graphics, Postal 2 is definitely a loveable game that allows the player to be as violent as they please. You can even try being completely passive, I'd imagine it's difficult, but they say it's doable. Running With Scissors took a simple idea of doing tasks for your wife and made a game out of it, and did it very well. It is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish, but I confess I've yet to get my lazy♥♥♥♥♥to play everything again. Regardless, the game is immensly enjoyable for those who like the humor in it and the ever lovable voice of Rick Hunter, as the beloved Postal Dude, really nails his lines in a perfect manner.Even more fun is that you can see the game devs themselves on the first day, and you can pass through their offices on your travels. And as an added bonus, they often aid you in combat. So with a large array of weapons (including the ability to♥♥♥♥♥♥everywhere), you'll find many creative ways to kill enemies, cops or innocent bystanders as you try to make it to the end of each day.I'd recommend buying this game at any price, either full retail or on sale, as it is good fun and the developers deserve whatever you could give. But if you are somewhat easily offended, don't like the violence, don't like dated grahics or you are a plain old buzzkill, don't bother getting it. It wouldn't be for you.Note: a link to my PL review since it doesn't seem to show up properly at the time of posting: http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_boggy_fella/recommended/360960/ "

Another problem is the multiplayer, don't misunderstand me, but sometimes there are some connection Problems and other Problems, like modded serves that you can't connect to or (just sometimes) hacker. But on the other hand, the multiplayer mode can be very funny (and bloody).So, to say with my final words:If you (older people) Loved this game back in your days, you should totally buy it (if you don't own it) and if you don't mind some issues with the game.But younger people should also buy the game, not only because it's a classic, because also it's really funny to play, because you can just shut down your brain, while playing and enjoy masses of mindless Violence (and if you love old games) .

												What can I say about the game that I have completed over 15 times and I still enjoy playing to this very day?The beauty about Postal 2 is that it gives you a true choice. For example, one of your first errands buying milk can be completed in 3 ways:1) Walk inside the shop, get milk, wait in a line, pay 5$ for it.2) Walk inside the shop, get milk, don't bother waiting in the line and just steal the milk.3) Walk inside the shop, get milk, kill everyone in the shop, get into the back room and steal everything you can.After completing the game, you can replay it. On higher difficulties or with a different play style.There are fun achievements, that actually make you play the game in a different way.There is multilayer and there is a strong modding community that makes awesome maps and mods.And finally. you help making Postal 4 a reality. A true sequel that the fans deserve. Something that RWS will develop in the house and make it even more awesome than Postal 2 (if such a thing is even possible).Do I need to say more?TL;DR Version: Buy it! Or I will follow you home and kill your dog. I'm not kidding. :P			"

												I've always heard a lot about this game, and been intrigued by it due to it's credentials for controversy. Finally decided to buy it and try for myself. I wasn't expecting much in terms of gameplay but am I in for a surprise. 10 years on and I have to say I haven't played a game this fun for a long while. Yes, it's very crude and sets out to offend, and production values are pretty low, but that's actually the point, and in fact where the wacky fun comes in. I don't play video games to be polictically correct!The very wide variety of weapons and items in an open world with plenty of NPC in-fighting allows for creative play which IMHO is unmatched by any game in recent history. The fact that you can wee on yourself to put out a flesh fire is unprecedented (and dare I say, unlikely to be replicated) in gaming history and reason enough to experience this game. They simply don't make games like this anymore. If only someone has the guts to make and, most of all, publish something like this today!			"

												Go to the shop and buy some milk - How many people will you kill along the way? How many cats will you penetrate? Will you need that chainsaw? Where did you get that severed head? When did you become addicted to crack? These are just some of the questions you'll have to answer in Postal 2.If you've ever wanted to cut someones head off and then urinate on it, guess what? You're NOT alone! In Postal 2 you can meet like minded people, share tips on how best to humilate, abuse, mutilate and cause general suffering to.... Anyone!Personally, I enjoy urinating in someones face untill they start vomiting violently, then I give them a full charge from a tazer and watch them lose control of thier bladder while convulsing on the floor in a puddle of thier own vomit and urine. Then I take a lovely little break, smoke a crack pipe, eat a slice of 'za, maybe even have a doughnut and then it's back to work. I'll take the hedge trimmers I borrowed from a neighbor (after I cut his head off with a machete) and remove thier hands and feet one by one, if they survive that I'll take off thier arms and legs and sometimes, they even survive that, so I'll cut them in half.Once a cop survived! No arms, no legs and cut in half, as his guts slowly started to seep out and he was crying, I thought I better not miss an oppertunity, so I dropped my trousers and bust one out up the wall, when I was done, shame ejected, I covered him in petrol, throw a match on him, and left. I had made it to the shop and bought some milk, now I just needed to get home......But that's another story........Postal 2! It's ****ing bat**** crazy! You'd be crazy to not play it! You'd be crazy if you played it! You'd be crazy to listen to me! I'm off my med's! You'd be crazy too if your wife ran away with your grandma! (They didn't make it far though.....) haha, hahaha HAHAHAHhahAHhahHAHhAAAAAAAHHH WHEN DID MY LIFE GO SO WRONG?! WHAT HAPPENED?!? THE LAST THING I REMEMBER IS BUYING SOME GAME ON STEAM! STEAM!! STAY AWAY FROM STEAMMMMMMMM! NO I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK IN THE STRIAGHT JACKET! NO DRUGS! PLEASE, NO NEEDLES! NOOOOOOOO AHHHH NOOOOOOOOO!!!.......zzzzZZZZZZzzzz........zzzzzZZZZZzzzzzz......Postal 2!

												Are you tired of playing as that lone single survivor mowing down legions of moaning zombies with a sawed-off shotgun? Perhaps you're sick of being that dynamic hero who saves the town/planet/universe/whatever from thousands of enemy soldiers/aliens/demons/zombies/whatever? If you said yes to any of these, perhaps maybe you should give Postal 2 a try...quite possibly one of the wackiest and most offensive FPS games out there.The game takes place in a corrupt town called Paradise, where you play as the Postal Dude, a henpecked husband running errands (missions) all over the town for his nagging wife. The game plays on a day-to-day basis (monday through friday for the postal 2 mode, saturday and sunday for apocolapse weekend mode, and all 7 days for the AWP mode), and missions can range from just about everything from picking up your paycheck, getting people to sign your petition and picking up milk. Sounds like nothing could possibly go wrong, right? Well...you'll also encounter plenty of enemies, ranging from crazy cannibal butchers, rampaging rednecks, corrupt cops, the taliban and even violent video game protestors.The game itself is actually very non-linear in design, which is a treat. You can complete the errands you have to do at your own pace to have time to explore your envoirnments to find plenty of weapons and other collectables, or you can simply complete your missions as quickly as you can to beat the game as quickly as possible. Also you can make the game as violent as you want---you can go postal and kill everyone and everything with a variety of different weapons, including gasoline, rocket launchers, firearms, grenades, shovels, knives, and even your own urine...or you can try to be a pacifist and not kill anyone (though it's heavily encouraged at times).In short, this game certainly isn't for everyone: Postal 2 tries really hard to be as offensive as possible, and there's plenty of ridiculously over-the-top violence. However, if you're looking for a unique FPS to play, or simply have a dark sense of humor, Postal 2 is worth a buy...and the $10 price tag is hard to beat. 4.0/5.0			"

												I don't want to feel like I wasted precious minutes of my life writing a review for a game that I bought for only 69p because as you all know death is right around the corner for us all and you don't want to feel as though your life has been wasted. We'll all be old one day and ready to die. However I don't want to be old and feel as though I wasted my life writing a review. What is there after death? Do we go onto the next life? Are we given birth to again? Or are we doomed to an eternal darkness where we no longer exist and all the memories of loved ones no longer matter to you because you are living in said eternal darkness? Life is short and no matter what happens afterwards you will still always feel like your life has been wasted. This is mostly due to the fact that you spent your valuable time reading reviews on steam. Go outside and stop reading reviews on steam, go outside and fufill your dreams, stop reading other people's opinions on things. We'll all be dead soon...Also the game is pretty fun. 10/10 tbh			"

												Postal 2 is a legendary game that still manages to hold it's relevancy to this day, which is to say - quite amazing.The defining quality of this game, which made it stand out, is the freedom that it can offer to the player.  All the others FPS games we saw prior to this game did not have such ambitions as to make a game where you can do whatever you want and whenever you want. Even the main quest you can do in whatever order you prefer. But in the slight chance that you like kicking stuff and shooting at it(inluding shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your hand into the face of unsuspecting pedestrians), you might enjoy this game main quest aside.You are not alone in the game. Your buddies, the RWS staff will help you with any problems should they see you struggling, and should you not anger them. The game is very self-aware and offers much satire and social commentary. But all this things aside it is just an enjoyable game. That said, i meant just the regular game. Vanilla game has a conclusion. So i had no idea that players will recieve some kind of expansions down the line. First came Share the Pain. And all this expansion had to offer were online play and some new areas in the game. At the time i had no awareness as to what linux or mac were, so it was literally nothing to me. I did not mind this expansion very much, and online play did not appeal to me as i had the taste of CS, UT and Quake and they are objectively a better online expirience.But then came Apocalypse Weekend. And it was a ♥♥♥♥ing car crash. The game that i loved and that had a conclusion now recieved some half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cash-grabbing continuation. It was horrible. The freedom that was Postal 2 was gone from this expansion. It added on two new days of awful linear missons, that feel out of touch and unnecessary. You see, this game's reputation is not due to great shooting mechanics, but it's all we got left in this add-on. Additionally in this expansion they ditched the realistic atmosphere in favour of some supernatural elements, which in my opinion belittled the game even more, and contributed to overall 'out of this world' feel. This add-on had no need to exist. And cemented the game into the ocean of mediocrity. Along the line there were this thing called Postal 3. Now, I did not play this game, and being russian myself i feel shame that it exist, so this mention is all i can allow. The news of the development of the new postal 2 DLC, called ""Paradise Lost"" were surprising and promising. I can't remember any other cases of developers going back to their old product to produce new content(Romero gets a honourable mention, though).  Basically, it's a new Postal 2 game, set after the events of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Apocalypse Weekend, 12 years ago. This DLC is awesome and you definitely should buy it.  It has the gameplay and charm of the original Postal 2 except for few minor details, and it was a pleasure playing it. What i did not like in ""Paradise Lost"" is the fact that the god awful Apocalypse Weekend was acknowledged as canon. With this, they did bring the supernatural aesthetics to the dlc. I would enjoy the game far more if that wasn't the case.They plug the motion picture 'Postal' in the dlc and convey some kind of pride for it's existence. Look, there is nothing cool about having uwe boll make a movie about your game and it is the lowpoint of the franchise if you ask me. In the end of 'Paradise Lost' they tease us with postal 4(or as i would prefer, the real postal 3). Let us hope that RWS have learnt from their mistakes, and will deliver us good game one more time. I definitely recommend Postal 2 and the DLC even if the game is over 10 years old and the game engine struggles. They even give you a cool metal track for free! So have at it.			"

												This game is called Postal 2.It's selling point is that it's only as violent as you.That may well be the case,but past the faceyou will soon find out that's not quite true.You start on day one with a search for gunsand get your paycheck for your day to day funds.You pick up some milk, it could be smooth as silk so long as you don't just grab it and run.Then it's off to the bank and you deal with some stank when the PAYDAY crew come in loud and the cops be not proud.I'd tell you some more, but just buy it, you ♥♥♥♥♥.

Be it getting milk from a store or committing genocide on an unsuspecting town using shotguns and machineguns fitted with silencers made out of still living cats, Postal 2 will surely provide you with hours upon hours of entertainment.

												Ah postal, One of the most controversial games to be around. I was one of the poeple who originally played this game before it somehow landed in steam. And honestly i'm happy it came to steam more poeple can be exposed to this masterpeice of a game and know the true defenition of a ""controversial game"". Pros- Open world You can walk freely around the entire map, Well there are ""loading zones"" but honestly that shouldn't realy be a problemunless you are running this game on a toaster, Alot of hidden stuff you can find, from passage ways to weapon staches.This game is very exploration friendly, the game progresses in days and unlocks more areas for you to explore therefore gives a feeling of progression, can't realy say the same for the expantion pack levels, they are closed off and are only semi open world.-A large Arsenal at your disposalThis game offers a large arsenal for you to carry around to reak mayhem and havic, and the fun part is, YOU CAN CARRY ALL OF THEM AT ONCE, that's right non of that 3-2 slot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, you can carry an entire arsenal on you, this might not be a huge thing but for me it's fantastic. reminds me of classic games where you could carry all the guns in the game and not have to throw anything away just to pick up another weapon.-ModsBefore this game had hit steam it has a huge amount of mods for it, weapons, maps, and entire game mods like Eternal Damnnation for example, but with the game hitting steam alot of mods that use to work with the game are now broken due to the game being updated and a bit modernized.but nothing to worry about the mod community is large and growing and with the workshop added to postal 2,Alot of mods are at your disposal, it's only a click away.-The Dark HumorThis game had me laughting my♥♥♥♥♥off for hours, i can't remember a moment this game felt dull, from the sterotyped Indian store clirc to the Corrupt police force this game is packed with pop culture refrences and dark humor, hell it even features Gary Coleman for ♥♥♥♥ sake (R.i.P Gary Coleman), definetly somthing to see for yourself--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons-EngineFor it's time postal was pretty average but for todays standarts the old unreal engineis not realy fancy and a bit outdated but non the less it had some good touch up work to make itfeel a bit more modern but the core engine is not realy anything new and ground breakingHonestly there is not realy any other cons i could think of this game is just a masterpeice and definetly somthing to cheak out  if you did not play it back in the era it came out in.

												Go to the shop and buy some milk - How many people will you kill along the way? How many cats will you penetrate? Will you need that chainsaw? Where did you get that severed head? When did you become addicted to crack? These are just some of the questions you'll have to answer in Postal 2.If you've ever wanted to cut someones head off and then urinate on it, guess what? You're NOT alone! In Postal 2 you can meet like minded people, share tips on how best to humilate, abuse, mutilate and cause general suffering to.... Anyone!Personally, I enjoy urinating in someones face untill they start vomiting violently, then I give them a full charge from a tazer and watch them lose control of thier bladder while convulsing on the floor in a puddle of thier own vomit and urine. Then I take a lovely little break, smoke a crack pipe, eat a slice of 'za, maybe even have a doughnut and then it's back to work. I'll take the hedge trimmers I borrowed from a neighbor (after I cut his head off with a machete) and remove thier hands and feet one by one, if they survive that I'll take off thier arms and legs and sometimes, they even survive that, so I'll cut them in half.Once a cop survived! No arms, no legs and cut in half, as his guts slowly started to seep out and he was crying, I thought I better not miss an oppertunity, so I dropped my trousers and bust one out up the wall, when I was done, shame ejected, I covered him in petrol, throw a match on him, and left. I had made it to the shop and bought some milk, now I just needed to get home......But that's another story........Postal 2! It's ****ing bat**** crazy! You'd be crazy to not play it! You'd be crazy if you played it! You'd be crazy to listen to me! I'm off my med's! You'd be crazy too if your wife ran away with your grandma!

You can do thousands of things like. Asking people to sign your petition then if they decline, peeing in their mouth. Or fighting a quiki-mart manager for calling you a ""infedel"". Then finding out he has 21 virgin terrorist babes with guns upstairs. And even burning a whole marching band, watching them burn alive, then stand there as they all try to crawl away charred and mangled. This game is hours of stupid fun. And it has a workshop page where people upload thier own levels for you to pee on even more people.			"

												This game is...unique in many ways. A little backstory is that when I was little, around 2000-2005, there was an outcry that videogames were too violent. This game pretty much was made to show just how violent things can get in games. Obviously, it's fun because of this. I assume this game received tons of controversy because of it's violent nature. These are the kinds of games that parents and politicians would be disgusted over, but frankly, us gamers don't care at all, because we see it as entertainment, not senseless violence.Now for a review about the game: In the least, this game had it's difficult times, and action-packed times. This game goes day-by-day throughout a week in the life of ""Postal Dude"" in Paradise, Arizona. Along the way of running errands, and doing things for his Wife, you'll come around to things you'd outta check out. Some including secrets and items, others include brutally murdering a bunch of annoying protesters. Really in the least, violence never felt so good, especially when it's for a good cause, for you of course. There really isn't much to say about this game, other than I bet GTA fans would love this, smaller, less civilized version. One last note, is that I think anyone could enjoy this game, if you like challenges and working towards a goal so that your Wife will not nag you about it. Anyway, it's a good game, and I think you'd like it too.I nominated this game for the ""Best Use of a Farm Animal"" award in 2016's Steam Awards.			"

												Postal 2 is violent, irreverent, offensive, and immature. It's also one of the most bizarre and fun shooters I've played in years. I mean, what other game allows you to hurl diseased cow heads at terrorists, watch them vomit everywhere, then kick their dead bodies into other people to infect them as well? Not too many, I'd hope.Postal 2's plot is simple - you're the Postal Dude, and you have 3-4 chores you need to take care of each day. Things as simple as returning a library book and collecting your paycheck become insane challenges when certain crazed citizens of Paradise get involved by shooting up your workplace or burning down the library with you inside. The further into your week you go, the more difficult these tasks become. But, they're never too frustrating, as you never really can hit a point where it's impossible to complete a task. Just duck, weave, and snipe out enemies, and you'll be in the clear usually.The weapons of this game are just as crazy as its scenarios. In addition to the usual shotguns, assault rifles, and pistols, you get weapons like throwable scissors, scythes, sledgehammers, deodorant flamethrowers, and WMD's. They all shine in their own unique ways, and contribute to the surreal atmosphere of the game.While the Apocalypse Weekend expansion might be less enjoyable than the base game, the overall package is worth a play if you enjoyed the first five days of gameplay. I would highly recommend Postal 2 to shooter fans and avid gamers alike. It's just too oddball to pass up.			"

												What I love about this game is that it features some of my most favourite pass times. For example I love to shove things up cat ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I love burning dogs, I absolutely adore urinating in my own mouth and even more so urinating into innocent men and womens mouths. Oh and when they puke, God that just makes my knees weak. I also recently discovered I have an affinity to murdering women, only women though because my mother didn't show me enough love as a child. So to be able to do this in quite gruesome ways like drenching them with gasoline and throwing a lit match at them, cutting off their limbs without killing them and then setting them on fire or just good old smashing their faces in with a baseball bat... and then setting them on fire; all without consequence is just fantastic. Finally, a video game I can masturbate too.			"

												Old game that focuses on dark comedy.The price is reasonable,the amount of mods is amazing,and the idea of the plot and gameplay is truly innovative.Of course,it is an old game so don't expect good graphics and animations.The story will get kind of monotone and boring because you have to travel very,very far away to finish your daily tasks.And what will happen is always the same,only it was put in a different story.All you do is go to the designated task location,do the quest,being attacked by certain organization,kill all of them,run away,go home.This game is much better than the sequel,Postal 3,though.Overall,I'll give this game a 'meh'.It's just like Goat simulator and I Am Bread.You get some fun after several hours,and then suddenly you'll have enough of it and get bored and never play it again.

As corny and cheesy as it gets, still a good time just siccing your dog at people and/or blowing up the car next to them to kill 'em.

												Postal 2 is entirely ridiculous and offensive and goes out of its way to be both.But it's also rather fun and amusing, the same way the early episodes of South Park were.Added to that, it's aged surprisingly well, supports modern resolutions and looks better than many games from its era, its certainly a bit of a curiosity.

												Postal 2 is essentially a VERY watered-down GTA-esque game with the same juvenile humor and open-world style where you're allowed to either cause chaos in killing sprees or pursue a number of missions. Postal 2's missions are simply the protagonist (""Postal Dude"") completing a number of menial and trivial tasks (picking up groceries, going to the Bank, etc.) while occasionally being pitted against various enemies (like protesters who believe video-games cause violence - only to whip out automatic rifles and begin indiscriminately murdering people, a group of Jihad leading an assault on a church, etc.) In regards to gameplay, unlike in GTA, you're placed in a relatively rural environment, and there's an odd complete absence of vehicles, except for those in parking - not even NPCs drive any vehicles. Most weapons are found through stealing or finding them, though there some of them are purchasable via the mall.In summary, if you happen to find this game for a good price (like I did, at $2), it's well worth the purchase for several hours of mindless indulgence.

												Nice satirical game with an interesting story and enjoyable gameplay. Getting all of the achievements requires a decent amount of skill, time, and purchase of the dlc. Because the dlc achievements are connected with the original game, and it is a lot of extra story/content I would strongly recommed getting them together.			"

												Postal 2 is an open world first person shooter. Calling it a first person shooter is at least the most fitting term for the game since although it features a lot of melee weapons and can even be finished without shooting at all - at least on lower difficulty settings. It is very different from the first Postal game which was a rather dark top down shooter that was broken  up into various levels where the sole objective was to take out all opponents.Postal 2 takes place in a small town called ""Paradise"". You play as Postal Dude (that is his actual name, I swear) who lives in a trailer with his wife and his dog. He is rather unsatisfied with his current life. He is completely broke, he is the only person in the neighborhood who lives in a trailer, his wife constantly yells at him, his car barely works anymore. He just started at a new job in games development (guess which company) though. Will that help him to get his life back in order?The gameplay of Postal 2 is split up into five days, starting on Monday. Every day Postal Dude gets a number of tasks that must be completed to proceed to the next day. Many tasks are given by his wife but some are his own decision. A majority of the task are rather mundane, for example cashing in your paycheck, buying milk, getting a christmas tree or buying meat for a barbeque or going to your uncle Dave's birthday party. While none of this sound like a pretty exciting  activity the town of Paradise is full of people who would go ballistic over the most trivial things. So even the most mundane task may end up with Postal Dude either running for his life or being forced to kill everybody in the vicinity. At the beginning of the game you just have to be aware of random people starting fights but every day after completing certain quests Postal Dude gets an additional group of enemies who hate his guts so much that they would attack him on sight without thinking twice. Luckily the law enforcement is just as violent as the other citizens and might be a great ally in cases like that. If you start funny business yourself however they will not hesitate shooting you either. You can tackle all tasks at your own pace and explore the town. Exploration is really rewarding since you might find weapons and items that would not be available yet otherwise and might give you a real edge over your enemies. Also, there are small eastereggs jokes and references hidden all over the place.While the first Postal game featured rather dark themes Postal 2 is full of silly over the top humour. Also it might be the most offensive game ever created. The game depicts various groups of society as exaggerated stereotypical caricatures: Censorship advocates, Christians, Muslims, gays, bankers, animal rights activists, policemen, New Age religions - nobody leaves unscathed. (I will tell you a little secret: You can lure policemen by dropping a donut on the ground.) If I needed to compare the humour of Postal 2 to anything I would probably say South Park.On his quest to survive the week Postal Dude can rely on a huge arsenal of tools and weapons. Melee weapons like tasers, shovels, scythe, machetes or sledgehammers as well as ranged weapons like scissors, pistols, shotguns, napalm launchers, rocket launchers, grenades, infectious cow heads (which spread an unpleasant disease) and molotov cocktails. On top of that you can just kick people. There's another ""weapon"" in Postal Dude's arsenal that should not be left unmentioned: Pee. He can open his pants and just let go. It does not deal any damage but it can stun people briefly if you hit them right in the face. Also, it causes people to either scream at you, flee, attack you or just puke. While this sounds like nothing than an easteregg peeing can be vital to your survival. Fire based weapons are extremely dangerous and when you ever find yourself being on fire you better pee straight up in the air so you can extinguish the flames. It can also be used to clear flames blocking your path or to extinguish burning people other than yourself.As mentioned before there are various tools and items to utilize. Dog biscuits can be used to befriend dogs and make them follow you around. Catnip can NOT be used to befriend cats. Instead you can consume it yourself to slow down the world around you. Cats however can be picked up and either be used as erratic tornadoes of fur and claws (keep your distance) or as silencers to put on your shotgun or assault rifle. A fishing radar comes in handy to show you the position of nearby enemies. Also there are various items that restore health like donuts, pizza or ""Health Pipes"" - be warned though, they are addictive.There is one gripe I have with the game. Some weapons feel really underwhelming. There is basically no point to some of the melee weapons (for example the shovel) as soon as you found a higher tier one. Also the standard shotgun and assault rifle feel to weak.The town of Paradise feels incredibly alive. Bystanders will walk around the place, talk to each other and either go their merry way or start a fight. If they see corpses they will run away or start vomiting. If they see you in an embarassing situation they will laugh at you. Also, it is entirely possible that huge fights break out without the player having done anything to cause them. Considering when the game came out this is impressively done and really conveys what kind of town we are talking about here. The title Postal does not need to refer solely to the main character but can also be seen as representative of Paradise and its citizens. Postal Dude would have all reason to give up and despair but he rather reacts with snarky sarcasm which makes him kind of likeable. I he goes postal eventually depends on the player but believe me, this town will put your patience to a test.This re-released version of Postal 2 comes with the add-on Apocalypse Weekend that covers Saturday and Sunday. The playstyle is a little different though. Apokalypse Weekend still has the humour of the base game as well as some really neat new ideas and mechanics. Sadly it drops the open world exploration aspect completely and often comes down to tunnel shooter levels and arena fights. It is also a problem that the two most ""standard shooter like"" levels are among the longest of the expansion. Do not get me wrong though. It is well worth playing, I just feel that it cannot hold a candle to the base game.For the re-release of Postal 2 the developers added several weapons, mechanics and cosmetic tweaks. Some of those had been featured before in community made mods. The developers really went and asked the modders if they were okay with the mods being included in the main game. That's what I call being in touch with the fans.Also, after the re-release being financially quite successful the developers decided that they could afford to work on a second expansion pack for Postal 2 which is by now released and available as DLC. As far as I know releasing an official expansion ten years after the base game came out is completely unheard of. If this doesn't proof incredible dedication to the fanbase I do not what does.What's more, the expansion called Paradise Lost is much closer to the base game than Apocalypse Weekend was. It also features additional content and improvements some of which have been retroactively added to the base game.Long story short if you have not played Postal 2 yet you should give this classic a try. If the humour is not for you or you are easily offended you might not like it. Otherwise it is well worth your time. If you have played Postal 2 before and liked it you should also pick this version up since it is a step up from the original version in every area.More reviews here "

												This is a great game to rampage on. Many ""creative"" ways to slaugter people puts a smile on my face. As a natural Misanthrope there isn't much I can touch base on with my review. I can say though if you are looking for a in-depth,FPS,action oriented game.. you are playing the WRONG game. Postal 2 is all about the LULZ and it does the job well from♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the face of females to kicking their head after they've vomit. Postal 2 is amazingly fun to extract the seething hatred for humanity. I loved this game since release and don't see that love dying anytime soon. as postal dude would say ""You probably didn't think you were gonna die today.....SURPISE!""			"

												Note: l'm not good at reviews so I'll say what l think about itOne of the BEST games everNow l may be saying lots of times ""Best game"" over and over but they are.The amount of things you can do can't be said  because they are too many but  l can say you complete it Pacifist way or commit mass murder  on your way to errands.It's so good, gameplay, repeating the game with different routes and ways to complete errands,voice acting is world class for me, l salute the voice actor of the Dude, graphics? Who cares. The gameplay matters but if you really want my opinion even when l don't care about graphics they are great.Weapons variety is also pretty good and just about everything about this game and even the developers are greatOnly thing l don't understand is the sneak action, it's useless and it just makes you extra slow.People won't reaction to your footsteps even  if you run and jumpTHANK YOU for making this awesome game and l salute youAnd NEVER trust critics scores.Trust only the people11/10Jesus rank/10			"

												In Postal 2, you are tasked with doing errands from your hateful wife. Simple tasks like getting milk, voting and getting Gary Coleman's autograph. What could go wrong? Well a lot of things can go wrong. Without spoiling everything, lets just say a simple trip to the store can turn into a shootout between you and Hijab wearing women.The tagline to Postal 2 is: ""It's only as violent as you are"". Which is true. Will you lose patience at a line to the bank and end up killing everyone? Or will you wait in line like a civilised person? The choice is yours! Postal 2 is also quite hilarious. You'll ecounter gimps, rednecks, Al-Qaeda and marching bands.I would 100% recommend this game, for those who enjoy violence and dark humor.			"

												A cult classic with one of the best independent developers supporting it more than 10 years later. It's an open-world FPS that has actually aged well. The Postal Dude is one of the most underrated FPS protagonists ever made. Transitions after walking through one part of Paradise are the only thing that holds this game back for me, but this fault is overridden by the fact that I can urinate on everything. Even though the shock value has evaporated from this title, the fun factor from being able to kill everything that moves is what's left, which is a great thing. Get this♥♥♥♥♥♥as soon as you can.			"

												In the beginning I was very skeptical if the game was worthy the money, so I bought it in order to try it out and see. After a few hours of gameplay I loved it! It was not what I expected. It is a great open-world/FPS game full of violence with a funny main character. Last but not least, the way you are playing will give you a peaceful or a full of dangers adventure, so be prepared!			"

												Postal 2 is an enjoyable game in which you can carry out the tasks of a week from either Monday to Friday, Monday to Sunday or just the apocalyptic weekend, depending on what mode you play. Despite dated graphics, Postal 2 is definitely a loveable game that allows the player to be as violent as they please. You can even try being completely passive, I'd imagine it's difficult, but they say it's doable. Running With Scissors took a simple idea of doing tasks for your wife and made a game out of it, and did it very well. It is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish, but I confess I've yet to get my lazy♥♥♥♥♥to play everything again. Regardless, the game is immensly enjoyable for those who like the humor in it and the ever lovable voice of Rick Hunter, as the beloved Postal Dude, really nails his lines in a perfect manner.Even more fun is that you can see the game devs themselves on the first day, and you can pass through their offices on your travels. And as an added bonus, they often aid you in combat. So with a large array of weapons (including the ability to♥♥♥♥♥♥everywhere), you'll find many creative ways to kill enemies, cops or innocent bystanders as you try to make it to the end of each day.I'd recommend buying this game at any price, either full retail or on sale, as it is good fun and the developers deserve whatever you could give. But if you are somewhat easily offended, don't like the violence, don't like dated grahics or you are a plain old buzzkill, don't bother getting it. It wouldn't be for you.Note: a link to my PL review since it doesn't seem to show up properly at the time of posting: http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_boggy_fella/recommended/360960/ "

Overall its not a very high quality game but then again, its not meant to be. I'd defininetly reccomend it to anyone wanting to get a game purely for its fun factor. If you're looking for anything more you aren't going to find it here, I can tell you that. The game itself is really violent and not for the feint of heart, or easily offended.... So go ahead play it if you want a game to just sit back relax and enjoy like gaming was meant for.Quinn ♥~~			"

												Postal 2 is an open world first person shooter. Calling it a first person shooter is at least the most fitting term for the game since although it features a lot of melee weapons and can even be finished without shooting at all - at least on lower difficulty settings. It is very different from the first Postal game which was a rather dark top down shooter that was broken  up into various levels where the sole objective was to take out all opponents.Postal 2 takes place in a small town called ""Paradise"". You play as Postal Dude (that is his actual name, I swear) who lives in a trailer with his wife and his dog. He is rather unsatisfied with his current life. He is completely broke, he is the only person in the neighborhood who lives in a trailer, his wife constantly yells at him, his car barely works anymore. He just started at a new job in games development (guess which company) though. Will that help him to get his life back in order?The gameplay of Postal 2 is split up into five days, starting on Monday. Every day Postal Dude gets a number of tasks that must be completed to proceed to the next day. Many tasks are given by his wife but some are his own decision. A majority of the task are rather mundane, for example cashing in your paycheck, buying milk, getting a christmas tree or buying meat for a barbeque or going to your uncle Dave's birthday party. While none of this sound like a pretty exciting  activity the town of Paradise is full of people who would go ballistic over the most trivial things. So even the most mundane task may end up with Postal Dude either running for his life or being forced to kill everybody in the vicinity. At the beginning of the game you just have to be aware of random people starting fights but every day after completing certain quests Postal Dude gets an additional group of enemies who hate his guts so much that they would attack him on sight without thinking twice. Luckily the law enforcement is just as violent as the other citizens and might be a great ally in cases like that. If you start funny business yourself however they will not hesitate shooting you either. You can tackle all tasks at your own pace and explore the town. Exploration is really rewarding since you might find weapons and items that would not be available yet otherwise and might give you a real edge over your enemies. Also, there are small eastereggs jokes and references hidden all over the place.While the first Postal game featured rather dark themes Postal 2 is full of silly over the top humour. Also it might be the most offensive game ever created. The game depicts various groups of society as exaggerated stereotypical caricatures: Censorship advocates, Christians, Muslims, gays, bankers, animal rights activists, policemen, New Age religions - nobody leaves unscathed. (I will tell you a little secret: You can lure policemen by dropping a donut on the ground.) If I needed to compare the humour of Postal 2 to anything I would probably say South Park.On his quest to survive the week Postal Dude can rely on a huge arsenal of tools and weapons. Melee weapons like tasers, shovels, scythe, machetes or sledgehammers as well as ranged weapons like scissors, pistols, shotguns, napalm launchers, rocket launchers, grenades, infectious cow heads (which spread an unpleasant disease) and molotov cocktails. On top of that you can just kick people. There's another ""weapon"" in Postal Dude's arsenal that should not be left unmentioned: Pee. He can open his pants and just let go. It does not deal any damage but it can stun people briefly if you hit them right in the face. Also, it causes people to either scream at you, flee, attack you or just puke. While this sounds like nothing than an easteregg peeing can be vital to your survival. Fire based weapons are extremely dangerous and when you ever find yourself being on fire you better pee straight up in the air so you can extinguish the flames. It can also be used to clear flames blocking your path or to extinguish burning people other than yourself.As mentioned before there are various tools and items to utilize. Dog biscuits can be used to befriend dogs and make them follow you around. Catnip can NOT be used to befriend cats. Instead you can consume it yourself to slow down the world around you. Cats however can be picked up and either be used as erratic tornadoes of fur and claws (keep your distance) or as silencers to put on your shotgun or assault rifle. A fishing radar comes in handy to show you the position of nearby enemies. Also there are various items that restore health like donuts, pizza or ""Health Pipes"" - be warned though, they are addictive.There is one gripe I have with the game. Some weapons feel really underwhelming. There is basically no point to some of the melee weapons (for example the shovel) as soon as you found a higher tier one. Also the standard shotgun and assault rifle feel to weak.The town of Paradise feels incredibly alive. Bystanders will walk around the place, talk to each other and either go their merry way or start a fight. If they see corpses they will run away or start vomiting. If they see you in an embarassing situation they will laugh at you. Also, it is entirely possible that huge fights break out without the player having done anything to cause them. Considering when the game came out this is impressively done and really conveys what kind of town we are talking about here. The title Postal does not need to refer solely to the main character but can also be seen as representative of Paradise and its citizens. Postal Dude would have all reason to give up and despair but he rather reacts with snarky sarcasm which makes him kind of likeable. I he goes postal eventually depends on the player but believe me, this town will put your patience to a test.This re-released version of Postal 2 comes with the add-on Apocalypse Weekend that covers Saturday and Sunday. The playstyle is a little different though. Apokalypse Weekend still has the humour of the base game as well as some really neat new ideas and mechanics. Sadly it drops the open world exploration aspect completely and often comes down to tunnel shooter levels and arena fights. It is also a problem that the two most ""standard shooter like"" levels are among the longest of the expansion. Do not get me wrong though. It is well worth playing, I just feel that it cannot hold a candle to the base game.For the re-release of Postal 2 the developers added several weapons, mechanics and cosmetic tweaks. Some of those had been featured before in community made mods. The developers really went and asked the modders if they were okay with the mods being included in the main game. That's what I call being in touch with the fans.Also, after the re-release being financially quite successful the developers decided that they could afford to work on a second expansion pack for Postal 2 which is by now released and available as DLC. As far as I know releasing an official expansion ten years after the base game came out is completely unheard of. If this doesn't proof incredible dedication to the fanbase I do not what does.What's more, the expansion called Paradise Lost is much closer to the base game than Apocalypse Weekend was. It also features additional content and improvements some of which have been retroactively added to the base game.Long story short if you have not played Postal 2 yet you should give this classic a try. If the humour is not for you or you are easily offended you might not like it. Otherwise it is well worth your time. If you have played Postal 2 before and liked it you should also pick this version up since it is a step up from the original version in every area.More reviews here "

												Postal 2 is essentially a VERY watered-down GTA-esque game with the same juvenile humor and open-world style where you're allowed to either cause chaos in killing sprees or pursue a number of missions. Postal 2's missions are simply the protagonist (""Postal Dude"") completing a number of menial and trivial tasks (picking up groceries, going to the Bank, etc.) while occasionally being pitted against various enemies (like protesters who believe video-games cause violence - only to whip out automatic rifles and begin indiscriminately murdering people, a group of Jihad leading an assault on a church, etc.) In regards to gameplay, unlike in GTA, you're placed in a relatively rural environment, and there's an odd complete absence of vehicles, except for those in parking - not even NPCs drive any vehicles. Most weapons are found through stealing or finding them, though there some of them are purchasable via the mall.In summary, if you happen to find this game for a good price (like I did, at $2), it's well worth the purchase for several hours of mindless indulgence.

												Postal 2 is a legendary game that still manages to hold it's relevancy to this day, which is to say - quite amazing.The defining quality of this game, which made it stand out, is the freedom that it can offer to the player.  All the others FPS games we saw prior to this game did not have such ambitions as to make a game where you can do whatever you want and whenever you want. Even the main quest you can do in whatever order you prefer. But in the slight chance that you like kicking stuff and shooting at it(inluding shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your hand into the face of unsuspecting pedestrians), you might enjoy this game main quest aside.You are not alone in the game. Your buddies, the RWS staff will help you with any problems should they see you struggling, and should you not anger them. The game is very self-aware and offers much satire and social commentary. But all this things aside it is just an enjoyable game. That said, i meant just the regular game. Vanilla game has a conclusion. So i had no idea that players will recieve some kind of expansions down the line. First came Share the Pain. And all this expansion had to offer were online play and some new areas in the game. At the time i had no awareness as to what linux or mac were, so it was literally nothing to me. I did not mind this expansion very much, and online play did not appeal to me as i had the taste of CS, UT and Quake and they are objectively a better online expirience.But then came Apocalypse Weekend. And it was a ♥♥♥♥ing car crash. The game that i loved and that had a conclusion now recieved some half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cash-grabbing continuation. It was horrible. The freedom that was Postal 2 was gone from this expansion. It added on two new days of awful linear missons, that feel out of touch and unnecessary. You see, this game's reputation is not due to great shooting mechanics, but it's all we got left in this add-on. Additionally in this expansion they ditched the realistic atmosphere in favour of some supernatural elements, which in my opinion belittled the game even more, and contributed to overall 'out of this world' feel. This add-on had no need to exist. And cemented the game into the ocean of mediocrity. Along the line there were this thing called Postal 3. Now, I did not play this game, and being russian myself i feel shame that it exist, so this mention is all i can allow. The news of the development of the new postal 2 DLC, called ""Paradise Lost"" were surprising and promising. I can't remember any other cases of developers going back to their old product to produce new content(Romero gets a honourable mention, though).  Basically, it's a new Postal 2 game, set after the events of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Apocalypse Weekend, 12 years ago. This DLC is awesome and you definitely should buy it.  It has the gameplay and charm of the original Postal 2 except for few minor details, and it was a pleasure playing it. What i did not like in ""Paradise Lost"" is the fact that the god awful Apocalypse Weekend was acknowledged as canon. With this, they did bring the supernatural aesthetics to the dlc. I would enjoy the game far more if that wasn't the case.They plug the motion picture 'Postal' in the dlc and convey some kind of pride for it's existence. Look, there is nothing cool about having uwe boll make a movie about your game and it is the lowpoint of the franchise if you ask me. In the end of 'Paradise Lost' they tease us with postal 4(or as i would prefer, the real postal 3). Let us hope that RWS have learnt from their mistakes, and will deliver us good game one more time. I definitely recommend Postal 2 and the DLC even if the game is over 10 years old and the game engine struggles. They even give you a cool metal track for free! So have at it.			"

												This is a great game to rampage on. Many ""creative"" ways to slaugter people puts a smile on my face. As a natural Misanthrope there isn't much I can touch base on with my review. I can say though if you are looking for a in-depth,FPS,action oriented game.. you are playing the WRONG game. Postal 2 is all about the LULZ and it does the job well from♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the face of females to kicking their head after they've vomit. Postal 2 is amazingly fun to extract the seething hatred for humanity. I loved this game since release and don't see that love dying anytime soon. as postal dude would say ""You probably didn't think you were gonna die today.....SURPISE!""			"

												Note: l'm not good at reviews so I'll say what l think about itOne of the BEST games everNow l may be saying lots of times ""Best game"" over and over but they are.The amount of things you can do can't be said  because they are too many but  l can say you complete it Pacifist way or commit mass murder  on your way to errands.It's so good, gameplay, repeating the game with different routes and ways to complete errands,voice acting is world class for me, l salute the voice actor of the Dude, graphics? Who cares. The gameplay matters but if you really want my opinion even when l don't care about graphics they are great.Weapons variety is also pretty good and just about everything about this game and even the developers are greatOnly thing l don't understand is the sneak action, it's useless and it just makes you extra slow.People won't reaction to your footsteps even  if you run and jumpTHANK YOU for making this awesome game and l salute youAnd NEVER trust critics scores.Trust only the people11/10Jesus rank/10			"

												Great game, I enjoyed it quite a bit. DEFINITELY not for everyone. It's very vulgar, but that's part of the charm/fun of it. Online is very dead, and I wish it wasn't that way. Singleplayer is where you are most likely going to get your entertainment from anyways. There are some glitches, but not too bad  for example, on the last boss of Apocalypse Weekend, he got stuck, so it was very easy to kill him  I don't have anything to say for Paradise Lost since I haven't played it yet. Overall, I still enjoyed the game and I plan on trying to get all of the achievements since I just finished the entire week.			"

												Ok, I have to admit that this is one of the best video games I have ever played in my entire life. People who never played GTA before (like me) would totally get a kick out of this game.Despite its many difficulty options, POSTAL 2 is a very easy game in my opinion. Only some bystanders have weapons, and the police officers just try to arrest you for no reason! But hey, you play as the Postal Dude, an ordinary guy who just wants to finish his errands and go home, But in the eyes of Paradise's citizens,  they see the Dude as a no good smartass Hitler type tyrant. Well, thats kind of true, if you played the original POSTAL game from 1997 and witnessed how he noticed HE was a bleedin' killer himself, andhe didn't care!What I really like about this game is that it's very GTA like and realistic. You can explore the open world of Paradise, and if you have any maps installed, you can explore those too. You can get suited up with guns and♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrorizing the citizens and fighting the cops and trying to gey the hilarious toy character Krotchy down. And once you finish the game (the original game, not counting Apocalypse Weekend), you unlock cheats, and you can turn bystanders into Gary Colemans or Osamas, or load yoursef up with guns and an unlimited supply of ammo, and even get bonus health stuff whenever you want!And I wanna say the funniest thing about POSTAL 2 is that you can♥♥♥♥♥♥on people, and during the petition mission I asked a bystander to sign it and they said no nd I coaxed them three times, still said np and tats when as punishment, I made their day.

												Are you too poor for Grand Theft Auto? Do you want a game that the developers still care deeply for even though its been out for a decade? This is the game thats for you. POSTAL 2 is like a christmas present, as you'll never know whats in it. POSTAL 2 has spit in the face of radical muslims, scared parents, tree huggers, its own developers, christians, rednecks, and Gary Colemon, without a care in the world and it manages to hold a great amount respect from fans. If these reasons aren't enough to buy it, here are some more reasons.The gameplay is like a FP GTA, except everyone either walks past you, or charges at you with a sign. However, you can stop them with weapons ranging to a nuke launcher to your own♥♥♥♥♥♥ The sound is still a charm, even though there is barely any music its fun to listen to the protagionists remarks. The graphics are from 2003, so you can't really judge it. Replayability for this game is gigantic, as almost everything in game can be done differently.The most important thing about it is that the developers still care about. If a decade old game still gets updates, I think it is worth your money to buy this game.9/10			"

Well, this is my first postal game then later I'd played the original postal.  One thing I love about Postal 2, is ridiculous absurd funny and yes, its controversial at the time. But this game made my day. Well, I'd got this complete version at steam and waiting for next ""a long waiting"" DLC from this game called Paradise Lost.If you want a funny absurd FPS and not offended from all of the content from this game, this is a real gem from 2003 that got bashed from the critics.

												This is one of my favorite games, which is saying a great deal since I've only just now sat down and played it within the last few weeks. If you can get past the rather dated visuals (It was an indie game in 2003, cut it some slack) and the occasionally teeth-grinding unfair difficulty at times, it's an absolutely great game, especially if you believe in catharsis. It is pretty damn funny, and feels like a good old PC shooter, which it is! The Dude's lines are funny, although repeated a bit too much, maybe, and  vulgar enough to♥♥♥♥♥♥off all your family members. In short, buy this thing, and let out some pent up rage, where else can you play golf with human heads, or♥♥♥♥♥♥on a police officer?			"

												This game is awesome. It's quite controversial, of course, but it was made to be that way. Plus, it's only controversial if you do bad things in the game and (though resisting the urge is quite difficult) you can go through the game without harming a single living thing. (It's not very fun when you do it that way though. x3) I would definetly reccomend this game to people who don't mind a bit (a metric crapton) or violence and some little (massive) innapropriate jokes.

												I got this game on sale for two bucks, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥was it worth it. If you get past the dated graphics there are some really fun moments to be had. Its humor is that of south park, over the top and as disgustingly gory and nasty as possible. For example, I cut off the arms and legs of a cop, as she tried to crawl away I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on her and set her on fire. With the Postal Dude's hilarious commentary and the ridiculous weaponry, you will be laughing your head off as you decapitate, gib, and burn your way through PETA the Taliban and a variety of other hate groups.

												Ugly textures.Ugly animations.Ugly gameplay.Small map.Fu**** up sh**.But still a good game anyway, nothing great, let's be honest, this is far away to be even a decent game but it is still kind of fun to play and to fu** **** up If the gameplay was better, of course, it would be better, the textures and the graphics could use some adjustments, graphics aren't important, but oh God they're ugly and most of them are glitched and so are the animations.For example, you look into the mirror, you'll see that it is handling his weapon or item differently than it is in first person.Some textures are just passing through (meshes and textures problems).But anyway, it is still fun when you have nothing better to do with your time.6/10  The first one is still far better in my opinion.But hey, it's a game that everyone should try at least once, because, it's an experience, it's just that kind of special.

												This is a great game, there is so much to complete in it that you always wanto to finish one more thing on the list. This game is great for releasing any hatred or anger with violent deaths + lots of blood and gore, i highly recommend gettting this game if you feel like just randomly slaughtering a bunch of elephants or killing hundreds of people!!!

												It's really a strange game... it certainly isn't a bad game, in fact, I highly reccomend it, it's just a weird approach to a first-person shooter.  It potrays a modern society being corrupt and you play as a social justice warrior... who also seems to be subject to the corruption.  It's kind of twisted, it brings a new concept that I think other games should model off of, and it adds a needed comedic element which really seals this game's good rating.  I'd say 9/10.  Very unusual.			"

												OLD but GOLD! In this game, u could realize all ur grotesque tastes and sinister plans while other games may not. You could burn and torture all the harmless Critters and get away with it. This game is Critters torturing club that includes limbs trimming, decapitating, incinerating. 11/10 would “trim” an innocent bystander’s limb and watch him bleeding to death. If u feel dat is not enough, u can pour gasoline on him and then scratch a match…. If u feel a little bit regret, u can unzip ur pants and pee on him to put out the fire. U could even have a wonderful barbecue party, if u r among group of people. Just don’t get ur ""a*rse"" burnt, lighting ppl up at ur own risk. :)P*iss simulator, the game would count how many gallons u peed. 11/10 would p*iss on a phat cop’s face and then kick him right in da balls. While peeing, u could choke ur victim in da face and let him vomit. U could have a wonderful puke party, if u r among group of ppl.  U could even choke urself with ur own pees or put out fire when you r burning. Try it urself. :)-“May peace (p*iss) on u, peace (p*ss) on me, peace (p*iss) on everybody. Amen!”-Jesus ChristSkull demolition simulator. In this game:  u r playing as head demolition engineer. U could use baseball bat to smash ppl’s head explode; u could use sledgehammer to pulverize ppl’s head explode; u could also use Sturdy double barrel shot gun to shoot ppls’ head explode, plus Gore Splattering dismemberment, which is awesome.Suggestions: Pls increase the stability of the game and fix some bugs that could lead the game to crash. This is very cereal, because when I was fighting the devilish milk cow man the game suddenly crash, which makes me sad. :(Add high quality and high definition girls’ panstus pls :)Add vehicles that could let players drive and grind critters up :)Pls add El penetrator that I could thrust ppls’ backside In and out :0 11/10 would play the DLC: Paradise Lost!

												This is a weird game to make a review about. The game itself is kind of an oddity and if you can describe it as something, it sure as f#ck it would be ""complete offensive clusterf#ck"". That being said, it's satiric style does make it remarcably fun to play with from time to time, something I wasn't expecting at all. I met this game for the first time with a free demo a f#ckload of years ago and all I remember about it is shooting islamic people with a shotgun that had a cat as a silencer (by literally sticking the poor cat's #sshole on the gun's barrel) and then♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on their corpses. It's that kind of game. As usual I will first talk about it's negative parts, then move up from there.First and foremost, it's biggest problem is the engine and it's gameplay. Saying that it hasn't aged well is putting it lightly. At times weapons just seem to not be worth a damn while NPC's seem to enjoy glitching around and doing one of the worst jobs at actually putting up a fight. There's also glitches, though you'll be glad to know that the Developers STILL try to fix anything gamebreaking that might happen, which is honestly impressive taking into account how f#cking old this game is already. The weapons themselves are a bit dumb. You see, to the end of the game you'll have so many that's just overwhelming at times to go through the damn menu and try to find the one you wanted to use. Specially melee weapons, 90% of them become instantly obsolete later on and they'll just be taking a space in your insanely big inventory. Then there's weapons that just don't have much of an use, like the rocket launcher or grenade launcher that I used around once or twice in the entire thing. Also, this game manages to make shotguns boring. HOW. HOW THE F#CK YOU DO THAT!? THE SHOTGUN IS AS WORTHLESS AS A SILENCER ON A NUKE. Something that's probably obvious by now is that the game is also quite violent and offensive. I know that will turn down a lot of people, so that's my warning. I'll say though, the first POSTAL game was WAAAAY more violent and it actually took itself more seriously, while this one is more of a satirical experience with tons of dumb jokes. You might get a laugh at this one at times mainly because of how insane most stuff is, but sure as hell when racist, sexist or homophobic stuff goes around it drops the ball too much, going from satirically hilarious to just going too far.I'm also not the biggest fan of how much damage you can take and how little there is on the way of healing. All of those food items you might find? Kinda worthless until you have around 50 of them. You better stock up on weed during the early game because it's pretty much what will keep you alive later on, even if it does have a negative side-effect.Lastly, I found the last parts of the game underwhelming compared with the crazy bullsh#t that was happening early. Honestly, it feels like some fans made up the end game based on some dude's fanfiction; it's close to what you would expect, but it's just not the same.Is the game good, though? In a cosmic sort of way, yes.You see, this is one of those games that are so ungodly f#cking bad that they're actually amazing. Pretty much EVERYTHING in the game is SO WRONG that it's good. Just think of Hatred, one of the edgiest games out there, actually done well. It manages to be fun for a long amount of time despire it's issues and that's not something you pull off easily.The game also gives you a ton of freedom on doing the main objectives however you feel like, which is something I honestly love. It does drop the ball with the freedom later on, but oh well. I'd also say that actually playing the game on a pacifistic respectful way is just as hilariously fun as the psycopathic trigger-happy one.The main character also has a pretty cool voice-actor behind him and I actually enjoyed his performance and ironic, sarcastic bullsh#t. Just think of a young Duke Nukem who had enough with planet Earth and feels like going on a rampage and it's nearly as fun as the actual Duke.The story itself is also cool enough for a game like this. Sure there isn't much, but I don't think this game needed more. It's simple, and it stays simple until said late-game stages were it kinda drops the ball. Do I recommend this game? It mainly drops down to your tolerance to over-the-top offensive♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you can handle those kind of things, then you'll find a game that's fun as hell for all the wrong reasons and that despite having sh#t FPS mechanics, it's still worth going through to the end. If you can't take a joke, turn back right now. I don't think this game is best suited for you.TL;DR Edition: One of the most offensive games you can find lately, which plays like out-of-date sh#t and it still manages to be fun. You should be wary of it's extremely offensive nature before you buy it, but once you do you'll find that the game is actually just satirical and poking fun at it. Maybe poking fun a bit too hard, but I'd still recommend it on a Steam sale if you can take a f#cking joke.			"

												Amazing game where zero ♥♥♥♥s are given!  You get different assignments everyday that you must accomplish.  Very great combat for first person shooter with a variety of weird guns.  Cats are used for silencers on the shotgun and M4A4.  The tasks get stranger as you go becoming more difficult as well.  Great game if you like to destroy lots of things and carry on rampages with people.  For example you can pee on yourself if on fire or on others to annoy them!			"

												Postal 2 is an experience unlike any I have ever had, peeing on yourself to turn off a fire you started with your gasoline canister, stick cats on shutguns via their arses to silience the shotgun, stirring the taliban in their quick-e-mart stronghold, or snatching the last crotchy at the mall only to uncover saddistic dog/cat experiments in the same mall. Its a free roam world that does great things with a map and some daily quests. Try the catnip, fight the law, put out people on fire with your own♥♥♥♥♥♥ Life is great in Paradise, a desert community filled with angry video game protestors, postal postmen/women. Find hidden weapons, secret paths, play with a variety of great weapons to use like the heat seaking rocket launcher and the brutal diseased cow head. With an assortment of ranged and melee weapons. Gets progresively harder as more days go by, and can be very punishing at higher difficult levels. Stealth works in your favor as you clear the many ""important"" tasks that you recieve on a daily basis. With awesome power-ups like the fish finder and dressing up as a cop to avoid them, this game has alot of content packed-in. Great physics for its time and ragdolling heads with your kick ability is great. A true classic to its genre. I fully recommend giving Postal 2 a try, avoid postal 3 and postal 1 is ok but not as great as this one is. Cheers!			"

												If your seriously looking for older classic games, I HIGHLY suggest you get this.  I own 3 copies of this game and I still play it a bit to this day. Unlike games today, This game gives you a freedom of choice while putting you into a setting that is disurbing and quite amusing at the same time.   The game does have a twisted sense of humor. Yes, while It has no story. But the gameplay makes up for that by giving the players freedom. The recent update added a new spice to the game as well with some new weapons.That being said, the developers are extremely nice people. Postal 2 is 10 years old and had a huge update recently as mentioned before. I hope their ""next project"" goes well for them.			"

												Postal 2 is really quite an unique game, though uniqueness never garantees quality. at it's best, it is a rather cynical and blundering parody of video game violence, in similar vein to games like Harvester. but at it's worst it's a very mediocure first-person shooter ladened with bugs and poor design choices. there are a few good points however: the town you get to wander around is suprisingly detailed and can be quite enjoyable to explore and find secrets in. the NPC interaction is, while very awkward and disjointed, quite enthralling taking into account the time of the game's release. however, It's pretty hard to reccomend as an actual game, because once the novelty of being able to pour gasoline on a cat, set it ablaze with a match and then♥♥♥♥♥♥on it's charred gory carcass wears off, you then see for what the game really is: an abhorrent mess of offensive stereotypes and gratuitous violence. but I can recommend this game for the experience it offers. you may get more out of it that way. I would suggest going in not expecting much, you may be pleasently suprised... note the word MAY.			"

												I’ve got two words for you: Anger Management. Theres always those few times where you’re ready to explode and do something stupid, but this is the real world. You know that doing that one stupid thing will probably follow you around your whole life. How about instead of doing that stupid thing in real life, DO IT IN A VIDEO GAME!Postal 2 by Running With Scissors is the perfect game to do it with given that the main focus of the game is pretty much brutal murder in the most obscene ways.Running on the Unreal 2 engine, postal 2 may not look pretty, but don’t let that stop you from enjoying the utter mindlessness of the game. You play as Postal Dude (no really that’s his actual name “Postal Dude”) who is an angry redhead in a trenchcoat and sunglasses just trying to live a peaceful life in the fictional town of Paradise, although, he is given a set of simple tasks for 5 days.This game can be played two ways: Murdering everyone you see because why the hell not, or not killing or harming a single person (no matter what happens to you), however the developers throw your way a series of increasing annoyances such as long lines at a bank, having to pay postage fees, getting gonorrhea (that actually happens), and the parents against violent games committee ironically pulling firearms and attempting to shoot you on sight.The game is INCREDIBLY obscene and racist. There are the stereotypical turbin wearing terrorists running about and they make their hideout in a convenience store named “The Lucky Ganesh” while you try to go pick up “Jihad brand goat milk” (i’m not ♥♥♥♥ing kidding here). Gary Coleman also makes an appearance as a short, high voiced dwarf. There is a series of toys called the “Bad Touch Crotchy” which… obviously… is a scrotum with a smiley face on it. I could go on with this game’s incredibly offensive content, but I won’t.Postal 2 is a great way to relieve stress and have fun, but if you’re sensitive to incredible amounts of offensive content, this is NOT THE GAME FOR YOU. The complete package is available on steam for 9.99pros:- fun gameplay-surprisingly hard- stress relievercons:-unessecary racism7/10 (just because of the racism)			"

Even some ideas were released as offical mods.This game is AMAZING, even though it doesnt live for the whole hype and experience from the first installment it never the less one of the best games to be released in recent years. Valve did it again, and of course there is another fan base wishing for installment number 3 with great hype.overall score:   10/10 - would play again*what do you mean that this is another game? POSTAL 2? not PORTAL 2? are you sure? poStal? really? not porTal? well f***...*so I guess I made a mistake... this is POSTAL2, not PORTAL 2...Well I guess I need to see what we got here:Peeing on people... kinda funnyCat machine gun silencer. pretty niceLots of mature jokes and references- this is coolwell I guess I would play it again if I would be bored... so 10/10 - would play again?

This is due to the fact that Postal 2 is NOT a serious game, and if it is, it certainly doesn't feel like one. The storyline is linear, there's no characters you'll likely care about, and the gunplay can become quite stale very quickly, even with the varity of weapons.Overall, however, it has it's moments: from lighting a marching band on fire to tazing dogs and flipping off dikes8.3/10			"

												Postal 2 is a game that is flawed, yet it is wonderful at the same time. is it worth the buy? really its up to how offended can you get. this makes gta and the like look like care bears in terms of violence. and for a game ten years old, its really cool how rws are still showing love tho this game. if you are easilly offended... do not get this game. and especially dont get this game for your child. but, if you need a stress reliever, buy this game, then go to the workshop and put in the sandbox mod for maximum carnage.

												Postal 2 is unique. It absolutely lacks a coherent story, but for what it lacks in narrative it makes up in playability. The game is absolutely insane, for example: I was exploring the local sewer system behind the protagonists house with a shotgun stuck up a local cat's♥♥♥♥♥♥ when I happened upon a Taliban insurgence base where I proceded to murder them with said cat♥♥♥♥♥♥gun, and then I killed their leader with a severed cow head. None of this had anything to do with the story. It has a hit and miss sense of humor, and it is normally racial, childish or shock style of humor and caters to the lowest class of intelligence. I almost never laughed at the dialogue; not because I was offended, but because most of the time it just was not very funny. The game is offensive though and if that is ever taken in to account when making a purchase do not buy this game. The best humor in this game is simply when you create over-the-top murder situations, like butchering the entire town with a limb hacking machete while pretending you are Jason Vorhees. The graphics are good and forgivable for the date of the title. The character models are, well, odd. and their animations are dopey to say the least. The game takes place in a single town called Paradise, the town is small but ""♥♥♥♥♥quot; to navigate I had to pull up the map a good 100 times. Overall I would say that I personally enjoyed Postal 2, it is certainly not perfect but a good way to kill time. 6/10 Oh and the Apocalypse Weekend is terrible, do not bother with it.			"

☭AH MAH GASH U CAN PEE ON PEOPLE. TENOUTTATEN!☭ Ahem. This review has been long coming. Postal 2 is an offensive to some, but if you can look past that you can really get some enjoyment out of this game. While the gunplay is average at best, the weapon variety is amazing. Scissors, Gas cans, Dynamite, Urine, Napalm Launcher, Sledgehammars etc. The story is simple. You are sent on errands by your nagging wife. It entirely up to you how you decide to behave. You can be a pacifist, not killing a single person using your wits and money to get out of arrest. Or for most players. You can go POSTAL. Gunning down all these people and rampaging through the town decaptating, burning, or otherwise maming your way through the game.  If it comes down to it, Would I reccomend? Yes.Some people are sensitive about a game like this, but you just need to listen up.Its low brow yes, but theres charm in that.Overall I enjoyed Postal 2 and if you bought it, you will too.			"

												I bought this game back in '03 when it was originally released and I liked it so much that when it went on sale on Steam for a paltry two-fiddy, it was a no-brainer to re-purchase it.The real reason I bought it on Steam, however, was for the achievements.Normally I couldn't give a flying fudgesicle about achievements, but this game not only gives you an achievement for peeing on someone until they puke, but also one for drinking your own pee. Add another one for ""luring a police officer with a píss-soaked donut,"" and you've pretty much exceeded your pee quota for the week.Oh yeah, the non-pee related parts of the game are pretty fun too.Buy Postal 2.

The level design is 2nd to none, it's essentially an open world FPS from 2003, but with sections in between that require loading.

												Having just purchased this on a whim, this is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable games I have played on PC. Granted I'm playing this on a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥laptop so it's hard to play a game made post-2006 but nonetheless this game is still fantastic. The graphics are nothing spectacular (even for a game released in 2003) but what makes this enjoyable is the open world and the endless carnage you get to unleash upon it. From the moment I beat someone to death with a shovel, set them alight and then urinated on their torched corpse I knew I was in for a fun time. The shooting mechanics are nothing amazing and pretty basic; but it's using the melee weapons where the game truly shines. Dismembering screaming bystanders witha set of hedge clippers was a morbid delight. Having purchased the complete Postal 2 collection (including Weekend Apocalypse) and having thoroughly enjoyed my experience I was delighted to see that DLC was available for the game 11 YEARS since the last expansion. I also got myself Paradise Lost and hhave just started this. So far, it's been a juvenile delight with plenty of cussing, blood and shameless toilet humour. If you're looking for something that will metally and physically challenge you, pushing your gaming skills to the test; or you're seeking an in-depth and engaging story then this is not the game for you. However, if you're looking to indulge you childish humour, primitive bloodlust or just have a really crappy PC that won't run anything made within the last ten years, then this is the game for you.Good job, Running With Scissors! You've earned yourself another fan!			"

												Postal 2 is a fun FPS sandbox experience, however it is recommended that if you are easily offended, just walk away. It's addictive and very challenging at harder levels. The main story is not that great, and mainly varies from doing different errands, such as cashing a paycheck or returning a library book. How you do them, however, is up to you. You can just simply walk into the bank and cash your paycheck, or you can sneak into the vault and take whatever loot you can carry, and also murder half the population of the town. Its a fun little time waster and is even better with the hundreds of weapons mods. Also, the multiplayer, while fun, is very empty. Not to mention, you can urinate on people.			"

Pure genius for the comedic, and parody lovers out there.The game also had a update recently with the new ""Apocalypse Weekend"" expansion (for free of course)So pick up the game now and start getting your lulz.

												Now the flowers will grow!What's there left to say about POSTAL 2? POSTAL 2 stands out from most every video game ever, even 10 years later. It's funny and it's fun and that's all you need. The game is a week in the life of Postal Dude (from Paradise, AZ) Who is Postal Dude? Postal Dude is just a dude. A dude who is postal, or in other words, just doesn't give a f**k. What is an average week in the life of POSTAL dude? POSTAL dude embarks in the herculean adventure of getting some milk, returning a library book, cashing a check, and making a confession at the local church. The catch? POSTAL dude can and will be obscene and violent as he can. POSTAL dude will♥♥♥♥♥♥on, shoot, tase, kick, beat-with-a-shovel, or set fire to anyone or anything he (you) wants. Oh yeah, and cashing that check? You can just rob the bank. This game is as funny as it is offensive. If you are easily offended, you should probably grow a spine, because this game picks on everybody. Women, middle easterners, gay men, and police officers among everyone else. However, Running With Scissors is self aware. They pick fun at theirselves. They know their game is violent, offensive, and plot-less, and that's the point.			"

												Do you like FPS games? Do you like FPS games in a sandbox world? Do you like games that push things to the edge in a world of political correctness? Well, POSTAL 2 might just be the game for you.Story:The story of the game is simple. It's all about the protagonist fittingly named Postal Dude and his daily errands. The game is separated into five levels, but if you include the Apocalypse Weekend expansion, there's seven. One level for each day of the week. Each day has it's own list of errands that Dude must complete in order to progress to the next day. As you follow Postal Dude on his journey and complete errands, something always goes wrong such as being attacked by video game protesters, rednecks and various other social groups that become Dude's enemies throughout the game.Gameplay:The game gives you a large arsenal of weapons to combat these enemies. Sure, you can use your standard weapons like shotguns or machine guns, but why stop there when you can get a cat and attach it's rear end to the muzzle? There's a great selection of melee weapons as well. There's sledgehammers, boomerang machetes, shears, scythes and more. So if decapitating your enemies with a shotgun blow to the head just isn't doing it for you, you can run around with your shears and manually dismember your enemies limb by limb. There's also gasoline and matches that you can use to set people on fire. Did I mention that you can♥♥♥♥♥♥on people? Well you can. You can even♥♥♥♥♥♥on yourself. So if you ever find yourself on fire, just unzip, look up and let it rain. You can play the game the way YOU want to play it. If you want to run around shooting everything in sight, you can. However, if you want to play without so much as attacking a single person, you can do that as well. It may be more challenging that way, but it's possible.Conclusion:Overall, this is an amazing game. Don't come looking for a deep, thought-provoking story. This game doesn't have it. But what it does have is incredibly addictive gameplay with practically endless possibilities and a plot that's simple enough to keep your interest along the way. This is one of those games where once you beat it, you likely won't stop playing it for a while. It's a fun sandbox to run around in aimlessly while you watch your favorite TV show or listen to your favorite podcast. If you're offended easily, this game may not be for you. Otherwise, I'd highly recommend it. This may very well be my favorite FPS game of all-time and if it isn't, it's definitely up there.			"

Even some ideas were released as offical mods.This game is AMAZING, even though it doesnt live for the whole hype and experience from the first installment it never the less one of the best games to be released in recent years. Valve did it again, and of course there is another fan base wishing for installment number 3 with great hype.overall score:   10/10 - would play again*what do you mean that this is another game?

												With the amount of controversy that surounded this game I was curious as to whether or not it was actually any good.  After playing I can say that it is a hilariously fun game that anyone with a sense of humor can enjoy.  I also find it ironic that, for a game poking fun at how the media portrays violent games as the root of all evil, it became a main example for people that do not approve of violent games to use in court as evidence to support their beliefs.  The irony here is that the entire game can be beaten without harming anyone, proving that games are only as violent as the people that play them.  Didn't mean for this to turn into a speech.  Bottomline really funny game, go play it.			"

												Crude... Offensive... Tactless... All words that come to mind when describing Postal 2. All good words, mind, and they certainly add to the charm of this rather unconventional first-person shooter. ""Live a life in the week of the Postal Dude!"" they shout. And you certainly will, with all the shenanigans that occur in this game. Ferom killing protestors on Monday to visiting your crazy Uncle's compound on Thursday to surviving the apocalypse on the Weekend, the game is jam-packed with things to do. You COULD cash your check and be on your way... or you could break into the bank's vault and steal everything. You COULD wait in line to pay for the milk... but you won't. You COULD ethically let cats go.... or you could use them as silencers. The game is only as offensive and sick as you are, and thats part of the beauty of it. If you want to be Mr. Nice Guy and not kill a soul, you CAN, but you shouldn't. If you want to be Happy McMurderson, you CAN, and you probably should be. What with the new big update that the devs put up here, you have even more tools to start cracking skuls with. Why delay the inevitable by putting buying this off? Just buy it now, give it a go, and laugh(or cry) at the sheer amount of dumb fun that this game offers.9/10 would probably bang again			"

												TL;DR: Genius in its simplicity in most aspects. will satisfy bloodlust if you have it or justify the violence diegetically if you don't. Don't try this at home. Runs on any computer that can run Steam.Want to butcher and urinate on people? This game's for you.Want a diegesis that justifies said butchering and urinating? This game's  ALSO  for you!Are you a politician or kid who shouldn't be exposed to justified murder? The disclaimer says this game isn't for you.While most people seem to claim Postal 2 is the prime senseless dismemberment game on the market, the snarky and sadly believable storyline behind it all makes the violence you'll be tempted to dish out anything but senseless. (Either that, or I need to be sent to an asylum.) The combat is simple yet awesome once you learn how strong each weapon is, and you can always justify  invading random in-game homes and businesses  to get more firepower given how trigger-happy most of the residents are. The tons of difficulty levels will keep you coming back for more urine-soaked amputation-and-firearm to-do lists. (Seriously. A trip to the grocery store might involve slaughtering or avoiding masses of angry people.)Surgeon general's warning:  READ THE DISCLAIMER AS THE GAME LOADS . YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS GAME AS JUSTIFICATION FOR REAL-LIFE VIOLENCE. (You could use it as a reason to whine about the modern world if you like as long as you're not going into politics, though.) Some later parts are counter-intuitive, but others make up for it by having multiple means to the same end. Some non-combat interactions are glitchy. If in doubt, equip your in-game money and hammer E. For item drop-box glitching, keep trying and they will eventually work. If you get stuck in the wall, this game is very good at getting you  un-  stuck, so be happy about that.			"

												This game is brilliant. It's humour is funny, graphics meh but it is a fairly old game. Mine had a glitch where no one actually carries guns just shovels, police batons, knuckle dusters, molitovs and (near the end) sledgehammers. It is quite random in terms of where you are and what happens, like you go to confess your sins at the church and it gets attacked by terrorists. My advice, always carry a weapon. I made the mistake of not taking a weapon to work on the first day and got killed by protestors. If you want to do everyday things but kill people, go for 'POSTAL 2'. If you want to kill zombies,  insane Gary Colemans (armed with scissors) and defeat the demon-cow big boss, then go for 'Apocolypse Weekend'. If you want the full feel of the game, go for 'A Week in Paradise'  (or something like that, I may be wrong).All in all, this is a great game and I seriously advise you to get it. :D			"

												Yeah, this game is very fun, but it's not without it's flaws. In this review, I will pick out specific parts of the game to talk about, and they may contain spoilers, so do not read if you do not want to finish playing. (Like this game has spoilers.)First, the game is very offensive to those who take offense to this sort of stuff. Now, I'm not one to be offended, so I had an enjoyable time playing this game. But some might find the stereotypes, the violence, and the overall mature oriented material of the game offensive. That said, they'd know what they're getting into with the content rating and the screenshots on the page.Secondly, the dialogue in this game is clear and can be heard pretty perfectly. However, they often repeat lines, which can get a bit annoying at times. I can't tell you how many times that I heard a pedestrian say ""One side!"" or the Postal Dude say, ""You probably think I'm not a nice person,"" but I know that the count must be in the hundreds by now.Third, the combat in this game is great. However, without a cover system, the first person aspect was a bit tough to grasp and truly not take damage from anyone shooting at you. This made the apocalypse difficult for me, as I had a small amount of health. Also, the boss battles were frustrating, as they had a missile launcher and I had to stand back and shoot them.Honestly, I thought the weekend missions were some of the most repetitive missions I have ever played, and would rather not play through them again. I remember thinking I was almost done with the game at one point, but I had another 10 parts to go. It just jumped the shark too much at the end. The week was fine, I loved the week, but the weekend was just a roadblock to me. The bridge and Mike J. were some of the most frustrating parts of any game for me.Besides those complaints, I still think this is a very good game, and a very fun game. I'd recommend it to those looking for a dose of violence into their lives. Would I recommend it for the story? No, the story is almost non-existent. But the game is fine, and it's fun to just experiement what you can truly do in the game.And the multiplayer is fun. They remove a few weapons from the game, but the perk of playing the game with friends is a large fun perk.Rating: 7.5/10			"

Protestors and Red Necks, Fanatics, and Butchers, all want you to stop changing things for the worst!This game has a hilarious loadout of weapons, that would have you question the logic of structure!Run errands, cause a huge commotion, kick down doors, you're in for a First Person surprise!I reccomend this game to weirdo's like myself, who don't mind ""A Weekend In Paradise!""

												This game is abhorrently violent and senseless...  And that's why we love it so much.  It doesn't bother trying to be PC, it just lets you go...  Well, it lets you go postal!  I mean you don't HAVE to go around setting everyone on fire then♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on their burning corpses or tazing someone until they're on the ground♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves, only for you to decapitate them with a shovel...  But the option's there!Also let's not forget the fact that the game is still getting support and updates from it's developers long after release, and when you look at some other AAA games, they're left dead in the water after a few years.  All in all, good mindlessly violent fun, and it doesn't dare take itself seriously, because it knows you bloody well won't!			"

												I bought this game in like 2004, but I figured I'd post a review anyway.  This game is pretty awesome the first time you play it.  It doesn't have much replay value, unless you're in the mood to run around and kill people.  I personally like to pee on peoples' faces, and then douse them with gasoline and light them on fire while they're puking.  Chopping people up is fun too.  The game only takes a few hours to beat, unless you make it a point to kill everyone you see along the way, which I did.  My only complaints worth mentioning are that there is only a somewhat small assortment of weapons and, thus limited ways to kill people.  Having something that could disembowel someone woulda been fun, for instance.  I could think of other ways to kill that'd be cool, but you get the point.  Also, being able to torture people in different ways would have been a good addition.  I wish violent games on the whole would get just a bit more nasty.  This game has the right idea.  Again, just wish there was a much larger variety of nasty stuff you could do to people.			"

Really makes fun of American culture and is far ahead of it's time being such an old game. Even if you just run around aimlessly you will have fun. The game is a little beyond tame allowing you to pour gas on people and light them on fire. You can also unzip your pants exposing your ""junk"" for npcs to comment on, better still you can urinate on anything. With the great assembly of weapons, You can go on quite the angry rampage and there is a bevy of funny acheivements to go with it.I dare you to beat the game without getting lost in the mayhem lol7.5/10 "

												Fantastic, fun game with loads of quirky adult humor! Absolute classic, still looking quite fresh, great to see it on steam! The game lets you control the normality of situations you get in and for some people can get pretty nasty and very violent! I mean first mission you get is to go to the bank, cash in the check and buy some milk! Sound pretty normal doesnt it? Or you could just grab a petrol can, pour it all over a shopkeaper, throw a burning match at him and urinate all over his crispy corpse to show your appreciation of a shopping experience, choice is yours! With a massive arsenal of quite possibly the most messed up weapons in gaming history (cow head that makes people throw up) will definately blow you away and make you reinstall it again and again in the future!

												If your seriously looking for older classic games, I HIGHLY suggest you get this.  I own 3 copies of this game and I still play it a bit to this day. Unlike games today, This game gives you a freedom of choice while putting you into a setting that is disurbing and quite amusing at the same time.   The game does have a twisted sense of humor. Yes, while It has no story. But the gameplay makes up for that by giving the players freedom. The recent update added a new spice to the game as well with some new weapons.That being said, the developers are extremely nice people. Postal 2 is 10 years old and had a huge update recently as mentioned before. I hope their ""next project"" goes well for them.			"

												POSTAL2 truly lives up to its name with insane amounts of murder, blood and gore with one or two outrageous weapons even though none of that made sense. The freedom to (almost) do whatever you desire and to do the story at your own pace just makes the entire game even better than it already was. Even though im not too sure about the ""only as violent as you are"" promise, its certainly a tub full of blood! (if you like that kind of stuff.)			"

☭AH MAH GASH U CAN PEE ON PEOPLE. TENOUTTATEN!☭ Ahem. This review has been long coming. Postal 2 is an offensive to some, but if you can look past that you can really get some enjoyment out of this game. While the gunplay is average at best, the weapon variety is amazing. Scissors, Gas cans, Dynamite, Urine, Napalm Launcher, Sledgehammars etc. The story is simple. You are sent on errands by your nagging wife. It entirely up to you how you decide to behave. You can be a pacifist, not killing a single person using your wits and money to get out of arrest. Or for most players. You can go POSTAL. Gunning down all these people and rampaging through the town decaptating, burning, or otherwise maming your way through the game.  If it comes down to it, Would I reccomend? Yes.Some people are sensitive about a game like this, but you just need to listen up.Its low brow yes, but theres charm in that.Overall I enjoyed Postal 2 and if you bought it, you will too.			"

												Postal 2 is a unique experience, containing amazing gameplay like no other.  It tells the story of a man who has to overcome his various mental problems through many different methods, showing the internal struggle through a week of his life.  It shows how some people with problems have to go through a struggle to simply get milk.  It feels like everyone is your enemy and you have to conquer them, very symbolic.  It contains daily menial tasks that have a lot of struggle.  It also shows a very realistic depiction of modern problems that we all face such as a bad economy, losing your job within the first day of working at it.  Truly the only game to match the symbolism and quality as a public statement on life that I have seen is the popular game ""Gone Home"".  Truly an artistic masterpiece that will bring you to tears with its storytelling.Also you can stick your gun in a cat's butt as a silencer and I laughed.  :)			"

												POSTAL 2 will make your mother cry and your friends question your lack of empathy.Just joking.It's not that bad.Considered one of the more offensive games out there, I found it to be quite light hearted. This is due to the fact that Postal 2 is NOT a serious game, and if it is, it certainly doesn't feel like one. The storyline is linear, there's no characters you'll likely care about, and the gunplay can become quite stale very quickly, even with the varity of weapons.Overall, however, it has it's moments: from lighting a marching band on fire to tazing dogs and flipping off dikes8.3/10			"

												Aside from not realizing how OLD this game was I found it to be quite entertaining and for $2.99 at 70% off it was a good deal, I love the GTA feel with more freedom, and i find it to be very comical. If you like games that allow you freedom of choice, yet have a storyline/quests ect. and action then I would reccomend you get this game, though the graphics are outdated (only by 10 years) and by todays standard the gameplay may be a bit lacking compared to GTA or Saints row it is still an enjoyable game esspecially if you just want to kill time or don't know what else to do.

Also, you can blow up cars, rob the bank, and kill civillians, smoke crack, and even smoke catnip to go slow motion. The missions are simple tasks that usualy go wrong making you fight enemies or escape places, and sometimes they dont. You can use cheat codes, play online, and do apocalypse weekend. Do whatever.

												By far one of the best games on Steam! Full of dark humor, action, and hilarious dialouge from the Postal Dude. The only issue I've experienced with the game is that it will crash occasionally, usually if there are a ton of enemies in the area so save often if that happens. Otherwise there is a ton of content to this game for only $10, even better if its on sale.			"

												This game is hilariousThis was made in early 2000's so it really brings Nostagia with the Graphics, refrences, events, and struggles back then, like the Taliban, Video game protesters, etc. Also the phones, lol. This game also made my day when I found a SImpsons refrence. The only thing this game lacks is graphics, but since was made over a decade ago it kinda has an excuse.Amazing Gameplay. What you do is you go around doing tasks, but in the city you live in, Paradise, isn't so bright so you end up being attacked everyday by people from the Taliban to Rednecks, when all you where trying to do was buy milk or get a paycheck.This game sounds dumb at the start, but when you play it, you will be amazed at how amazing this game is.

												This game is AMAZING!!!the game is dated but just like half-life, it's still really fun! You play as a man named the ""Postal Dude"" who gets chores from his naggy wife, like cashing a check at a bank. You could wait in line and get 25$ from you're check. OR go balls to the walls and get 500$ from pulling out your big♥♥♥♥♥shotgun and rob the place! As time goes on more and more people start to hate you and will randomly attack you on the side-walk. Eventually the military will come in and before you know it. The apocolipse happens and your running away from zombies and ebola cows! Yeah its kinda ♥♥♥♥ed up but its so ♥♥♥♥ed up its fun! One problem though. eatch day is harder than the last, and thats fine! But on day 4 and 5 you are walking from one side of the town to the next witch takes about 15 min. Its fine the first time I played it, But the second time it was so boaring to walk I just dropped it. still fun for new players though!-Pros-Badass postal dude-Choice between good or bad-guns, knives, and even more guns to weild!-ZOMBIES AND EBOLA COWS!!!-Bunch of other stuff!-Blah, Blah, Blah, JUST GET THE GAME!-Cool workshop and mods!-Cons-A little dated-you forgot to save so now you have to redo some stuff :/-more forgetting to save-walking simulator on the final daysAnyway, just get the game.

												My first reaction to this game was: Hmmkay? Totally not weird to chop people's heads of, set them on fire and pee on their burning corpses. But later on in the game I started to enjoy the pixelated boobs, bloody limps and the puke staines on the ground. It is pretty pleasing to separate someones legs from their body in one nice and clean swing with your machete. Smashing the brains of a cow with a sledgehammer, in a way that you will find pieces five meters further is also very interesting, and especially tasty when you are eating while you are playing. The fact that you can put the barrel of your shotgun in a cat's posterior and use it as a silencer should be enough to make you buy this game.7,5/10			"

												A much more humorous take on the series in comparison to the original POSTAL, however the series still holds true to the large amounts (or lack) of ultraviolence and satisfying weaponry, in addition to having the choice of continuing the legacy Dude's massive psychotic murder-spree or being a goody-two-shoes. The replay value is great and the DLC is even better. There is also a large network of mods, skins, maps and other addons by use of the website POSTAL NETWORK or even just the Steam workshop.""I REGRET NOTHING.""			"

												Postal 2 is really quite an unique game, though uniqueness never garantees quality. at it's best, it is a rather cynical and blundering parody of video game violence, in similar vein to games like Harvester. but at it's worst it's a very mediocure first-person shooter ladened with bugs and poor design choices. there are a few good points however: the town you get to wander around is suprisingly detailed and can be quite enjoyable to explore and find secrets in. the NPC interaction is, while very awkward and disjointed, quite enthralling taking into account the time of the game's release. however, It's pretty hard to reccomend as an actual game, because once the novelty of being able to pour gasoline on a cat, set it ablaze with a match and then♥♥♥♥♥♥on it's charred gory carcass wears off, you then see for what the game really is: an abhorrent mess of offensive stereotypes and gratuitous violence. but I can recommend this game for the experience it offers. you may get more out of it that way. I would suggest going in not expecting much, you may be pleasently suprised... note the word MAY.			"

												This is a game that's meant to enthuse the part of your mind that's obsessed with killing, bloodshed, and the occasional feeling that your cat may know what it is you plan to do with it as it reaches the 'not so entertaining' years of it's life, as well and to offend LITERALLY everybody.Postal 2 is THAT kinda game that's a sandbox, adventure, shooter, gibfest of a game that plays of the original Postal (where the differences are failry noticible from a graphics standpoint) where you are Postal Dude, the indescribably firm definition of what it means to be a psychopath, slaughtering everything that get's in his way; including but not limited to- Cats, Dogs, Elephants, Zombies, Humans, pretty much anything that has a vowel in it he'll give the death stare until he feels enough discontent that he'll slap it over and over again until he has the sudden relief that what he saw as a horrified image of someone giving him half-a-million middle fingers can't flip him off anymore; continuing on to the next mission doing the exact same thing.Anyways, you get your set amount of difficulties; Libermode which is the litteral definition of ""almost too easy"", average for those of you that seem to know the rainbow filled fun of the hack and slash everything genre, and ""I hope there's enough room in heaven for how much I'm going to be dying over and over because of the crazed ice cream man with a spoon intent on bashing my skull in because I didn't order HIS particular special 'Rocky Road'"". Through it all, you'll experience different sorts of people intent on making your day a living hell; Stereotypical Protestors, Stereotypical Police, Stereoty- y'know I'm gonna stop right there, everything in this game is stereotype, and to win you pretty much have to be king of the stereotypes and self proclaimed survivor of the zombie appocalypse.Aside from completing your run of the mill ""Wacky Honey-Do"" list scenarios, you don't have to necessarily have to do them all and go straight home before curfew, you can explore the Post-Apocalyptic world where you and the rest of the population (which will be exterminated because of Postal Dude's bravehearted decision to destroy humanity for his sole wellbeing) spend their lives. You can collect plenty of weapons, which are hiding mind you, that have different styles of attacking and methods of use- my favorite being the Scythe because I can run around with my clipboard shouting ""Next"" whilst slicing off another crainium to add to my Psycopath Stew ((TM) not really TM).TL:DR - Shooty Shooty Bang Bang, Decapitation and gibs galore, weapons that no normal person should use but does, sandbox style stuff, and if you couldn't pee enough in Duke Nukem or Deadpool, now's your chance for vengeance my friends.

												Postal 2 is a classic game. The game is painfully simple; you play each day in a week and every day you are given a list mundane of chores: buy milk, go to church, pick up laundry etc. Sounds boring right? Wrong! The town you live in is bat♥♥♥♥♥♥insane. Random firefights break out everywhere, taliban shows up to create mayhem and as the week progresses more and more groups want to kill you. How you want to play the game is up to you. You can finish the game without killing anyone or you can use a large array of weapons to murder everyone in sight. My favourite weapons are the boomerang machete and the cat-silencer shotgun. Yes you can shove a shotgun in a cats ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the gun meows!If you are a fan of political incorrectness and excessive violence this game is a must buy!			"

												This game is very amusing to say the very least. Good way to relieve stress after a long day of work. I could care less about the tasks they give you in the game because I often get side tracked from them and just go around and killing people. I'm pretty sure back in the day the graphics looked good since I remeber this game being released in early 2003. By today the graphics look quite blocky and outdated but that means nothing because I'm having so much fun. Sometimes you can even find stuff that aren't possible to get with just cheat codes alone. This game also makes exploring fun because who knows what you can find out there. Although since Apocalypse Weekend was released as a seperate expansion originally in early to mid 2005 the graphics by then looked quite dated especially with games like Splinte Cell: Chaos Theory or Battlefield 2 really pushing the envelope back then. The path in Apocalypse Weekend is quite linear so it can get quite boring after a while espcially when the enemies in that game were too easy to kill on average difficulty. I don't care if this game is offensive, I'd recommend this game any day. Please note that this game will crash every so often and sometimes it'll not launch after. Had to restart my computer every time almost which is midly annoying.			"

Unlike games today, This game gives you a freedom of choice while putting you into a setting that is disurbing and quite amusing at the same time.   The game does have a twisted sense of humor. Yes, while It has no story. But the gameplay makes up for that by giving the players freedom. The recent update added a new spice to the game as well with some new weapons.That being said, the developers are extremely nice people. Postal 2 is 10 years old and had a huge update recently as mentioned before. I hope their ""next project"" goes well for them.			"

I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on people and putting a shotgun barrel through a cat's♥♥♥♥♥hahahaha funny"" but after that, the humor kind of dies down, and you're basically over it after 2 minutes of seeing it. As far as the main objective goes in this game, it's really basic. You just go through the days of week doing errands, some of them being a little more catastrophic than others, but nonetheless just doing ""every day"" kind of tasks, that people normally do, with the exception that you can kill people on the way if you're feeling Postal haha. Overall though, the game is pretty fun for what it is. If you see it on sale, I definitely recommend picking it up.			"

												Yes, this game is offensive, controversial, and horrible. Yet, these seemingly unattractive qualities are exactly what makes this game so much fun to play. I have spent 8 hours on this game as of now, i have just beaten the main story(the main story is much shorter than 8 hours, but i just like to mess around and kill people). The main story happens over 5 days in game (mon-fri) but, the game also comes with extra gameplay (apocalypse weekend), and multiplayer. Sadly however, when i tried multiplayer there were around four people online, which, i suppose is to be expected from a game from 2003.

												Postal 2 is bloody brilliant. Seriously bloody. You play as the postal dude going doing stages of his life. In my opinion the missions are a little repetitive and I might have gone insane from the last 2 levels. The gamplay is sick and awsome. You get to cut off people's limbs then burn them before peeing on them to put them out. If you are easily offended then this game isn't for you, There are jokes which some of you might find offensive and even racists. To enjoy this game to the fullest go into it with an open mind as it will really ♥♥♥♥ with it. Also steam workshop support, now you can do even more sick♥♥♥♥♥♥with the help of your local friendly modders who are just as sick as you. This game doesn't have good reviews but it is the best psychopath simulator ever (debatble). This  game gets a positive from me!			"

												Postal 2 is a game which contains violence and it's own sense of humor.  Game makes fun off people who think that video games cause violence which is a nice change for once. My first impression of the game started with a big bang. The dog pisses on my shoe and I decide to take revenge by♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on it, bloody dog attacks me so I beat it to death with a shovel 10/10. Game gives you choises at first which are good or bad but when the game progresses everything just starts to get more straight forward. You just shoot people as you've completed a task...It gets dull towards the end and you get sick of traveling around the map. For some reason I am still recommending this game. Probably because of some unique ways to kill and especially the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥mechanic xD. Also some of the things that happen gave me a laugh and some of the things people and protagonist say are descent fun. Also I think Workshop can bring a lot more content to this game but I am yet to try it. Buy this game on a sale when it's under 5 euros in my opinion a little over liked title.			"

												This game crushes so many social and political topics, You can get it for like 1$ on steam sales. Really makes fun of American culture and is far ahead of it's time being such an old game. Even if you just run around aimlessly you will have fun. The game is a little beyond tame allowing you to pour gas on people and light them on fire. You can also unzip your pants exposing your ""junk"" for npcs to comment on, better still you can urinate on anything. With the great assembly of weapons, You can go on quite the angry rampage and there is a bevy of funny acheivements to go with it.I dare you to beat the game without getting lost in the mayhem lol7.5/10 "

												This game is extremely satisfying to play. I caught myself many times giggling out loud. People can be outraged by it's content when reading about it or watching a video but when you actually play it you'll realize it's just about absurd fun. Like dressing up for Halloween your just playing a fantasy role and should know the difference between fantasy and reality.You get to pee on stangers, it's something you'll find yourself choosing to do A LOT. It even keeps track of how much you chose to do this. You could just walk to the store and buy milk but you won't, you'll choose to be a jerk and it's totally okay because being a jerk can be fun when it's fictional. I was concerned about the age of this game but it's still totally worth playing so just go for it.			"

												Classy old crazy game from another era of gaming.Embraced violence and open-ended gameplay, but allowed to stick to the freedom and even pacifistic ways of completing the game. Old shool challenges, jet black humour, the stamp of the years gone by.Oh, and it's frequently updated by devs even now, in 2016.Probably one of my favorite old games in steam.			"

												Game of all years, 10/10The game received a 4.8 on >Gamespot (on a 5 point scale, obviously), so you know it's a good game. Not only does the game have a noteworthy storyline, but the game devs were not lazy when they constructed the town. It's one of the only games out there where you can actually go into other people's houses and into almost every building you see. In this sense, the game is somewhat reminiscent of Fallout 3 but this game has a colour scheme. There's also a carton of goat milk on the main screen.			"

												The game is likeable for what it is, for players that played it in the year of release probably a bit more than for others. It's the cheap, mindless sort of game you can barely find today, at least not with this violent subtext. It's not comparable to Hatred, which is purely sadistic IMHO.+++++++Minor spoilers ahead++++++++++But now, about sadistic: The context-less, forced cow- and elephant slaughtering of the ""Apocalypse Weekend"" addon is an absolut -disgrace- imho. Especially considering that this game can be completed without killing a single person (playing Mon-Fri), even giving an achievement.Maybe I'm getting old ;)			"

You are given a list of errands to do in each mission, but hey!- You can also choose to♥♥♥♥♥♥on people, knock their heads off with shovels, pour gasoline on them and light them on fire, etc.That being said, 5 hours in... still need to beat the first level.

												Postal 2 is obviously the sequel to Postal, however the only thing this game has in common are the title and the protagonist. There isn’t really a story in postal 2, you are just put into the shoes of the postal dude for two weeks where he moves to a fictional town in Arizona called paradise where he works for running with scissors. The gameplay is the main focus of this game, it’s a free roaming first person shooter where you have a series of non-violent tasks to do on your to-do list, such as: return a library book, or buy some milk. This is a game where it’s only as violent as you are playing it, you don’t have to kill a single person. Though the game will start testing your patience since some of the objectives involve queuing and the NPCs like to push in and most tasks usually have multiple ways of completing them. After each task is complete something usually goes horribly wrong and a group of lunatics show up with guns, and once this has been done these people will be marked on your map as a group of enemies who will shoot you on sight when you are wondering around. The exploration is handled quite well in this game, there are a lot of nooks and crannies where items can be found. Like I said earlier you can either be a pacifist or you can murder and torture as many people in as many ways as you want, since you have an arsenal filled with kitchen appliances, garden tools, sports equipment, firearms, and explosive and flammable equipment and each weapon is better for different situations. The violence in this game is so over the top that’s its quite funny. This is quite a funny game due to the crazy things that can happen in the game world but the humour is hit or miss, it ranges from cultural parodies, animal cruelty, absurd acts of violence and disgusting behaviour since you can♥♥♥♥♥♥into people’s mouths and they will throw up (you can also put fires out with♥♥♥♥♥♥, and breaking the fourth wall.   There are also over dozen difficulty modes, on the lowest difficulty the most powerful weapon the enemies will be armed with is the shovel, on insane-o mode everyone is armed with a random weapon and they will attack if they feel threatened instead of most people running away and screaming in a ridiculous manner, and on they hate me and above everyone is armed and will attack you on sight.  The only problem with this game is that it does crash fairly often due to a bug in the game, and it’s got quite a limited appeal since the violence and the offensive parodies can be huge off putters, when this game came out it received mostly negative reviews because of this and disregarding everything else in the game. So this is a really good game, with a lot of replay value and I suggest you play each one (Monday to Friday, and paradise lost) three times, one normally, one being a pacifist and one on postal mode.

												Do you enjoy irreverent humor? Freedom of choice? Causing mayhem with a wide arsenal of weapons both exotic and mundane? Partaking in daily chores at a leisurely pace without causing injury or insult to a single soul? In a word, a game that is: different? Then look no further! Look right here, right now! Postal 2 complete! Postal 1 wasn't enough, Postal 2 wasn't enough, Postal 2 COMPLETE isn't even enough... But it's the best we have right now! So pick it up and give it a try! It's on sale cheap and the developers are always looking to expand this already great game to perhaps even include steam ACHIEVEMENTS!			"

												The game is violent, politically incorrect and very bloody. Tools crimes are very diverse, from the ordinary Glock shovel until the napalm and rocket launchers. There are also tools which can deprive the opponent's limb or torso separated from the legs. Nevertheless, we can pass this game with no murder (!). The story talks about the man name's Postal Dude, who lives with his wife in a mobile home in a small town ""Paradise"". We are our hero for the full week. The tasks seem trivial, because what's so hard about putting a book to the library? It turns out that the people of the town will not allow that in the life of our hero crept into everyday life. In the game's under brutality we can see political motives, the game puts the unanswered questions and makes you think. This is still a good game, I love it.			"

												In my opinion POSTAL 2 is a one of a kind game. Truly unique. This game offers so much freedom to our conscience. You don't want to kill anyone, you simply don't have to. You want a bloodbath you can make one. Simply masterpiece. 11/10			"
