												Really enjoyed this adventure game!!  It's different than the average point-and-click adventure game in that the decisions made by the player will change how the story unfolds.  Which, in turn, affects your scoring at games end.  You play as Mata Hari and are recruited as a spy.  As story progresses, you end up becoming a double agent.  As with point-and-click adventure games, it is somewhat linear.  However ... the key is to strategize.  You're a spy.  Stop and think.  Even though some characters may suggest you go to one country, try going a different route via a different country first.  There are side 'missions' that are at play while completing primary missions at hand. With my first playthrough, I pretty much did what I thought I was 'supposed' to do per the character interactions to get what I needed to further the story.  My score was pretty sad at games end and I didn't understand why.  On my second playthrough, I took more time, chose different routes than suggested by characters, tried to avoid interaction with certain characters until necessary, and was delightfully surprised that I could do much more than I thought.  Any adventure gamer will really enjoy this game!!!! (I would love to see achievements and cards added to this game!!!!)			"

												Like some other reviewers I find it difficult to give this game a pure thumbs up or down. It does have a charm to it--where else can one drug a man to sleep and steal his secrets while dressed in a nightie and high heels? The problem lies not in the story but in the game play. First, there is A LOT of traveling between countires and while the attempt to turn this into a minigame might have meant well it quickly becomes tedious. Second, I thought the the difficulty of the minigames ramped up quickly, espeically the dance one. I know you don't have to be a dancer to finish the game but I hate it when not having great twitch reflexes gets in the way of playing the game how I want to play it--frustration is not equal to fun. Some people are going to love this game but I didn't. The story and the setting simply couldn't overcome what I experienced as poor game play.			"

												Mine is not a thumbs up, nor a thumbs down. The game has a particular charme: it's set in the first two decades of 1900, you travel in 4 countries of Europe, you meet some historical characters, and the main character is Mata Hari. That's probably the only good thing about this game. If you like the adventure genre and you have nothing else to play, and you find this game for a few bucks (like I did), give it a shot, but you better know that this isn't one of the best point'n'click adventure games out there: the puzzles are boring and too easy - most of the gameplay will be spent traveling from city to city to speak to someone (couldn't she use a phone?). The story isn't very addictive either, but there's something about this game that give you a good feeling. The setting is perfect, the puzzles are useless. Too bad, it could have been a great game, but it isn't.			"

												Its an average game, the story doesn't really get engaging until towards the end.The puzzles are decent, the graphics are meh, but not atrocious.  The voice acting is done very well and makes up for any lack of polish the game may have.The main character seems a bit out of touch with reality in some cases.It would make a good stocking stuffer for anyone who enjoys point and click adventures.

												Good Point-and-Click Adventure game offering a classic experience with some quite challlenging mini-game puzzles. Playing as the legendary spy who was actually a dancer by profession means you will be doing some fliriting, object-combination and item fetching throughout. Mata's mission are varied and interesting, even though the actual story progression is happening at a decent pacing.Overall this one is a recommendable adventure game with some replayability as there are different endings to get, depending on three values (Wealth, Spycraft, Skills).

												I had to check it out since it's the first game of the studio who made the excellent Black Mirror II and III. Indeed, you can already see some helpful UI elements which show up in future games like teleporting to your destination by double-clicking, and the spacebar showing all hotspots.The game successfully brings you to the depicted time period, with decent visuals (except the awful dancing animations) and music. The game is fully voice acted and I found both the writing and the voice acting to be decent (checked out both English and French versions and ended up slightly preferring the French... this is set in Paris after all).I found one minigame pretty nifty: at some point you must find out which approach will work best to seduce some men, based one what you can guess about their personalities. This requires you to have listened properly to the dialogue earlier in the game.Beyond that however, everything falls apart. The story is boring (and not in the least historically accurate, but real-life Mata Hari was even more boring unfortunately), puzzles are trivial yet some involve pixel hunting if you don't use the space bar, getting around is a chore due to both the dialog UI being annoying and the traveling minigame being pointless (but eventually skippable), you get the drift.Do go play Black Mirror 2 and 3 though (optionally the first one, for background, it's from a different studio and annoying to play though). They're awesome and show how much this small studio learned in the interval. "

												Quite an interesting adventure game with some good art. The location design is colourful and vibrant, but still easy on the eye. The character details are pretty high as well, especially Mata's during the dancing routines. The story is quite intriguing, it shows Mata Hari as a brilliant dancer turned spy against her will -- fortunately, her womanly wiles and quick thinking help her overcome every obstacle. However, once you're a spy ""the only way out is death"" and so Mata is dragged into even more dangerous missions. Her determination to prevent a war is the only* thing that keeps her going.Gameplay is a simple point-and-click and goes quite smooth in the beginning. Tasks are easy and dialogues and cutscenes build up a great foundation to the tale of Mata Hari. Further in the tasks become more challenging, requiring some clever thinking and problem solving. Minigames also start to appear after the first mission to spice things up -- these range from a catch-me-not train ride through block-swapping puzzles to decoding encrypted messages. These are also easy to learn and simple to solve at first, but get more demanding as the game goes on. The dancing minigame deserves a special mention, it's what makes the game stand out. Mata Hari is a great dancer, and it is also up to the player to take care of this aspect of her life through finding inspiration for new dance moves and actually guiding her movements on stage. The minigame is a simple rhythm game where notes appear from 4 points on screen and have to be touched with the mouse cursor when they're in the centre of one of 4 circles. Sounds simple, initially is, but with each dance the number, speed, and variation of notes increases to match Mata's ever-better dance routines. Overall rather easy, requires about 5 hours for 100% clear for players well familiar with adventure games - newcomers may find some tasks difficult to work out. About the only downside is the crazy amount of travelling between locations in the second half of the game - nearly every step in solving a task takes place in a different city, and travelling between them (even using the safe trains) can be very repetitive and dull.

												Entry-level puzzle game littered with interesting pre-WW1 historical tidbits amidst interesting characters. Very repetitive backtracking towards the end and you may find yourself skipping the train minigame like I did. Just about all the puzzles in the game save for the last one are very easy and the seduction options are really only a matter of trial and error. Overall not bad but it could have been much better.

												Really interesting game. The small issue with the game not starting is easy to fix. After that I was a bit surprised by the gameplay. After I got used to the approach, the story really got me and I now would recommend this game. I may play it again because it seems there were more things I could have done, and must have missed. :D really nice, and I liked the details and the graphics, though maybe not everyone would.			"

												The game is an old-school point and click. You play Mata Hari, seductive, desired, curious and suspicious as she is meant to be. You will see the many sides of a sexual spy during a political, psychological and mysterious war. Although predictable, the story is a nice trip through history. The main issue with the game is repetitiveness. You have a huge amount of discussions, repetitive OST, repetitive puzzles, impossible dance mini game (another repetitive puzzle) and a bit too much of going between towns. The good side is, you can turn on the panic button for mini games, including the dancing one. It is barey possible to be successful at it on a computer without a touch screen.Do I recommend the game? Definitely, for the fans of quests with lots of speech and conversations. As a whole? Nope.*Sorry for the typos! "

												I give this a thumbs up because, as others have said, the story is interesting, the settings are good and the voice acting better however it is marred by the repetitive train travel, although the expresses help a lot here, a clunky interface requiring you to drop icons on characters to converse (!), action hot spots which are far too hard to find and the pretty terrible dance mini-game dynamics. I know I could replay and improve in some areas but the painful parts don't bear repeating, which is a shame. Steam achievements wouldn't go astray, either. It's still worth grabbing it when it's on sale if you have nothing better lined up, for it's good parts. Overall, 5/10 and a missed opportunity for something much better.			"

												To be concise, the game is just barely ok, where it could have easily been at least 'good'.Cons:* Puzzles are just very easy. No real challenge here.* !!Too much backtracking!! For a game that requires so much going back from one place to another, the very least the designers could have done, is to make it easy and fast. Instead, moving between locations takes ~50-60% of the gameplay time. Moving between countries is required a lot, and often, but everytime you must: go to the current-location --> taxi --> train station --> target country --> target location. So moving from A to B takes ~4-5 screens. Every. Time.Frustrating, annoying and tedious, it adds absolutely nothing positive to the gameplay. According to record it seems I played for 7.0 hours. I theorize that if traveling has been easy, I could have completed it in as much as 3!The story of Mata Hari had some great potential, but the performance is rather poor			"

												So-so p&c adventure. World famous spy from one hundred years ago mind-♥♥♥♥s and bangs dudes to manipulate them into giving up state secrets. There's way too much emphasis on lame mini-games involving traveling between train stations trying to elude other spies and they even found a way to make her burlesque show boring.  Thankfully, they can be skipped if you don't want to rack up points and just play the adventure part. I got it for $5 and took me a little over five hours to beat. This game is geared more toward the casual crowd. It's not horrible if you're desperate for a p&c adventure and you can get it on sale.			"

												Thumbs down was given based purely on the fact that the amount of thumbs up was slightly higher than the amount of thumbs down.Seriously, though, I do really feel neutral about this game.  The point and click part of it was pretty cool. There are some great secrets to find worth exploring for that you'll miss if you head straight to the objective every time.  It's based on the real life Mata Hari who was accused of being a spy purely on the fact that she used a lot of international trains and they found invisible ink in her room, with no other evidence.  Historians generally agree she wasn't actually a spy, but this game plays with the idea that she was.The thing I don't like is that you're forced to grind the stupid train and dancing minigames for imaginary points that do nothing except change the quality of the ending.  The train minigame in particular gets pretty hard and I don't have time to spend hours on the same stupid puzzle.If you're okay with that, or okay with getting kind of a poor ending, then go for it.  If these sorts of things are deal breakers for you, I suggest maybe looking at a different adventure game.			"

												I'm not sure why this game received such poor reviews - I found the game charming. The story is a bit bland, but the main character (a seductive spy-dancer who charms secrets out of men) is definitely interesting. I especially liked the optional secret objectives - they involve hidden items and additional puzzles, and solving them all changes the ending.Similarly, some people complain about the mini-games but these can be mostly skipped. They do reward you with a better ending if you do them though.			"

												This is most definetely the worst point and click game out there:) With all do respect, I have never played anything more boring. Everytime you have a dialogue, you must drag and drop an icon onto your interlocutor, which makes the discussion tiresome and cumbersome. The whole story is a hole story:) Don't buy it.

												Made in 2008, this game is still version 1.0.0 meaning it never had any updates is abandonware not working on modern computers.  Pulled out an old laptop from way back in 2008 and the game still had no cursor on screen making it impossible to select anything to even start the game.  Whats more fun than this game to burn your money?  Go to a store that sells Twilight Life Size standees, buy the one that you hate most, Team Jacob is a way of life so picked up the vampire Edward Cullen.  Then went to the park with friends and burned that wannabe vamp Edward Cullen, now THAT was fun.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

												I've played the game twice by now (once for myself, once for recording) and am almost kind of surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I don't usually play games all the way to the end if I'm not recording them (I hate boss fights and give up pretty fast if I don't get a puzzle), but this is one of the few games which I have actually played until the end on my own. I love the story, Mata Hari's character, the characters she meets and the environments. Sadly cannot say much for the audio since I do not pay as much attention to that as I should. There is a lot of travelling back and forth between scenes/places however, as others have pointed out. I personally have no problem with all the travelling back and forth throughout the game, though the mini-game for it (if you choose/have to play it) does become difficult quite fast. I also enjoyed the dancing mini-game, though that one might not be the easiest or smoothest in terms of game play.I personally recommend the game for what it is, especially since it's pretty low priced, but be prepared for a lot of back and forth travelling, and not always the best game play for mini games			"
