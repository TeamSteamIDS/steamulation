												Note: This review was written for ""The Secret World"", not ""Secret World Legends"".It's not a game for everyone. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. That depends on what makes a game good for you.It has quite some flaws. The UI is made with flash, runs badly and doesn't give you all the features you'd want. The shaders aren't very optimized. There are bugs. If you're used to have the whole story presented to you, you'll find the story slow and boring.So why would you like this game, like I do?If you're ready to spend some time in its world. And by that, I don't mean ""to play"", I mean ""to look around, read the lore, and let the immersion build around you"". This game doesn't do everything for you. It expects you to take a certain part in exploring it and make your own conclusions. If you're ready to take that part, by reading, researching, learning, and maybe continuing to think about it when not playing, you will get an immersive experience in a world filled with horror stories, spooky places, interesting people and secrets like few other games have. Sometimes, it's just more like reading a good book than playing a good game.In addition, the character development system is or is not going to make you happy. If you think that wow has what gets you there, you maybe won't become friends with tsw's system. It has no classes, almost no levels and wants you to rethink your whole build and gear every now and then.But that just fits to the whole concept of a story-rich world. Your character won't develop on a given line, you can, at any time, choose the next direction your character goes. This, and the fact that the look of your character is in no way connected to your play stlyle (or class, since there are none), gives you the possibilty to use your toon as a good roleplaying character. Something that Funcom supports in multiple ways, including places in the world that have no use for quests, but for roleplaying only.So when people tell you about the rich story, they don't mean your character's personal story that is told to you, they mean a world filled with lore, tiny details and story pieces that you can explore bit by bit in order to find out more about it.So yes, if you want a story directly thrown at you, an mmo with excellently balanced classes or a completely bugfree AAA experience, you probably won't like this game.But if you sometimes enjoy a good book, have an imagination that you can use, or like a progression system that sometimes takes roleplaying over balancing, you have found a gem here. One that allows you to immerse in an amazing, spooky world - if you are ready to take exploring the story into your own hands.			"

												As a player of this game for almost two years, I feel I should weigh in with a review for any new players looking at TSW as an MMO to jump into. While I highly recommend it, an MMO can be incredibly polarising, and TSW has it's share of polarising features both for better and worse.The game boasts a unique world, you literally will not find another game brimming with the story beats and character that this game has. It's in the environment, incidental dialogue and monsters you come across. It boasts an interesting story about 3 factions, and how each faction is working in their own ways to guard and prepare for the coming filth (and that which is already here). All the while playing off against each other because after all, they have their own agendas.The gameplay is fun an interesting, run and cast system so that you are usually always moving. The range of skills and weaponry means that you can cultivate a character to your whim and the unlimited level cap (none, in theory) means you can essentially have a character that can do whatever you'd like it to do. An area calls for you to be a bit tankier? Done. A dungeon requires you to fulfil a healer role? Done. This hammers home the end-game need to build specialised builds that are constantly trying to improve through either signets, augments, or raid tier upgrades (if that's your thing).If end game content isn't your thing, and you want to see the rich story through the Solomon Islands, to Egypt and then lastly Transylvania. You don't need to grind any end game gear at all. You can enjoy the story alone, or with friends and can decide at any point if you'd like to engage in a dungeon. Thankfully, the tier levelled dungeons means that there are different difficulty levels of each dungeon.The game has a number of well thought out systems that sound brilliant on paper, that sadly are implemented poorly. Which is to be expected of Funcom (Ever the dreamers, never the achievers). The party finder system usually leads to more confusion that it does active parties opting for the tried and true ""LFG"" posts in general chat.The development cycle is notoriously slow, as they are running on a small staff the updates or ""issues"" as they name them, usually take longer than anticipated. Originally, they had a 1 issue a month plan, after falling behind that on numerous occasions, they have abandoned that for a more vague ""when it's ready"". Usually coinciding with a ""State-of-the-game"" update from Joel Bylos (Game Director).The game recently has started to receive a huge boost in player base (no doubt the steam sales having a hand in this). New players I hadn't seen before are now reaching the end-game content, which always helps an MMO to remain fresh and current. The community is, for the most part; friendly, vibrant and willing to assist new players. Whether that's communicating answers for questions, or helping with dungeons so that you learn. Bare in mind though: Like most things, if you want to be carried through the game, expect more stick than carrot with players.Overall, I would suggest this game to players disenfranchised by your typical high fantasy setting we've come to expect from the MMO scene. It a fresh and deserved game in the MMO scene and one that is highly worth trying, who knows, you may just find yourself enjoying it just as much as the rest of us.			"

												Two things I barely ever do: 1.) Play M.M.O. R.P.G.'s.2.) Write reviews on steam.This game has forced me to try both :D. Let's start with pros/cons.----PROS:Storyline-Vast universe filled with dozens of worlds, and thousands of replayable quests.-Constent flow of new players, that way no one world feels too desolate/over-populated. -Quests. Are.. EVERYWHERE. Everything from a NPC's handing them out at your local city to stumbling across a corpse with a treasure-map in the middle of the road. Very non-linear.-H.P. Lovecraft approved, atleast fan-approved :D (To see Kingsmouth in-game made my day)-Bits of scattered ""lore"" throughout the game clue you in about the history of certain landmarks and events that happen through-out The Secret World.-Has a LOT of pop-culture refrences. Eveything for popular movies to new video-games.-Cutscenes actually put your custom character into them!!! Badass. Real badass, bro.-There are plenty of cutscenes compared to MMOs like Guild Wars or World of Warcraft.Gameplay-You can either play the classic mouse-clicking way, or switch to over-the-shoulder 3rd-person aiming-view, OOOOOR zoom your camera all the way in and play in makeshift 1st-person :D.-Doesn't feel like any other RPG out there. Very fast-paced, doesn't have that 'grinding' feel.-Gameplay feels like a upgraded MMO version of ""Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines"".-Not typical lvling system. In fact, no ""levels"" what-so-ever, mearly distribution of skill points.-Hack-and-slash, killing hoards of monsters hasn't been this fun since Diablo.-Creatures vary from location to location, this game doesn't just color a creature a different color and make him harder, it's like they went through the entire Necronomicon in this game. -Great crafting system, strongest weapons/armor/items are crafted.-Great character customization, seemingly unlimited choices.-Playable alone if the servers ever die. (You'll have to be a high lvl to take on some missions.)-Not completely abandoned by devs.Funcom Points -NOT pay2win, not much stuff to buy with REAL money that you can't get in-game for free.-If for some reason you're lookin' to spend cash, they've got some great vanity stuff -If you want the vanity stuff, but don't have cash, there are promotions that might help.. ;)-If cash is not a issue for you, then take solace in knowing their prices are really cheap c:Performance-While the game IS old, the graphics are pretty decent, and are still being patched.-I has a: Radeon R9 280x GPU. And it runs like warm butter on ultra settings.Misc-Cool cartoony colors.-Friendly community.----CONS:Storyline-Sometimes you get a quest that is impossible to beat alone or at your current level (despite the quest claiming to be ""normal"" difficulty), bit of a buzz kill when you make it half-way then figure that out the hard way... by dying brutally and seriously out level'd :P.-Compared to other MMO games, it doesn't have as many active players as other titles.Gamplay-PVP seriously unbalanced. Like... whacky unbalanced......I would spend atleast 50 hours playing co-op or alone before ever stepping in the PVP zones. (I've got 40 hours under my belt and still haven't even reached the PVP zones lol. Big game.)-Steep-ish learning curve. (Steep because so different from other games.)-Combat animation with some low-rank weapons can be repetative.-Defualt short-cut and keyboard layout can feel a bit cluncky.-Each issue past 8 is expensive... I reached Tokyo and now I need 29.99 to keep playing :/Funcom Points-They should have made their item market on steam. Would have been much easier transaction-wise. Then again, who can blaim them for not wanting to cut steam in? -The Item shop doesn't have good descriptions on some things. They don't mention stuff like: Uniforms don't show stuff like necklaces or gloves, est. Or anything labeled ""effects"" is used to the London Theatrics Company, yet that info is no-where to be found.Performance-40+ GB download.-This game will eat all your free time up. YUMYUMYUMYUM..... gone. XD (This may be a pro.)Misc-No steam achievements? But it has it owe achievements -_-...-At times, the voice acting can be a little corny :P....ONLY AT TIMES! And It fades away with the awesome story.-OVERALL FIRST IMPRESSION:The storyline strokes your ego enough to make you feel individually important in a world with so many players, while at the same moment stressing the importance of teamwork, breaking the ice for interactions between new-comers and vets.Even though you can do the lone-wolf thing and beat the majority of missions alone, it's easier and more fun putting a group together to quest with, even if it's a random passer-by who just happens to be on the same page as you. Many vet players are kind enough to let you tag along on quests if they've got a free space, and you'll always find someone willing to help you whether it be directions, healing, or back-up. -LONG TERM IMPRESSIONWill update the more I play, but in all honesty, not seeing much negative aspects. So, if you're torn between the fence, buy in confidence, tis' a great game :D.P.S. To all new players! Don't forget to renew the free stuff they give you at thesecretworld.com, and check out the promotions they do such as; finish 30 missions get 1200 funcom points free.Recommended Guides for Starters.-http://www.tswdb.com/miscellaneous/the-secret-world-beginner-guide/-http://yokaiblog.wikidot.com/guides:craft-patterns#toc23 "

												When you play this MMO, as you most assuredly should do, it will serve you to remember it is not World of Warcraft. It is not Rift, or Champions Online, neither Age of Conan, nor Star Wars: The Old Republic. It is not for end-gamers or raiders, grinders or power-levelers, PVPers or dungeon runners.Rather, it is The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, Broken Sword and Syberia, Gabriel Knight and I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. It is for seekers and journeymen, detectives and discoverers; it is for explorers, and it is for adventurers.So is The Secret World a game you will enjoy? Familiar MMORPG trappings are apparent; there are definite systems and mechanics at play that one could use to thusly label this game, but close examination quickly reveals this style of MMO is not one that will appeal to a mass market.Beyond the limited character customisation options, the somewhat hasty justification of your avatar’s situation and subsequent induction to their chosen faction, lies an entire parallel universe to be explored. The scene set is present day, with the twist that here in The Secret World, all conspiracies, myths, and legends are true.The Secret World delivers a definite sensation that there is nothing here that does not exist through explicit design, be it the name of a town or the colour of the flowers planted in someone’s front yard. It feels as though every constituent is grounded and has a weighty history attached, as though understanding the lore is but an Internet-search away.The mission structure is unlike any you will have encountered before. There are several types of mission, and a small limit on the number of each that can be active at any time. The translation of this is that one cannot race wantonly through hub areas, collecting missions with abandon, to turn-in simultaneously for experience rewards broaching hedonistic quantities.Neither can missions be discarded once acquired, and though it is possible to pause them to resume later, it’s not an efficient method of churning through content. Of course Funcom doesn’t actually want you to be churning at all, but to be instead involved in your actions, and to see missions through their multiple tiers and increasing difficulties to their satisfying conclusions.Some missions require a rethink of your entire MMO approach to date, and this time I can provide an example. An escort mission of sorts mandated the continued living status of my accompanying NPC. After failing twice, I resolved to level a bit and come back later, until I remembered there are, in fact, no levels.Experience does still accumulate, but its effect is to unlock more skills and abilities. True, some of these are more powerful, but it doesn’t have the same impact as levelling in other games.Tactical skill-based combat is what's important.The skill wheel takes a while to get your head around, but basically you can choose from melee weapons (sword, hammers, and fists), firearms (pistol, shotgun, and assault rifles) and magic (chaos, blood, and elemental). Each skill has subsequent layers to unlock. You are not tied to any one skill; in fact, you can effectively have two skill ""trees"" selected at one time - a Blood Mage wielding a Shotgun, for instance. You can go heavy on one skill and unlock deeper and more complex skills or you can choose to pick a scattering of each.Visual information in The Secret World is more important than it would be in other MMOs. Clues for quests are scattered about everywhere. Being able to read your environment, not just your powers bar, is a skill to be mastered in this game.Beyond the informational side of things, the general art style and attention to detail just completely suck you in.  Sweeping vistas are easy to find if you go high enough, but it's on the ground that you feel the setting.  Mist-shrouded woods, caves illuminated by phosphorescent mushrooms or the occasional lantern, burning deserts, and seashores all have a heft to them visually, even when they're overrun by nightmarish creatures that by turns are fascinating and repulsive at the same time.As with the visual, so with the audio. Sound cues are always important, particularly if you've drawn aggro from a mob, but it's the use of sound in quests and puzzles that make it a step above the norm for MMOs.  Finding the signal in static, the right tones to unlock a door, even tracing a siren's song back to its origin point, there's all manner of clever uses for sound in this game and some of them will get you killed in short order if you're not on the bounce. Equally impressive is the voice acting in the game. The storyline and main quests all have voice-overs for their introductions.There are a couple things I didn’t get into, such as the dungeons, but I never had the chance to go through a multi-person dungeon.However, I did hit a few single player dungeons and they weren’t all that bad solo.It's a blast to see an massively multiplayer online (MMO) role-playing game that doesn't go straight for the high heroic fantasy genre. Funcom has done an excellent job creating a world that is both relatable and mysterious for players to explore. The Secret World delivers an MMO experience that's distinctly different from its competitors, and it's likely going to remain the standard for future games in the horror/supernatural genre.			"

												This post is far too long. I'm very sorry. But I can't keep it short when I'm talking about something I like. And this game I do like definitly. First off: Almost all the negative review statements I read concerning this game are true. Period. This Game is insofar as it concerns the UI, graphical glitches, the inherent logic of development systematics you need to know to advance your character correctly or the combat mechanic in general highly unpolished.It falls very often short in giving you a wholehearted experience of a well thought out contemporary horror story. It is quite cheesy actually. Sometimes it's cheesy, sometimes just boring. Sometimes so confusing and overcomplex that you may sigh and just leave it alone.What are all the different stats for? I mean really for. As an advancing player I read through the forums. I do what veterans say is the best option but I just don't understand the mechanical processes of numbergenerating during combat until now. On the surface the stats are not only overly complicated but behind this not so complicated scenery lies no truely understandable mechanism which would show up after a few hours and let's you fine tune your characterbuild. At least I never got a comprehensive insight in the numerical processes which lead to the different combat outcomes.But: I'm not really into MMO's. Perhaps players who are used to this genre have a much better Intuition for the Interaction of stats in the Secret World. I can't judge this game in terms of being a good or not so good MMO.Because this is the only one I play. And I play it a lot.And I will tell you why:Two main reasons exist for me that make this game standout between a whole bunch of games I played in the last years and MMO's I tried to get into.The first one:A sometimes just amazingly cool feel ambiancewise. I said that the quests often are cheesy. Cheesy like some bad horrorstorypaperback from the trainstation's bookshop. Or sometimes worse actually.But on some ocassions I was really immersed in the dark, a bit - not disturbing - but confusing tone of the narrative which unfold. I could name a few quests I play over and over again. And I am absolutely not bored by playing them again. Somme MMO-Player's could say I am grinding... but if I'm grinding I can't say it feels like grinding. I'm looking forward to the nice cutscene I know to start after this boss battle, the beautifully arranged scenery of the abandoned Fair, or the appearance of a not so cliché character.The fascinating, gritty or disturbing atmosphere this games sometimes - only on rare ocassions - is able to create reminds me of the self forgetting process of reading contemporary psychoanalytical writings.Mark my words: It's definitely not the same, it shares only some strange layer of significance which is hidden behind the structure of the narrative form.There are few games in which I find such a thing. But the ending of the vanishing of Tyler Freeborn quest is such a moment. I'm not quite sure what's it all about, but it's coherent feel makes it worth my time.After I found this feeling in some quests even the shadow of this structural phenomenon reminds me of the cool moments I had in some other quests and makes the less well thought out and arranged levels of this game worthwhile for me.Second one:The Dungeons.I read in one review that this games dungeons have some classic feel to it. Like the old WoW Dungeons.I cannot say if this is true for I never played WoW. But I must admit that after I did my first (very newby stupid and surely - for my patrners - annoying) dungeon run I finally understood what this MMO stuff is all about. The groups which I was joining in this first period of getting known to playing an online game with foreign persons was such a remarkably stressful, chaotic and foremost optimistic experience for me that I instantly got hooked of playing a healer. These persons with which I was running - absolutely unexperienced in building and manouevering the quite responsible position of a healer - were just great, respect- and helpful individuals. I had the feeling they were about my age. Didn't take my constant failing too personally. Let me practice my skills and even gave me helpful advice and comments on how to become a better part of the TSW community. I liked this a lot.And I like it today. Everytime I play this game I look forward to doing a few dungeons with nice and relaxed people from all over the globe, and enjoying a few of my favorit quests. That's just a really good way for me to sometimes relax after work. I like this game and I hope you will like it too and I'm really sorry that I couldn't help and wrote such an enormous blah-blah post but it seems as if it had to be said.Thx for reading.			"

												UPDATE: I would Recommend getting Ultimate Edition from the store, which is significantly cheaper for the amount of DLC included. The DLC is just as great if not better than the main game.  I have also updated my Tips.Don't buy this game IF:Your gaming computer is more than a few years oldYou don't have over 40GB to spare for a single gameYou dislike MMOs that stray a bit far from World of Warcraft's now standardized blueprintYou prefer a more traditional fantasy setting (or to a lesser extent sci-fi) settingYou hate not having access to all of your skills simultaneouslyYou hate the idea of an MMO that doesn't constantly require player cooperationYou hate sitting through cutscenesYou love open world PvPDo buy this game IF: You want an MMO with a genuinely unique settingYou want an MMO with a wide variety of gameplay in its missionsYou want a deep skill building system (think closer to Guild Wars 1)You love to dive into the lore and backstory of a gameYou want an MMO with a cohesive, well-executed storylineYou want a solo-friendly MMOYou want a game that doesn't pressure you to play itYou don't want to pay a subscription feeBeginner TipsChoose a pair of weapons early and stick to it, preferably working towards a faction specific deckWhen talking to characters, keep clicking on a dialogue selection until it has a green checkmarkKeep an eye on the mission difficulty; you will want to avoid things marked Very Hard or DevastatingDon't pick fights with mobs in Lair areas by yourself, they are meant for experienced groups to tackleUPDATE:  Use the Group Finder (Shift+C) to help find people to do dungeons withUPDATE:  The custom chat communities Sanctuary and Noobmares can be helpful for learning the game and finding people to do group content with (use /chat join <channel> to join)UPDATE: Join the Event custom chat to keep an eye out for people starting world bosses and also holiday events.  ConclusionLooking for a game that would properly scratch the same itch that GW1 did (but its sequel did not), I took a chance on this game when it was on sale, and am glad that I did.  This is a game that shows a great deal of thoughtfulness, even if it was overshadowed by the three big MMOs that came out the same year.  If this is a game that sounds at all like something you would like to try, take the chance.			"

												I am going try to avoid saying what has already been said about the game and just share my experience.  Currently, I am undecided on whether I love the game or hate it.  There is so much potential and so many problems.  If the price is right for you, do try the game.  I suggest holding back on purchasing DLC (issues) and spending real-world money in the store until you have played in Transylvania and complete at least 10 matches in the PvP mini games.  If you still enjoy the game at the end of Transylvania then you will likely continue to enjoy it.On live chat, most players are polite and helpful.  Be aware, however, that The Secret World game can be very stressful and frustrating: even nice players are going to rant and rage on occasion.  There is a filter to keep the bad words at bay if one chooses.  A few nice words to someone having a bad day might help them feel less nasty.Simple graphic issues:  The recommended System Requirements are not set high enough.  One can play the game while meeting the requirements but there will be system lag that will make some missions difficult to complete.  Platforming within missions can challenge low graphic systems.  The graphics are beautifully done but they are demanding.Nearly all the missions, story missions, and side missions are good.  If you get stuck there is usually someone on the live chat that will help you out.  The greatest issue I discovered with missions is that some involve platforming or jumping from object to object.  This can be a problem if one has system lag or just isn’t good at jumping.  Sabotage missions have a greater instance of platforming and also involve jumping over traps.  The investigative missions have issues of their own if you want to just play a game.  There is an in-game browser for a reason.  One could spend hours researching for answers to puzzles on the internet rather than just playing the game.  (This can be resolved by asking for help or researching walkthroughs for the answers.)  The lock-out time for missions in Transylvania is about 60 hours, which leaves a player looking for something to do until the missions are cooled down.  There are issues (DLC) to keep end-gamers busy for a time.Issues 1 – 4 are included in the purchase.Issue 5 is a mystery story, someone went suspiciously missing.  Issue 6 is an adventure story, like Indiana Jones movies in a fashion.Issue 7 is a horror story where children are the victims.  This is not for everyone.Issue 8 is a grind…no real story.  In this issue one gains Augments that improves abilities. (AP costs are very high)Issue 9 is a back to where it all started story.  The AEGIS system is introduced and a story of chaos in Tokyo has begun. PvP has a few issues that make it difficult to enjoy every time.  There will be lag even on the best of hardware.  Sometimes the lag is show-stopping; sometimes it is more like an unexpected hiccough.  Sometimes the teams are not full; a faction can start with only one or two players rather than the total allowed.  If your faction does not have a full team at the start, winning a match is more difficult.  The PvP mini-games are often unbalanced: a team of high-end players can be matched against teams of new/lower level players.  There is an issue where players stand AFK in a match and don’t fight at all.  If you are a tolerant, even-tempered soul, PvP is still playable as even the losing team is rewarded for playing.  Funcom is working to resolve the issues in PvP but we might have to be tolerant for a time before it materializes.  Maybe a very long time.The concept of playing the way you want to play falls into the dirt on the second map (Egypt) and dies on the third map (Transylvania).  Some missions and dungeons, if you do not have the right build, cannot be completed.  Away from the dungeons and PvP, one can play with whatever build suits them in most PvE missions.  Even though most days I find something to dislike, I recommend trying this game.  Just hold back on spending too much real-world money until you get more past Egypt.			"

												Hands down THE most unique MMO on the market.  Once out of the starter area, the game grabs you and takes you on a wild ride thru the mysterious ""Secret World"".  With a terrifying atmosphere, this game pushes your brain to the limits with the quests and offers different ways to complete them.  (ie. Hacking computers, searching for solutions on the Internet, etc.)  With no levels to worry about and access to every facet of the power system to create your own playstyle, The Secret World offers a gaming experience that truely breaks the traditional mold.

												If Morrowind and WoW had a baby, and then if an Epic Lovecraftian horror story had a baby with conspiracy theory, and then those two babies met and banged and shot out a Horror MMO with amazing playability, that would be this game. Simply put, it's brilliant. I'm disappointed that it took so long for me to get it.  The only thing that could possibly be better are the controls on a keyboard, other than that every single part is so NOT anything you would get in any other MMO. The Community is GREAT! There's always some one willing to help you out, and the population seems steady and dedicated. You'll either love it or hate it, but you'll FEEL something and that's always great! Either way you can get a 72 hour trial to try this game out, if you go and ask anyone in the discussion board. Then you can decide if you really like it, and that's pretty cool!			"

												there should be a complete edition soon including everything up to issue 15 - its already avail on Funcom site-not yet  on steam howeveri wouldnt recommend vanlla at this point unless one only wants to solo main quest -- which is several hundred hours btw. it lacks most of the current endgame,and upgrading  is not a cost effective option, so most end up rebuying the big version after a while.all in all game surely has some issues but overall content is huge and of great quality.I could easily say its one of  the best RPGs ever made.I won't go into a detailed review.I think the game is at least good enough to give the 10 day trial a go and shape your own opinion about TSW---see forums how to get it.Only thing i ll say about tsw content,is that before buying I was very sceptical about the setting - i mean illuminati, templars, starsigns and mumbo jumbo....seriously? not my cup of tea.But after playing, i realized the fact that TSW doesnt take that stuff  entirely seriously either and actually it balances satire with seriousness really really well.Anyway long story short and after playing for a while, I can now safely say its  my favorite RPG setting by far and away.

												Ate a bee. Became magical. Said ""screw magic."" Grabbed a shotgun. Went to hell. Got a hell shotgun. Found a boss, thought I killed it. Found out I didn't. It killed me. Turned into a ghost, and discovered a couple secrets. Fought octo-nipples. Fought Chtulu. Died fighting Chtulu. A lot. Fought my mother in law. Fought your mother in law. Got tired of my shotgun, and tried magic. Learned how to shoot fireballs. Become a fire weilding maniac. As a DPS, tanked through a dungeon. Got loot. Broke it, and made better loot. Got cussed out by some old Seoul lady. Spit on a Templar. Went to hell. (Again.) Found out the Illuminati is super powerful because it has a robot that learns from the internet. Had all powerful being ask for a high five, before realizing it had no hands, and then threatened to kill me like a 12 year playing COD. And I haven't even gotten to the good parts.			"

												It's the only MMO I've ever played, so I can't speak to its mechanics in comparison to genre standards. But, it's also the only MMO I've ever wanted to play. I'm mostly a solitary single-player game type of girl and TSW is real good for that.			"

												The Secret World so far has been an amazing immersive experiance, As you may have seen in other reviews this MMORPG isnt about combat or becoming the strongest character you can be. The games best features come from storytelling and immersion in a dark twisted modern-day world while letting the player go at their own pace and play how they want to.Combat: The combat itself is pretty generic tab-target, but using cone attacks (aka shotgun blasts) free this up a bit and make it more about kiting and dodging.Levelling/skills: As advertised the game has no character levels or class restrictions but you can only have up to 7 active and 7 passive skills set at any one time, aswell as a max of 2 weapons.Questing/Missions: The game only lets you hold up to 6 missions at any one given time, 1 story mission, 1 dungeon mission, 1 main mission and 3 side missions but these arent the old ""go kill x monster or gather x thing"" quests which take under a minute to accomplish, Every quest be it side quest, story or main mission i've picked up and finished has provied pieces of information towards the events happening in the area, making everything alot more immersive and larger in scale. (Note:  Investigation missions are quite tricky puzzle solvers that will make you pull your hair out trying to complete!)Storytelling: As stated above this game is more focused on immersion and storytelling, but how good of a job does it do? Overall the voice acting from each new npc character you meet is extreemly well done and sets the mood, Quite like watching a dramatic horror/thriller film, This also adds depth to the areas you explore and try to pass through bit by bit.Overall: If you're looking for a game thats big on action, easy questing, quick levelling or combat focused this game wont be for you, If however you want a game that racks your brain, makes you think, pulls you into its world and does a damn good job at keeping you there, Then i'd suggest picking up The Secret World.

												When we hear the term ‘MMORPG’ we tend to think of Elves, Dragons, and grinding out levels. The Secret World seeks to subvert this trend by not being set in a high fantasy world and doing away with levels, skill trees and the class system entirely. Set in the present day and in this universe, The Secret World has players assume the role of a regular person who has been granted fantastic abilities, and uses them to do battle against dark forces on behalf of The Illuminati, The Templar or the mysterious and chaotic Dragon.The biggest thing that sets The Secret World apart from other MMOs is its setting. Events take place in our present day world, and reference real world culture. For instance, the Templar make a point of telling the player that they are nothing like what one might see in a Dan Brown novel. Early locations pay homage to the likes of HP Lovecraft and Stephen King, and mission-giving NPCs feel like they’ve stepped out of film and literature as they go off on their pre-quest monologues. Enemies are taken from myth and legend, and include the likes of Draugh, Wendigo, Zombies, Vampires, Demons and The Bogeyman. I’ve even seen a tribe of Sasquatch.Zones are large and varied. In the early stages of the game, players explore haunted carnivals, sleepy towns plagued by the undead, occult institutions, and forests inhabited by vicious beasts. I’ve been putting many hours into the game since I got it, and still haven’t left the early zones as there is plenty to do in each of the game’s large, open areas.Most of the time, like in other MMOs, I’m doing missions for NPCs. Upon accepting a mission, the player is treated to a cutscene where the quest-giver tells you (sometimes in a rambling, roundabout way) what they need done. I really like these cutscenes. Despite the player’s character not having any dialogue, the quest-giver monologues are entertaining, as the NPCs have a lot of character and the voice talent has done a good job of bringing them to life.While still maintaining the “Kill 10 X” style of quest, The Secret World expands on the formula by introducing a couple of new quest types. Investigation missions are probably the most enjoyable of these new types, as they deviate most from the standard MMO fare. In investigations, players have to employ detective skills, along with logic, problem solving, and perhaps a little research (made easier by the games handy built in web browser) to uncover clues that lead to other clues, that eventually lead to uncovering some important knowledge. Some of the investigations are absolutely devilish, requiring a substantial degree of effort on the part of the player. One such mission presents the player with a message encrypted in Morse Code. To advance to the next stage of the investigation, the player must decipher the coded message (or give in to temptation and google up a guide using the games handy built in web browser). Investigations may also task players with cracking a computer password or following a series of cryptic clues in a treasure hunt across the zone. The investigation missions are a lot of fun, provided you’re the kind of person who is into cracking clues and codes, otherwise they can just be infuriating and force the player to follow a walkthrough to get it over with.The other main type of mission introduced in The Secret World is Sabotage. These involve sneaking into an area, avoiding laser tripwires, security cameras and enemies who are capable of quickly dismembering the player if their attention is accidentally attracted. Sabotage quests are not as common as investigations or “Kill X” quests, possibly because they can be a little repetitive. Most Sabotage missions require the player to navigate an area where the price for failure is almost instant death.This wouldn’t be a problem, but at times, jumping over a low tripwire is complicated by sloppy jumping mechanics, often ending in something exploding and severely damaging your character, if not killing it outright and forcing you to attempt the section again.Another interesting aspect of The Secret World is the way in which it does away with the traditional class and levelling systems that appear in other MMOs. The Secret World employs a system that allows the player to create their own class, or ‘deck’ as it is called, by equipping two weapons, and up to seven active and seven passive abilities. Decks are built by spending a combination of Action Points (AP) and Skill Points (SP), which are gained through accumulation of experience. Abilities are split into categories based on the weapon a character a character needs to use them. Currently, the weapons available consist of Swords, Hammers, Fists, Blood Magic, Elementalism, Chaos Magic, Pistols, Shotguns, and Assault Rifles.If one were to play the game for long enough, one could obtain all the available abilities, as there is no limit to the amount of experience a character can accrue. For this reason there is no way to refund spent Ability Points, nor does there need to be.If someone was to do what I did, and create a character build they weren’t happy with, remedying the situation simply requires picking up a new weapon and buying some new abilities to go along with it. I was genuinely surprised with how easy it was to alter the developmental direction of my character. I just stopped, equipped a hammer I had lying about, used my spare AP and SP to grab some abilities and weapon skill, and off I went.The limitations imposed on the number of abilities a character can equip may be jarring to MMO veterans who are used to loading up their half a dozen action bars with dozens of abilities. I too felt somewhat strategically hindered at first. Eventually I came to see the restrictions as a deeper level of character customisation, intended to force the player to design their deck of abilities around the situation at hand. There’s still times where I really, really want an eighth ability slot, just so I can squeeze in one more attack or passive ability, but I’ve come to appreciate the strategy behind customising my build within the constraints of the system.Combat is probably where The Secret World is closest to other MMOs. The player still has an ability bar, and the abilities on that bar still have cooldowns. Resources like mana have been done away with however, and each of the two weapons a player is carrying uses its own resource pool. During combat, players use abilities to build weapon resources, then spend those resources to unleash their more powerful abilities, then resources are built up again and the cycle continues. The Secret World seeks to break up the repetition of combat by letting the player perform a dodge roll, which allows the character to get out of the way of incoming area of effect attacks some enemy types like to use.Engaging enemies must be done with some degree of strategy, as for each unintended enemy entering combat, the player’s chances of survival decrease quite a bit. The enemies that inhabit the outside environments tend to boast roughly the same, if not a larger, amount of health as the player and are capable of taking a bit of punishment, so engaging with too many enemies at once is not in the players best interests. There is no PVP, as each faction has called a truce in order to fight the dark forces.No MMO is without bugs, and The Secret World is no exception to this. During my time with the game, I have encountered a few bugged quests, and have even fallen through the world on one occasion. The GMs were amazingly helpful with the bugged quests, rectifying the situation within 15 minutes of me sending off a petition. Other than these isolated incidents, my time in The Secret World has been essentially bug free.AbstractStory 9Gameplay 9Graphics 9.5Sound 9.5Replayability 9Controls 9Overall Score9.25/10			"

												I've been playing MMOs since everquest in 1999, and MUDs on BBSs before that.  I've beta tested and played more MMOs then I can count without sitting down and taking the time to think about it, but at least a few dozen.  So take it as a massive compliment for TSW when I tell you that this game has some of the greatest features in any MMO I've ever played.  Is TSW a perfect game?  No, the game play can get a little rough at times, and the character builder feels quite flat.  But it has by far the best story of any MMO I've ever played, rivaling many triple A solo games stories.  The atmosphere of modern horror is perfect without resorting to cheap scares, but instead weaving a tale of Lovecraftian horror and survival, all with the backdrop of major political forces moving in the background.  The 'leveling' system is by far one of the best and most original that I've ever seen in an MMO, eschewing traditional 'levels' and 'classes' in favor of a more free form system of upgrading skills and items to build a unique character.  In addition this is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, and by far the best looking MMO of anything I've ever seen.  Top all of this off with the fact that you buy the game once and play it for free, no subscription fee, and this game is a no brainer.I'd reccomend springing for the ultimate edition for the extra few bucks, you'll get a TON more content, and odds are once you start playing, you'll fall in love with it the same way I did.

												So, this game is good, its really good. I have never played a MMO before where such care has been taken into the writing of the game, all quests are fully dialoged and cut sceaned and this greatly helps with immersion and makes you actually start to care about the world around you. The quests range from your standard MMO grind collect fest to some of the MOST FUN and CHALLANGING puzzle quests i have played. EVER, Yes in any game. These ""Investigation"" quests will have you searching google, wiki pages, local town info boards, forums, and sometimes real world peripherals. It requires some extreame thinking outside the box. THERE AMAZING more games should do things like this.The combat is ok, you have the choice between tab targetting and action targetting, the real fun comes in the form of the combat wheel where you will use points to purchase abilitys and passives to experiment with endless possible builds. There is no lvling in the secret world, instead you upgrade weapons and gear which is either dropped by mobs or crafted, the crafting is very simaliar to minecraft where you make the item shape to produse the gear you want.The atmosphere in this game is incredible, alot of this has to do with some really nice art and sound design, It trully makes you feel alone in this game, Only seeing a fellow person on occasion going about there business really adds to the helplesness that this world has fallen into.This isnt your standard MMO. You wont find hundreds of players rushing from mob to mob with there flashy mounts, What you will find tho is a amazing story and some really intresting quests that i have never seen done before, So if youre looking for something a little bit different, You owe it to yourself to TRY this game!

												90% of people who like MMORPGs shouldnt play this game. For the rest of us, this is the best MMORPG on the market, hands down, no questions, end of story. Would you like an MMO to have a serious story and real, actually challenging missions that don't constantly mean you have to ""kill X of Y"" or ""collect X of Z""? Then you play this. In this game, you actually solve real problems. It is above and beyond what MMORPG means to me. It's like a single player adventure/rpg with multiplayer elements strongly included. My only complaint is the store is filled with ludicrously priced items. They aren't neccessary, but after already paying for the game itself, the prices are outrageous.			"

												Played nearly 200 hours, don't think I've been in an actual party the entire time. That said, this is easily the best MMO on Steam if you're interested in a solo experience. I'm a huge fan of the insane build flexibility the game allows, as well. There are no set classes. Instead you pick two weapons and grab skills as you see fit, with the ability to switch at basically any time. You can also grab passives from weapons you don't even use to make your build better. The quest system is also a little different. You can only have 5 quests at a time: the main story quest, which will tell the overarching story in the long term as you traverse the different zones; a normal quest, which will usually have voice acted cutscenes and multiple stages to go through; and up to three side quests, which are more like the shorter quests you're used to from other MMOs.  It sounds odd, but it works very well with the way the game world is set up, with normal quests leading you to sidequests which lead you to new areas, etc. There are also investigation quests which give you very little to go on, often requiring you to solve puzzles or research outside of the game in order to progress.Highly recommended.

												Funny that I've been playing this game for a long time now, and I'm only now getting around to write the review. But, well, I've been distracted. By this game.The Secret World is an MMORPG set in modern times. Your character awakens with magic powers in a world where all of the conspiracy theories are true, and you're quickly recruited into one of the ancient secret societies. They send you to several supernatural hotspots arouns the world in order to protect your society's interests and stop the impending end of days.You get to channel your magic through two different weapons, and you have three guns, three magic focuses, and three melee weapons to choose from (not to mention auxiliary weapons you'll find later on, such as the Rocket Launcher or Whip). Most of the chocies are viable for a player simply looking to do damage. If you want to tank or heal, you'll need to include one of the ""tank weapons"" or ""healer weapons"".I enjoy playing this genre of game, but I could never get into World of Warcraft or its many clones. This game really is something special. The first reason is that the story and mission dialogue is not only worth reading, but it's compelling at times. Some of the characters really are very lovable, and there are some really fun mysteries to unravel. The second reason is that the quest structure is really good. Sure, there are a few ""kill 10 wolves"" quests, but there's also an ""unlock the Illuminati vault by solving a riddle"" quest, and a ""sneak around the laser system"" quest. Each quest really felt like I was doing something meaningful. The third is that, in this game, you're never locked out of certain paths. You spend points to upgrade certain weapons or get new weapon skills, but you can always level up other weapons in the future in case you want to fill a different role.I should also clear up one thing about this game: no subscription. You pay once, and you get access to the vast majority of the game's content. You can choose to pay a little more for content packs... most of them are worth spending some money on.I got this on sale, and it's some fo the best money I've ever spent on Steam. If you enjoy playing MMOs, then this game is absolutely worth trying. If not, it's probably worth trying anyway.			"

												This game comes highly recommended by yours-truly. If you're into MMO's, then this game has it all. Modern RPG-style MMO where you play the role of one of the 3 secret societies across the world - the Illuminati is an example of one.The cutscenes are worth watching.Every piece of literature is worth reading. Every NPC is worth talking to.The puzzles are VERY HARD to the point the game includes a built-in browser so you can Google up a walk-through. For example; some missions have you looking up old books on Amazon and decyphering a code from the ISBN. The voice-acting is hit-or-miss. Some of the actors are very recognizable (Tim Russ!) with outstanding delivery, inside jokes, actor allusions and Memes everywhere!Hundreds of class combinations that you can switch on-the-fly. You're not limited to anything. What weapon combinations you want to use, your skills; all of them become open to you and you can mix/match whatever you like to create your own unique build that works for you. There is no one true build for any particular role.The maps are huge without any big chunks of nothing in between. There's something to find everywhere. A good chunk of the game is solo, but the best loot is found in the multi-player dungeons.No level system. Your gear is your level and you decide what your character is best at first, then branch out from there.PVP is available and successful PVP ventures unlock buffs for everyone in the region! Keep at it, because it's not something that locks in for a week. One minute your secret society may control everything and it can be taken away the next!There's something for everyone in The Secret World, so pick up a copy and join Onyx Gaming on the Arcaida Server!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I just read a post from someone named Zakennayo and I got a little angry and came back here to revise my review because I didn't want my rant to get buried.  People need hear this.Some people have played WoW for SO LONG it's forever colored their perspective of MMO's.  World of Warcraft revolutionized the MMORP gaming genre back when all they had to compete with was Everquest and Ultima Online.  Now WoW is boring, dated and severely lacking in concepts and when anyone from WoW sees an MMO they instantly try to compare it to WoW and only disappoint themselves.You'll never recapture the magic of the early days of that game and I don't know why these 30-somethings still try.  Just like Call of War 9: Modern Duty Ops 4 will never recapture the magic of Quake or the first Halo.The genre won't change until technology changes and technology may seem like it's leaping forward with every new iPhone # or Samsung Galaxy #, but it's not.  This year, the phone has 3.5Gigs of Ram instead of 3 and can both make AND receive calls for $200 more than the previous generation!  We also shrunk the chassis (or made it bigger) and made the screen bigger (or made it smaller).We're doing the same with video games because we've actually hit a technological ceiling.  It's not that we CAN'T go further, it's just we've limited ourselves with artificial barriers like ""currency"" and ""political correctness"".  It's either too expensive or too offensive.To add onto that.  Does anyone even remember what video games like Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros. cost back in 1985?  I do.  The original NES sold in the US for $299 and Legend of Zelda was $59.95.  Legend of Zelda was scripted, coded, compiled, packaged and ready for release in 3 months and cost approximately $5000 to produce.  The latest console is around $399 and games are STILL $59.95 with the most expensive game to date being Destiny at a !!rumored!! TEN MILLION DOLLARS in development costs (that's just for the first game released, not including DLC and future expansions) and a FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ad campaign spread out over the lifecycle of the title (rumored to be about 10 years).This game, with all of it's expansions up to issue 11 is $60.  The same price as the first Legend of Zelda game, with fully-voiced characters, non-intrusive cinematics, an expansive world, a unique story; I could go on and on.  Even if you don't like this game for personal reasons, there shouldn't be any reason to down-vote it.  It's a good game.  It's playable.  It doesn't pull any punches and it works.  On the off chance it doesn't work, they have Omni-GM's (GM's with root console access, not just a Kick/Ban button for jerks) on hand to fix any kerfunk that may occur....Didn't mean to get philosophical on everyone; but that's just my two cents.

												Creepy MMO - A brief but honest review. The Secret World is by no means a stand-out title. It certainly doesn't re-invent the wheel at any point and the movement and combat feels a little floaty. It's yout typical action-bar-pickup-quests-kill-mobs sort of game. At least that's what you think when you start playing. However; the game developers have managed to capture this really thick atmosphere through a combination of great story-telling, awesome voice-acting and a brilliant soundtrack. When you start playing the game you really start to get sucked in and the experience becomes increasingly immersing as you follow along with the story. You start yearning to find out the secrets behind the mystery. I really get this 'Diablo 2 but set in the modern world.' sort of vibe while playing it. And really it is that which drives me on. The game has a fairly steep learning curve. A complex crafting system, a massive selection of weapons, skills, abilities, stats -- and none of it is really formally explained. But with a bit of surfing you will quickly find answers to those questions. (using the in-game browser is a nice touch.)I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone playing for end-game content or raiding for epic loot. However; if you're looking to immerse yourself in a really well voice-acted horror story that generates an atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a knife, this could well be for you.			"

Short verdict: you will like this MMO, even if you don't like MMOs in general.PROS+ Fantastic lore with a lot of inspiration from H.P. Lovecraft, folklore and mythology. No shortage of pop-culture references either+ Overwhelming amount of content. The Ultimate Edition on sale with a 75% discount is a fantastic deal. Even with the Standard Edition you get plenty of gameplay hours for the buck.+ No subscription, no slots to unlock, all the things that matter are unlockable either with skill/ability points or in-game currency/tokens+ You can solo most of the missions (except for dungeons, lairs and raids)+ Very friendly and helpful community, which is still quite active+ Atmospheric+ Modern day setting, which is a relatively rare thing for MMOs+ No fixed classes, it's all about skills and equipment in this game, which you can easily change+ Seasonal events+ Free membership for 2 months with the Ultimate Edition. The membership offers considerable loot and XP boosts and free travelling+ When buying the Ultimate Edition, you also get one free key of the Standard Version to share with a friend+ Abundancy of outfits and cosmetic items. Many of them are free+ You don't feel the grindiness in the early game period, because everything feels quite exciting for about first 50-80 hours (for me at least) and there's always another achievement, another item, another skill deck to get within your reach+ Adjustable camera distanceCONS- This game is not super-grindy, but it's still grindy, especially in terms of combat. - Tedious combat. Enemies have too much HP, even the easy ones. Unless, you're doing missions with friends, killing takes a long time.- Camera issues - big enemies don't fit the screen very nicely- Even though the enemies change, what changes is their looks, not how they act and feel. Basically, there are just a few enemy types: big, slow golem-like enemies with a lot of HP;  grouped small weak enemies that can overwhelm you with numbers; small to medium size ungrouped strong enemies; spectres with magic abilities and minor bosses.- It's hard to sneak past enemies without triggering a combat. Usually you can outrun them, but you need to be careful of not triggering too many enemies at the same time, which happens quite often- Agartha is a sort of transport hub in this game and its convoluted design makes the travelling a little bit cumbersome. Also, in some maps, the fast travelling points (anima wells) are scarcely distributed.- Although, there is a unique story for every mission, after a while, the gameplay does start to feel repetitive. And that is the main reason, why I'm taking a break from this game. The gameplay starts to feel like a repetitive cycle of clearing the areas, missions and gathering lore and skills.- Too narrow opportunity windows in sabotage missions.- There are quite a few bugs and I needed to switch from DX11 to DX9 to avoid frequent crashes.- The Ultimate Edition does not include all the DLCs, you still need to buy Issues 12-14 additionally.In the end, I'd like to say that I don't like MMOs and the reason, why I picked up this game, was because of the Lovecraftian lore and the fact that you can complete most of the missions alone. So, if you are into a good story and enjoy some modern day mystery, this game is not bad at all, not at all.My overall rating: 8/10 "

												I've never written a review on Steam before.   Many people have already posted about the story line, the atmosphere, etc.  All of that is great.  This is what really makes the game great for me though.   There are no character classes.  You unlock every skill and then you can build your own deck (basically role) for many different types of game modes.  There are your classic holy trinity roles of Tank, DPS, and heals.  However, there are many different hybrid roles as well.  Some examples are a heal tank, melee dps, DPS tank, leech healer (healer that heals with an assault rifle DPS), and then the mixing and matching of many skills/weapons that add more to your build as well.    I have a few hours on this game and my toon can do every role for all the content in the game (sans some brand new content since I haven't learned every role yet in the new content), and that is what makes this game great for me.   Typically in any other MMO you must roll another class to try or play another role.  Not in this game.  You get complete control of what weapons you want to slot, and you craft all your own custom gear.Many MMOs have advertised the ""Play it your way,"" model of character progression and design.   While, you cannot 100% just make up whatever you want in this game, it is the only game that comes close.   You are never locked into a specific class or build, and with their crafting system you can completely customize all your gear.   It really is the closest thing to the ""play it your way,"" I have ever experienced in a MMO.I'd recommend this game to anyone where this is appealing.  To be honest this game has sort of ruined me, as I will probably never want to play a class-based MMO video game again.    I now want my character to be able to perform any role.			"

												Enjoyable MMO that does away with leveling and your basic class system and instead focuses on player freedom and customization. Initially a bit challenging after playing some of the ""Press button to kill things"" games, The Secret World requires you to know your build well enough to utilize it during combat. It can feel a bit unforgiving at times if you haven't balanced out your gear and stats, but everything is customizable and can be broken down to make new items so it shouldn't take long to get the hang of playing.I would suggest the Massive Edition for anoyone completely new to the game. The starter weapons are good through the entire first zone (until you hit about 3 million XP) and you also get an XP booster you can use once every 16 hours (lasts 1 hour).Another big draw to the game is the overall look of your character and how much you can customize their wardrobe. Your stats are based off smaller items, not your shirt, hat and boots. You can acquire clothing items in game by doing various missions or achievements but you can also purchase them through the Item Store, which allows you to preview the item on your character before purchase. Sure, clothing doesn't affect the game, but being able to come up with your own look is a nice touch. What's more, you get your faction outfit as you progress through the game and you can unlock other outfits as you complete ""Decks"" (the closest thing to spec/builds in The Secret World). I would suggest looking over the starter decks early and figuing out what weapon combo you want to play, then spend you AP and SP to unlock that starter deck. Once you have completed it, you can claim the outfit for that deck. (Considering you can obtain every skill and ability in the game on one character, everyone is able to complete every deck and play every style.)One drawback I've found with The Secret World is that it's a bit of a time sink. What felt like an hour of play time was actually about 4 hours of real time. It's easy to get caught up in the world, I guess.			"

												I probably should start by stating the fact that I generally hate MMOs but this... This is different.It got guns. It got zombies. What more could you wish for?No, but seriously. The game has a modern day setting and brings every myth you ever heard of to reality in said world.Think of it as Supernatural being made into a MMO. You even solve cases and there's puzzles on top of the usual mass killing of your favorite creatures. And did I say it got guns? As in firearms - pistols, shotguns, assault rifles beside the magic and melee weapons.RIGHT NOW IT IS ON SALE!! A one time payment like with any other normal game, so no subscription fees.			"

												As far as MMOs go, I'm REALLY enjoying this game immensely.First, to be clear: It's not going to be for everybody. If you dislike MMO-style gameplay, then look elsewhere: this game includes a (somewhat) typical (though unique in some aspects) quest system, the usual grind from time to time, and tinkering with character stats.It also does not give you the full experience if all you're interested in is jumping into a game and mindlessly blowing everything up (which, hey, who doesn't love that, too?). Finally, the graphics aren't going to blow your mind (that's not to say they're bad. It's just...they're MMO graphics. What do you want?)But with all that said and out of the way, I love the effort this game goes through to create such an amazing atmosphere. The story is intricate and intriguing, the main quests include well-crafted cutscenes with quality voice acting. And the quests! The quests took me by surprise!The quests will range from your typical ""go here and kill 10 zombies,"" to an intricate series of puzzles and riddles, leading you through town and exploring secret areas, and finally giving you incredibly challenging riddles that require you to do research (with a pretty cool in-game browser window) to seek out a solution. Never before have I been challenged by an MMO like I have with TSW.And it's also the first MMO like this I've played that has no classes and no levels, pushing you to really invent unique ""deck"" combinations suited to your gameplay, picking and choosing which two weapons you want to use and which abilities for each. I found I was realllly left in the dark about how this all worked, but after I did some research into everything online, everything started to click into place quickly. Which I suppose is just fine for a game that urges you to research and learn, anyway.The subject and genre are unique and interesting, and it's a good experience to turn off the lights, and immerse yourself in the game, reading the clues and lore, learning new things, and exploring this creepy world. I'm hopeful for even more customization of character, and I think the gameplay system could be made more clear somehow, but overall, this game is a definite new favorite in my library. Solo-friendly. Group-friendly. Helpful and nice community.Overall, you only get out of this game what you're willing to put in. If you explore and involve yourself with the story, TSW is a rewarding experience. It was a refreshing change from my years of WoW addiction, and made me brush the dust off my brain. I'm hooked.			"

												PART 1~~Short Introduction~~TSW is a modern horror/mystery MMORPG set in the modern world. You can choose between three secret societies (like factions in other games) to join the battle against nasty monsters or each other.There are no classes or levels but I will talk about that later.~~Payment model~~TSW is Buy-to-play, similar to Guild Wars 2. You don't need a subscription to play but new content is (partially) locked behind a DLC. When you buy the game you get the base game and the first four Issues (that's what content patches are called). You also get enough Bonus Points (after doing 30 missions) to buy one of the DLC.The item shop is mostly cosmetic and the few non-cosmetic items are far from Pay-to-win.The optional subscription gives you some points for the store, a 10% store discount, an item of the month (clothing or pet), veteran points and an item that gives you double XP for one hour (16 hours cooldown).~~Setting~~TSW is set in the modern world. The three faction hubs are London, New York and Seoul. There are three quest regions at the moment, each with 2-3 zones: Solomon Island (New England), Egypt and Transylvania. The next region will be Tokyo (probably late 2013/early 2014).There is a lot of horror and mystery influence from H.P. Lovecraft, X-Files, etc.~~PvE~~Most of the quests have cutscenes and the voice actors are great. This is the first MMORPG where I didn't skip any cutscenes and really got into the story.Every quest is repeatable which lets you correct mistakes you made with your build early on and gives you the chance to get enough AP to get every skill later (see ~~Progression~~).There are three types of quests: Action, Sabotage and Investigation.Action quests are your typical run/kill quests.Sabotage quests have you sneak around and avoid cameras and monsters.Investigation quests have you solve puzzles, use real life knowledge etc. (One example (SPOILERS): In one of the quests you have to figure out that the hint you just got points to a specific bible verse which gives you another hint for the next quest step)The dungeons are some of the best I've ever seen in an MMORPG and can be pretty challenging if you don't get carried through. Each dungeon comes in three difficulties: Normal, Elite and Nightmare.The endgame is mostly running Nightmare dungeons and the two raids. With Issue 8 (released in Nov '13) there are also scenarios to run, which are basically instanced missions for solo, duo or groups with random elements.Unfortunately most of the content is the same regardless of faction and since you can get everything on one character you are not encouraged to make alts.~~PvP~~I don't play PvP myself but from what I hear some love it, some hate it. Better look for another review if you want to know more about PvP.			"

												I've spent around 32 hours with it, and in that time only made it through the first quest zone doing most of it by myself, and there were still quests to complete in the area when I decided to check out the next one. I think there are 8 or so zones in the base game, more available in expansions (one of which you can pick up for free with the Ultimate Edition since it gives you the free FunCom points used to buy such things). The zones themselves span from a New England town to Egypt, Transylvania, and Tokyo, as well as having hub cities like New York, London, and Seoul. The missions are pretty well done instead of the usual ""Kill X number of whatevers"" or ""Collect X number of whatevers,"" and some of what sets it apart from most other MMOs (or RPGs in general) is that it's a modern-day version of the world as we know it (but with a Call of Cthulhu kinda flair, so you run into crazy monsters along the way). You play as a member of a secret organization like the Illuminati doing all kinds of X-Files stuff away from the public eye. There is an in-game browser that you can use to look up fake websites, and there's investigative stuff to find passwords and clues to mysteries. And pretty much everything is voiced. I honestly can't think of any MMO that can compete with it in terms of missions. The biggest gripe most people have with the game is that the combat, like most MMOs in my experience, is kinda boring. It's slightly more nuanced than average, but still not super exciting. You get to pick two separate fighting styles based on the two weapons you have equipped, and you can change and upgrade any of them as you level up. So you can mix assault rifles with a sword and then over time you decide you like blood magic, you can equip a blood magic focus in place of your assault rifle or sword and totally mix up your play style. And yes, it is possible to unlock all of it and even save alternate loadouts so you can swap back and forth on the fly. Pretty much all of the content is solo friendly except for the dungeons, so you can enjoy 95% of the game without needing to suck your friends in or be social with strangers.			"

												If every conspiracy theory and Lovecraftian mythos happened at the same time, you have the setting for The Secret World.Pros* Buy-to-play (ie. no subscription). The game plays fine without spending any more money.* Fully voice acted including multiple appearances from Jeffrey Combs.* No classes, any character can put points into any skill tree.* No levels, you earn skill points at a steady pace. Instead, advanced skills cost more.* No skill point cap. Try everything!* At times it's geniunely very creepy.* A truly unique MMO setting.* Crafting is Minecraft style.Cons* Like much of the source material it's drawing from, the story is gibberish.* PVE combat is easy and gets repetitive.If you're tired of WoW clones and fantasy settings, try this. It's just dripping with atmosphere. Grab it when it's on sale and see if you like it.			"

												This game is not the best MMO I've ever played. Blockbusters like WoW or SWTOR beat it by throwing sheer volumes of money at every problem. But this game doesn't try to compete in their arena, and in doing so became the most interesting MMO I've ever played.Ever standard complaint of the genre is, if not fixed, at least tweaked. Sick of boring Kill X, Gather Y quests? The Secret World has the most involved quest lines I've ever played. Even their most basic missions are steeped in enough lore to keep you engadged and their legendary Investigation missions earn every bit of praise they've aquired. Tired of spammers filling chat with goldfarming ads and racist tirades? The TSW community is only interested in sharing theories and, occasionally, bad puns. Heck, just don't like monthly subscription fees? Pay once, play forever! And don't worry, while there is an add-on store, it's used entirely for cosmetics, convenience, and story additions. No pay-to-win here.If you're a fan of contemporary fantasy or cosmic horror genres, this is an absolute must. Even if you're just a casual MMO player interested in seeing how the genre can work when it's trying desperately to make the Blizzard lightning strike twice, this is a game worth seeing.Come on... take a peek behind the curtain of reality.

												Excellent game, pretty sure this is easily my second most-played MMO and I'm still very much enjoying it. Missions that will (most of the time) keep you interested, and a unique class system. I'll say, this game can be hard to get into. The story alone should keep you going for a bit, especially if you really give it a chance. I sometimes feel the dialouges are a bit drawn out but the story overall is interesting. That being said, questing areas are often not too populated and I imagine it can be hard to make friends, and the ability wheel at first glance can be overwhelming.One of the first thing you'll want to do is join Sanctuary by inputting ""/chat join sanctuary"" into your chat. This is a fairly active chat for new players with a lot of vets willing to help with builds, questing, and more. But as you get more comfortable with the world, your roles, the quests, the dungeons, it can become really fun. This is the only game I've ever played where I LOVE instances. I have no issue grinding every elite on repeat for hours. Each group poses new dynamics, challenges, and the boss fights are generally fun (to me).CLASSES AND FIGHTING:The ability to change out your roles and classes can be weird at first. Essentially in the beginning you will probably want to be guessing at builds online and hope they're effective until you learn the skills. But once you do, it can open up a  world of building your own builds, rotations, there is really no definitive way to play a class and a lot of the time later, you'll find yourself switching skills depending on the situation, or sometimes even roles, making you more and more valuable as a party member for your flexibility. It is amazingly valuable to be mid dungeon wiping and realizing you can't heal something, only to have a dps come up and say ""hey, we can switch"", and still be able to progress. QUESTING AND ENVIROMENT:Most reviews talk about this so I'm not gonna go into it too much. The story is interesting, with nice character variety and interesting side stories. There's some excellent attention to detail. There are actually for real sites they've made for this game connected to the story which can be clues and more, and I love little details like that. (i.e.: a character has a blog writing about something relevant to a quest, you can go to his blog: http://www.monstersofmaine.blogspot.ca/)Immersion is pretty good. Graphics, eh, pretty decent. Exploring and lore hunting is fun. Maps are fairly big, it'll take you some time to run around an entire one and see it all, often you'll find small side missions hidden if you're exploring. One criticism I have is the hitboxes for traps SUCK. I absolutely hate sneaking missions. You'll be feet away from a landmine and it will blow up on you. Absolutely hate those things.COMMUNITY:The community is often one of the better I have been in. If you are new to an instance there are usually people very willing to help out. I mainly heal in this game and I very very rarely get the whole ""omg noob healer!!!"" business (even when I can be that). It can be slow but there are some really cool people on this game. Late game players often even carry the easy difficulty dungeons for new players, there can be a very nice sense of community. Of course, there are the douches. It is an MMO. UI AND THE NEED FOR MODDING:The UI isn't great. It can be glitching and it's lacking as well. I'll tell you right now if you decide to get this game, mod the UI. You'll want better combat logs, resource counters, and... Well, just generally, look for the mods. ENDGAME:I'm not quite to full endgame yet so I feel a little weird writing about this specifically but endgame is grinding. Grinding nightmares, scenarios, signet missions. If you enjoy the gameplay, unlocking all your skills, making new builds, it's fun. But when you get there, that's definitely a thing. (To be expected in an mmo, but just saying.)Anyway... Been meaning to write a review for awhile. So... Off to run 24s. o/			"

												I have really enjoyed the Borderlands series and story - The characters made the difference. I wanted to try out my first MMO however I'm extremely picky about ""Fantasy"" - I usual don't like it. With TSW, it takes place in the Present. It has a ""grown-up"" story full of characters, etc. not found in most games. Plus, this game has as much playtime as the entire Borderlands series combined.There were some Sci Fi MMO's I considered, but I didn't want to level grind - TSW has linear growth and I can ""spend"" my Skill Points where ever to determine my Quality Level (1 - 10).With most of my gamer buddies on Xbox, I have to solo this a lot, and it's very doable - if balanced correctly. Other players are around and will assist occasionally to help you out.Here's my advice if you want to get started on The Secret World:Remember there are no monthly fees. You can play without every buying an In-app purchase. You will earn 1200 bonus credits to buy new side stories or in-game stuff after your 1st 30 missions. You can earn in game credit to buy things too. Spending real money might save you time though, get you time boosts, ""outfits"" - none of which is necessary. The Ultimate Edition on sale is the best buy with issues #1-#11, side stories, & more. Put The Secret World on your Steam Wish List. Install a copy from the Funcom.com site and ask for a 72 hr trial key from the Steam TSW Forums. Then if you enjoy it, get the Ultimate Edition when on sale ( at 60% off = $24 - WOW!! ). *IF you can get the basic Secret World for #1-#3 on sale that will give you time to play it until it's on sale again, but you'll basically spend $$$ to eval a game. Luckily, the Ultimate comes with a base game license key you are allowed to give away. NOTE: This is a FUNCOM key to give, not an extra Steam Key ! Do NOT create any character right away. You need to do research, preferable before you buy it. (Yes, you are already playing the game, not having bought it yet.) Read the Steam Community Guides on it. In particular: The Secret World 101 - has lots of great links at the bottom.

 http://wordpress.tswguides.com/category/tsw-guides/builds/level/my-first-60/ - this site is a must if your new and will be soloing Lastly, after completing 30 missions, Funcom (currently) gives you 1200 store credits which is worth $10. With that credit, you can buy anything you missed. If you own the Ultimate Edition, you're getting $10 back on your purchase for in-store credit for new chapters & packs. Awesome. Thanks Funcom.Character creation: Be patient creating a unique nickname. Without a login, use http://chronicle.thesecretworld.com to look up if nickname is taken. Note: there are also reserved names - First, Nick & Last . Not everyone can be Snoop Dog or Eva Longoria. If you goof up a Toon's appearance or name, (at the time of writing) you can delete you character & create a new one at no cost with the desired nick name (or even same nickname) so long as someone else doesn't grab the nickname -- I did. YMMV. But if you've been playing and want to re-spec - don't consider deleting it as you'll have many months of game play to get back to where you were. There's very rare reasons to delete to re-spec. Servers matter for solo adventurers - you want one to find folks for Dungeon runs, PvP gaming, or meet folks to co-op with. Unless you 'Meetup' with someone on another server or are co-op'ing, you will always PvP on your host. I've read I should have gone with Arcadia RP. Now, it's a Role Play host, that means stow (uncheck) your characters gear so it's not visible. And don't Run & Jump over every car & fence you see. I play that way already when I read the suggestion. FYI, It cost $20 to move an existing character to another server. So choose wisely. You can delete a character & create a new one (you have 3 slots) on your preferred server - but it'll be gone forever.I have my 2nd of three characters on Arcadia RP. Depending on the zone's or sub-zone's population, it can get occasionally very slightly jittery. If that's a problem, don't use Arcadia. My first character is on Daemon server and its really smooth. My third is on Cerberus. Now I have a character on each of the most populated (English) servers. Put every piece of clothing on your character you can when first making them. Jackets, glasses, etc. They will always have shirt, shorts/pants, shoes. However, glasses, hats, jackets, etc. can be removed at anytime. If you want them in-game, you have buy them with earned (or real) currency, achievements, etc. So, take them while their free. You will get bonus stuff from the Steam purchase. Use some of them. Press ',' comma to pull up the store,  select Claim Items, then *review first*. Do *not* claim any yet. Review all the store. Some are even more powerful than earned rings, etc in game but only work below 3mil Exp. Others [ like timed boosts] work for all levels. Consider saving your boosts for later so you level faster/steady on tougher minions/portions. Factions only matters for PvP really (capture the flag, territories, etc.). Everyone has the same story to complete, though your faction will alter some dialog. There are a few faction missions, but they are different perspectives or goals of the same event. Everyone can travel to the other cities: London (bank & large market), New York (body modification) & Seoul.Game Mods:Viper's TopBar Overload and Viper's Deck ManagerYou'll likely want the Mods: Viper's TopBar Overload so you can install Viper's Deck Manager. The site http://secretui.com has them. Some people use http://Curse.com. You can download them from there too. (I don't like having more clients so I don't run Curse on my rig.)VDM is the defacto ""stringifier"" of builds for importing & exporting your current loadout while making loadouts easier too. It's a maintained community Mod. Several Mods are must have but TopBar Overload & VDM are practically mandatory.These sites can share & compare your builds with others outside of TSW:(Note: if your chronicle.thesecretworld.com profile page is publicly visible, some of these sites will import using that too beside your exported VDM string) http://www.drakkashi.com/secretworld/ http://www.drakkashi.com/secretworld/Ability%20Wheel.swf (Just the tool) http://www.tsw-builder.com http://www.badomens.net/calculator http://joakibj.com/tswcalcThere's a few more build sites too.BTW, Viper's DontMakeMeWait is super helpful is speeding past all the startup junk.TSWRPAnother popular mod is for http://tswrp.co - it's allows for in-game role play character HTML rich profile sheets to be accessible on the toons. Being HTML, folks can embed photos, use different fonts & colors, etc. Even if you don't RP (role play) you can use it for conveying additional information about your toon or you. The thing is, you have to use the mod if you want to see that out-of-game ""meta-data"" in-game.Of course you could use the in-game browser and see if someone has a page at http://tswrp.co/character/TOONNICKNAME (provided you get any capitalization correct since not all nicks are Capitalized.)Ghost Tablethttp://www.secretui.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=85 OR http://www.curse.com/tsw-mods/tsw/ghosttablet makes the GHOST computer interface taller for practically no scrolling.

												Well what can I say about this game :P I love it soooooo much, I have put in over 1800 hours so far and not even close to finished yet, new content released all the time and I get to play with my friends. The maps are massive and filled with missions, also one of the best story line missions I have ever seen. For the most part the people are friendly and the GM's are fast to respond and they are friendly too. You dont have to pay to play this game but I recommend paying becasue you get access to a rance of content and store items that you cant buy anywhere els, there are super cute outfits and tons of accessories. One of the best things about this game is you can be any role you like, we have things called talismans and depending on the talismans you equip you can play the role of a tank, DPS or healer, you can also mix talismans and chop and change your spec on the fly, and combind your stats to make a heal-tank :P or a leech DPS or combind all 3 to make very powerful tanking healer dps build thingys (I call them survival builds) to kill the many monsters in the new nightmare level scenario issue packs found in game. Really its impossible to do a in depth review of this game becasue its simply too big and too much to do and too much to say... just take my word for it and buy the game you wont regret it. Sure its hard in the beginning but once you get some gear you can take on the world solo or as a group of upto 10 of your friends :P Make your own guilds and this isnt even mentioning the PVP aspect of the game... just buy it :P			"

												TL;DR Worth the cost for top-notch story, voice-acting, and characters - but the rest of the game is average at best.A modern-day MMO with guns, Lovecraftian horrors, and bare-naked demon lady boobs.Combat is a bit different to standard tab-target and hotkeys, with a smaller set of abilities and a dodge button. Groups and dungeons still boil down to tank/damage/heals though.Story, script, and voice-acting is where this game really shines compared to others in the genre. Focus on puzzle-solving and the modern-day setting I liked a lot, and are a refreshing change to all the dragons, orcs, elves etc. But while this game nails plot, character, and narrative in a way that no other developer does - especially in the field of MMOs - there are a lot of weaknesses.Character creation is very basic indeed. All characters are fashion-model slim (no options to add bulk in the form of muscle or fat), and although there is a slider to alter height, the variation is quite small. Facial options are limited to a handful of starting faces, with a small selection of features and skin colours. The end result is a game populated by characters of the same build, roughly the same height, who all move in exactly the same way. Superficially the faces look different, but underneath it's still easy to spot one of the small number of basic templates.Character and combat animations are also basic, with the same ones being used for a variety of similar skills (sword skills seem most memorable for this).Combat initially seems more innovative because of the small ability set and the dodge mechanic, but is just tab-target and hotkey with the aforementioned grafted on. Whilst not a bad thing on its own, combat in TSW lacks any sense of impact or meaningful feedback whilst fighting (e.g. when using an enormous black sledgehammer with veins of lava on it, I don't feel like it's connecting with enemies, and there is little to no reaction from them when they are hit aside from numbers appearing above their heads). Coupled with the re-used animations this makes battles slidey/floaty, repetitive affairs, even later in the game when more advanced abilities are unlocked.If you treat this game as single-player and buy it for the story, then you will get amazing value for money - there are hundreds of hours on offer here. It's just a shame that the MMO components and the combat (which there is a lot of) are usually mediocre.			"

												This game is one part mysticism and occult, one part urban legends, and one part the Matrix, all put into a blender and injected with steroids and served on an MMO platter. I'm really glad I gave this game a second chance. I followed the game's production which sadly was a mistake because I sort of painted this idea in my head of what the game was going to be like. When I finally got to jump in I was disappointed when ""The Secret World"" wasn't really all that secret, as my first few hours of playing were spent saving a town from a zombie apocalypse. Being sorely disappointed by this overused cliche, I shelved the game. Cut to several years later, I have gotten over my preconceived notions of what this game was going to be and allowed myself to get caught up in the Lovecraftian style horror and heavy occult themed storyline, and I'm loving every minute of it.There is lots of action right from the start, and while playing the newest addition to one of the three ancient factions (Illuminati, Dragon, or Templar) you find yourself instantly going from average joe to superhero. Yes its a little unrealistic and overdone, but don't let this turn you off. Once you overlook how over the top everything is you can allow yourself to really get caught up in the world that has been created for you to discover.You can pretty much play this game like a single player game with MMO elements. Some may be turned off by that, but actually the missions in this game are well thought out, delivered with cutscenes, full voice acting, and are far from your typical kill X mobs, collect X items, etc. that have plagued the MMO scene since WoW (some of this is still present, but usually in the form of optional side missions). The most intriguing thing about this game are the special investigation type missions. These missions don't hold your hand and, for example, will have you using the in game browser to pull up a website for an in game company in order to find clues that will lead you to the next mission objective, or you may need to use google to translate Latin scribbled on the wall that's a riddle leading you to the next objective. This really taps into the whole ""Secret World"" thing, and is very rewarding when you are finally able to figure out the mystery. One mission even had me follwing a clue that lead me to a video on youtube that was recorded by an occult fanatic trying to open a portal to hell (yes this video is really up on youtube). This type of interactive quest system that forces you to think outside the box is something I've never seen done by any other MMO.The class system is completely fluid, you build your own class by attaining ability points (AP) and spending them in one of the many skill trees tied to the different weapon types. You are able to have 2 weapons equipped at one time, limiting you to the active abilites associated with those two weapon types, but you can have passives from any of the other weapon types active regardless of what weapons you have equipped. This system allows for an incredible amount of customization. Also there is no limit to the amount of AP you can gain, so eventually you will have all skills unlocked, so there is no need to develop mutliple characters if you want to try different weapons and builds, it can all be changed on the fly on a single character. (I strongly suggest using some of the prebuilt ""decks"" in the ability window, these will help you learn how active and passive abilities across multiple weapon types can create synergies. This is very helpful to the new player - you also get cool costumes for unlocking all abilites in a ""deck"")As far as the combat and item system, its very similar to SWTOR (Star Wars the Old Republic), albeit the animations are not quite as smooth. Many enemies and dungeon/raid encounters will require you to dodge AoEs and areas you need to avoid will be highlighted, giving you time to run or dodge out of harms way, making positioning very important. This makes combat dynamic and much more engaging. You have 7 active abilities and 7 passive abilities. Items are geared towards either DPS, tanking, or healing, and if you plan on running dungeons and raids (this game has a great group/raid finder) you will need to specialize your gear and build accordingly (but as I said, gear and build loadouts can be saved and changed on the fly with the click of a button to fit whatever your group/raid needs).TL:DR All and all The Secret World has really surprised me. What I thought was going to be just another over the top forray into quest grinding wrapped in a Lovecraftian, occult, conspiracy theorist skin, turned out to actually be a very well created story driven MMO with lots of exciting mysteries to uncover and fun character progression. If you want to experience a game with a dark atmosphere and well written missions, give this game a try, you'll be glad you did!			"

												The best and perhaps only consistently good part of The Secret World is the world design; the environments are generally fantastic, the story can be pretty good, and the world overall is vibrant (if a bit shallow).The gameplay leaves a *lot* to be desired. The lack of traditional classes and level structure sounds interesting at first, but it's little more than a facade in reality. The ""classes"" of the game are your weapons, which each have two different ""roles"" that they're designed around -- Fist weapons heal, Blood magic provides shields, Swords deal DPS, etc -- and the result is ultimately a little more restrictive than Guild Wars (1), except very little in the game makes these equipment ""roles"" explicit, leaving all of that to discovery (by which I mean the wiki). The absence of proper ""levels"" in the game is just as fake -- you'll still be stomped flat if you wander too far ahead of your ""level"" (or encounter a higher-level player in PvP), and you'll trounce anything below your ""level"" -- the game just hides all of that information from you. The game doesn't ""unleash"" you in any way; it just trades your leash for a shock collar of painful trial-and-error.The controls and netcode are terrible. And yet, somehow, despite the fact that your player character controls like a fish flopping around on an ice rink, Funcom had the gall to include a significant emphasis on jumping puzzles in TSW. (Full disclosure: this review was the product of after two hours' rage, trying to glide my fish up *two jumps*, complete with skidding about, unregistered jump keys, jumps of inconsistent height and distance, and random rolling around.)Sadly, the puzzles in TSW are often painfully vague, or utterly tedious. You WILL need to look up many of them from a wiki, and you WILL want to after dealing with some of these quests. For examples: translating morse code for a pattern in a blinking light that you aren't directed towards; translating phrases into *broken* Latin for computer passwords; learning a demonic alphabet so you can type more broken Latin (thankfully provided) into runes on the floor. There's a few good puzzles interspersed, but unfortunately most of them completely miss the mark.Overall, the game just isn't worth playing as a primary MMO. If it goes on sale for $10, consider picking it up to play for a weekend or two; tour the game's environments, enjoy a few of the better puzzles, but don't pay so much that you'll feel obligated to play through the unending piles of awful that this game also offers.

												After buying and playing The Secret World, I knew getting Ultimate Edition was the absolutely right thing to do. It's story & lore beats most of the single player RPGs. All dialogues are voiced, graphics are great compared to other MMOs.Also, there are some crazy missions/puzzles. For example, a while ago I did the Red Handed quest.______________In first tier, there are sick people with some listed symptoms, you need to give them the right drugs.For the first patient, I googled *""spasm in jaw muscles, breathing problems""* it turned out to be tetanus. Then I checked for it's treatment on Wikipedia:http://i.imgur.com/26exBVI.jpgGived Diazepam to the patient.The first 3 patients were easy but the 4th had an untreatable disease (can't remember now, vampire bite or something); but the doctor's father had worked on it, so I checked his diary.http://i.imgur.com/FPNWAYm.jpgIt was obvious that they were elements, I tried to use first letters of English equivalents instead of Latin, but that didn't work.Then, http://i.imgur.com/TJFz66Z.jpgI wrote down the atom numbers of the elements; and then looked for the letter in the alphabet's n'th place.The message was this:“I Asked The Old Drinkers at the Tavern About My Father Some Recalled He Spent Nights With His Local Mistress There. “Good with a pitchfork and that is not all” This woman is long gone, but perhaps something remains.”Went to the tavern, checked the rooms and this was there:http://i.imgur.com/RFq8E6v.jpgIf you strip away the holiness from this message, the truth of my research will be revealedThere are holy places in the village. At the holy church there is a holy man. That holy man owns a holy book. I went to the church, searched around and digged out a soviet laptop.It had this http://i.imgur.com/8vESjSb.jpg&nbsp;The laptop had a password and the hint was this:http://i.imgur.com/54RQf37.jpgI searched the numbers and they were genotype for the UROD gene.https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/UROD#conditionsPassword was **porphyria**____________________________And there's whole bunch of story missions, dungeons, raids, regular MMO stuff etc.That's why I love The Secret World.

												An above average Buy to Play MMO, recommended if you are getting this on sale and are looking for a singleplayer experience in an MMO. Game has promising ideas, but implementation leaves much to be desired and Funcom suffered financially as a result. Graphics:Nice artstyle and atmosphere but overall graphics is not the game strong points. Animation and graphic quality are average at best while optimisation isn't very good (I have better frame rate and less stutter on Black Desert Online with many more player character onscreen compared to TSW not so populated first few zones). Cutscenes are abundant but due to not-so-good animation they are boring most of the time to watch. Gameplay:Interesting non-class based mechanic but still follow the traditional holy trinity which is good. Interesting puzzle approach to quests, but puzzles are not on par with say The Longest Journey and much of the time require you to surf the internet to find the answer. Apparently the game has an in-game web browser just for this purpose. Combo system is so-so, there are MMOs that handles combo much better. Overall gameplay is not mechanically complex as Anarchy Online. It's neither a sandbox nor a themepark MMO, probably somewhere between a sandpark (the like of ArcheAge and Black Desert Online) and themepark (of WoW or Final Fantasy XIV). Can't comment on group content yet as I have not touched it, but the singleplayer experience is meh if you are actually compare it to singleplayer game. I can't help but be disappointed this wasn't a singleplayer game from the beginning, cutting the wasted resource on MMO part to help refine and polish what could have been a great singleplayer action-RPG.Story:Interesting and well written, but nothing groundbreaking. Maybe I have played too many RPGs over the year so it's hard to impress. Too bad Ragnar Tornquist left much early on, but then again the new Dreamfall Chapters wasn't as well received as The Longest Journey and Dreamfall Chapter either. Is it because ""we've seen it all"" that we keep getting disappointed by further creations in the same veins?			"

												This is a real treasure!The game looks and plays like an mmorpg; mediocre (sorry, mmo-fans). The content and lore is of a level I have not seen in a lot of games. Through the latter I'm getting immersed in a world of fiction and one that borders our own conspiracy culture, history and beliefs. I highly recommend this game, especially if you don't mind solo-exploring (yes, it is a mmo, but it's as multiplayer as you want it to be; not necessary), if you're into conspiracy culture, myths, monsters, puzzles (please try solve them yourself, it feels so good to solve them) and don't mind closing the curtains and locking yourself in for a couple of days.It is totally worth it. Listen to all the conversations (exhaust all your options), read all the lore, do as much sidequests as you can, and this will be worth more to you than it costs. Also; a bottle of wine works well alongside.			"

												Ever heard of a single player MMO? No? Neither have I but if you were imagine something so obsurd you would soon imagine ""The Secret World"".The world is pretty big and open with plenty of quest givers strewn about. With this you can explore and kill with friends but the story missions are almost all singleplayer. These missions are what makes the game so great. Many are investigation missions with criptic clues and puzzles. They actually encourage you to leave the game and use the internet as a research tool trusting that you will return. I have never seen a game with so much confidence in its design as to let you leave and know you will be back.Also, no monthly fee is a huge bonus. It takes away the pressure to play play play just to get your moneys worth.			"

This game have many epic stories and puzzles i very enjoy watching every video in game. In my opinion this is how modern mmo need to look like these days. Would i recommend, yes 100%. From all listed above mmos i would give number 1 place for secret world. Yes its even better than wow for me. I played Wow about 1 year but i didnt like the story as much as Secret World. Wow quests more boring and less fun same as Dungeons and Raids, i dont want to judge Wow but if you looking for a new mmo try The Secret World.			"

												TRANSMIT - initiate Steam signal - RECEIVE - initiate review sequence - JOIN US - initiate purchase protocol - WITNESS - The Secret World.Initiate overview.The Secret World is a modern day setting MMO, which is already fairly unique, but isn't the game's only peculiarity. It has a heavy focus on story and atmosphere, the combat system deviates from the usual MMO formula, and many other preconceptions are either tweaked or totally changed from what people might be used to. The game also has a big focus on customization, allowing players to dress any way they like, and make any skill build they want for a very flexible experience.Initiate positive reinforcement.The game's best asset by far is the story. If you can get into it, it's REALLY good, specially the deeper you go, and the more you advance through the Issues of content. The cast of characters is also well developed and entertaining to listen to, really selling you on the setting and what's going on. The quest design is also very interesting: there's not only fetch quests or ""kill 10 of this enemy"" quests, there's also puzzle quests, or quests that require stealth, even quests that require you to investigate to find an answer, using resources such as Google or the Bible.Beware. The dark side.However, the game isn't without shortcomings. For some, the combat might feel a bit lackluster and simple. While I enjoy it the way it is, and as you play you unlock the more fun to use skills, some of the animation or skill effects are a bit underwhelming. The graphics of the game, while overall great looking, can feel a bit dated or have minor errors sometimes. Finally, the game is known to have plenty bugs, from visual errors, to getting stuck, or even failing a quest because of them, but most have easy solutions and workarounds.Dark days are coming.Overall, I love this game to bits, and is probably up there with Final Fantasy XIV for my favorite MMO. Its issues are many, and some quite obvious, but the good aspects surpass the bad ones by far. I encourage anyone remotely interested in the game to give the free 10 day trial a shot, you will probably be surprised.Our wisdom flows so sweet. Taste and see.			"

												______________________________________Updated/Revised @ 100 hours______________________________________WARNING: This'll likely be long.Firstly, I'd caution social MMO fans that TSW is not the kind of MMO to which you're probably accustomed. While there are many social features here (such as raid-only dungeons, a kind of ""buddy system"" designed to connect likeminded players, etc.), TSW feels a lot more like a single-player game with multiplayer options than the other way around. It's HIGHLY immersive and, in my humble opinion, best suited for roleplayers and hardcore ARPGers than casuals or social butterflies.As for immersion, one of the things I like most about TSW is that it truly makes you CARE about the characters and the stories it provides for you as a player. Cinematics accompany nearly every main or story quest-giving NPC and your quests are capped to better ensure that you take your time while exploring the regions available to you. The stories are very much alive in this game.It's also a true horror fan's wet dream, going far beyond cheap jump scares and the same old monster grinds over and over again. Sure, there are ""kill quests"" which require you to knock off a dozen of the same mob and you may get tired of seeing zombies around every corner by the time you've made your way through most of the Savage Coast, but you'll also be tracking down the pages of discarded horror novels and following in the characters' footsteps. You'll be battling haunted theme park rides and discovering hidden Illuminati archives. You'll be learning all about the woeful fate of Andy's kittens. It makes the monotony of creature killing so much less monotonous and (in some cases) gets a teensy bit difficult to play comfortably alone in the dark.  Key things to remember if you're just getting started:-The leveling system is less about the prestige of character level and more about your combat build, with an emphasis on faction rank and ability combinations. -The crafting system is a little (read:extremely) tough to master at first, but once you've gotten it down, it becomes a fun sort of mad science.-The dungeons are incredible and well worth the effort of LFGs. -You WILL change your mind a half a dozen times about which weapons you want to use. -You WILL get frustrated trying to figure out how to complete some of the investigative quests -You WILL break down and Google how to solve at least one of the aforementioned quests because the game isn't holding your hand.-You WILL die. A lot. -The community is there to help you. They're very kind as a whole and I've personally never seen anyone trolled for not knowing how to do something. Don't be scared to reach out if you need help.The most important thing to bear in mind about TSW, I think, is that it requires patience and a passion for discovery. If you're looking to barrel through a game that'll make you feel like a god from the word ""go,"" try a different MMO. If, however, you'd rather be elbow-deep in the lore of the old gods and feel like you're literally lost in a world of unending madness, play the Secret World.Masterfully written, beautifully executed. It's the best MMO I've ever played.			"

												This was without a doubt, the most amazing MMO experience I ever had in my life. I started back in the good 'ol days when Cyberion City was around in 1993. Then the Diku, Merc, Circle MUDs came out. Then there was Ultima Online, then EverQuest and so on. I built and assaulted fortresses in DaoC and Lineage 2, I enjoyed WoW, was blown away by the storylines of SWTOR and ran through Neverwinter and so many others. None of that compares to The Secret World. The missions, the character progression, the amazing lore and storyline that bleeds into the real world and back. Playing the investigation missions (no cheating) and figuring them out has been more rewarding than many single-player games ever. I loved how the game created mass-instances so immersion was rarely broken seeing hundreds of players running around.  I loved how I could change my builds and change my roles on the fly. That my gear wasn't tied to how I looked at all and I could be whoever or whatever I wanted to be. I felt the pervasive fear of the unknown, the shock and rage at the atrocities of the Orochi Group, the love for Emma, the wild and awe-inspiring raids or dungeons. I was stunned, surprised, and dismayed, and overjoyed at the secrets to behold upon reaching the dark tower. I was there to help the residents of New England, breaking the curses, learning about its secrets and histories. I learned more about the majesty and wonder of Egypt than I had ever before. The brazen adventures of fun as I felt like James Bond or Indiana Jones thrilled me. I liked the weekly challenges, the combat (yes its far better than just waiting for silly things to proc with the slow beat of a ""normal"" mmo combat system) with its dashes and rolls and mixing magic and guns in all their glory.Yet I can't recommend the game anymore. Because instead of making new content, they've decided to kill the game. They're launching a new game with a graphics makeover, screwing over all the original players (you have to start all over again from freshstart), and this old, beautiful game is (as of today) now officially a dead world, a dead game. Its joins its brethern like Anarchy Online. Still running, but dead inside, never to see anything new again. Maybe you'll want to try the new game (SWL), but with a dumbed down combat system and streamlined gameplay, its going to be a sad, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of its former self.			"

												It is the best mmo currently available. There is no other online game with better quests or deeper atmosphere. Absolutely everything is voiced and most of the quests deserve to have a full game dedicated to them,If you love the works of Lovecraft, mythology, urban legends, modern setting  and mature community, you will find yourself at home here.

												I like the premise of this game, and to be honest I like many of the mechanics of the game, but sadly it fails as a MMO. While the missions are nice, with really quite unnecessary cutscenes that are just really nice bonus content, a lot of the game seems to be devoid of players who are below Q10; at least on the server I was playing. This means you don't really get to play dungeons and have to focus on missions to ""level"" and gear up. You can play the auction house, but there's too large a divide between those who can farm high-Q areas and those who can't; basically items are either pennies or gazillions, which translates to *not very good* and *completely unaffordable/above your Q-level until you've grinded away hours of your life*.If you ignore this, and focus on the game as a mission-based RPG, it's not bad. Problem is, it's a grindy RPG, and unless you're one of the dedicated few, there's better RPG's out there. While I wouldn't *discourage* anyone from buying it if they wanted to try it out, ultimately it means I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.			"

												Not your typical MMO this one.  It has a lot of the staple MMO tropes with quest based progression and the ""Holy Trinity"" of Tanks, DPS, and Healers...it does hold a special place in my heart.   The investigation aspects of this game are amazing and it's quite clear the writers took a lot of time to make sure that you would get involved in the lore of the store they're trying to tell.  Even in the first zone there are missions that require you to understand latin, know 16th Century composers, and be able to determine where to look off of very little info given. While the combat system is rather bland, and it once again follows the typical MMO tropes of follow a quest line through a zone...I can say it held my attention for the many hours I played (Even though it says I've played 14 I have much more then that due to their launcher being derpy.)  I would suggest picking this up full price if you're intrigued about the storyline and are looking for an MMO to try out...or wait till it goes on sale and pick it up for you and a couple of friends. I do however warn you, if you're looking for the typical WoW style gameplay, it's not here.  If you don't like reading, or using your head then the investigation missions might not be for you. (And yes you can look up the answers online...but whats the fun in that?)  "

												An atmospheric horror conspiracy MMORPG with interesting combat, incredible role flexibility, and great character customization. Making character builds and running the fun dungeons are especially enjoyable.+ Fun dungeons with interesting bosses and only few trash mobs+ Many character customization and outfit options, with clothing stores, a barber, and a plastic surgeon+ Unique atmosphere for an MMORPG blending together horror, fantasy, conspiracy, and pop culture+ The mega server structure allows everyone to meet up and play together+ Full interface mod support, with tons of useful mods available- Performance can be demanding, there are quite often FPS issues, with the interface being a main culprit- PvP options are limited and the reward system is still not optimal			"

												Think 'Stranger Things', the MMO. It's got a great story, great storytelling, an immersive atmosphere unlike any other MMO out there, and is very flexible about your playstyle. You can solo your way through, gear up through PVP, run dungeons, all the good stuff. The developers actively push out new missions in content packs that you can buy (or get for free if you're subscribed), kind of like what Elder Scrolls Online does. It's definitely worth a try if you're curious.			"

												Somewhere in a desolate hotel room there's a guy starting to realize that eternal fate has turned his back on him.""It's 2 A.M., the fear has gone."" he says ""I'm sitting here waiting, the gun is still warm. Maybe my connection is tired of taking chances."" Taking a deep breath, he continues, ""Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head. I'm wrapped up in the silence, all circuits are dead. I can not decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy.""  Frustration is shown in his eyes, as he paces back and forth. Then it hits.""Help, I'm stepping into the twilight zone. This place is a madhouse, it feels like being cloned!"" screaming, banging his fist upon the wall of his empty room. ""My beacon's been moved under the moon and star. Where am I to go, now that I've gone to far?"" Soon you will come to know when the bullet hits the bone.""I'm falling down a spiral, destination unknown. A double-crossed messenger, all alone. I can't get any connection, I can't get through. Where are you?"" Well, the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind, this far from the borderline. When the hit man comes, he knows damn well he has been cheated.			"

												You'll have to excuse me because I like to write long reviews.In my opinion ""The Secret World"" is an MMO that does everything right. Solid gameplay with a fantastic questing system. This game doesn't disappoint. Every character you meet feels different from the rest, there's no running to npc's taking a quest and skipping through all the quest text. Each mission you take has its own little story and cutscene. Some quests require you to complete others first, in which certain characters will warm up to your character and tell you more of their backstory, making it feel like your actually making a difference. I can't say much about the story in MMO's as most tend to be okay at best but I actually enjoy this game for its story, it incredibly rich on lore and I feel as if I know more of what happens in The Secret World than I do in real life.Purchasing the expansions (labeled ""Issues"" in the game store) has added much more to this game. A new verity of weapons to choose from such as Chainsaws and Flamethrowers, to RPG's and Quantum magic. With the latest addition of Tokyo added AEGIS armor into the game, which is sort of like a rock, paper scissor combat in which you must match your damage type to the enemies armor type to do damage before you can physically harm them. The Combat system""The Secret World"" eases you slowly into its combat, allowing you to train on test dummies at the start of the game to decide on which starting weapon is best suited to you, then you'll quickly acquire a second weapon which allows you to mix and match up to 7 different skills on the hotbar from each of the skill trees from your weapons, many of which can be mixed together to create powerful skill combinations. At later stages of the game, the combat begins to climb in difficulty adding buffs to the mobs you fight, such as Spectres in graveyards phasing in and out of reality changing their physical and magical damage resistances. With the current addition being the AEGIS system.The StoryIts hard to explain the story without containing spoilers, the Story for ""The Secret World"" is incredibly well written and I have enjoyed every minute of it so far. It has a good mix of serious dialogue with a few jokes thrown in the lighten things up. The characters are written really well, there's a handful of characters that are written so that you can understand them emotionally and then there's a fair few characters that are written so that you will dislike them. Each character in the story is varies from each other and keeps the story fresh and entertainingContent (""Issues"")To a certain extent I feel as if this is where the game dropped the ball slightly. Issues 1 through 6 added a good chunk of extra story to the game and felt as if they were worth the money, considering the most you pay for an expansion is around 10 pounds I wasn't expecting a huge amount of content, but atleast something to keep the game fresh for a while longer. Issues 7-8 felt a bit lacking as apposed to its previous Issues. Issue 7 adds an extra bit of story to the Transylvania portion of the game and was fun to play, but as soon as I found myself having a good time with it, it was over. Issue 8 is where my main gripe is at. Issue 8 included the area, well I should say room ""Venice"". In Venice you can take part in scenarios, in which you must keep 2-3 groups of survivors alive through 3 waves of enemies, with a boss at the end of each wave. The amount of survivors alive at the end of the three waves determine how many ""Seals"" you will acquire at the end. The scenarios are a nice addition to the game, but are incredibly repetitive. Having Issue 8 allows you to take part in three different scenarios, not owning Issue 8 leaves you with 1 scenario to take part in. Scenarios can be completed by yourself, as a duo or as a full group. The maximum amount of seal you can acquire is determined by the difficulty of the scenario you undertake. The easiest difficulty will give you around 5 seals and each scenario has a 18 hour cooldown before you can attempt it, and a 45 minute cooldown if you fail it. In a recent patch the need for getting 80 seals to proceed to Tokyo has been removed to just completing the first training mission in Venice, which allows you to move straight onto the next part of the story. However you can still undertake missions in Venice to aquire powerful gear.All in all ""The Secret World"" is a very well created game with a lot of time and care spent in its creation. I would highly recommend this game to any MMO player and strongly suggest that they stick with it. As each issue adds even better things to the gameUpon the recent patch which changes both the combat, gear and story progression my final rating for this game has changed to     10/10			"

												Best singleplayer pc rpg questing game ever. Also it is online and has horriterrimegaultrabad group content. Play it like a singleplayer game, or duo with a friend and the quests will drop your jaw.There are no character levels in a sense, you get skill points and spend them accordingly to get a variaty of skills from the giantish skill wheel, and ability points to pump into your weapons and gear levels. It's a somewhat neat system, but it feels like it's only really there to overcomplicate the ""no character levels"" gimmick when in reality there are levels because you have to pump ability points into gear levels then you are rated by what level gear you are wearing. One of the main reasons why the group content is so bad, the dungeons have a recommended gear level but everyone at base gear level wants to go in asap and get carried / bring down the group.The multiplayer aspect isn't actually that bad, but the playerbase makes it horrible. There tends to be the elitist group that doesn't allow anyone to join or even try to learn the content, then the OMGLETSGO base level players who want to get carried through all the content. The dungeons are pretty well made, focusing more on movement and awareness then mindnumbing loldps.Now the quest system is a whole new monster. The quest system is built for replayability and actually makes you think and work for it the first time through. The quests are basically placed so when you finish one quest, you should be within earshot of another to pick up, and depending on which quests you choose, your route can change when replaying areas. The quests aren't the normal ""go here"" ""pick this up"" ""defend this person"" quests, these will actually make you think and make use of the in-game browser. The first area alone will make you translate latin, find secrets in paintings and artists, connect symbols to in-game items, decipher a nursery rhyme, and figure out meanings of cryptic messages. For examgle ""Time is the province of Kings and Gods. The hands of time point to truths written by Kings in the words of God.  The path is opened to the enlightened."" is just one of the clues during an investigation mission. All the quests in the game are also given a cooldown when finished so you can replay them and get the full xp again; so you can actually play through the same area as much as you want with no penalty, although higher level area will give better xp so you can get some of the higher tier skills easier.The game is a bit pricey but don't hesitate to pick it up on sale for a steal. Long as you treat it like an online singleplayer game, you won't be dissappointed. The investigation missions are definitely worth it.			"

												This is not a bad game, but certainly no masterpiece.It used to be a subscripton game ($15 per month), now it's buy to play, meaning you buy it and don't pay anything more to play. Well, that's the theory. The problem is that you won't be getting a lot of contents at max level, unless you fork up the money for the socalled Issues (content packs). As far as I know, you get the game with updates up to and including Issue #4, while the rest (currently up to #10) has to be paid for.About questing in this game: it has often been said that this game does not have quest hubs, quests are found when exploring. This is BS. There are certainly quest hubs, and the quest you're supposed to find while exploring, are mostly impossible to not find, since you'll either do other quests in such areas, or move though them while going somewhere else. Many quests counts as ""main quests"", and these have one extremely annoying issue: if you already have one, you can't get another unless you accept that the first one is cancelled.Funcom tried to make a combat system with an advanced skill-up system, but (imo) they failed miserably. Though it's not recommended, it's possible to to go through all the contents while never using more than 2 or 3 abilities/spells at any time. That why many jokes about describing the whole conbat system like this appeared: ""press 1,1,1,1,1,2 - repeat and never change"".So, is it worth it?Well, not the full price. This game if often on sale here or elsewhere. If you wanna try it, grab it then. Imo, the game isn't as innovative as Funcom tries to make it sound. To begin with, it feels new and fresh, but it quickly becomes repetitive and average. And that's when you realise that there are better options out there.			"

												The quests in this game are mind blowingly awesome.  I've played dozens of MMOs and none of them can compare to TSW for questing and environment.  This game knocks atmosphere out of the park.The combat system, however, leaves quite a bit to be desired.  Although the skill tree itself is very interesting and allows for really fun and unique builds, the animations are wonky, combat feels slow and boring.Character generation is also not a strong point of the game, making a character that isn't fugly is quite a challenge.  Good thing there are tons of costumes available in game to help you cover up your ugly mug.Still, that quest system though.  Love it.			"

We see you looking at this game review. Your mind undecided on whether to commit to the purchase or not.

So many things to loosen your grip on your hard earned cash. What's more there is advice we can give, of places you can go to bond with others like yourself. To seek assistance with the things that go bump.Beware sweetling, this is not a battle of good vs evil, those are constructs of human design. No, the moral scope is far more gray than what you'd expect. You are not a paragon of heroics or the bringer of evil....you are merely a bee that is attempting to do what you can to hold Dark Days at bay....however....It's too late for everything is true and Dark Days are here.

												I'll start by saying that so far, The Secret World is probably the best MMO that i've ever played.The storyline is solid, the missions are submersive and even the side missions tie into the main story somehow. It's one of these games where it feels worth doing every possible mission and exploring everything. Some of the missions are rather difficult and will require you to translate morse code, ancient hieroglyphics, binary and the like. There's no handholding involved here and will have you do some true detective work. You are given a In-Game browser to assist you in your investigation missions. The graphics engine works well with the game design and the music is very suiting to the Lovecraftian atmosphere you find yourself in. And as far as i have experienced, the community seems friendly and adult. I haven't run into many other players personally, but i think it suits the apocalyptic mood. It does have a good size player base so the wait for a group event or dungeon is never long.If you want to try out a MMO that is different and engaging? Then you should give this one a try! "

												I'm new to the game, but here are my first impressions.- Graphics are subpar. They aren't TOO bad, but yeah, they're pretty outdated.- Animations are wooden and somewhat awkward. The game isn't that old, so I'd expect slightly better combat animations and smoother character models.- Pretty generic combat. Tab-target, mash keys, watch them trade hits until one drops dead. It isn't that boring, but in this day and age MMOs are moving towards more action-style combat.+ Great setting and theme, with all the secret societies and Lovecraftian monsters. You get to be in the Illuminati and fight Cthulhus. How awesome is that!?+ Engaging and unique quests. Many of them don't hold your hand and direct you to some place to kill some monsters. You have to put on your detective cap and figure things out for yourself. Figure out the code to unlock a safe, hack into computer systems, etc. Or you can pull out the wiki, but that's no fun.+ A huge degree of freedom in the way of character building and progression. No levels, game doesn't pin you to a class, you're able to do whatever the hell you want as long as you work for it.+ A deep and engrossing narrative, which seems to be the main selling point of The Secret World. The voice acting and storytelling are top-notch, and that's saying something because I'm a freak for storyline in videogames. I daresay it's on par with many of the story-heavy singleplayer RPGs of today. It's well-crafted, immersive, and absolutely mesmerizing.So far I'm loving this game. MMOs like this are a real treat -- not a game, but a world to explore and interact with, much like Mabinogi and Guild Wars 2. At this rate, The Secret World may become my new favourite MMO. Its overall style and design is right up my alley.			"

												I can dress like Indiana Jones and whip the f*** out of things. 10/10.       In all seriousness, this is hands down the best MMO I've ever played, and ironically it doesn't feel like one. I've poured every hour I have into this game alone, without friends. It feels like a singleplayer game of massive proportions, with elements of multiplayer. The great thing about the game is that you can play in a variety of ways. Want to solo the entire main game? (Which I did) You can. Want to play through with a group of friends? You can.  The game isn't like any other MMO, your quests don't consist of ""track this enemy, kill 10 of these and then collect  these etc"". You solve actual, real problems in quests called ""Investigation Missions"". The game comes with a built-in web browesr for a reason! The game WILL make you think long and hard, as well as outside of the box. (One mission has you learn morse code!) It's an absolute blast and I can't imagine how much more fun (and easier) it would be to solve missions and hunt down clues with friends. However, there are also your typical combat-based missions as well. The game also covers a vast array of themes and atmospheres- you can go from fighting a zombie outbreak to trekking through a scorching desert. If you're a lore-aholic then you'll be in heaven, the game rewards players for having a watchful eye and putting two and two together. There are also many cultural allusions in the game, too many to count- Although a memorable one is a mission chain in issue 6 that's obviously inspired by Indiana Jones (No joke, you can get the outfit and whip, which is pretty useful!). Graphics wise this is a really good looking game, better than most if not all other MMOS- however I do play at 1440p with max settings. Some areas may look a bit worse than others, but the game holds up fantastic. I reccomend to use DX11 with this game, because there are some truly clever uses of it.     Some people complain about the combat, and I didn't like it at first either- However, once I learned the fundamentals and played for a bit, I find it VERY enjoyable. There's a plethora of different weapons and abilities you can assign to your characters, perhaps the most I've seen in an MMO. There are dungeons and raids as well of course, but if you don't have friends (cough cough) it can be hard to find groups and complete them. This is a shame, because the few instances where I do find a group, it's such a blast to fight through the dungeons. The community is fairly small! I've been playing TSW for almost two years now, and always find myself coming back. The game does recieve updates and new content, however once you complete the main game you'll have to buy what's called ""Issues"" to further the story, which is basically end-game content. All in all, even if you don't like MMOS, I STRONGLY suggest you give this game a shot! TLDR; If your're looking for a good looking game to sustain your attention for a long time, and enjoy solving mysteries in a world that's oozing with lore- give this game a shot. It doesn't feel like a typical MMO!			"

												This game has an Engaging storytelling that is unique to any MMO I have played with cinematic cutscenes for every main  story mission. The mystical, creepy, and even frightening enviornments keep things fresh, Each quest although there are some cookie cutter MMO quest layouts. The overall questing does not feel grindy each quest moves you foward to the next zone and ready to explore something the real thing that stands out from this game are the Investigation quest which force you to use your gray matter and think outside the box to solve AR riddles and puzzles. Combat is basic and is not mindblowing, but its fairly enjoyable. The player customization is fantastic it can feel like a cash grab somtimes, but its completely optional since all clothing is just for a cosmetic purpose.  Community is realy friendly and willing to help you out with many question especially if you join sanctuary chat room. Overall this feels like its own new brand of MMO. I would Definitely recommended.			"

												*this review was written for the original game The Secret World, changes made for SW: Legends changed none of the aspects mentioned*Let me just start by saying that this is by far the best MMO I have ever played and that this game completely destroyed my life - if you have anything important to do, like a deadline coming up, don't get into it. Now, on to the pros and cons. Pros: + Good graphics for an MMO + Extremely immersive, it's got a great story.+ Great voiceovers. + Well scripted, fully animated and detailed cutscenes for every mission (instead of just text and/or NPC voice that you normally see in online games). + TONS of content. + Your faction choice does not impact gameplay, you're not forced to choose a class and there are 500+ abilities to choose from, plus countless augments and effects, making characters really unique and flexible. You can do whatever you want, however you want, with whatever you want. + Very enjoyable multiplayer, the community isn't very large, but everyone is extremely polite, mature, respectful and helpful. No-one is going to call you a noob or any other name if you mess up, and no-one is going to make kitchen-jokes if you play as a female character. I promise you. If you let people know you're new or having difficulties with something, you'll find that a lot of players are willing to give you the equipment they have extra and they don't need, help you set up your build, give you tips or just come and save your♥♥♥♥♥ + Missions are repeatable (with the exception of faction-leveling and some story missons). + Grouping makes the mission is truly a collective effort, meaning that not every single player in the group has to go through the tasks (compared to some MMOs where it feels like playing single player game a few feet away from eachother).  You still have to stay close together in order for completing the tasks to count for everyone. + Extensive DLC once you've finished the main game, and they're totally worth it. + Amazing investigative quests and puzzles that really make you think and depend on your overall knowledge or make you do actual reasearch online. + Tying in with the last +, the game has an in-game browser, so if you get stuck, you have a bug or you want to google for dungeon strategies, you can do it in-game. Cons: - The ""fast travel"" system Agartha is very inconvenient. - Many instances in the story mission are solo instances for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason. Most of the content is playable in co-op (and is much more enjoyable that way), but there is no reason non-faction-specific missions should be solo player.  And yet they are. - In-game items, boosts and modifications are ridiculously expensive to buy with respect to the money you earn doing missions. - Due to the fact that there aren't many players, you might find it can take quite a while to find a group for a dungeon run. It's even worse for lairs, given that you usually need over 5 players to do a lair run succesfully and it's very hard to get people of the appropriate QL together to do them. Unless you're hosting a wicked TSW party at your place. - The game makes you dependent on itself, so expect to spend money on DLC. You'll try to fight it. You'll cry. But you'll also feel like you need it. Meh: +- Combat system is a little weird at first. However, once you get used to it, it's not bad, I've seen a lot worse. +- I'll stick to my point about the investigation missions being amazingly thought-out, however I do find that a lot of them are not completable without the help of a walkthrough. It's cool that they think of detail and challenge, but ask yourself this - how good is your Romanian? Knowledge of Egyptian mythology and American literature? Can you correctly find the Hebrew equivalent of an Arabic word? How are you with Morse and binary codes? What about hexadecimals? Good? Congratulations, you will be able to complete the challenges with your own head. Otherwise...It's still a great challenge to correctly identify the clues and do research. All 'n' all 11/10 would spend hours of my life on this game.			"

Leaving the old reviews is extremely misleading since THIS game has not even been released and the Old version will still be playable. These reviews need to be deleted entirely since TSW will no longer be supported by Steam.  NOT THE SAME GAME			"

												Others have posted highly detailed (and rather excellent) reviews of this great game, so I'll simply offer this anecdote instead:I was surrounded by a horde of monsters, with my health draining rapidly and my end looming closer.  Any hope of survival was fading alongside my depleting health, when out of the blue, some random dude in tighty whities and a lurid green octupus on his head came running through, blades slicing through layer upon layer of foul rotting flesh with frenzied delight.  And as quickly as he appeared, he was gone, leaving naught but a carnage of corpses in his wake.Ergo, I post this review simply to say ""10/10, and a huge thank you to the dude in tighty whities"".

These missions take up a huge amount of time when doing them without a guide, but they are so rewarding once completed. This game is definiately worth the try.			"

												IntroductionI purchased The Secret World (TSW) in 2012 when it went buy-to-play, and have been extremely impressed by it ever since. This is a game I strongly encourage you to play!Disclosures/About MeI've been an RPG fan ever since around 1994, when I received my first Final Fantasy game on the SNES (followed by Chrono Trigger). I've been interested in MMOs primarily for their story and gameplay components. I have a lifetime subscription to LOTRO and was active on there for 5 years. I've played bunches of other MMOS, as well. Of all of them I've played, I can say that this is the one worth getting behind.ValueFrom a value perspective, this is a great buy. The actual games comes with tons and tons of content-- I'm ~109 hours in as of writing this review and haven't even gotten to the content not covered in the base game. The item market sells cosmetics (which you can also easily get in-game) and sell story content. This is great! As consumers, we're not being bombarded to buy meaningless junk (a la Neverwinter and, eventually, LOTRO). If there's content restrictions from the item store, it's on actual story content, and it's well worth the purchase. The developers are rewarded for creating great story content (not system unlocks or gameplay advantages), and us consumers reap the benefit.GameplayTSW is a nice blend of traditional MMORPGss and newer, AMMORPGS (action MMORPGs). There's dodging, but it's very straightforward and doesn't require ridiculous motor skills. The ability to play with crosshairs is a lot of fun. The gameplay is fluid and fast, and is very hard. This is a challenging game-- you won't get bored, but you also won't get frustrated.SystemsThere aren't many systems, but the ones that are there are great. Think of your skills like cards in Magic: The Gathering. You want to build a ""deck"" that is as powerful as possible. There is no respect cost, and a single character can unlock every skill in the game (no classes, although you will probably end up playing the ""pseudo-class"" you want based on the skills you like). More like the Elder Scrolls than any other MMO I've played. Plus, each skill (there are 588, according to a source online!) can be ""augmented"" to change its effects. We're talking a ridiculous amount of customization, optimization, and progression. It's awesome. :-)Warning, though: the amount of depth and intricacy in the systems means it will take a long, LONG time to learn. That's okay. I'm still learning things, myself. You can't permanently mess yourself up, though (since you can unlock everything on a single character), and learning while you go is a part of the idea of the Secret World!StoryThis is not a game that you should play for the main story, although it is good. Rather, the stories of the world are amazing, from Stephen King-- sorry, ""Sam Krieg"" to HP Lovecraft-- sorry again, ""Hayden Montag"". This is a living, breathing universe, and the sidequests are really the main attraction. If you're looking to power through, skip this game. If you want to be a part of something awesome and really dig into the implications, with full voice acting and lots of strings to connect, this is a great game!GroupingI have no idea. Sorry. I'm playing this like a single player RPG, and it's a great game for it. No need to group at all, from my ~109 hours in. I do not know if there is much group content, and if it is good.Closing thoughtsIf you're looking for an excellent RPG to invest your time in, carve out your niche, and experience a great story, this is where you should be. Highly recommended!			"

												I'm going to preface this by saying, that I hate questing.  I enjoy mindlessly zerging dungeon content.I spent 40 hours QUESTING in the FIRST zone with 2 different characters, because I wanted to try a different build...story is AMAZING.  I can't wait to see what endgame content is like, but even if it sucks, the several hundred hours i'll spend playing through the other story content by myself is worth it.			"

												This is for the original The Secret World, not Secret World Legends. As of April 19, 2017, I have not yet played Secret World Legends, but based on the original game, the published information about the new game, and the company that owns The Secret World, Funcom, it is highly likely this review will still be accurate, for me. If you do not want to hear about the special experience of another player then skip this review. I'm saying that because, personally, I prefer to have my own immersion and discoveries. It's important, to me, to play the game the way the designers meant it to be played, ergo it isn't fun for me to hear about solutions to the quests or how cool some event happened before I see the event myself.SELF CENTERED REVIEW FOLLOWS:I've never seen such a game, even a single-play game. The quests are unique and roughly fall into the catagories: combat; stealth; puzzle. I find that I thinking about the game while I'm doing something else and the puzzles are frequently the last thing I think about before falling asleep.Attention to detail is high everywhere. One thing you'll notice early on is the lack of duplicate scenery. For example, duplicate trees or buildings or rocks or fences or boats are unlikely.I'll add some things about dialog later.It's bewildering to me that this game even exists. The design team should publish a paper on their creative-side business management tactics.Recommended.			"

												I've played WoW i've played Guild Wars I've played a-lot of MMO's and None of them have sufficed. I'd even say I thought I hated MMO's as a whole and would never buy another.Then this game sneaks into my life out of nowhere. First time I play it i sink 2 hours into it never touch it again until 2 weeks ago.  2 weeks ago I start streaming this game on twitch and I fall in love with it. i meet new people playing it. i discover I enjoy doing all the quests. I love the spookyness to it. This is one of the best MMO's i've ever played. -pros Great communityExtensive combatspooky atmosphere perfect for halloweengreat clothing options and unlockable gear through just playing the game.Great Dungeonsreferences real life things like left for dead, google, 80's pop music etc.Great Halloween Events.Has unlockable items you can get by playing their other games.lots to do. atleast 100+ hours of gameplay in standard edition though I recommend you get the ultimate edition.Top notch voice acting Decent graphics-consEnemies can be really OP and you'll be forced to take them on 1 at a time to avoid being killed or have a high level player help you.can be a bit overwhelming at first.Confusing puzzles that require you to research vague clues to solve (how ever this is really fun if you like that stuff)In Conclusion The Secret World Is Fantastic for those who hate MMOs or just don't think they'd enjoy them.

												If you're even remotely interested in getting this game for the story, do it. Any interest in Lovecraft, spooky things in general, the what-ifs of the world? Grab it for 70% off RIGHT NOW.  It is an mmo, and the combat can be a turn off at times, but the story is way too good to ignore for such a price. P.S. Roll Illuminauti as your first character, no regrets. I promise.			"

												Easily the Best Questing and Lore of any MMO to date, all of it is extremely well written and thought out. Dungeons are well done; and character customization is fairly extensive and unique.The only Major Complaint I ever had with the game is that when you reach the post-updates end-game you slam into an extra wall of grind that is very tedious.This game is still worth it's price twice over to just to play through the quests and see the Lore; it really puts into perspective what an MMO can be when the developers actually put the time in on the small details.

												Playing this game for quite a while now. Must say, I love this game. I always keep coming back to this game.There are three factions. Though the story stays the same and the results won't really change, it's fun to see the story from a different faction's perspective. The story is amazing, it's very emersive and engaging. It's uses real myths and urban legends to fuel the story. It's good, play it.If you like bees and want to feel special, go play it.If you like to get dirty and love filth, go play it.If you like Ankh, clothing, werewolves, evil Tony Stark Tech, bad people, vampires, classless progression, cool story arcs, interesting plot twist or maybe bees? Go play this game.If none of the above appeal to you, go play this game. It's still good.Pro's:- Amazing storytelling- Myths and urban legends- Classless system (515 abilities)- Be what you need to be at any place and any time- Make amazing roles (Need to tank?? go dpstank, leechtank, mitigation tank, bufftank or healtank)- Clothing is not based on gear- Bees- Giant birds that try to kill you- Everything else also tries to kill youCon's:- Endgame can get boring if you don't play with friends- Sometimes a little grindy- No Tilty or Bob boss- Not enough beesAnyway, go play it.

												Finally an adult MMO that I can enjoy. Nothing is spoonfed to you as TSW constantly requires you to think. There are tidbits of puzzles and many of the tedious quests can be challenging as you will need to find clues/hints to progress (which are not indicated with highlighted items). Some of the mobs are challenging too as they have a specific pattern you have to adapt to (think boss fights in those oldschool Asian fighting games).Some quests even require you to Google answers to puzzles. The lore is a bit jumbled up as everything is mashed up together. You'll get zombies, mages, secret societies, guns and swords in the same game. There aren't necessarily any Sci-Fi lore in the game though (ie. no aliens/technology).The community is still bustling after a couple years which is a great sign. I had expected this game to be dead but it's far from it. I'm sure it'll keep going for at least a decade.I rate this game a solid 8/10. It's extremely enjoyable and refreshing but there are some bugs/kinks that need to be worked out. Some better aesthetic options would be nice (like being able to modify what my facial structure looks like).			"

So beautiful that many quests and missions can beat the very best RPG games or adventure games out there.Its a very well done cooperative game and a very tactical one.Its a beautiful massively multiplayer online game with many genres combined.Play as you like.Its a game where you dont have to grind many meaningless hours and be effective.Its both a cup of coffee and a big feast that you can enjoy with others.Its....the RPG game for me.And it should be for you too.P . S : The combat is something you should get used to and love. Can feel clunky at first but beats many tab-targeted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t out there.The price/performance ratio is so epic that you feel the comfort and content feeling when you get it on sales.AND! dont let yourself sink into walkthroughs online.It's at its best if you make yourself solve all the puzzles and missions.

												The Secret World features some of the most interesting and immersive missions as compared to any other MMORPG. The missions are fully narrated and unique, so you won't get bored reading blocks of text and completing repetitive tasks like in your typical MMORPG. Combat could use improvement, however.Another plus, you don't have to pay a monthly fee to play, and you can purchase additional issues if you want to progress in the storyline further.			"

												First off, I'm giving this game a thumbs down because I am unable to give it a thumbs sideways.  I'm really torn on the game as there are elements that I love and elements that I loathe with a passion.  However, the negative elements are so mind numbingly bad that I cannot reccomend the game.Let's start off with the good.  The setting:  The Secret World takes place in the contemporary real world, except all the crackpot conspiracy theory crackpot secret society stuff actually exists.  Add to that a generous helping of Cthulhu Mythos, and you have a wonderful, interesting setting that's a very welcome break from the awfully worn out standard Tolkien-esque fantasy setting.  The Secret World also features terrific writing and great voice acting, on par with, or even exceeding, many single player games, never mind just MMOs.  It;s all rally interesting and really well done.Also, while the game has its share of standard FedEx and Kill X monsters quests, at least they are dressed up quite well with interesting backstory and delivery.  Plus the game features some cool investigation missions where you are not guided by map markers clobbering you in the face or the game holing your hand and walking you through the steps.  Instead you need to do research, reading lore, looking up figures, checking history of places, and figure out what to do and where to go on your own. (Figuring stuff out on your own, imagine that!)So this all sounds great and it could, and should, be a fantastic game, right?  Well then how come I gave it a thumbs down, then?  Sadly this game features some of the worst mechanics I have ever encountered in my some 30 years of gaming.  I am searching for a word to adequately express just how bad the mechanics are...  I guess ""atrocious"" is the best I can come up with, but I'm not sure it;s strong enough.  I cannot wrap my head around how a game was possibly made with mechanics this awful and how it made it past playtesting.  I can only guess that the person who designed the mechanics had severe brain damage and that Funcom has no playtesting whatsoever.  The combat is awful and boring, and is further marred by controls so poor and unintuitive that it makes combat maneuvering an exercise in frustration.  With enough practice you can sort of get the hang of the controls, but they will never be good or even adequate with any amount of practice.  They are just that abysmal.It's a testament to how great the writing and setting is that I continue to play this game.  The story and writing keep me going.  I cannot reccomend the game, however, with a clear conscience, because the mechanics are just so unbelievably bad.			"

												A beautiful MMORPG.This game is as beautiful as it looks on pictures, but only having beautiful look doesn't make the game perfect, The Worlds are beautifully designed and they look stunning. Like every MMORPG, this one is also filled with items that are look nothing like each other. (I loved how you can use gun and melee together).The best thing about this game is that ""IMO"" it doesn't feel like other MMORPGs like WoW or SWTOR. It feels more like Dragon Age MMO, because unlike other MMOs, this one is story driven, an amazing story that will make you want to keep playing.The only downside of this game is that it got many classic MMORPG elements, which is obvious, but  because of that I believe only or mostly MMORPG fans would enjoy this game for long... non-MMORPG players should aware of the repetitive missions (in solo).9/10 ""Strongly recommended for hardcore MMORPG fans""			"

												Ever since the succes of World Of Warcraft every game in the MMO genre has tried to copy it's fantasy style.The Secret World is the original thing the genre needed.To put it simple,If you are a fan of games like Bloodbore, Resident Evil and Devil May Cry... if you like movies like Van Helsing and Underworld...Or you like TV shows like SupernaturalThis game is the MMO for you. It mixes the supernatural genre with light horror and really draws the player in.The gaphics are simple but pretty.When you fight it actually feels like you are the one doing the fighting, and not just commanding it.The game give you these open area's where you can ignore your main questline and explore and go sidequesting.And clothes you wear don't affect stats. So you can fully decide how you look.Only negative I can think of is that there is no above character chat text. Making you have to check the chatwindow a lot.			"

												I'm not much of a fan of MMO's, while I like the co-op aspect, I find they tend to be too much grind, and not enough story. The Secret World is something else though. The setting is unique and intriguing, full of mystery. Main quests have fantastic cut scenes which bring the world to life. My favourite type of quests are the puzzle quests. They can be difficult to solve and frustrating at times but you get such a sense of achievement when you figure them out. I love that you have to actually investigate, looking up bible quotes, mythology, morse code etc.  "

However, the atmosphere of this game is impeccable. The setting, the ambience and music make it all feel creepy and compelling. At times it reminds me of Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines.The puzzles are also incredibly interesting, often making you look up bible passages, or classical composers.Great game with a load of content.

												I give TSW an overwhelmingly positive 5 outta 5The community is fantatsic. The support is wonderful. The payment modle is fantatsic.I like this game because there are no traditional levels and no classes. You are free to focus on building the character you enjoy. You pick two weapons to use out of 9 total and your 8 active skills revolve around those weapons. You also get to pick 8 passives. Later in the game you get access to a support weapon, of which there are 4, that has its own passive and active skill. And there are dozens of skills for each weapon type. Putting a build together like this is fun and makes you really think about how everything works together. The great thing is you can have dozens of builds all with different weapons and skills. Even different gear.To be able to swap out your build as you need to is a HUGE awesome feature. Go from a dedicated tank to a support buffer in seconds. That's cool.There's 2 sides to this game... one is combat and the other is missions. On the combat side there is normal PvE grinding (which I find VERY statisfying for some reason), as well as nightmare areas that have stupidly powerful enemies you should get in a good group for. There are also dungeons which are group instanced raids of various difficulty.Missions are a bit more complex. Sure there are some 'go kill things' or 'run to X and get Z' but they are done with intresting bachground. The Secret World is telling you a story in every mission you do. You get to an area and have no idea what's going on. By talking to people, doing missions, exploring the area, actually obersving the monsters behaviors, and things like this... well it all offers you a small piece to what is going on, how it came to happen, and maybe even what happened to lead up to this. But it never fills in all the gaps. And it never comes out to tell you this stuff. You as a player need to connect the dots and really pay attention.This same theme is how the famous investigation missions are. They are like riddles or mysteries you have to figure out by doing lots of crazy things: researching a biblical theologian's works; logging into fake websites (which are suposed to be real in game); using goggle to do actual real research... its insane! And so staisfying!!! Presently I am stuck on one of these missions now. Sometimes I put a 1/2 hour into mulling over it. Sometimes I go to the RP social meet-up spot and actually role-play trying to do work on it... showing people my notes and sharing my thoughts asking for loose tips. Sometimes I take my research ideas online and surf real life counterparts to get more understanding about what the mission is about. Sure I could go to a cheat site but that would totally defeat the reason for the game! I can put the mission down and go kill things or do other more casual missions.The other thing I adore about TSW is the cosmetics. You don't have armor. You have stuff like talismens, rings, and charms which are not shown. So every item you see someone in is just a vanity style. The game has a lot of slots for items: head, face, neck, back, chest, legs, etc... so you can buy clothing items in game and mix/ match them up.TSW is a very hardcore game and not for everyone. I am the type to role-play, take my time with things, and really enjoy a story. This lets me do that beyond my wildest expectations.Sure its not perfect and I would love to see certain things added, such as player owned apartments, but its amazing as it is. If my review made you wanna try this game please friend me and I'll give you a free 3-day trial. Of course I get a little perk if you do this and buy the game, which I would appricate. I'd be glad to play with you and help teach you the basics too.I liked this game so much I spent $200 on it to become a grandmaster (lifetime membership).... but please don't be confused! The game is buy to own. There's an optional membership thingie you can get to give you special perks. If you buy the game you never have to spend money on it ever again unless you want dlc. But dude you kvae no idea just how much content is included in the basic $30 game, let alone the $60 massive edition.This is one of my fav all time games!!! I don't play it constantly because a lot of it is very brain racking and hardcore.			"

												""Best money i've spent on a game since Morrowind""This game is unique to itself like no other mmo to date. The ""Leveling"" system is interesting, allowing every character the ability to acheive every role in time.There is no ""Pay to win"" play is free after after initial purchase, with option to subscribe. However, subsribing does not give you ""pay to win"" features or OP items.The cosmetic variety is increadible, rarely do you see two people who look the same.All said and done... this game rocks, dont miss out on it!!!

												From the outset after your initiation, you're chucked into the worst map in the game, no matter which faction you choose. Well I say worst because the rest of them are amazing, and Kingsmouth (or whatever it's called) isn't a friendly place, but once you know what you are doing, and that is 'the missions' you'll start to get the hang of how the game works. I struggled hard to push myself and my coop partner into liking this game at that stage. We did a lot of talking and kept turning down missions because they were all ranked as too hard (which they were not). At the time, pre-steam nearly 2 years ago, it was bugged too, zombies popped up next to you whereever you were, like in the middle of a conversation. But getting through the first map, is what it's all about, specialise in one or two skills (preferably from your faction deck), and you'll never regret it, just think of it as an initiation, like having to sleep covered in toothpaste with your new phrat krew. Gameplay, story, immersion, skill... Soon you'll be lording it up.This is the best story driven MMO out there. Hands down.I just bought it again, so I have it on my steam account. That's how good it is, and now it has so much more content, and scenarios etc... Don't think twice about this one. Oh and the voice acting is amazing, you'll want to hear every line of dialogue, so don't forget to keep speaking to people until the white writing goes grey.And the Music? Dinna nunna ninna nunna ninna nunna ninna nunna ninna nunna ninna nunna...Also, Wendigo Way, and the a'kabs (Which are basically Wendigo's in disguise!)BUY ! BUY ! BUY !			"

												I love this game, and I hate it even more because of that.The good:The idea is awesome. Secret societies battling secret evil in our modern world. The characters look cool and there is good customization. The locations are really cool and each quest is well written and interesting.Investigation missions are great.The neutral:The skill system is not that great. There is little help in finding a good build in game. There is little sense of progression.Crafting is mediocre at best.The bad:Stealth missions are really annoying.Combat animations are wooden and just look bad.Difficulty of monster varies wildly between push over and whoops, why am I dead?Balance between different skills is bad. Some are OP while other should just be avoided.The horrible:Mission design. This is an MMO. So I will play with a group. Why are there so many forces solo missions in this? It is incredibly annoying when you play together and frequently the game sends you into solo instances. You can't build a synergy team of characters since each one of them MUST be able to survive on their own. From a story point it makes even less sense - if our heroes have been working together on a case, why would they suddenly split up to tackle the big baddie at the end on their own?This is made even more aggravating by the fact that there are missions in the main story line that you MUST complete to progress to the next zone that are solo and incredibly hard. So if you can't complete them you can't get help from anyone, you can't outlevel them and come back and try when you are stronger, because you are stuck in the same old zone and can't progress. Basically you can try over and over again until you get lucky or it*s game over. I have no idea why any MMO dev would consider this design wise. Basically you're telling the player 'you suck, we don't want your money!'Yeah, I hate it, but I hate the game.			"

The quality of the cutscenes/voice acting/plot make it feel more along the lines of a single player rpg-esque game. It's absolutely amazing and I could go on forever talking about it.

												Been playing this game for years, and will continue to play it.At first, it was hard to get into (about 4 years ago) when I had no idea what I was doing and no clue where to go - but with any MMO if you need a little help this community comes together in an excellent fashion.There are bugs, there are some things to be fixed; but you know what? The developers are actively listening and fixing things. This is the only community where I have seen one on one face time with Developers, GMs, Community Managers and more. It's one of the reasons why I still play this game, aside from the RP community.If you're thinking of buying this game but unsure? Why not catch it on a sale when it proffers the Complete edition for 70-70% off? Pay only 20$ where I, paid hundreds to get the content when it came out! (i.e. = Issues are about 10.00$ when they come out for standard issue. C.E.s are about 15.00$ ) Type of game where it has no classes, no levels (only ranks - up to 13), where you will eventually unlock everything and will be able to do anything your heart desires. And of course the storyline is superior to boot. I've never been so invested in wanting to see a new expansion but man everytime it does it's better than the last - in my opinion.TL;DR - Maybe not a game for everyone, but it's a damn good game.It's not your typical MMO.It's the Secret World.

												This happens to be the only mmo I’ve played where I’m not screaming into a pillow while I mindlessly grind terribly boring quests (yes, better than SWTOR), in fact I love questing in this game. You’ll want to take your time leveling up and exploring areas, the game actually encourages this by limiting how many missions you can do at one time; one main mission and three side missions. If you’re a chronic min-maxer and feel you  must  race through the leveling as if your life depends on it, there’s nothing stopping you I suppose but you’re missing out on what TSW does best and that’s story, lore and unique characters. As a returning player who hasn’t played endgame content from issue 12, I can’t comment too much on it. Despising the aegis system myself, I might be a little biased since all content from issue 9 uses it. Community is small but great. While questing you probably won't run into a lot of people, bonus in my books really.TL;DR: If you want an incredibly immersive experience filled with lore and fantastic stories then try this game.Edit: Looking at their steam store page, you'll see they've only listed the collectors edition for some issues which are priced around $30 (cheeky). The standard version of Issues can be bought through the TSW store for roughly $10 (1200 funcom points), so fear not, it's not as insanely expensive as it looks.			"

												I am a huge fan of the original game, ""The Secret World"" and have over 350 hours of gametime logged despite only joining the community in the last year or so.  The changes implemented in the beta for Secret World Legends are attrocious.  The core gameplay has been gutted and simplified, and all at the expense of the devout fanbase that has continually bought content for the last year with a promise of future story material which turned out to be a blatant lie on the part of the developers.  Instead of creating new content as a reward for the most recent grindfest updates at end-game, they have decided to relaunch and have all of that previous grind lead to absolutely nothing.  This would have at least been just moderately disappointing if they had not taken away the entire skill system that made the game worth playing, and instead replaced it with garbage.  I will never give Funcom another cent of my money after this.  Oh and if you are even thinking of buying this ""new and improved"" version of the game, just consider this.  This relaunch is being headed by the same person that launched the NGE for Star Wars Galaxies all those years ago (aka forever killed the game and is regarded as one of the worst MMO updates in history).  They are implementing the same crap decisions here, and it will end with the same result.  STAY. AWAY.			"

												The Secret World is basically two games that when mashed together create something incomplete and unpleasant.The story and writing are great, especially the writing. This is a game that if you take your time reading the quest fluff you'll be surprised. Okay, the story isn't THAT great afterall, but I think the setting really benefits the way things happen as you progress. Given the moment I got through the first ""world"" which took maybe 40 or so hours I felt great about it. The moment I went into the second ""world"" Egypt I felt things slipped almost immedately.This and the combat especially are where Secret World starts falling apart. For as much as you can solve quests with knowledge (or the internet) and figuring out what this Moorse Code is pointing you towards or what these crpytic clues mean, the combat is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's clunky and requires you to have up to date gear as well as skills that are inclined to the opposite of what you're doing. That is to say, the skill system is very large and freeform and it actively hinders you if you do not follow a guide. Trying to peacemeal skills you think you want makes things take longer and fights anywhere from teeth-scrapingly close to utterly impossible.These problems are exponential when trying to complete known ""faction"" quests where it expects you to have gear WELL beyond what you can conceivably have the moment they give them to you. It quite literally took me a week of off-and-on grinding to have the ""right"" skills and gear to even compete with the enemies I fought.When it hits it hits. When it misses you're sent straight up into space. Give it a try when it's cheap to experience the writing but don't expect a WoW killer when it comes to combat.			"

												Unbelievable game. I've played RPGs all my life and I've never had as much fun as I have with this game. There's a huge amount of content, the areas are deep and interesting, and every NPC has a lovable quirk that makes interacting with them memorable. I can't stress enough how detailed the world is and how critically that supports the gameplay! Also of note, I've found the art to be a lot less sexist than in other games; rather than chainmail bikinis and hulking dudes in tinsuits, the avatars are a lot more realistic and understated.Outside of the artistic aspects, it plays similarly to any MMO that you're used to. The skill bars are short (something I prefer). Interestingly, only 7 of your skills are active, and 7 are passive skills that are hidden during normal play. I'm just beginning to understand how deep the level of character customization can be.A very unique feature is the investigation quest, of which there are many. These quests give very little information at the outset and ask you to solve a puzzle, follow a trail, dig up some old mystery, etc. They are very challenging, and each time I play a new one I'm surprised again at the ingenuity of the game developers.This is an absolute STEAL at $30. I have only two problems: first-time startup was rickety and required some setup tricks on my part, but that took about 20 min to fix. Second, the game world is low on players, so you'll spend most of your time questing alone if you don't play with a friend.			"

												This game is just slightly different than any other MMORPG. It's nothing unusual from FunCom. They try to do different game mechanics for every title. And here it is. I love the idea of TSW (modern day, conspiracy, rising darkness,...). When I played it first time (in beta) I was excited. I just said ""I have to have it"". At first game had lot of bugs, but I think that is already ok. What impress me really much, was choice of weapons. You can choose between magic focus (blood, elementalism, chaos), melee weapons (hammer, sword, fists) or ranged weapons (pistols, shotgun, assault rifle).Dark days are coming. Three powerful organizations have to join forces againts rising darkness. People with special gen awake their hidden powers. They have to choose for who they will fight.What will be your choice? Templars? Illuminati? or Dragon?Advantages:+ No levels, no classes, no limitations (you can switch everything in one moment);+ graphics (visually amazing);+ impressive storyline;+ every character has it's own voice and every mission, which you get from them, has cinematic;+ puzzle solving missions;+ inspired by H. P. Lovecraft.Disadvantages:- Low number of players (when you want to go in dungeon, you have to wait longer time);- DLCs (but I understand, that maintenance need money).			"

As far as i see, this game breaks all standards in MMO games genre. There are no similar game to compare. Freaking Cool Environment, Encounters and its paradise for everyone who loves questing and puzzle stuff. I'm not saying that this game is better than game ""A"" or game ""B"" e.t.c, but definitely The Secret World deserve very high rating. And it's truly amaze me when people saying like ""TSW is like - blah blah blah"". Tell it to my mom, the TSW by far is - Not Like. The game is quite unique in terms of character progression and all stuff like crafting and tallent system with mote than 500 active/passive tallent points available to learn. As i said, there are No similar game(s). At least i don't know any. Resume: Cool Game.There are no subscription fee required now (actual on Jul 2016).			"

												First of all, it takes time to get use to this game because it's very different than the other mmorpgs at the moment.The Secret World is set in a modern-day real world under attack from occult forces.The story inspires a lot from H. P. Lovecraft's works, the Indiana Jones franchise, and Stephen King's novels, and the player's character joins one of three world-controlling secret societies which are the real life myths;  Templars, Illuminati, or Dragon. Like many other MMORPGs combat is move based.The character is totaly free to redevelop their abilities on the go because there is no class system,you can use every weapon, every skill on the game just by learning those skills from the abilities screen.And to gain that ability points you just need to play the game thats all! ; killing mobs,doing mission,dungeons,pvp everything gives you ability points to purchase skills.Therefore, a player can be a tank, a healer and a dps at the same time just by changing his skills on the action bar. You can only use 7 active skills.			"

												I tried playing during beta, and at the time it just didn't hit the spot.  I'm not entirely sure why; much of it was the same, although not as polished, and less forgiving.  When the Ultimate Edition came out, with all the expansions, etc, at a discount, I figured this would be my second try.  I really have not been able to stop playing since I got it (except sleep and food, begrudgingly).  If you want a new MMO to be addicted to, this is absolutely it.  Pros: -Atmosphere (horror/arcane/Lovecraftian/gothic - whatever you want to call it) - it's genius-Combat - fast-paced, fluid, not tremendously punishing (although not a walk in the park either, which is nice).  a ton of variety-""level"" progression - it really is very flexible.  Do what you want.  -gear and aesthetics are completely separate.  I love that I can change clothes like I do in real life without affecting my ability to cast blood spray at zombies.  Fickle and vain.  <3-Story / Characters - this stuff is very well developed.  In some ways it may have worked better as a single player game, but there have been a lot of times where another person has come along to save my Dragon hide, and it was great.  -A LOT of variety in quests.  Obviously a lot of killing and a small amount of collecting.  BUT, the investigation and stealth missions really take it up a notch compared to most MMOs I've played.  You will almost certainly need to go online to solve stuff! (built in browser).  There's also creative use of crafting during quests.  Cons: TBD.  JK - I do have some cons.  My biggest thing is really just my general dislike of MMO enemies and story progression.  The constant respawning when you least expect it, the ""grinding"" if you have to backtrack through an area, the lack of change in an environment, even when you complete major quests.  These are not even remotely unique to TSW, but to me they are major detractors.  Remember that time you reinstalled a huge set of wards and destroyed the source of enemies in zone, progressing the plot and saving the entire institute?  No?  You can't tell because there are just as many enemies and none of the wards work after 2 minutes.  MMOs.  Womp.  Leaving MMO-general issues aside, I love this game.  I really highly recommend it if you think the atmosphere/story sound even remotely cool to you.  You (hopefully) won't be disappointed.			"

No other M.M.O. has such an engaging storyline. There's a reason that S.W. is still going strong. The only negative that I can think of is that it's only available for P.C..

												Please be aware that the reviews as of March 29, 2017 that are being posted on The Secret World: Legends are actually for The Secret World which is a separate game no longer available for purchase because Funcom is halting development of The Secret World to rededicate all development resources to the relaunch of The Secret World brand as The Secret World: Legends.With that in mind, I obviously can't provide feedback for a game that isn't even in closed beta yet.  What I can say is that the relauched version appears to carry over the lore and story line of the old The Secret World and that I would rate that lore and story line as excellent.  So take this recommendation with a grain of salt as that is all it is based on.  The game play, mechanics and quality could end up being exceptional or awful or anywhere in between once this is released as an open beta or full release.			"

I noticed quickly that if you are not playing with friends, you will likely not be playing with somebody other than yourself. The community seems so tight knit to the point of toxicity. If you do not know exactly what you are doing on your class/abilities/build you will be sorely paying for it. PVP seems to be plagued with the 2-3 players than know EXACTLY what they are doing and in result... 1 shot everyone and everything in their way. Making it nearly impossible to have fun while still riding that learning curve. It also seems to me that the Dragon faction will rule Stonehenge and El Dorado (whatever they are called) and the illuminati will rule the Fushang Province (however it is spelled) Leaving the Templars to scrap together a rare victory on occasion.The bag system seems to fail med game due to an increasing amount of lootables/rewards making it a 1-2 hour ordeal to clean your bags and make them viable once more.The PVE dungeon system is a tad bit out-dated, Leaving an old school WoW feel. You either need to walk to the dungeon or be summoned there. There seems to be endless trash mobs inbetween bosses. The bosses feel like they are immensly stronger than they should be for the level you can enter the dungeon. In conclusion, as a F2P MMORPG I would say it is a good time waster if that is all you plan on doing. I would only recommend this game to someone who wishes to waste their time.... I would NOT recommend this game to anyone looking for an enjoyable experience that lasts till the end.P.S. If you don't like my review, don't read it again?  "

												This is probably the most immersive MMO I've ever played, and it's grabbed me like no other. The atmosphere and writing often remind me of Bloodlines. In a lot of ways, it's less like an MMO than a really great singleplayer RPG.Also: this game has a built-in web browser because you're going to need to do actual web research in order to solve some of its puzzles. That's super awesome.			"

												Tl;dr at the bottomI've spent about 300ish hours in this game and I have to say it is one of the best MMO experiences I have ever had. I like the combat in this game and it was pretty easy to get used to...The only hard part was trying to figure out what skills work best with others and which passives you should equip to best compliment your build. If you're anything like me, this is very confusing but thankfully the community is nice enough to share builds that help in any stage of the game. Some of the builds work better in certain situations and you could possibly be switching builds depending on the fight ahead of you. I made it through most of the game without much help, as I am a bit hesitant to socialize with other players for fear of being classed as a noob. I just recently made it into Tokyo, however, and found out that none of my previous builds were working out for me. So I started experimenting with different builds that I found on the interwebs and still am having a hard time, especially with the boss-type enemies that have 2 different aegis shields...The Missions in this game are very engaging. From when you click the button to start the quest to the response you get from your faction leader after you finish it. The cinematics and voice-work are very nice and you miss out on a huge part of the game if you skip and don't read/watch them. Then there are investigation missions. Before you start this game, I would recommend you buy a notebook to take notes in as even the smallest bit of information in these mission-types is a potential clue. That is, if you want to solve them by yourself. If you need a bit of help with these, there are guides on the internet that can get you unstuck or if you just don't want to waste time, can get you through the entire mission. One of my favorite sites for this is Unfair.co (I believe is the address). This site actually explains, in detail, the steps they went through to solve the missions and what hints you should look for.Now onto the RP element. This is the most disappointing part of this game for me and it makes me really sad. I love this game and in many games that I love, I love to RP. They have a pretty big RP community with a website and everything to post events. I've gone to a few of these events, and have tried to involve myself in the group. With me being a very new player to these events, it is hard to find a place to fit in. I have walked up to random people that were RPing and led with a whisper asking if they wanted to RP, to which they would usually respond yes. We would then engage in the RP which would usually end up with me RPing by myself, getting 2 or 3 word responses from the other player. After a while, I noticed that the RP community is very closed off to newer people. People only seem to want to RP with people they know and it in turn leaves me standing by the bar, sipping on a drink and ♥♥♥♥ing around on my phone, hoping someone would come talk to me since me talking to them never seemed to work.Recently on Fridays, the developers have been doing streams on twitch, playing through the different issues and answering questions from the community. I went to the latest one, which they had giveaways going on to win either Funcom points or the new Franken Chopper. I actually won the Chopper and was so excited about it. I would love to see more of these events in the future of this game. It's always amazing to see the developers get in there and interact with the players and to see them play their own game.Tl;drI would recommend this game to every one of my friends. From the combat to the story-telling, this game is amazing. The community is usually very helpful and the developers and GMs are also quite helpful. I haven't done any PVP but I hope to change that in the near future, when I understand the mechanics a bit better.			"

												I'm on the fence about this one, because there really is a lot to like, but also flops where it counts. Overall this is worth a shot on sale (I got the ultimate edition 50% off, sale seems to happen regularly). The bonuses are all right but nothing to write home about, you get a selection of free starter weapons that you'll replace within a couple hours, a couple costumes, and some ability earning bonuses, but the real reason to get ultimate is so you don't have to buy the chapters (up to 11) separately later. I'm not there yet, though, no where close. This is a game where you can sink a lot of time and always have something to do. There are side quests galore, plenty of lore to read, and even if you're just trying to charge through the main quests, you're in for a pretty long haul. That said, it can be a bit overwhelming, sometimes repetitive, but in fairness, there's minimal grind, it's more of a journey. Go into this game with that mindset and you'll have a great time.Note that I'll be changing or adding to this as I sink more time into it.PROS:* Extremely diverse ability system that you can change up on the fly. It's worth noting that you just keep on getting AP, there is no respeccing because it's not necessarily needed. Also worth noting that many abilities/passives from trees of weapons you aren't actively using can still be equipped--it'll tell you if it requires the equipped weapon (or related skill). There's lots of cool synergy and theorycrafting you can do, one could spend a very long time just sitting there making builds.* The bulk of your experience gain comes more from completing quests, rather than grinding mobs. On one hand, some players may dislike this approach, but it strongly encourages you to engage in quests rather than mindlessly grind, and I'm okay with that model (though quests could have been executed better--more on that below).* The atmosphere is delightfully spooky. The music, graphics and sounds come together very well; you feel like you're the star in an episode of some supernatural show. On that note, some of the enemy designs are very heeby-jeeby inducing, making it all the more satisfying when you kill them.* Voice acting is on point, and there's a TON of it, some voices you may even recognize either from movies or other video games. Seriously, check out the IMDB for this game and look at the list, it's baffling how much talent they got. Notably, they even got horror film legend Jeffrey Combs for a couple voices (who you'll hear very early on if you side with the Illuminati).Now, sadly, here's where I have to rip on it. I say sadly, because these points are pretty major, and detract from what is otherwise an enjoyable entry to the genre.CONS:* Combat. This needs several bullet points to fully explain, because it's a lot of little things that add up:-- No auto-attack. You pick an ability that builds your resources and have to spam that. Feels kinda clunky. This is especially hindering in situations where, say, you catch a nasty lag spike or somehow disconnect, when fighting something so easy an auto-attack would finish it while you're d/cing--nope, you reconnect dead. Fortunately lag spikes and graphic stutters aren't TOO common (and of course can always be blamed on client-side issues), but they do happen.-- Lack of variety in animations. Abilities only have one animation, and most of them are shared with other similar abilities.-- Unsatisfying and awkward sound effects. Sometimes they're on point, but most of the time it just doesn't seem to match the action. In general combat just doesn't feel... tight, I guess would be the word. Things are happening, health bars are going down, but the action all seems disjointed.-- Final note: While the combat does have its issues, it mostly just takes some getting used to. Despite all the disjointedness and repetition, it can be entertaining.* Graphical stutters even with lowered settings and a decent rig, an issue which I'm seeing echoed in other reviews. Apart from being annoying, this can be lethal in many encounters, especially since you can't rely on an auto-attack to save you by the skin of your teeth. Strange thing is, these stutters will happen at the weirdest times, even when there's not much action on-screen. Fortunately there's not really any penalty for dying.* Player characters all look very similar, outfits and hairstyles aside. Couple that with the repetitive animations and you really disconnect from that sense of uniqueness. * Some quest triggers are confusing, and oftentimes you're able to do things before you're supposed to, requiring you to trigger them again somehow. This has yet to break anything for me, but has left me scratching my head on occasion.* Key items specific to quests take up inventory space, and sometimes there are a lot of them; frequent trips to banks and vendors are highly recommended. This wouldn't be so bad, if...* ... you could actually delete quests! That's right, there's no abandoning a quest once you've got it. All you can do is put it on pause to ""make room"" for another active quest/mission, but those key items for that mission? They're not goin' anywhere, forever sitting in your inventory, taunting you to complete that quest. What's worse, I've even picked up key items for quests I don't even have and don't know where to get, and you can't delete those items either.NEUTRAL:* Quests and missions are a mixed bag as far as entertaiment value. Cinematically, they're often fantastic; animations, script, voice acting, the works. Some of the dialog is so convoluted though that you'll be fiddling the ESC key to skip if the guy says anything else blatantly obvious. Gameplay-wise they can be sort of underwhelming. Most side-quests are simply ""go here and kill X mobs,"" with some random stuff mixed in, pretty standard fare for an MMORPG, but they're usually pretty well executed. This is where the grind comes creeping in though, since some kill-quests are rather lengthy, and on top of most mobs having a b*tch-load of health, can be tedious. Missions aren't much different but always have at least one gimmicky element to spice things up. Investigation quests can be fun, but frustrating, and will often lead to you simply looking up the answer online after scratching your head over them.* Speaking of which, I'm not sure how I feel about practically *requiring* players to look things up online for clues to the answers when they can just as easily look up... the answers themselves, but at least they provide an in-game browser. Still, it's a pretty ancillary feature, considering it's probably faster to just, y'know, use your out-of-game browser. It's not like we're not already on a computer with internet. Whatever.OVERALL:This game reminds me of a hodgepodge of some of the best (and worst) elements of other MMORPGs. It's like a mix of SW:ToR (another EA title), City of Heroes (now discontinued), Guild Wars (skill system) and, well... not sure what else. The puzzles and overall secrecy are very unique to this title--a title which the game strongly holds up to. Cinematic production is fantastic and worth it for that alone, but gets shadowed by the awkward, repetitive, and often very formulaic combat (i.e. you will always be doing the same skills in the same order with your build until things die, occasionally using a defensive move). But at the end of the day, this doesn't stray much from the tried-and-true MMORPG formula, so it's hard to complain; I might be a bit jaded from years of this stuff. Customization nuts will have a blast, and the atmosphere is executed brilliantly. So, overall, the good outweighs the bad, and it's worth giving a shot when it's on sale.			"

												This is my POV after 9 hours. I realize there's a lot I haven't seen yet. Overall I like this game but boy does it it come with a lot of annoyances.Pros:- there is no better game with a conspiracy theory plot- there is no better game using Lovecraft- if the writing is taken as such, it is very solid and enjoyable- while there are plenty of games with a lot of 'cool', the 'cool' in this game is pretty enjoyable- a whole lot of content from what I can tellCons:- everything is 'cool', so nothing stands out- everything is a conspiracy, so nothing is mundane- everything is Lovecraft-ish horror, so nothing is really horrible- the missions are very linear- the UI is clunky and confusing- the combat is boring -- while there are a lot of options, they all feel the same- the character jumps like in a platformer- the puzzles of the game require a lot of attention (this could be a plus, just not my thing)- the graphics engine is appalling, I would expect much better FPS for this graphics quality- I had to install an injector just to get halfway decent antialiasing, and getting it to work was a painI give it a 7/10 despite the long list of cons. I have the Ultimate Edition with all DLC, which I bought for 18 EUR. As of now, I consider it money well spent.			"

												I need to play this more.Edit: I played it more.*Can't quite classify it as a normal MMORPG, It has the elements; but a better taste.*You get tons of skills and whatnot- But you are limited to two items and a handful of active and passive skills.*But you can change the presets whenever you want pretty much.*The best part of this game is it's storyline; Makes you think about that is real and what isn't, what matters in life most, and what does not. * It keeps a dark H.P lovecraft feel with a perfect balance of humor and seriousness.* Makes you realize americas government is filled with a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.-MAKE SURE- To read every report when you finish a quest or side mission, and watch every cutscene; It contains (hands down) the best storyline for a game of this genre.

												This game is huge, a ton of hours worth of game play in just the first two areas. But you're also send requests to go to other places while you're playing depending upon your level, where you are and if you are playing solo or with others.Exploring turns up new quests, rare items and even more instances to check out. Customize your avatar to how you want to look, update your wardrobe by getting more clothes and accessories. Update your gear and try out different builds.The point system allows you to customize your avatar to do spells, damage or AoE damage, ranged or up close damage - you choose your style. Play your way, choose your path!This is a really cool game, love the replay ability and the vast wheel of choices to build on. Plus they've got some really cool perks too. Free offers and brand name items, like a Steam brand clothing, TSW brand clothing and all sorts of cool vehicles, weapon styles, accessories, non-combat pets and more.My only wish is that the pets were combat not eye candy. Would love to see my wolf go after some poor target. It's nice to have a furry companion who'll watch your six. lolDefinitely recommend this game, even got a few others hooked on it. Makes for lots more fun too. I would highly recommend getting the Ultimate Edition due to all the special items included in it, but also because it has a lot of the content to play for a long time. Several dlc chapters are included in the UE so you won't have to look for them. Save some money and get it on sale! Excellent deal on how much you get for the price.			"

												First of All ... the Story .. .Contrary to All other MMO's there is NO GOD complex here .. no ego tripping , you are not a hero , you are part of a story , you are part of a faction a group an army of defenders divided into factions that barely can keep up with the happennings and current events within the Storyline. Am i not the hero in there ? No you are not the hero barely a witness of the impending doom within the story line one of the many actors within the story . You are not the chosen one , nor are you the hero at all . This alone is rare feat in MMos and in terms or storytelling.In this game you are not the hero ; The story is the hero and it is a mighty engaging story , the lore of the story is complex and so are the missions , certainly some of the missions look simple enough , kill some monsters , send report , done and on to the next one . But investigations missions will make you research , think and whereas there is a deep rich amount of help the community will be glad to provide any new player , expect a game where the going can get tough at times without help. The setting goes from Myth of Cthulu to the most action oriented genre into a modern setting. You will explore and discover the conspiracies animating a long and complex history within the Secret World , Feuiding corporations vying for domination , Engineers of chaos willing to bring the coming of a new age and blindsided to the fact that their own stated goal may lead them to their own destrution , Discipined Army of soldiers , general and commanders , looking at the slightest bit of evil as a pausible cause to scorch the Earth to bring it into a new Eden of their making. And yet something much darker lurking in the corner of your eye and seeping through the reality of the story , the present players are in over their respective heads and even the Council has little grasp on the vastness of the events at hand.  Classes: THERE ARE NO CLASSES. There are no classes at all  within this game which make it a whole different ball game than any other MMO , your equipment has statictics and following those you will perform either grandly or poorly within your assigned role . The skill system is rich complex and deep , the fighting is hard and complex don't expect your tank to stand still in a fight facing a boss .. don't expect to stay immobile in a fight , expect to dance around the objectives , minding the telegraphs impairing the critical casts avoiding chain damaging your companions, Now the Community: As an Mmo TSW stands pretty much by its own , it is dedicated to a mature audience , most cabals (guilds) expect high repect from player to player and that is valid and enforced accross all cabals i came in touch while playing the game. Ok those are the positive points: Now for the so so part : Game optimization : While TSW is a great game the client-server relationship does need a lot of optimisation , PhysX support is close to nil for most of the modern Video Cards and there are some persistent issues concerning multi threading within the game.  This game will run fine on most settings but if you run at high resolution and like DX11 in its full glory. The game at the present time does not leverage multithreading and in complex event PhysX might revert back to CPU calculation rather than leveraging the full power of your graphic's cards PhysX capabilities. This will not interfere with gameplay but during raid and evnts but is still a concern time of this review. The GM's and Customer support at Funcom: Let me be clear the GMs will address every concern and question and will be helpful within a matter of minutes , they will not leave a stone unturned on the matter and will be nothing short of helpful within their powers. Development and content delivery : If you expect timely and regularly timed end game content you might want to be patient with the company, on the other hand a beginner within the game will have a LOT to go through before reaching the end potential of his / her own character , take your time , explore around and do not ever forget to help others , i was a simple noobie once and i still go in normal mode dungeons to help new players get geared up on a regular basis. Don't close yourself up in one branch of the skills , you can learn them all and lack of specialization is something you will appreciate as you go through the content. The bad part : Events . One word can sum them up ... LAGGGFEST .. the lack of optimization to modern multicore machines really hurts the performance of the game at the time of this writing this can be mitigated by turning off some of the effects and turning those back on when out the event zones.  There are specific channels within the community server to that extent. I hope you have enjoyed the reading and remember this is not about you being the hero this is about the story and YES it is a hugely complex intertwined storyline that will keep you at the edge of your chair at each custscene .

												This is the MMORPG that gamers say they want. Deep story, total control over your character's appearance, interesting missions (quests), challenging, skill-based, etc.The only thing I have to say to newcomers is that you need to forget what the typical MMO has taught you about zone progression. TSW has you progress from area to area within a zone, extending the amount of time you spend in a place, and it really helps connect you to that part of the world. Each region is made up of 2-3 full zones, and each zone has 6-10 areas within it that you will progress through.Gamers have been complaining for years in other MMOs about throw-away zones that are forgettable. TSW addresses that, but the tradeoff is you're going to be spending more time in those zones.Now, let me save you the 5,000 word essay I could (and would) write on Investigation Missions. They're the single best thing I've ever seen in an MMO. It's like National Treasure and Da Vinci Code had Rosemary's Baby... and it's GLORIOUS.I can't believe a game this smart even got made.The dungeons are rich and story-driven, and look spectacular, no generic hallways filled with scaled versions of normal mobs. These are hand-crafted and very memorable. Raids/Nightmare mechanics give you a LOT to worry about, and will keep you on your toes. This is not Sinister Strike x3 > Eviscerate raiding here. The mechanics are not very forgiving, and if you screw up there's a good chance you'll just be a smear on the floor.TSW isn't afraid to remind you that while you have special abilities, you're not all-powerful :)11/10Note: Actual playtime is +200hrs or so, as I didn't initially own the game on Steam.

No dialogue all cutscenes, tons of different weapons, all quests optional , good dodge system, great graphics and performance. Can't say enough about it, the most important thing would be the gameplay style, it's definitely grungy, creepy and filled with horror, so if you're a lover of all that stuff, BUY THIS!			"

												A pile of weird puzzles, intersecting storylines, and the folks running about the world trying desperately to keep or shove the genie back into the lamp. It not the greatest thing ever, but it's solid. Open character developement does leave the problem of how to advance, but it also gives you a fair bit of freedom to tool about with. The voice over quality pretty good, the little flourishes, refferences, and side stories all add to the feel of the world. It's a madcap little world, one I enjoy playing in.			"

												A very good mmo. The fact you create your own class by first choosing 2 weapons and then 7 active and passive skills means the combinations of builds are large and varied. Good plots and atmospheric too. Worth a go.			"

												It has good moments, it has bad moments. But this game's over all mood is better than most MMOs. Not to mention finishing stories actually effects the areas you save. Also one of the VERY few horror MMOs that actually make you feel nervious as you never know for sure if you can walk away from a monster fight, despite having supernatural powers yourself.			"

												I recommend this game principally based on two things: the ability to role play and the environments.If you are a vetern of mmos then you know that possibly the most important thing in an mmo is the ability to make a character which is an avatar of yourself and to be able to get into that character and role play it. If you can't do that then you are simply grinding quests into oblivion. If you can do that then ""you"" are grinding quests into oblivion but you don't care because it is fun.Now there is a relationship between your character and what you kill. The mobs in The Secret World are reasonable. You won't see any bizzare Korean mythical hybrid-fairy mobs which you could never possibly give a damn about. Or I haven't seen any yet anyways. The first mob you encounter are locals turned to zombies.I regards to roleplaying your character the game has clothing shops in one of the major cities (London) where you can play Mr Dressup and rig out your wardrobe for which ever environment you currently questing in.The environments of the game are present day environments. e.g. the first you get into after your starter city is a small town in Maine and the surrounding back woods. Running around the backwoods of Maine with a sledge hammer and pistols is in my opinion fun.Those two things in mind you should be able to get your character to the end of the game and if you do then your hours spent playing vs. cost ratio should be pretty good.Concerning combat: combat is pretty basic. You get seven slots to put abilities in. You can equip two main weapons. The game uses a combo point builder system similar to a rogue in other games. You build to five points and use a finisher (some finishers use less points). Of the seven combat slots you get it is most likely one will be used for a single target builder, two for single target finishers (one for each weapon), one for an aoe builder, and one for an aoe finisher. So of the seven comat slots you only really get two slots for whatever situational skills. It is likely one of them will be a healing skill. Consequently combat is pretty simple however if you roleplay your character it should be more than rather, rinse, repeat. You also get seven passives to compliment your seven combat abilities and these 14 together will constitute most of your theory crafting and the goal you set for the combination of skills you eventually want to achieve in your dream build. I would not recommend looking up a cookie cutter build in a forum while your are still doing the main quest but rather theory crafting your own otherwise it may become a mundane and anxious process.Concerning questing: quests come in a variety of types and the type of quest is indicated by a box symbol at the quest giver. There are your basic kill quests which never seem to get old. There are sort of covert ops quests where you have to try to infiltrate an area with minimal combat. These can get somewhat old but for the most part stay reasonably fresh. Same obstacles typically but spread out differently. Then there are investigation quests which are fun initially but eventually get very, very old. The investigation quests have two problems in general. The first is the are not necessarily solvable either through intuition or through a process of deduction. Often trying to solve them is trial and error or trying to discern the authors intent. The second problem is they can become quite laborious. Even if you know how to solve a particular part of a quest you can spend a good deal of time translating a piece of text from one language to another one letter at a time. These quests however typically give the most exp so if you want to put in the labor you can. Or you can simply look up the solution online which is very often what you will do which sort of spoils the quest because you are looking at what to do online and then doing it; often times again and again.This for the most part is the secret world: questing, roleplaying, theory crafting in modern environments. I haven't reached the endgame yet but I wouldn't expect much from it. I wouldn't consider this game a race to the end(there isn't really a level cap in this game in the traditional sense. I believe your gear has a level cap) but rather a journey where you try to milk what you can out of the content. Maybe the endgame is good I don't know I'm not there.			"

												It's like if The X-Files was written by Steven King and H.P. Lovecraft. It is amazeballs.But it is TOUGH. Not for people looking for a casual and laid-back playing experience.The lore and characters are brilliantly written, with fully animated and voiced cutscenes given out liberally for every major mission. They're HIGHLY entertaining, and worth sitting through. The NPC's come in a vareity of delightfully demented flavors, ranging from 'listen to the teddy bear, he knows what he's talking about' to 'we kill monsters, make them into sausages, and eat them'. This is not an exagerration. These characters literally exist in the game. It's a treasure trove of character personality.The world is a suffocatingly gloomy work of dystopian art. It LITERALLY OOZES with darkness and creepiness in places. You'll see. I lack sufficient words to describe it. You'll see.9/10 only because it's not an easy game for new players to get into. There's a helluva learning curve.But if you love the paranormal/supernatural/horror genre?Welcome home.			"

												The Secret World is an interesting title. It's very unique in it's own right while still feeling very much like a normal RPG would. TSW allows you to join under one of three different societies (Iluminati, Templar, and Dragon) and each come with their own set of story, characters, and game world hubs to explore. Outside of these faction-specific hub zones are regions. And boy, there's a lot here. The first place you'll come across is Solomon Island, which contains three distinct locations all ranging in size. The maps are massive, and there are tons and tons of sidequests, main missions, and story missions scattered about. From what I know, there are three or four different regions each containing two or three different areas to explore. Your quests all range in both gameplay style and type. So let's break them down one by one.Story Missions - This are quests that follow the main story of the game. How you play it is up to you.Action Missions - Displayed by a symbol of a man running, action missions are exactly what they sound like. This is where you get to do lots of murdering, defending against hordes, and getting into dangerous situations.Sabotage Missions - Marked with the symbol of a timer strapped to dynamite, these missions are a more stealth orientated. You'll have to do such things as sneaking around enemies, cameras, and even hacking.Investigation Missions - These missions are marked with a laptop. This, in my opinion, is the landmark mission type that sets TSW apart from the rest. Investigation missions utilize the game's world, as well as its assets, to deliver a rich detective experience. Problem solving and a keen eye for detail are a must. And, sometimes, they really push your brain to the limit. Don't look up online guides for these or you're going to ruin all the fun. Some of these quests type involve having to follow clues, or having hints dropped on you, figuring out passwords and stuff of the sort. Sometimes you actually need to hit up Google and start doing some research in order to find what you're looking for. It's that kind of immersion factor that makes you really feel like you're actually working towards something bigger and unraveling the mysteries of the world.Dungeon Missions - Marked with a purple icon with 3 figures standing. Dungeons are, as you'd expect, hard. I've only played through one dungeon, and from what I can tell you pretty much go through treacherous environments that can harm you fighting multiple bosses until you finally get to the last boss. Then rewards ahoy!Item Missions - Marked with a box. These sidequests are not given by NPCs. Rather, they are objects you find around the world (such as a postal van) that grant you the choice of a side quest. They usually tie together with the main story missions.There's another called Scenario missions. I haven't gotten a chance to play those yet, but it seems to go on a pass-fail basis depending how well you and your party performed.Despite the good, TSW has it's draw backs. For starters, don't expect a TPS experience if you choose to use guns. They play out exactly as they would in an RPG. Your skills under 1-7 are what makes your weapons work. Apart from that, the party system has two really lame issues. The first comes from a lot of quests taking place in solo instances. It renders the whole point of a party pointless when you can only advance a certain quest tier by going into a solo instance. Just as well, Funcom also decided to make a gathering loot a game of chance. Sometimes if you kill an enemy, an uncommon or rare item will appear. No one in your party is allowed to take it. Instead, a bar shows up with 3 button choices, ""Need, Greed, or Pass."" Choosing Greed or Need will cause you roll a di (the number goes to 100 I think). Whoever gets the highest number on their roll wins the item. It's a good system, in theory, but it's also a little annoying. I much prefer GW2's method of just having character bound drops for every member of your party. Although having this system gives off the feeling that working together with other members of different secret societies is more like a fragile alliance rather than friendship.Combat in TSW starts off really poorly. Melee weapons and Magic tend to be more offensive and do a lot of damage to enemies. And the abilities you get can really pack a punch. Guns, on the other hand, start off rather weak. And, alone, its incredibly hard to play with. It's hard to avoid getting hit because you have a very limited dodge function. You can only dodge once after, I think, a 15-20 second cooldown. This makes confrontations alone with guns rather annoying because you can never keep your distance. Once you gain new abilities you'll be a DPS machine. Of course, the way to do this is to level up and get crowd control abilities. But expect to die a lot and work your♥♥♥♥♥off.The story is nothing short of a miss. The concept sounds cool, and the world is excellent. The backstory and lore stuff is really interesting. I haven't gotten much into the story, but what really breaks it for me is the writing. Cutscenes, which happen at the start of every quest given by an NPC, drag on and on. And since your character is mute, sometimes you'll just be listening to one guy blabber on about something for over 2 minutes. This wouldn't be so bad if the writing wasn't so laughably awful. Characters tend to reference stuff that exists in real life, and make pop culture references left and right. Seriously, the head honcho of the Iluminati compares the organization to XBOX but ""more hardcore."" What does that even MEAN? There was a secret man who was well spoken but would occasionally drop meme bombs like, ""all your cameras are belong to us,"" and ""I am disappoint."" These quips don't get me immersed in the story. Rather, they suck me out of the immersive experience. I get that the game is set in modern times and in our world but referencing stuff that exists in real life causes players to think about real life and that breaks immersion.TSW originally started off as a subscription-based game. That was dropped once the sales were too low. Now you can just buy the game and play forever. However, the game does have an item store. This store contains various items like clothing, boosters, weapon moulds to give your weapons a cooler look, pets, accessories, etc. You will have to drop some cash if you wanna make your character look like a badass. Thankfully though everything is reasonably priced. Special outfits only cost a little under $10, and bits and pieces of clothing run you about 50 cents to 2 dollars a pop. There is a subscription system, though. This subscription model grants you 1200 funcom points a month, as well as veteran points for more exclusive items, a special item of the month, and other various bonuses. I don't know how much of an advantage it gives. But I've been playing without it and I seem to be doing okay. Even if I am dying quite a bit.In conclusion, TSW is a blast. And well worth it's asking price. I would also highly recommend the RP servers. Ya know, if you're into that sort of thing.			"

												TSW takes a different route from most MMOs by not taking us some medieval fantasy world or the far-flung future but instead keeps us right here at home in the modern era (with some serious occult enhancements of course). I am still not sure at this point if TSW is taking content directly from Lovcraft's stories or just drawing HEAVILY on them. Regardless, the early parts of the game feel like they would be right at home between the pages of his book. The enemies in the game are pretty different from what you would find in other mmos, at least visually. They aren't repeated so much as to feel stale, but they share enough common themes that you can look at a mob and know roughly what you'll be up against.Now for the meat of the game; Do you like class systems? Do you crave adhering to a set of archetypes; playing a sword and board fighter or a swift rogue? Well tooo bad, this game abandons the class system, instead allowing you to specialize in certain weapons, from the hard hitting shotgun to the protective embrace of blood magic's barriers, this game has a little something for pretty much any playstlye (Don't worry meatheads, you can still hit things with sticks). Just because there's no class system doesn't mean that you can't play as a tank, or dps or whatever. In fact, where most MMOs or RPGs would restrict you to choosing one, TSW allows you to mix and match 7 abilities, 7 passives, and 2 weapons. Like the passive from the fist tree that ups your crit chance by 15% but don't wanna get your hands dirty in melee combat? Feel free to use it with your fancy assualt rifle. There are a total of 9 weapon types. Each weapon has 2 'inner' paths that must be maxxed out to access the 6 outer paths. Each path has a mix of 7 abilities and passives. I don't think I need to do the math to tell you that there are a ton of options for kitting out your character. All in all the skill system in this game is easy to use and let's you make a character that is uniquely yours.The only real problems with this game are as follows:It suffers from the same problems as most MMOs: Quests can get repetitive (Kill 10 of enemy x) although there are plenty of interesting quests availible. Because it's an MMO, story doesn't feel as important or persona. Group play is required for a full experience, which  I guess is par for the course for mmos.There aren't a whole ton of people playing. I don't know if that is because I chose a low population server? Or if it is just because the game is less than popular, but it can get a bit lonely, and a bit difficult to find friends to raid with if you didn't bring your own.Some random good stuff about the game:Dungeons/Raids don't just have a stupid amount of enemies followed by a boss, instead they have a ton of bosses followed by a super boss. This means you don't have to wade through slightly stronger versions of the enemies you've already been fighting! It also means more drops!All main quests are fully voice acted apart from your character, some of the people are interesting, I particularly liked the  native american guy and his disinterested teen niece playing chess and mangling metaphors while hordes of Ak'Ab and Draug overran the Town.Enemies are interesting. Sure you start out fighting zombies, which I guess are pretty common, but pretty soon you'll be fighting things like wendigos, fish people, and weird giant bug things!The game is fun. I am normally not a person who enjoys the bland washed out feeling of mmos. But this game did it for me.There are mission types which require no combat, and mission types that require honest to god problem sovling, critical thinking, and an awareness of lore! Note that Funcom has set up websites that you need to visit and explore to solve certain quests. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ That took me for goddammed ever to figure out.Instead of armor deciding your look, you get to choose what your character wears. Defensive stats are derived from occult talismans and lucky chamrs instead of pieces of metal or cloth.Sorry for the rambly-ness of this review, but I hope I get my point accross. Game is gut, it's only 30 bucks, it's worth the money.			"

												The Secret World is pretty crazy. It has a really high level of story presentation and character personalization, comparable to some offline RPGs. Also, the intro for the Dragon faction totally sucked me in. Maybe it's because I was able to understand the Korean and Japanese NPCs even without the English subtitles, but yeah, it totally felt like I was living through some surreal dreamscape version of my own life, except with a few more Lovecraftian horrors. It IS a freemium game, but it seems that the money extras are largely cosmetic, and not necessary to actually survive.			"

												Describe The Secret World in a sectence? A refreshing take on the MMORPG genre.The Secret World is not an MMO for everyone, and you either love it or hate it. It features a very interesting classless, leveless system in which you truley can be whatever you want to be. With numerous weapon combinations and deep character customization in terms of abilities withing those weapons, TSW makes you feel unique in your character. But the true enjoyment of this game is not in the game mechanics, but rather the dark and beautifully crafted world in which you play in, and the deep story you are immersed in. TSW borrows elements of Lovecraftian story elements which is downright awesome as well as super mysterious. I was told when going into this game not to play it like a traditional MMO, which at first alarmed me, but after the first few missions, I saw how rich and vibrant the story was, and how I felt like a part of this fascinating world which I couldnt wait to rip apart and explore every secret and every detail. In terms of pricing I find it very generous, as many Subscriber-based MMO giants (I'm looking at your WoW) charge heavily for the base game, its expansions plus the monthly fee, whereas TSW is quite fairly priced as a base game, has very cheap DLC that in my honest opinion I would pay double for it and have no qualm, and has a subscriber system but is very different to MMO's with the same system such as SWTOR, as it merely adds cosmetics features and a shop currency allowance (Funcom Points). All in all, I give The Secret World a 9/10, and is by far one of the most enjoyable MMO's I have ever played, and I thoroughly look forward to continuing to play.TL;DR Thoroughly enjoyable MMO, evenly priced, lovely game world.

												I normally hate MMO's (huge fan of the Elder Scrolls series, minus ESO, dissapointed with that) and this game had a fan of single player open world RPGs in awe!  Fills the void that's been needing to be filled with modern day setting meets magic & legend (which I had hoped World of Darkness MMO would have come out, oh well).  The game features unique approaches to everything, akin to first person shooter (w/real time combat), leveling through skills & equipment rather than an overall leveling system, and the quests!  OMG the quests! You acutally get to use your brain to try and figure them out, not just go here, kill/steal/plant this etc.  Puzzle solving based off real world things like chemical formulas, book passages & movie lines, historical events, etc. make for an incredible experience that really takes you into the game.  The only down side is the rig req.  If you are getting this game you will absolutely need the recommended (and really better off over rec.) rather than min. req. (I tried min initially and even with all graphics turned to 0 was getting 10-15 fps and super lag, and on just under rec. running 2.3 ghz quad rather than 3 ghz quad, w/ 6g ram & 1g video, still catch lag in multi like groups and pvp).  If your box isn't running quad 3ghz, 8g ram+ and 1g video+, upgrade before buying.  Aside from that, AMAZING GAME!			"

												A mediocre MMO, but a great single player game with social elements. You have to go into this game with a certain mindset to really appreciate it. Do you value well written quests, a well told story and an interesting setting with good characters? This would probably be right up your allyway, if you can deal with the clunky combat. If not it's best to look elsewhere.---MORE INFO---Dungeons are extremely fun and among the best I've played in any MMO game so far. Community is also among the best and is very welcoming and helpful to newcomers. Be sure to /chat join sanctuary when you log in. As I mentioned before, combat is a bit clunky and slow and it can be a bit easy to screw up your build. They added decks a while back that make it easier to follow a certain skill path that can fit what your looking for. Quests are spectacular and are not your typical MMO fare. Some of them are actually quite intellectually challenging and will have you solving puzzles and using the in-game browser to research information. The lore is also very deep and if your big on sinking yourself into a good story, there's lots to find here. End game unfortunately doesn't seem to be very big, it's more about the journey then the goal in this case.All in all, TSW is a niche title that will satisfy a certain subset of players. If what I said sounds good to you then it is definitely worth a shot. You may request a trial key over on the official forums (or here, on steam) just to try it out and see if it is for you. For a new player there is a lot to discover and do. Hope to see you in game!			"

												I will admit. I was very surprised by this MMO and originally did not think I'd ever play it. Thanks to a Steam flash sale, I purchased the massive edition (with a few extras thrown in and some of the expansions.. called Issues, btw) for my brother and myself and tried it out. It's fascinating and unique. Edgy voiceover dialogue and discussions, pretty involved quest/story lines, class-less/level-less system, nicely rendered atmospheric environments all in a modern/urban setting. Funcom did well with this so far. There's a slight learning curve and might not be the easiest or the best game to start with for an MMO newcomer. For newcomers or vets alike, stick with it. The community seemed mature, decent and helpful (at least on the server we chose). And we saw our fair share of players running around in the starting areas, the travel nexus (called Agartha), and the first mission zone we were travelling in. There were default notifications about activity in the PVP territories too, so it seems like the game (at least on our server pick) has a decent amount of traffic and population.Graphics (8-9) - DX9/11 support, FXAA, tesselation, good graphics options for the workhorses and the slow ponies. Some character models are nice looking and some are just ugly (like SOME of the NPC's.. good lord, comb that hair)Fun (9) - Puzzles, engrossing questlines, decently fleshed out NPC's, class-less/level-less, fashion options.. wide variety of playstyles supportedSound (8-9) - Fully voiced NPC dialogue/cutscenes, Random NPC voice chatter, good atmospheric mood background music, appropriate sound effects, nothing fancy thoCommunity (8-9) - Decent population sampling for areas we've explored, specific chat channels set up for things like ""Mission Hints"", etc. and rather helpful, mature, decent chatter in the channelsPerformance (8) - I have settings turned up to Ultra on my semi-beast of a machine. I got the occassional lag in some areas, that I haven't quite isolated as graphics lag or connection lag. I'm leaning towards graphics lag due to the area I was inValue (8-9) - B2P (pay for the game, don't have to pay a monthly subscription fee). There's optional membership sub for added bonuses, there's an item shop you can buy things with cash (mainly cosmetic fluff and some value-added consumables), I got massive edition for a steal on a flash sale during the summer sale 2014, but overall the pricing is good with all that's included compared to other MMOsService (8) - The account management site is a little outdated and piggybacks off the old AO account management look and feel.. not very informative or user friendly and can be confusing at times. But you don't spend alot of time in there so I won't penalize the score too much.VERDICT: So.. to sum it up, I'd give this a 8-9 out of 10			"

												While I Don't have many hours in, often games first impressions makes or breaks the game.  I have been intrigued by this game for years, but never really looked at it when it was first released.  Since it is F2P and the initial investment for the game is low I thought I should give it a try.  I knew from research that this was not a normal model of a MMORPG as the normal leveling model is not used.  But instead we get a Skills based game in which you control how you play and how you play it.  While I am no where near the end game I understand that synergies between skills are very important and how you build is important as you move through the Game.  The good news is if you screw up, go back do some more farming and tweak the build.  You are shown a interesting opening sequence that starts the story, it takes awhile to get through, but does set up what is going on nicely.  You are treated to a breakneck speed Tutorial that gives you some basics about the game.  But if you are familiar with most other MMO's and how they work you can get through it fine without much fuss.  Then you are dumped into London and told to go off and find your HQ, there you select your first weapons and skills and are sent out into the world.This all works well and the graphics are as good, if not better then more of your standard fair MMOs.  Game play is pretty intuitive in terms of movement and combat skills, The Complications set in when you try to figure out the Skills and abilities.  However, thanks to in-game help and a good community forum I was able to select a combination of skills that would give me some good DPS and Survivability for the opening area in New England.  If you love the walking dead, you are going to really like the opening quest line.  The traditional gearing up is not the same as most MMOs it uses talismans to adjust your stats, as well as your weapons, clothes are just costumes and only add cosmetic looks.  The only con is the learning curve, while a familiarity of MMOs helps, reading the forums and various guides also help, but maybe a stronger tutorial area where  you get to see things like crafting might help.  All and all, if I did not have to go to work I would be still playing.  Reviews were a bit mixed on release, but the game seems to have matured and many of the issues in the early reviews have been addressed.  So my advice looking for something a bit different give it a try.			"

												Best and most underrated MMORPG. Lovecraftian/dark fantasy/occult theme with RPG gameplay and NO subscription fee. Arguably strongest lore of any game, immersive with fantastic environments, tons of content, great community, compelling writing/characters/voice actors, fun for casual and hardcore MMORPG players. Fun single player missions as well as group raids, dungeons, and scenarios.One instance of customer support was very helpful. I am always delighted to buy content-rich expansions to the core game, which are numbered Issues (they're up to #10 now) and support the developers. One of my all time favorite games.			"

												I find this game a rare treat, where crusading and cross-dressing are both valid responses to the oncoming end times. Items and costuming are optionally separated, so you can fight werewolves in kink-wear and cyber-wear with equal efficiency.Two words of advice for the beginner players: in the Ability Tree are the starter decks, stick to them until you've finished the Inner Wheel. It'll give you insight into how  a deck should go. Also, don't specialize your Skill Trees too much. The game's designed to improve each weapon generally concurrently and you can sort of snooker yourself with not upping every skill.			"

												It has a unique setting, great atmosphere, challenging/unique puzzles in the form of investigative missions, it's free... and unlike GW2, it doesn't crash my comp.Gotta say, my only major gripe is the questing system (can't cancel quests by the look of it, can only have -five- total with -one- main quest and 3 side quests, along with one overarching ""zone"" quest) and the fact that the character creation options can be kinda -eh-.Still, highly recommend it.

												An awesome mmorpg that pushed the gameplay scope past what was usual for such games. I played quite a bit of world of warcraft and while it has a lot of end-game content, the questing was typically extremely boring because each quest played the same way. The secret world has a lot of variety in quests (Called missions), there are story missions, combat missions, sabotage missions and research missions. The game itself is based on real world myths and mythology and the research missions showcase this the best. You use an in-game internet browser often to research specific subjects. It can range from relatively simple puzzles to huge research undertakings. Story missions are specifically related to the overall story arch, combat missions are more like traditional quests that you'd expect in an mmo, sabotage missions revolve around usually stealing intel or destroying points of interest without being spotted.As far as combat goes, it's responsive and pretty fun to play. There are no classes, instead there is an ability wheel that you can unlock entirely. You are restricted by your hotbar, which you can equip a single set of passive/active abilities restricted further by the weapons you equip. My only real complaint is that typically if you want to do PVE dungeons as DPS, you will have a difficult time in the high end dungeons compared to ranged dps.The game has no subscription, it relies upon expansions (called issues) which add more areas and missions to the game, as well as lots of cosmetic options. And last but not least you can play as the Illuminati, Templar, or Dragon. While many mmorpgs have a 2 faction world, the secret world has 3, which all work together except in PVP scenarios.Even with a somewhat lacking/restrictive endgame PVE, I managed to spend 300 hours playing this game before reaching the end of the main storyline (not including any of the DLC). This is the only MMORPG that I could ever recommend at this time.			"

												It's definitely an interesting game. Not for everyone. I will not go into the details (there are tons of a very good reviews already), just add my own opinion.I like that I have to read/listen the quests and think. I like that I can select how much I have to think (investigation mission might be too much after a hard day in the office, for example, but I can skip those to the time when I feel like scratching my head in puzzle). I like the story, voice-overs and atmosphere in general. Combat system is not extraordinary, but fun enough to explore and combat itself is not boring.The system requirements for a decent performance are a bit tough, considering what you get in visuals. The price of the whole package (base game + all the DLCs) might be a bit steep. I am not sure how much fun is the ""end game"" - doesn't look to me as a lot right now.So, overall - worth to take a look if you want something different from ""most other MMOs"" and if you like story-driven gameplay. During the sales on the base game it becomes ""must try"" option in my eyes. :) Just be sure to check system reqs (should be no problem for a reasonable _gaming_ rig, but be careful if you have something more office-oriented or old. ""SWTOR runs on my machine fine"" doesn't mean TSW will).			"

												A game where the story shines. The lore is indepth as any early Bioware game. In game graphics are great. Excellant voice acting. Cut scene CG, meh. I have spent over 350 hs in the game with only one character. Between SWTOR, Diablo III, Guide Wars 2 and the Secret World, I hardly have time for my console games.Character creation and skill/ability wheel is easy to use. By the end of the original issues (1,2 and 3) your 2 favourite weapon abilities will be maxed and you can use your further abilty points to invest in different weapons.Then you will get the use of an auxillary weapon and now with issue 9, you get the AEGIS system.Bottom line. If you like the X-files and supernatural themes, this is the game for you.			"

The setting and plot are gorgeous, I would tell more, but don't want to spoil anything. If you like conspiracy theories, H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, post-modern literature and urban legends and would like to play an immersive MMOm than you should check this out. The Secret World is different from other multiplayer RPG's.P.S. There is no stupid grinding in TSW, which is a sickness for most MMO games.			"

												I'll admit, this game doesn't have a good first hour of gameplay. However, after you findout how in-depth the skill tree really is, it opens up ridiculous amounts of possibilities. They need to have respecing available though just incase you♥♥♥♥♥♥up bad on your skill tree. You feel rewarded after playing though unlike many other MMO's (After the first hour or so).There are two skill tree's in the game. One for Skill points (What level of weapons and armors you can use) and ability points (What abilities you can do). The amount of experiance to fill the experiance bar does not change through out the game, however, the number of skill points and ability points does for better abilities and stronger skills. You earn 1 skill point for each time you fill up the experiance bar. And as the experiance bar is divided into three sections, you also earn 1 ability point for filling up each section of the bar. Some people might ask why this would even make sense to do this. The reason is because they want to be innovative. A more rewarding system. Instead of getting 1 skill point for killing a billion enimies for doing 10 long♥♥♥♥♥quest's, you earn a bunch of ability points to spend along with skill points which makes the game feel much more rewarding.If you stick to the game and choose a weapon that you think you'll enjoy using, you're much more likely to enjoy the game. Let's say that you want to use the assult rifle as a weapon, but also you want to use blades and you're stuck between the two, why not choose both?? You can have two weapon that you use where you can mix their abilities together to kick some major♥♥♥♥♥I would reccomend this game, esspecially if it goes on sale again.			"

												The world is not what it seems. For every civilization that has existed there are people who work behind the scenes making it tick, or toil. Behind them is the mystery that reaches into places we've never been or even imagined. Danger lurking and the unknown beckoning you to investigate. Dig too far and you might end up buried and forgotten or you might learn what few do. Imagine a world where everything that you thought was not real existed, man and monster. All of those mystical places each with their own calling. Do you join or not and if you do, then who? Enter yourself into The Secret World.The Secret World is a mature themed MMO right out of a graphic novel. It involves mysteries of the kind that you'd not likely imagine and characters and worlds beyond. Its graphical features are truly amazing as are its cut scenes, dialog, script and voice talent, all of course mature rated. This is the MMO that I've been waiting for a long time and it fits the bill perfectly. I cannot give away much more than to say that if you've ever been curious and found that you had a unique calling, you need to experience it.- It is great as a multiplayer experience though it is not required to enjoy the quests as they scale to team member count.- The music, atmosphere, voice acting and cutscenes are all top notch and yes it does have them but they are part of the narrative to the rich story this game possesses. This adds to the overall experience so this is more than just a loot grab. This has a story and a background. Something that you can learn from if you pay attention. Like a good movie or book it is a testament to the artform of great story telling though you are the story as it develops.- This is not a money grab in terms of it being an online game with F2P aspects. You pay up front for the client and it comes with a great deal of adventures and experiences. You can play the whole game without buying a thing in the store but there is a point to the online store, that helps but it is not required to enjoy the game. You be be just as powerful without purchases as you can with, its just a matter of how quickly you progress and how cool you look (vanity). Vanity as we all know in online gaming is becoming its own artform and expressive language.- There are multiplayer quests and dungeons that benefit from team work, but they are optional quests that do not detract from the main story line. Optional.- The worlds to explore are huge and with so many quests that you will likely miss many along the way so the replay value is high as is the play style.- Decks are a system of building your character according to archetypes that benefit your character in different aspects plus providing a cool look for your character and other archetype specific gear. A great idea reminiscent of class kits in dungeons and dragons.- It benefits from team play for sure as you can level much faster as a team. When teaming as I've mentioned, the quests and scale in difficulty so the gameplay doesn't become easier but requires team work.Did I say atmosphere? This game is oozing with atmosphere in so many aspects it is incredible. If you are a fan of the X-Files or Coast 2 Coast, you want to play this though it is not really a conspiracy theory type game but delves into the mysteries of the unknown for certain.If you decide to open the door to investigate further, I highly suggest taking the time to look over the decks system involved in picking a predefined archetypal role for your character as there are benefits.

												This game is a joy to play.  Don't get me wrong, it is not without its flaws...  Poor optimisation (especially DX11) chiefly amongst them.  But the fact that I am a huge fan of Lovecraft alone bypasses that.But the game itself?  Very few games have been made where you don't 'have' to do much combat.  Especially MMO's...  In fact, the games combat is fairly bog standard tbh...  It uses the tried and tested formula (mostly, there are also area attacks that deviate from this) of clicking on a mob and pressing number keys to kill them.  But, active dodge and moving during charge attacks at least livens it up a bit.But the game comes into its own with the investigation missions.  I recall one in particular, quite early on, where you find a van with some ID in it and have to use an actual website to search for clues.  I'd never seen this in a video game before, so it kinda blew my mind a bit.  A game incorporating things outside of it's programming...  Not really seen it since either to be honest!But, some of the investigations take minutes or hours, by hearsay, I've also heard some people can spend days on some...  So, not always to be taken lightly.Another fantastic point is the 'class' system.  Or, lack of one at least.  Buying skills and making a usable skill set out of them means an amazing amount of diversity.The size of the game is impressive also.  I believe I paid £15 back when I got it in a sale and out of it, so far at least, I have gotten almost 100 hours.  That's not bad going really...  I've barely even made any headway, out of all that time, I am still on the first area, yet to explore the rest of the game...I can't comment on PvP however, as I have not tried it yet.All said and done though, it's a much slower pace than most modern MMO's, so if you're used to the likes of WoW (not meant to sound like a hit at the game as I do still play it), where you do a few quests, then move on to the next area after an hour or two, this may not be for you.  Like wise if you like structured classes that immediately declare what 'role' you will play.But on the whole, I would recommend this to anyone.  Especially those who are interested in games with deep, interesting lore and also any fan of H.P. Lovecraft.  For the latter, it really is a must.			"

												All the urban legends and conspiracies are true! The Secret World pits players against horrors beyond belief, in scenarios inspired by classic film and fiction. The premise is exciting, but is it worth playing? Well...in a word, no. But that's a rating I need to clarify.It does have some interesting areas, enemies, stories, and especially the unique experience/ability/skill system. The voice acting is generally good. There's plenty of tongue-in-cheek, which helps it not to take itself too seriously when it shouldn't. And what music it has is very good.It's easier for me to talk about where I feel TSW failed. First and most importantly of all, the factions are all horrid packs of asslords that you will not like...how original. I understand they're going for 'realism' -- which, to clunky writers means 'unlikeable people' -- but it's been done to death, and here it just puts new players off. They're instantly confronted by people they have no real reason to do anything but work against, no matter who they pick. Given, after the introductory missions, you won't have to deal directly with your faction very much at all for long periods of time, but making it a pillar of the game itself was a mistake.I think it's a major problem of MMOs that so many have resorted to shoehorning characters into militaristic factions that not only don't make sense but aren't appealing, and it doesn't even matter the setting; they still do it regardless. If this really needed to be a part of the game, it should have been closer to endgame where a player chooses, based on interactions up to that point, which faction they will support. TSW's premise is one that would just work so much better if the player were an unaffiliated character, slowly figuring out the factions and figures behind the scenes, perhaps communicating with unknown parties...unknown until much later in the game. With how little part faction plays for quite some time, it really would have been much better to take that approach, as well as more suspenseful and engaging.As for writing, it's absolutely awful. The introductory missions are so abysmal they're often embarrassing, and some of them are offensively sophomoric or uncomfortable in clearly unintended ways. Characters are obnoxious 'just because', and they're not even believable or realistic in their presentation. It's pretty much a mass collection of people you are designed to dislike, which destroys any real willing suspension of disbelief.The character development systems are interesting and robust, but even though skills and abilities are given video tutorials, there are other systems in the game that players are left to sink or swim. Items accumulate in the inventory without explanation, and even though a shop presumably for kits to use them can be encountered, no effort is taken to explain. Similarly, certain gameplay mechanics go utterly unaddressed, such as dropping missions you don't want to complete (you can't, only replace them), or how the game expects you to approach the stealth-oriented missions (which it only informs you are stealth-oriented and gives you no real information on how they're different).And speaking of those stealth missions, avoid them like the plague. While the battle system and skills/abilities are actually refreshing and robust for the most part, the game is not nearly solid enough to even remotely allow for the kind of precision and demanding that they require. There are also a number of occasions where a player will find himself instantly blown up, with no explanation as to why or how it could be avoided. Nothing is explained about these overly picky missions, and they're frustrating and worthless. They don't fit in TSW anyway, but there's no effort to introduce them to the player, and as a result they just end up even less likeable.The tracker is okay, if a bit too approximate. It'll lead you to the area, but highlighting of key interactive objects is very poor, meaning you might pass by an essential item a few dozen times before happening to notice it. While I understand the need for not making the objects too incongruous, they end up being annoyingly hard to find and blend into the scenery. It would be nice to have an option to make the objects more noticeably highlighted.Speaking of options, it would also be nice to have the option for subtitles when people speak, for those of us who are hard of hearing or simply can't understand what some of the voice actors are saying. Sometimes there are subtitles, sometimes there aren't...There are no recovery items or boost items that are made clear initially either, so it can be a bit overwhelming for new players to become used to what's going on. The introduction to battle, a dream sequence common to each faction, doesn't really help much and, like the rest of the intro sequences, is incoherent and fairly useless except for raising questions it has no intention of answering.The game itself is something that can be enjoyed if you can tune out the poorer aspects of it. Battle is usually fun. Exploring the environments is enjoyable, and they're given a lot of personality. The player characters aren't super-customisable, but they're not bad. If you avoid the stealth missions, most of the others are fun. The stories of the locations -- what I'd really call 'modules' or 'regions' -- are pretty interesting, even if the overarching story is the opposite.TSW is one of those games that has such potential, but it doesn't actually manage to achieve much of it. It's frustrating perhaps most of all because if you can see that potential, it's terrible to see it fail again and again to actually get there. The result is a mediocre game that I can't really recommend to anyone without a lot of caveats and disclaimers. If you really want to try it, get it on sale and give it a try. I just can't guarantee you'll think much of it other than an occasional time-waster with pretensions it isn't able to back up, and that's a pity because it could have been something so much more special.

Story is deep and rich. Grabbing a quest, and not reading it could spell death to you.

The MMO aspects weren't quite as good but they weren't what drew me to the game in the first place and after going through the story and falling in love with the game, they were good enough to keep me playing for a long time.So why the negative review and past tense? Because whatever is available on this page right now is a reboot- all the positive reviews and user score are for the first incarnation of this game, not whatever is available here now.			"

												The Secret World is not a perfect game, but it is a game that is actually trying to be different. Packed with story and challenge, the game rides it's Chthulu-Conspiracy Noir to the hilt. The community is solid and (mostly) beginner friendly, and it's short comings early on have been mostly fixed although non-gamebreaking bugs are still common.I won't say it's for everyone, but it's a solid game that will appeal to many.

												(HEY! If you just bought this game in the sale, there's some noob tips at the end of this to help your experience!)If you want your 100% typical MMO experience, where you have to skedaddle your way through highly-obvious grinds and lock into a class and settle on things, don't play this game. The Secret World (TSW) is a game that obviously experimented in every field of MMO gameplay for the sake of standing out. And in my honest opinion, it worked out. The first thing you'll notice is the missions. They did a really, really good job on the missions. You're pretty much taken on a journey from the second you're forced to find your way to your chosen faction's HQ. By the way, Factions only affect main storyline, pre-made decks, where your HQ is, and PVP by the way. A lot of people use them for roleplaying purposes. You can do most non-faction quests regardless of faction. All main missions and ""storyline"" missions are fully voice-acted, and you'll fall in love (or hate) with many of the characters. Plus, they're all pretty well-written; the game really stands by its mantra of ""Everything is True,"" and it shows. In terms of objectives, the missions are always similar, but not the same. There are some ""investigation missions"" that are basically like a giant mystery, involving real-world research and thinking outside of the box. That's also paired with some ""stealth"" missions, plus your typical MMO missions; honestly, though, you'll only realize you're grinding if you pull yourself out of the immersion. Speaking of grinding, the class/role system, if you can even call it that, is unique but fun. Basically, you're only given a choice of weapons that accomplish different roles, and it's up to you to figure out the best way of building up your character. And everything depends on your weapon choices. Although it seems complex at first, once you figure out the role of each weapon - and they aren't always what you think - you can easily find a play style that suits you. I've seen other MMOs try the ""choose-your-path"" style of role-building, but none quite work as naturally as this. The fighting is something that you either absolutely love or despise. Paired with the weapon system, it can prove complex for newer players. There's a lot of kiting, which they honestly never really talk about; you just have to figure it out on your own. But with practice and the right set of character abilities, it's something you can get used to. The endgame stuff isn't as easily achievable as one may think. Here's the thing - the $30 set is the ""base game,"" and then for $10 each after, you can buy extensions to the game that give you more plot. The good news is that I hear nothing but good about these ""Issues,"" as they call them, like ""issues"" of a comic book or magazine. The developers clearly intend on putting out high-quality, entertaining content (with some good diversity, if I may add). The bad news is that there's a lot of this content, and without getting a hold of it, the endgame community may seem a little isolating. I do have to talk about the community and support. Two words: Absolutely unmatched. All of the veterans are really noob-friendly (as far as I've seen), and many come back for their ""nightmare mode"" (endgame difficulty) and extra missions, but stick around and will answer questions and even do dungeons. There's a sizeable roleplaying community that has a lot of great events and great people, and it may drag out your TSW experience (like it did for me) and keep you engaged. The developers are the icing on the cake. Sweet, rich buttermilk icing. Although they are largely hands-off, they lurk in the forums and roleplaying communities and keep an eye out for the players. (We're pretty sure they cracked a joke about one of our roleplaying characters at some point in the last week.) They have a ""monthly director letter"" where they chat about progress and upcoming events and content, as well as their intentions behind everything. And they're dorks. Complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dorks. Their selection of cash-shop clothing, their absurd number of pop culture references, the Lovecraftian air of the starter section, and some of their missions. What a bunch of dorks. If you plan on starting TSW keep the following in mind:Join the Arcadia or Cerberus servers. The former is livelier and has a lot of great players, the latter has more people and... more great players. You WILL use two weapons. Embrace them. Decks! Do a deck. They guide you into a weapon role. Open up your ability screen and to the left you'll see ""decks."" Choose a starter deck unless you're feeling courageous. Don't just skip through the mission briefings. The quests are really well-done and roll into one another. Collect lore! They look like little yellow boxes with hexagons on them. They give you EXP, achievements, and items. And again, everything's very, very well-written. Don't be scared to ask questions in General Chat. Everyone's usually very nice and willing to ask questions or help. The only place spammed with trades is Agartha (where you go from place to place). PVP is not a place for noobs. Wait until you're at least done with Solomon Island. Conclusion: This is definitely worth $30, and it's a steal if it's on sale. You can use as much time playing it as any $60 new-release game. Actually, you can put more time into it. Why shouldn't you? The developers and community put a lot of love into the game, and it really shows.			"

												The Secret World (TSW) is the first MMORPG that kept my attention long enough for me to actually reach the max level of the game. To a lot of people that's probably an easy task - but a lot of these styles of games are a grind. TSW, however, is not any ordinary game. It's smart, it's terrifying, and its action packed. The story is a unique blend of action, adventure, and horror, and I can promise you that you’ll never be bored if that’s your kind of thing. The gameplay is unique in the fact that you can play all the major roles on the same character. This means ideally that you only need one character in the game – but they still give you three slots if you want one character for each faction. You have to pick and choose your build, only having a select number of ability and passive skill slots at any given time. It makes you think, and you have to adapt to different situations.So far the game has a lot of replay value in the dungeon content, along with the ability to repeat any mission you’ve done. They also have some really cool season specific events around Halloween and Christmas which make the atmosphere even better.  As for end game content, I’m still working my way in getting there. I’ve just finished issue #8, and will be venturing into the new Tokyo issues very soon.  If you’re looking for a normal run of the mill MMORPG – this isn’t for you. If you’re looking for a challenge, and value story - pick this up. You won’t regret it.			"

												I don't often write game reviews, but The Secret World compels me to write one.First off, the virtual world is incredibly detailed and the atmosphere really does fit the theme of a creeping horror. Very Lovecraftian in most places. The cut scenes are always worth watching. It isn't a game for those with short attention spans, the missions are designed to be solved like a puzzle and the clues are often hard to spot if you aren't paying attention. Sure some seem like the standard kill x monsters, but the Lore and backround built into them does make it very different from the usual MMOs. The in-game community is very friendly too. There's never any awkwardness about asking for help - sometimes there'll be offers of aid in general chat, so even if you're shy about asking complete strangers, there's plenty of opportunity to voice your questions then. Chances are, someone else could be stuck on the very same mission and you'd be helping them out too.			"

												At first I was a bit cautious of the game. I bought it, played it for a little bit then left it to go do something else with some friends for a while. As time went on, I actually yearned to play the game and get invovled with the stories the game offers.. I would reccomend this game to anyone looking for something different in way of stories and lore.As for game mechanics... The ability wheel is nice. I really enjoy the fact I can mix and match abilities to get the exact build I want. Can't get better than that.  The fighting is typical of any mmo... point, click, etc etc... but what makes this one different in my eyes is the fact that there are the covert missons, the puzzle missions... you actually have to think and explore.

												This is, without a doubt, the coolest MMO I've ever played.  The Secret World, while unfortunately mechanically uninteresting most of the time, is the smartest, best-written MMO on the market today.  Investigation missions are a welcome (and much-needed) break from the standard ""kill 5 boars"" fare of the modern World of Warcraft clone.  This game makes you think to solve its puzzles, and it will make you feel like an idiot.  But that's a good thing, really, if you're looking for something different.  This is the first MMO where I didn't just mindlessly click through a million of the exact same kill/fetch quests  over and over and over again to grind to the level cap. I care about the characters and their stories.  The voice acting is great, and the writing is dark and witty.I love this game, and hope it sticks around.Just wish they'd make the combat as interesting and fun as the rest of the game. "

												Yes. This was everything I wanted it to be.An MMORPG in the modern world. With every possible myth, legend, lore, and tale in the hidden, Secret World view.No levels, but as you gain experience you choose to unlock more abilities themed around weapon types. Choosing your abilities and maximizing synergies with effects feels like TCG's deck building.  I love combining dual-wield pistols with lightning attacks.Quests are more than ""Kill x# of y"" and some are full-on puzzles worthy of classic Adventure Games or Myst in their diabolical obscurity, many requiring intentionally looking up information in the real world; bridging the game's themes of conspiracy into IRL.Great game for RP.This is maybe the only online multiplayer type game where I'm not rushing to get to max level, because I feel everything on the road there is worth experiencing. I never feel like I'm grinding.The only negative IMO is that the engine doesn't feel optimized; only a very good PC is going to run it smoothly, even with all of the settings turn pretty far down.

												The Secret World is pretty cool.I think the best thing about the game is the writing - the quests, characters, stories & locations are clearly a labour of love.The game itself is actually quite fun to play, too.It gives you the freedom to develop in any area you like, and there's really no reason not to experiment.  If I had to choose a favourite style of character progression in an MMO, I'd go with the old school 'Ultima Online' approach, where your skills develop as you use them.  (Well, actually they had that in some MUDs well before MMOs but let's not get bogged down on details).The Secret World simply rewards you with Ability Points (used to learn skills) and Skill Points (learned to get stronger) .. hmm, writing that down it sounds weird .. but anyway, you get the points and have the freedom to spend them anywhere .. the game has an ability wheel that is in many ways strange and counter-intuitive, but when you work it out, it's good.The game makes a strong first impression, but then, as you step toward mid-game, starts to wane a little .. so I think most players are either:Dabblers - new players giving it a goCitizens - folks who have had their dabble and powered through, or went away and came back (like me)When I returned to the game after my dabble, I suddenly 'got' it.  I understood the mechanics better and was a LOT more successful in my play - and once you hit that point where you're comfortable with the mechanics, the game becomes really quite cool indeed.Give it a dabble.  If it's not your cup of tea, try again a month later.You won't regret it.  It's a good game.			"

												While not amazingly visually stunning, the gameplay itself is quite enjoyable for an MMO. The quests are a bit more challenging - especially the investigation ones - Hope you like googling Latin :)The storyline itself is what keeps me playing, I have not skipped a single video sequence - quite a rarity for me. Even the mission/quest vids help the storytelling along by setting the appropriate drama/horror feel. It is quite an intrigiuing storyline, although each of the ""Chapters"" seems to independant of each other. Each Chapter storyline is never truly ""wrapped up 100%"" so that you are always left wondering if there is going to be more content to keep fleshing out that particular section.I also like the ""open class"" system, a lot of variety to ""play your way"" instead of being restricted to specific builds. The ability to Load and Save your preferred combinations is a great idea and allows flexibility for gameplay.It is easily solo-able with a number of different healing ""weapons"" available to create a survival build, although in the early sections if you can pump out enough damage, you can usually stay alive against all but the larger mobs.And the best thing?? No subscription and no crippled Pay-to-Play interface like SWTOR.All of the game content is available to play, with DLC addons availble (callled ""Issues"" )In my opinion, is one of the better models for Free-to-Play out there, as it has survived remarkably well against other titles that went free-to-play.Regarding 5-man dungeons - I recommend ALWAYS playing as a DPS. Tanking and healing are a pretty big deal and you have to be geared in a very specific way. You will also cop it from the whole group - as you won't be able to finish the dungeon if you aren't set up properly. Best left to the more experienced players until you start reading the forums on how to gear correctly for the roles.All in all I give this game 9/10.For what this game provides, it is highly entertaining and keeps me coming back to play it.More fun in a group, but easily played as a solo with a bit of forethought.Once again, not amazingly graphically stunning, but I don't need all the ""pretties"" to have fun playing a game.Read below only if you would like to know a little more about the paid DLC available for The Secret World (""Issues"") that can be bought in-game ***UPDATED September 2014***  I have recently purchased the additional ""Issues"" and am really enjoying the new storyline content. ********CONTAINS SPOILERS*********Issue #5 was full of great additional storyline - great narrative from ""Tyler Freeborn"" and a great spooky ending.Loved the Indiana Jones ripoff quest (with Ark of the Covenant, rolling boulder and the new Whip auxilliary weapon) in Issue #6Issue #7 was very tongue-in-cheek with numerous ""spy film"" references and tropes.The action was great and I finally got to ride my own vehicle, A Snowmobile! ( if only for about 4 minutes lol)The storyline was in-depth and intriguing and I enjoyed the ""reveal"" near the end (although I had already kind of guessed) Plus you get the Flamethrower aux weapon, what's not to like!!!Issue #8 I am not really a fan of so far. I may change my mind later on, but it defintely feels like it is filler content. I'm guessing Funcom was pressured to make more end-game content, so they came up with 3 grindy ""Scenario simulations"" that you can play repeatedly at different levels of difficulty.My guess was players wanted something to play while their Nightmare Dungeon runs were on cooldown. Unfortunately, the scenarios have cooldown timers as well!!I purchased a Tokyo pass from a vendor, which delighted me that I did not have to grind the scenarios for it ( I believe you need to purchase the Sidestories: Further Analysis to be able to do this)Issue #9 TOKYO!! A whole new area with an additonal level of difficulty. All enemies now have ""shields"" and you have to match your damage type (AEGIS) to that particular shield type to be able to damage it.The major drawback is that swapping between the 3 AEGIS damage types while in combat will disable your ability to attack for 5 seconds while you change them over!!! I found Tokyo quite challenging, even the trash mobs tend to kill you if you arent prepared (eg having the right AEGIS powers equipped beforehand)The quests were quite entertaining and now that the ""Pagan Sidestories"" have been released, there is even more content to play in Tokyo before Issue #10. (Issue #9 without the Sidestories was a little sparse on repeatable quests)Unfortunately as this area is purely end-game content, ""grindy"" elements have come into play- repeating the missions to purchase upgrades for your AEGIS powers and grinding mobs to upgrade the ""research"" levels on the AEGIS controllers.Once again, some great pop-culture references from some of the NPCs made me laugh quite a lot.Can't wait for Issue #10 now.

												Possibly one of my favorite online games of all time. Join the secret world and unravel the truth behind this modern-day MMORPG. But know that it's so much much more than another cookie cutter MMO. Classless, it encourages you to think outside of the box in solving combat situations. And the story is as thought provoking as it is engaging, taking you through a slew of uniquely-spun takes of myths and legends that would leave the brothers Grimm proud.			"

												In this modern world where every legend is true, you begin to choose a faction.A secret one !The "" I will destroy every evil and whatever if everyone see me "" Templars.The "" Money, power, sex, drug, and Game of Throne "" Illuminatis.And the unknown, strange, users of the chaos theory, the Dragons.Each has his own view of the world, and his own way to deal with it.Then, you create your character. with modern clothes. Unhappily, there isn't much choice of clothes and faces.But you will be able to gain more later.Then, your first cinematic, introducing you to this strange world, and your strange faction.But whoever you decided to join, you got magical power, and you will have to master them.During the tutorial where you begin to learn and get even more questions about your faction, you will learn to fight.And you have hundred of ways to do it, there are two time more skills.Don't worry if you put your hard earned skill points in the bad tree, you can get every skill.The only limit is the number of active and passive slot :-)Let's fight with pistols, shotguns, rifles, sword, hammer, claws, chaos magic, blood magic, and elemental magic :DYou can use two different weapons, so slow down this guy with a shot in the knee and make him burn with a fireball !But it's your skills, and the one you will fight against in the three different pvp area, where the three-faction system allows the two weakest to ally (for a time :D) against the strong one.In pve, monsters do basic attacks with sometimes an area of effect you have to evade.But don't worry, bosses in dungeon have all interesting mechanics, and almost none little encounter on which you will loose your time.But what about your stuff ? Plate armor in a modern day ? Nope, in this game your skin is totally different than your power. You can wear clothes with none stats, and relics which only affect your power.So the day where you hesitate to leave your low level armor because it's so beautiful is now over :DDuring your adventures, you will have to explore to discover the Lovecrafty lore, to kill, to investigate with clues and your brain.To fight against this hard game, you will play with the most mature community I met in a dozen years of gaming .)And the beautiful writting and voice-acting will give you even more courage, you will want to know what's next !Why is there war in this world where history show that hate build nothing ?Why is there starvation when we can feed all humanity ? Why you still don't play this game ?			"

												[I run the game outside of Steam so you may not see here that I have spent hundreds of hours playing it.]Where do I even begin describing it? The Secret World is a special game, a truly unique and rare beast. You will most probably either fall in love with it and become obsessed, or you will hate it and never want to think about it again. If I had to describe it in a single sentence I'd say that it's like an old shop hidden in an obcure part of town that is full of antique treasures as well as cheap forgeries. There is magic and beauty to be found, and there is the mundane and ugly.In a way it destroyed other MMOs for me completely. The lore and atmosphere are absolutely unmatched in the ""genre"" and have little competition in gaming as a whole. It is one of the few games which you can call ""mature"" and there are a few reasons for that. Gameplay mechanics and group content don't lend themselves to mindless smashing. Hardcore puzzles demand brain power of a seasoned adventurer and scholar. Dark subject matter and numerous popcultural references cannot be appretiated without familiarity with at least some classic books and movies, which usually comes with age. I have never encountered a childish behaviour from any of the players. Even young or less patient people seem a bit nicer than in your usual MMO and you can feel a sense of wonder emanating from them.How you react to what The Secret World has to offer depends very much on your gaming and... yes, I'm gonna say it... life experience. If you are seeking a virtual place you can inhabit and keep coming back to, that can be a catalyst for unique social interactions and gaming experiences no matter how much of the content you have cleared, The Secret World is very likely a game for you. If you are a kind of MMO player that values super-polished gameplay, meaningful loot drops and item progression with attractive, repeatable end-game content above all other components, you will be gravely disappointed.It's not to say that there's no good loot/grind to be found. I ran group ""dungeons"" countless times and for some weird reason I still want to do more of them, even though I never liked repeating the same content over and over in other MMOs. ""Dungeons"" are among the best you can find in online games today - locations are beautiful and atmospheric, enemy encounters are interesting and demanding. I aknowledge however that many people will find the amount of group content to be lacking.Your enjoyment also depends on how much are you willing to invest. Steep learning curve, importance of logical thinking and puzzle-solving skills coupled with an overwhelming collection of skills and gameplay that's never broken but only solid at best can scare many potential players. However you can make a really strong argument that those are the game's big strengths, keeping impatient people and ""kids"" out, while giving more demaning players meat they can sink their teeth into. I for one, though not much of a puzzle-solver, really appreciated ancient mysteries that had to be cracked and eventually became familiar with the complex skill system.The Secret World wants you to observe, listen and think. To let go of the real life and immerse yourself in its dreamlike vision. Yes, it will frustrate you many, many times, but its shortcomings always stem from its desire to engage more than just your fingers on the keyboard, but also your mind, personality and imagination.

To let go of the real life and immerse yourself in its dreamlike vision. Yes, it will frustrate you many, many times, but its shortcomings always stem from its desire to engage more than just your fingers on the keyboard, but also your mind, personality and imagination.

												I haven't played this game for a long time yet - 11 hours - But so far this game has been really fun and getting addictive. 9/10 - Some of the monsters are very hard to kill when going solo. The whole leveling system and attack list seem a bit complex to when you first start to play it.			"

												Fun game and different from the previous MMO's I've played in the past. There aren't too many hunt X amount of items in the game which I appreciate. There is also no numbered leveling system. I like the Lovecraftian feel to it and there are plenty of creepy stories that make me hesitate going alone to certain areas. The game is a bit tough to learn and it expects you to think your way through some missions. Solving missions and puzzles are very satisfying when you finally get it.			"

												First Look ReviewThe Secret World is a very different type of MMO. The Secret World strengths are in its missions. Missions now take research and all no longer just simple ""fetch"" quests. Some investigative missions actually use external game assets, like browsing Google to find a certain game related websites. These kinds of ideas are innovative and really provide the player a sense of immersion. The Secret World is a very challenging MMO and does have a learning curve. Not having a level cap is a hard concept to grasp when playing for the first time. Since the player can basically have all the skills in the game, its hard for a new player to decide what starting skills would be beneficial for early game. Personally, I did not do any research on skills and leveled Shotgun to start out. I soon realized during my first dungeon encounter that some boss uses a good number of Area of effect spells, basically causing me a lot of deaths and very little DPS. My recommendation for a new player is to decide early on the type of player you would like to be (Damage, Healing, Tank) and research what skills would be the best for these roles for early in the game. But, since this game does not have a dedicated class system, players can change skills on the fly to meet the needs of the encounter. Again, great flexibility and innovation.In my 50 hours of gameplay, I did notice some difficulty scaling issues. Without prior research, its hard to determine if the player has the power to survive the encounter. I noticed this while primary completing the story quest and have come to a point where I need to complete other missions for skill points to level up my health and damage. Again, this is due to the fact I went into this MMO without prior knowledge. The Secret World forums has a great write-up on how monsters difficulty is determined based on the estimated power of the player. The Secret World is a fun and challenging MMO and is recommended for any players looking for a flexible and different experience than any other current generation of MMO's. "

												10/10 would go beneath the primal fluid again.I definitely enjoyed the game for the price I paid for it. There's plenty of skills to choose from, so you can mess around with different combinations. Quests for this game is very interesting and some are pretty hard if you don't look up a guide to it. If you can find some awesome people to play with, this game will go a long way for you. You choose from one of the three factions: Templars, Dragons, and Illuminati. Each faction is against each other in PVP but in the PVE world you are all together. The server you pick only matters for PVP aspect of the game as you will be able to play with everyone for PVE. Cabals which are the guilds in this game are faction specific, so if your a Templar you can't make a cabal with your Illuminati friend. The biggest downside to this game is the player base. Even with all the servers being able to play with each other, there are times where it is dead.Pros:- Lots of skills to play with- Lots of weapon choices- Lots of unique quests- Storyline is pretty interesting (different for each faction, Illuminati is the best in my opinion haha *eye in the sky*)- Dungeon bosses gain different abilities depending on difficulty- Can unlock everything on 1 character (weapons and skills)Cons:- Community is dwindling- Combat system is not for everyone- PVP unbalanced (normally 1 faction dominates, depends on the servers your grouped with)- Dungeon/Raids get repetitive- Slow updates- Gotta buy ""Issues"" for some new content (not really a bad thing since your supporting the game but it might not appeal to everyone)If you meet anyone from my Cabals Lachesis, Atropos or Clotho, they are some awesome people :D Unfortunately I have not been playing the game for a while now.PS: Beware of Sliggity he's a therapist.

												THE SHORT REVIEW:A strange game that has a colourful setpieces, and wide range of interesting lore.THE LONG REVIEW:The Secret World actually caught my attention because I saw the word ""conspiracy theory"" in the description; it just goes to show you where I get my entertainment. Anywho, The Secret World is a mashup of just that, along with strange myths and legends, and secret societies that you get to take a part in (LIKE THE ILLUMINATI!!!). At first it sounds a little odd because it's set in modern day, but I can assure you that it's a welcome change of pace from the Fantasy and Sci-Fi setpieces that other games have. The story is fairly straight forward, you pick your faction, and develop your character from that point on. As my main, I was able to chose two starting abilities, the first being the ability to use an Assault Rifle and a Sword; which was awesome because the way in which it's presented to you.I think most of my fondness for the game comes from just the mystique of the world and factions. There is just so much lore that you want to discover because it takes on all of those myths, and conspiracy theories that are so entertaining to read about already. So props to the developers for taking on something that I don't even think anyone else has taken on (to my knowledge), technically they're lore is already made for them.But as cool as The Secret World is the graphics and animations can be a little stiff at times, making it kind of dated, but if you have a decent PC you should be able to up the settings. The UI is also kind of cumbersome to use, it's a little bit all over the place, and not very straight forward. In other games, things kind of come to you intuitively, but here you have to sort of test things out to see if they work. Which brings me to my next point, questing. Questing can be great if you get the hang of things, but it was so bothersome seeing so many just all over the place. I'm fine with games making plenty of content available, but I think that the harder missions should have been locked away from sight until the player reached the apropriate level; I saw way to many HARD or VERY HARD quests that I wanted to take on but really couldn't because I kept dying or I just didn't want to bother, which bothered me because it felt like a waste leaving quests there open.Oh, the other thing is that dying isn't normal either. When you do die, your spirit gets respawned at a point and you have to run to your body to revive them. Strange I know, but it works for the universe  - though after a while it might be annoying for some peopleOverall The Secret World is an odd gem, it has a lot going for it's strange premise and the concepts are all there to back it up. I really have been enjoying my time playing the game, aside from the few problems I had. The Secret World is an easy reccomendation, and if you decide to play the game, it's best to do it with friends since the experience will be a tiny bit better; again it's not your typical MMO, approach it as a game like DIABLO or DESTINY.MADE FOR: People who love conspiracies and the secret societies surrounding them.  NOT MADE FOR: People expecting a full blown MMO in the same vein as say World of Warcraft.THE SECRET WORLD8/10			"

												It's an MMO for grownups. Lots of fun quests where you have to look things up out of game, and actually use your brain and stuff! There's also a good it of the down and dirty killing things, but with a storyline so good you'll not want to skip the cutcenes explaining EACH quest. Even the NPCs are so awesome and individual that you'll want to stop and chat with them... like the Sir in the park in London. You actually feel like you're a part of this awesome place. Huge open maps that you can either physically walk to and from each place OR fast travel to from a really unique hub.My only qualm is that I wish they'd trust the player a bit more in the character creation. You can create a unique character but it never really feels unique enough. Lots of awesome clothing choices though to make up for it. You can also pretty much create whatever play style you'd like.

												I purchased this game during the original launch. There was a spirit that was there with the release (for anyone who saw the teaser commercials) that really had a hard time making it to the game.I am a huge Lovecraft fan and I enjoy every aspect of cosmic horror. The base game captures a lot of cosmic horror elements quite well, but if you're not willing to pay every time you want to see a little bit of new content, you'll be left bored pretty quickly.Cons:- 0 Endgame- Poor optimization has plagued this game forever      - Makes PvP a chore to play through when multiple people group together      - High particle density boss fights lag- Gated 'premium' content (micro-expansions that nickel and dime you for 1 new dungeon and a minor story line)- Became a dress-up simulator after initial launch failed- World PvP is skewed by faction popularity (Illuminati -> Templars -> Dragon)Pros:- Alt-free system (on the fly class-changing)- Atmosphere and base story are amazing- Being a Templar- Not being a Dragon (who even are these guys)- Not being Illuminati			"

												I absolutely love this game. If you're a fan of the Supernatural and being badass, this game is for you.What I really like is that you can play alone or with friends and the challenges are the same. I've only played for 40 hours, but after playing some other multiplayer games with toxic communities, this one is not one of them. Everyone is very friendly, and most times are willing to help and teach the beginners.It is also a very forgiving game. If you don't like a weapon set up you may have picked before, you can easily switch to another set and begin storing points for them. The only thing I find lacking is the character customization as the males and females have a set body figure. You can make them shorter or taller but their body shape remains the same. I also think that more customization would be highly benefitial to the game, but I do like that you can wear anything you want and it's not covered by ugly suits of armor. All in all, I recommend this game for the player base and the gameplay, as well as the story.			"

												So, it has been some time since I wrote a review for this game. Before whenever I did I was somewhat interested and said it was just a good game. But after spending many...many hours in this game and hitting a mark where I am doing end game content, I must say that I am thoroughly impressed. This game is a very unique MMO and pretty amazing if you are interested in the RPG community in it as well. Not many reviews here will talk about the ARGs, ((Alternate Reality Game)) that they do, blurring the line between real and fake. The Twitterverse, where you hop on twitter and post as your char, the developers even get in on it and post things as characters in the game world! It is super awesome and super fun if you are into that!If you are into just solo gameplay, this game has you covered as well! An amazing story with likeable chars, unique quests and amazing music! The PvE is amazing as the customization for your ""Deck"" ((Set of skills)) is amazing. You can be anything you want and that is always awesome.PvP, the community is full of amazing people. Before when I wrote the review I didn't talk about PvP... but this is the first time where I have entered a PvP area as a noob and had people actually helping me, wanting me to do better and willing to HELP me do better by giving me advice in very nice ways, never rude.Now, ever game does have it's flaws, this game can be a bit buggy at times and Egypt... *Shudders* Egypt has an AMAZING story, but I found myself struggling to get through it at times. Other than that though, this game is nothing short of awesome.do yourself a favour and pick up this game. This is quite literally the best MMO I have ever played and it would be nice to have more people on here!			"

												The Secret World is a really fun MMO which I wish was more popular, or it may be because of the server I am playing out. But nonetheless it is a really fun game and the mechanics, abilities and story are really ground breaking and interesting. It can be a bit glitchy at time, and PVP is pretty difficult as a low level with low level equipment, but it is gauranteed to be a fun experience playing with friends, or simply doing something alone depending how you play MMOs.

												I have a love-hate relation with TSW. I really like the character system used, giving you a lot of freedom on how you want to progress. An other very good point of TSW is the questing system. You can't just pick up every quest out there and you haveto be keep on what quests you take. I also like how the game looks like - it really gives you an apocalypse kinda feeling.What I don't like are the hordes of zombies (which are pretty agile BTW) that you see everywhere and how some are really overpowered. An other bad thing is the 'X marks the spot' idea for quests. You can see from afar where you have to go to, to do your thing :(Last but not least, the game absolutely looks stunning!Addendum July 8th, 2016 I've give TSW an other try the last two weeks and it's growing a lot on me. These last two weeks I've played over 50 hours already. One of the biggest problems I had with TWS (the hordes of zombies) is almost gone now, because I've moved out of Kinsmouth Town and went on the the Savage Coast, and am about to hit the Blue Mountains. Though there still are a lot of zombies around, the game finally goes deeper into the Lovecraftian lore as well...An other thing to point out (and why my love-hate relationship started) is the main story of the game. In the past I tried to do that one and pick up some missions along the way. This results in the game becoming extremely hard (close to impossible) for me when the main story hit the Blue Moutain. Now I've changed my focus more on completing the maps and do the main story as I'm on that map.Last but not least, I've always loved the story telling as it was done and it's been the reason I gave TSW a try more than once. A day or 2 ago I spoke with a veteran player and he told me that the main developer (who now has left) was a vivid role-player. I guess that's why I loved the story telling so much, having played Dungeons & Dragons for close to 3 decades and recognize when an experienced GM has laid out the main story.			"

I am now fluent in Latin and Romanian, and have applied for a job as a codebreaker.The dungeons are great fun.The abilty wheel allows so much customisation to builds.Great Community.Cons: Crafting seems pretty pointless.Combat is very basic.The engine is a bit dated! (the zones look amazing though!)In the 2 funcom games i have played, the guild/cabal panel/options always seem like an afterthought and are not prominent are interesting.... basically a list of names!

												So I've been playing this game about 2 weeks, and I really like it.  I had played AO from launch, and decided I'd skip Funcom games until they got their act together.  I have to say, The Secret World ain't bad.  It's not my beloved City of Heroes, but then ... nothing will be.It's a truly classless and levelless system of the kind Ultima Online wanted to be.  Every character can have every skill at max in the end game.  What makes that interesting is that you can only use a limited set of skills (a ""deck"") at once.  The game really shines when you figure out new builds from what you've unlocked.Plus, I adore Lovecraft.  This game is like mainlining heroin for a Cthulhu fan.  It's a dark, atmospheric war among 3 factions.  The mythology is Harry Potter meets At the Mountains of Madness with a dollop of Bram Stoker.  Good stuff. "

												WOW! What a highly under-rated game! Nothings here I would consider 'new' or 'special' (with the exception of investigation missions having me looking up ancient latin text in Google to get a code to open a door to then have to find a famous composers name to solve a riddle in a painting to then... （の ワ の ）it's fun) but the mature, modern setting with the Dark supernatural HP Lovecrft themes... Refreshing. Some nice voice acting as well. Better than average for sure. Effective story telling for the missions. Free form choice of weapons, abilities, and specs to playstyles. Plenty of choice. No P2W aspect within the microtranactions, all clothes, digital dressup. The way I prefer it and am happy to support with micro purchases from time to time. Worth every penny for 30$. If you happen to pick it up on sale, even more value. You'll even get 10$ in ingame micro currency for completeing 30 missions on your account. Free money to buy some personal style from the store!!Totally worth the time youll put in for the money you spent. Especially with no subs.			"

												Seriously why is this game so under-rated and buried. Me and my wife have absolutely loved this game. We really enjoyed it when it first released. We had some computer issues. Got them fixed and forgot to come back. Gameplay is solid. The mechanics of attacking feel good. The Storyline is to die for. Lack of a class system provides an interesting challenge when doing AP/SP. The graphics are also quite fantastic. Seriously very well could be the most under-rated game of all time. I will say i'm unsure of the END game. But honestly the storyline alone is worth the bang for the buck.			"

												It's got a very nice amount of story and it's very forgiving in terms of making mistakes - you can replay missions and switch equipment with very little in terms of time penalties. The community is generally very nice too, which is a rarity in the world of MMOs. My only major complaint is that the extra content is expensive - too expensive unless there's a sale - and that some of teh endgame content is a bit grindy.But overall, a good game.			"

Players can choose between three secret societies to work for, The Dragon, The Templars, or the Illuminati. One great thing is the classes, or lack therof. Players can choose two weapons to start with, building their skills as they play, and if a weapon begins to not seem like the right fit, you can choose to learn a new one, this is definitely a great MMO, and I reccomend it with every fiber of my being.

												I'm gonna Say it Here... I Love this Game and I Don't know why.Maybe its the design, maybe its the way the system opens up as you get more Xp, or how no ability is locked off to you without Reason (Story Spoilers for why 1-2 Abilities are locked.. so i won't get into it). The ""Deck"" design for building your character is nice and gives decent hints for how to play different Playstyles, In-game tutorials are there if you need them for most of the Systems that are in the Game... And the Community is Generally friendly.The story is fun (For Me atleast) and goes into directions that are predictable sometimes and sometimes a Complete Curveball (Transyvania and Dracula are one of the more interesting ones). Then there is the Lore entries... You don't just get one or 2 pieces of information about whats going on or Concepts.. you get massive logs to look though that give enough information to sate most people.. and those things it doesn't answer? It's usually just not something you've found yet...Overall I recommend The Secret World.... It's a Fun Romp though a Modern World that's going though a Magical Apocalypse as Cthuluoid entities (And Things MUCH WORSE) are waking up and breaking into our reality....The Dreamer's Wake, How will you stop them?

												All right, so the game looked promising at first. $30 for a modern/Fantasy MMO? Awesome, sold. Now, I'm an lover of the Souls series. As anyone familiar with the series can tell you, multiple characters for different styles of gameplay are a must. TSW however? You can do anything. Top all the weapon and skill sets out, flip between as you see fit. Sweet. But still, that's end game, and we're just getting started.First run, Dragon (because who doesn't love a little chaos). Pistols and Rifles. Soldier style. Cleared up to Transylvania, including completeing the main story quest line. But hectic. Didn't know enough, character is strongish, but a complete mess with points and abilities all over the place. Oh, found this thing called a Deck. Helps you stay decently strong while giving you things to word towards. Sweet. Time to restart!Second Run. Templar. Deck deck deck, Exorxist? Healer based deck. Cool, reduced que times for dungeons. Soloing the main story was a bit problematic, but hey! I'm a healer, I don't die easy. Story cleared up to Transyl again. Like it, but I don't love it. Restart.Third run. Templar, Paladin Deck. LOVE it... Tankability if I want it, high single target damage if I want it. Decent Aoe and crowd control too, all I gotta do is switch some specs up. Absolutely best run, but got stopped when buddy wanted to run with me. Paladin for solo time... Time to make another character, we'll get back to the Paladin later.4th character. Eh... Dragon, screw it, let's check out the Matial Artist deck. Very gook tanking build. Easy control over the mobs, though in story, a bit lackluster in damage. All right, it takes me forever to kill them, but it takes them forever to kill me. I win, I have decent passive healing. Chaos Magic via close colse quarters crowd control is a blast, and the sword skills boosting my defensive rating by a chunk, love it. Story cleared past Trasnsyl, caught up to Paladin, switch back to continue with my buddy on the character I love.20 minutes back on paladin, and I'm content locked. I check out the content pack I need, $10. Okay. But for only a portion of the area I'm in? Wtf?I go to Steam, and everything Issue 9 and up is only available via Collectors Edition. $25. Funny, cause directly from the site, I can get the standard for $10. Any package deals? Not unless you paid $60 intitially for the Ultimate Edition. Anyway to just upgrade to Ultimate? Hell no, you get another base game key to give to a friend. I can't give someone that, I'd feel bad. Steams total price for DLC is $210! Okay, so 7 DLC packs are $15 over priced. So buying standard straight from the source? 210 - 105. Still $105. Already paid $30. So 135. Sorry, what? AAA games go for 60, and reduce their DLC prices after a year or two. This game is 4 years old... 4 Years...I love the game, I love the mechanics, but I can't justify that price tag... I can't. I really want to recommend this game, but if you aren't going staight for the $60 Ultimate, which still leaves 4 DLC packs locked, I can't. Was it a full game? I'm sure it was, at one point! But I've been hearing about Tokyo since the beggining of the game, and now you're telling me I can fight there, but I can't progress without buying something? Why even bring it up!? Lock me out of the whole area. Don't let me in then tell me, ""Money or you can't do anything besides kill trash mobs.""Gameplay 9/10.Story 9/10.Prices 2/10.It's been 4 years, and you want that much money. That's now how you increase a player base.			"

												Bite Sized ReviewThe Good:+ Really Nice Graphics for an MMO+ The Interface looks really nice and slick, nice sounds on it too like when you unlock an achievement+ 2 Weapon System allows you to mix up your character build+ No classes, anyone can change character roles at anytime+ The atmosphere of modern day but with ghosts and goblins etc. is great+ Missions are voiced with cut scenes+ Mission Variety is great: Combat, Stealth, and PuzzleThe Bad:- Loading times/ how often you see them is a little excessive - Que times for PvE Dungeons and PVP is too long, even during weekends when it should be fast- Enemies get more health at higher levels, and just become bullet sponges near the end- Equipment (except weapons) does not show on character - Good/Interesting Vanity Items must be purchased with real money- Expansion content is locked behind multiple $15 add-ons- Can only make human characters in a universe where there are ghouls, goblins, zombies, and werewolves- Base game story line has a weak and uninteresting finish- Act of combat and combat animations are stiff and boring- Dwindling Player base- It is an MMOThe Verdict:I loved this game for a long time and only recently buckled down and beat the base game storyline. I loved the world and atmosphere this game gave off, but at every turn I felt like the game could be so much better if it was a single player RPG instead of an MMO. The combat and animations suffer and the fact that enemies respawn after you've killed them just leaves the game feeling hollow. I truly feel if Funcom were to take this world and make a Vampire the Masquerade style game out of it, it would be amazing. "

												I payed full price for this, and to be honest, judging by how the game looks and how the concept was presented, it looked sweet. Now that I played some of it, it really becomes repetitive, especially that you can re-do missions that give you more money or experience than others, and some of them are investigation missions too, it just feels like you are solving the same mistery over and over again just to grind some daily credits. Gets boring really fast, also eats up alot of RAM.			"

												The PvE is absolutely amazing, with freaky horror themes and mythology all mixed together.The PvP is the worst of any game I've ever played in my entire history of gaming. All of the builds in the game center around 1 of 3 of the most powerful crowd controls in the game, all of which being defined by the fact they have very little counterplay options because they are instant-cast and have 5 or less frames of windup animation.Ranged PvP can be defined as Cardiac Arrest + X. Every ranged build is just basic builders/consumers with that one hard-CC being the basis to all encounters that player has. Melee PvP can be define as  Strange Attractor + X or Double Impair Sword.And that's as deep as it goes. Funcom has no idea how to balance it so those 3 builds sit in masses alongside healers who have the age-old balance issues of almost every MMO's pvp healers, in that they heal wayyyyy too much because the game is PvE focused above all, and there isn't a true healthy mid point they can reach between being able to outheal raid bosses but still being able to die to player characters in PvP.If you're looking for a great PvE experience this one is worth a few weeks of play. If you're looking for PvP you should look elsewhere, this one is atrocious.			"

												At first I was a bit skeptic, because all the MMO's I played were in a fantasy world, but ohgosh, I love 'The Secret World' so much! All the NPC's are amazing with great voice actors. There are more type of quests, for example the investigation ones, where sometimes you have to browse the internet to find answers and clues. You have a great set of skills and weapons and you can freely choose what you want to level. You can choose from three secret society and every one of them are unique and really interesting (I especially like the templars with Dame Julia :D). The combat is not that interesting in my opinion, but not that bad, especially if you choose a weapon which you really like. I think it's a great game and if you like MMO's and interesting stories, you should definitely try this game out! :)			"

												There's no game quite like The Secret World. It's a mish-mash of a lot of things. It works very well as a single player MMO. You get the feeling of a community, but you aren't constantly forced to group to get the best loot or the best experience. The thing that will keep you playing is the world. It is beautiful. As well as this the way you're character will look and feel will become a lot more personalized than other MMOs. Overall, it's definitely worth a look if it peeks your interest. Without a subscription fee, the amount of content packed into this game nowadays is great value for money.			"

Posted: August 2, 2014
												I'm really happy I tried this game -- I've overlooked it for years.  I was a long time Warcraft player, and fell out of love because it felt like a grind.  Grind for materials.  Grind for money.  I always had a laundry list of quests with which I power levelled whatever character I needed.  I ran dungeons over and over again for that off chance I'll get that one drop.  TSW is different in that the quests are actually interesting.  I'm not asked to gather 10 goblin necklaces -- I'm asked to track down a serial killer.  And if, god forbid, I do have to kill X # of this, I can skip it.  There is enough content to level up.  And levelling -- I really enjoy it.  You always have points coming in with which you can change your character if you feel you've made a mistake or you feel unhappy with the current state you are in.  I do miss the days when tanks were tanks and healers were alts, but I don't have that sort of time.  I just want to get through some content.  It reminded me a bit of Grand Theft Auto.  A little open world exploration followed by cut scenes followed by action.  Except that you can bring friends.The down side -- this isn't the standard thief/wizard/cleric/fighter game.  It's not elves and tauren and humans cohabitating.  Just humans and more humans in horror settings.  This means that as a franchise it will probably never have the sort of draw as Warcraft.  No draw, dubious financial future, dubious life span of the franchise.  I expect one day to see the plug get pulled.  And I will be sad.  Second -- I hate enforced solo content.  Several times during the main story you are required to go to a solo instance and play and battle.  If you decided to go full healer, you are out of luck -- go back and replay content until you come up with a new build that will make it.  Sorry, but that's a bit silly.  I'm playing this with my wife, and that kind of thing just alienates people who are there to play in a group, or who need more guidance.  This, along with the almost sterilie LFG channel system makes a mess of the social nature of the game that I remember so well from everquest and warcraft.  Maybe it's not the game -- maybe it's me.  But I liked logging in to talk to my friends who were out questing.  I just don't feel any of that here.  And finally, and this is just my personal bias, the zoning system makes the different chapters of this game feel way too compartmentalized.  I get it -- they are different stories, but I remember how cool it would feel to trudge across a desert to find some semi active volcano and forest -- just wandering from end to end of a giant continent.  But that is just not part of the way TSW works.  You go to the first stage of Transylvania or Egypt or some harbor town -- you play enough of the story and you unlock the next zone.Honestly, I bought the massive edition for my wife and I.  It's the price of two new release games.  When I compare that to buying two copies of Black Ops or Saints Row or whatever, it's a game whose price tag is a steal and has more than enough adventure.

  The Secret World is the beast, in good and a couple of small bad ways First of all, I love this game. Weirdly enough, I have had some problems with a ""dxgi_error_device_removed"" error report, it is the first time I've seen this error. After install and observing the report I simply tried rebooting my system and after that, the game worked perfectly, at 100 - 120 fps I played for a couple of hours, and was really enjoyed. Next day when I tried loading the game, it came with the error, I tried rebooting without any luck and now I'm stuck with the error reports. Beside my frustration I can highly recommend this game, since this bug seems to be pretty uncommon for people with newer gear. I really hope the developers find a solution, in the meantime I will try to fix it myself.Of 2 hours of gameplay I can already say It's one of the most enjoyable MMORPG games I have ever played (I have played almost every popular EU&US MMORPG games there is) CPU Intel Core i5 3570K @ 3.40GHz  RAM 8,00GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 799MHz  Motherboard MSI Z77A-GD55 (MS-7751) Graphics BenQ XL2420T (1920x1080@120Hz)2 x 2047MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 (MSI) SLI	 Storage 2 x 223GB Intel Raid 0 Volume (SATA)465GB Western Digital WDC WD5000AAKX-003CA0 (SATA)If anyone have an solution please tell. :-)			"

												Honestly: I would highly recommend this game. Enjoyable combat, interesting story, intriguing and well-realized setting, and deft writing with both a sense of gravity and humor. The MMO elements come on too strong for me, and honestly, I wish the game was more of a Borderlands style optional co-op, but it still works reasonably well the way it is. Additionally, I personally would prefer not having a completely silent protagonist without access to even text dialogue, although the fact that every quest of any import is given in soliloquy does do something to help with that. Overall, however, the game is fun enjoyable to play--and it would probably be even more so if the MMO elements were actually appealing to you.			"

I thought, man that's more my kinna game. So I finally purchased the base game, and still getting familiar with the game play. I have to say, even though I'm early in the game, it has been Fantastic! I hate I found out about it 2 years after the fact, and wished it had a bigger following. I tried to sell it to my WOW folks, but bad timing on that. :) Anyways, if you're into the MMO and the Horror genre, this is the ONE! Myself, looking forward to purchasing the remaing issues.			"

												This game is pretty awesome once you get the hang of it. Graphics are pretty awesome and i dont feel like i am forced to buy anything to progress. The cash shop does have items that increase your characters power but its only for early game content and is replaced fairly quickly.  The in-game browser is useful sometimes when you have to use it and believe me you will have to use it a lot. I like that i dont have to keep making new characters in order to try something different i just keep getting skill points and abilities points (AP & SP) and just level up the appropriate skills and im good to go! Crafting is a lot different than i am used to in any game. It is very difficult to understand if you do not do the tutorials as you go. Do not try to figure it out on your own trust me you wont be able to. Most of the zones i have seen so far have a kind of horror feel to them and as you wonder through the woods in some places you can hear chewing and ripping of flesh and some other unsettling noises which is kinda disturbing at first lol. I do recommend this game to everyone especially if its on sale .. you dont need a sub to play and progress in the game .. you only get extra XP and other resources from quest completion with a sub. The gameplay is unique and satisfying and everyone should try it out.Edit: Thought i would come back and give more info about the game that i did not provide in my review. You get your own museum which is sorta like a housing system to show off some cool stuff. Its all instance based and you display exhibits of the creatures you kill in the world. In order to display to the creatures you just simply kill them and collect lore as you quest or whatever it is you do in The Secret World. I suggest you wait until you have finished spending your AP (ability points) on your character progression before attempting to restore your museum. The exhibits are not free and will cost you quite a bit of AP in order to restore one exhibit.. there are many... many .. exhibits. I have spent quite a bit of time doing dungeons and world bosses recently and depending on which difficulty you do the dungeons you will find them quite difficult and you will die alot. Most of the encounters in the game are not melee friendly and have one shot potential so take this in consideration before trying out your builds. I recommend completing the starter decks to see what kind of weapons you would like to play with.			"

												This is the best MMORPG I've ever played to ! I definitely recommend it.- The content is really mature and dark (Lovecraft influences), missions aren't about killing mobs only but it also involves stealth missions (don't try to kill mobs there you'll end up dead) and investigation missions (trust me you'd do things you'd never imagine doing while playing a game).- The universe is modern which is not common in MMORPG and it's very refreshing.- The gameplay is amazing, with 3 weapons (2 main and 1 auxiliary) you can create tons of build among 525 abilities (active and passive) depending the situation you're facing, there isn't level progression in the game and you can switch role (dps, healer, tank) at any time of the game but end game is more appropriate to do that.- The main story line is catchy and interesting. Templar, Illuminati, Dragon ... Chose your side.- The community is really involved in the game and is mostly really mature (especially during event time).Well I guess you can easily notice my love for this game however there are still few negative points about it.- As much as I love pvp in this game, it takes sometimes a long time to enter into pvp area due to the lack of pvp players.- The game engine suffer of some optimization problems especially when it comes to gather a lot of players at the same place (lots of fps decrease) and it also happens randomly at some specific places (and it's not a question of computer hardwares).- Developers are slow to release new contents even tho there are lots of things to do in The Secret World.Besides these few negative points, I must confess that this is one of the best game I've ever played to and I definitely recommend it if you're looking for a whole new experience !

												Excellent game with new innovative ""leveling"" system. The graphics aren't next gen, no, but they are pretty amazing for an MMO. The story is rich and very smart, a real thinker's game to be honest. No MMO has gotten me to really care for the story like this one has. The dialogue is rich and engaging, and while at times te ability wheel prevents your character from their potential,it adds to the challenge that is this game. Definite recommend for MMO skeptics like myself who usually quit MMO's after a couple of months.			"

Character customization is great, the enviroments are huge and detailed. The enemies will send a tingle down your spine on some occasions. Some of the quests are very well thought up and require you to research it 99% of the time using the end game browser, for the investigation missions I mean. Does the whole no level thing very well. This is a mature MMO.			"

												A game that's fun and easy to pick up whenever. From lore hunters to endgame smashers, The Secret World is oft understated in the MMO world. I started out on my own originally, quit for about a year, then returned when a friend decided to join in. Since then, we've been joined by two more, who we are running through the hoops somewhat with laughter all around. Many TSW players will admit that starting out can be a little daunting since there is a learning curve, but those who stick around past the frustration will find the game rewarding in many ways.As several other reviewers have noted, this game is coded and run on Flash; however, there are player-made mods (Curse.com has a client that can install them for you) that can help with everything from re-arranging the user interface to auto-sorting your inventory. Additionally, the graphic may not make some of the graphically inclined too happy, but honestly I was not bothered by it and found it charming.I would go into depth on mechanics and whatnot, but it has been covered by others prior to myself. All-in-all, I recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge.			"

Most of the zones i have seen so far have a kind of horror feel to them and as you wonder through the woods in some places you can hear chewing and ripping of flesh and some other unsettling noises which is kinda disturbing at first lol. I do recommend this game to everyone especially if its on sale .. you dont need a sub to play and progress in the game .. you only get extra XP and other resources from quest completion with a sub. The gameplay is unique and satisfying and everyone should try it out.Edit: Thought i would come back and give more info about the game that i did not provide in my review. You get your own museum which is sorta like a housing system to show off some cool stuff. Its all instance based and you display exhibits of the creatures you kill in the world. In order to display to the creatures you just simply kill them and collect lore as you quest or whatever it is you do in The Secret World. I suggest you wait until you have finished spending your AP (ability points) on your character progression before attempting to restore your museum. The exhibits are not free and will cost you quite a bit of AP in order to restore one exhibit.. there are many... many .. exhibits. I have spent quite a bit of time doing dungeons and world bosses recently and depending on which difficulty you do the dungeons you will find them quite difficult and you will die alot. Most of the encounters in the game are not melee friendly and have one shot potential so take this in consideration before trying out your builds. I recommend completing the starter decks to see what kind of weapons you would like to play with.			"

												I thoroughly enjoy this game, and that's a lot coming from someone who generally doesn't like MMO's. The Secret World is very unique in its setting and themes. It asks a lot of its players in terms of patience and dedication, but following through with the investigations the game presents to you is very rewarding. The world is full of secrets, and it is your job to unravel them!			"

												I'm really happy I tried this game -- I've overlooked it for years.  I was a long time Warcraft player, and fell out of love because it felt like a grind.  Grind for materials.  Grind for money.  I always had a laundry list of quests with which I power levelled whatever character I needed.  I ran dungeons over and over again for that off chance I'll get that one drop.  TSW is different in that the quests are actually interesting.  I'm not asked to gather 10 goblin necklaces -- I'm asked to track down a serial killer.  And if, god forbid, I do have to kill X # of this, I can skip it.  There is enough content to level up.  And levelling -- I really enjoy it.  You always have points coming in with which you can change your character if you feel you've made a mistake or you feel unhappy with the current state you are in.  I do miss the days when tanks were tanks and healers were alts, but I don't have that sort of time.  I just want to get through some content.  It reminded me a bit of Grand Theft Auto.  A little open world exploration followed by cut scenes followed by action.  Except that you can bring friends.The down side -- this isn't the standard thief/wizard/cleric/fighter game.  It's not elves and tauren and humans cohabitating.  Just humans and more humans in horror settings.  This means that as a franchise it will probably never have the sort of draw as Warcraft.  No draw, dubious financial future, dubious life span of the franchise.  I expect one day to see the plug get pulled.  And I will be sad.  Second -- I hate enforced solo content.  Several times during the main story you are required to go to a solo instance and play and battle.  If you decided to go full healer, you are out of luck -- go back and replay content until you come up with a new build that will make it.  Sorry, but that's a bit silly.  I'm playing this with my wife, and that kind of thing just alienates people who are there to play in a group, or who need more guidance.  This, along with the almost sterilie LFG channel system makes a mess of the social nature of the game that I remember so well from everquest and warcraft.  Maybe it's not the game -- maybe it's me.  But I liked logging in to talk to my friends who were out questing.  I just don't feel any of that here.  And finally, and this is just my personal bias, the zoning system makes the different chapters of this game feel way too compartmentalized.  I get it -- they are different stories, but I remember how cool it would feel to trudge across a desert to find some semi active volcano and forest -- just wandering from end to end of a giant continent.  But that is just not part of the way TSW works.  You go to the first stage of Transylvania or Egypt or some harbor town -- you play enough of the story and you unlock the next zone.Honestly, I bought the massive edition for my wife and I.  It's the price of two new release games.  When I compare that to buying two copies of Black Ops or Saints Row or whatever, it's a game whose price tag is a steal and has more than enough adventure.

												Honestly: I would highly recommend this game. Enjoyable combat, interesting story, intriguing and well-realized setting, and deft writing with both a sense of gravity and humor. The MMO elements come on too strong for me, and honestly, I wish the game was more of a Borderlands style optional co-op, but it still works reasonably well the way it is. Additionally, I personally would prefer not having a completely silent protagonist without access to even text dialogue, although the fact that every quest of any import is given in soliloquy does do something to help with that. Overall, however, the game is fun enjoyable to play--and it would probably be even more so if the MMO elements were actually appealing to you.			"

												At first I was a bit skeptic, because all the MMO's I played were in a fantasy world, but ohgosh, I love 'The Secret World' so much! All the NPC's are amazing with great voice actors. There are more type of quests, for example the investigation ones, where sometimes you have to browse the internet to find answers and clues. You have a great set of skills and weapons and you can freely choose what you want to level. You can choose from three secret society and every one of them are unique and really interesting (I especially like the templars with Dame Julia :D). The combat is not that interesting in my opinion, but not that bad, especially if you choose a weapon which you really like. I think it's a great game and if you like MMO's and interesting stories, you should definitely try this game out! :)			"

												Never done the MMO thing, because the games didn't seem to be my style. The only thing about WOW I got into was Hearthstone. I was fixin to try Diablo on PS3, then I read about TSW. I thought, man that's more my kinna game. So I finally purchased the base game, and still getting familiar with the game play. I have to say, even though I'm early in the game, it has been Fantastic! I hate I found out about it 2 years after the fact, and wished it had a bigger following. I tried to sell it to my WOW folks, but bad timing on that. :) Anyways, if you're into the MMO and the Horror genre, this is the ONE! Myself, looking forward to purchasing the remaing issues.			"

												A game that's fun and easy to pick up whenever. From lore hunters to endgame smashers, The Secret World is oft understated in the MMO world. I started out on my own originally, quit for about a year, then returned when a friend decided to join in. Since then, we've been joined by two more, who we are running through the hoops somewhat with laughter all around. Many TSW players will admit that starting out can be a little daunting since there is a learning curve, but those who stick around past the frustration will find the game rewarding in many ways.As several other reviewers have noted, this game is coded and run on Flash; however, there are player-made mods (Curse.com has a client that can install them for you) that can help with everything from re-arranging the user interface to auto-sorting your inventory. Additionally, the graphic may not make some of the graphically inclined too happy, but honestly I was not bothered by it and found it charming.I would go into depth on mechanics and whatnot, but it has been covered by others prior to myself. All-in-all, I recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge.			"

												Pros:-Modern setting with good graphics, intuitive controls, and tons of lore-Delve into the story behind factions including the Illuminati, the Templar, and the Dragon-Many hours of gameplay (At 20 hours I had just finished the first main area)-No subscription required, some free items included in purchase (check 'claim items' in store in game!)-Unique travel system between maps using underground tree network Agartha-Cutscenes and voices for every major NPC/quest to draw you into the story-Decent character customization choices for clothes/appearance-Unlock special outfits by completing certain skill sets-Over 500 skills to select from including 9 different weapon categories.-Equip 2 weapons at once, allowing use of skills from both seamlessly without even having to swap manually-Choose 7 active and 7 passive skills from any that you have unlocked from all categories.-Given time a single character could learn all skills; no specialization prevents you from unlocking any others-Solo play possible for those who enjoy it for all but the toughest missions-Variety of mission types - action, sabotage, investigations, item, dungeons, etc-Investigation mission puzzles are likely the most challenging you have seen in a gameCons:-No auto attacks, no attacking without skill use; this means you spend lots of time mashing your main skill button-Equipping new weapons/armor does not change the way your character appears-Some puzzles so challenging you are expected to solve using web browser, which can detract from immersion-Although no subscription required, you do have to pay for further releases of content (issues).-No means of travelling quickly within maps so you lose a lot of time having to repeatedly walk/fight your way through-'No class / No level' system is not accurate; you still gain XP and are limited by your skill and item levels  -This makes it somewhat less clear when you are really 'level-appropriate' for a given area until you end up dying-Due to most missions being repeatable in any area, you have less of a feel of closure when moving on to the next area			"

												This operates on the same model as Guild Wars 2 now, so no subscription fee. If you like conspiracy theories and Lovecraftian horror, and don't mind some slightly dated hotkey-based combat, this is pretty good. The writing is better than any other MMO I have played and the voice acting is good (apart from, as ever, anyone attempting to do a British accent).Worth trying now you only have to pay once for the game.

I think I'll try it again though - I can see it's worth the effort to get through the first few levels - just gets a bit confusing with how to character build and what to specialise in.  An awesome concept that more people should take a chance on.  And yes, it's addictive unless you have absolutely no patience! :)  Great graphics, items, lore, and really nice to be playing with ""real"" people and not just NPCs for a change.			"

												The best MMO I've ever played, and one of the best games I've ever played in general. The story is interesting, but you have to work to find a lot of it in a similar fashion to Dark Souls' lore system. The mechanics work well, the graphics are actually pretty great, and the part that I think is most impressive is the sheer amount of content in the game. By the time I'd logged around 6 hours, I'd only done 2 and a half real story missions and chose to focus on side missions, of which I'd done perhaps 30 or 40, which weren't even half of the ones that were available at the time. And that's only in the first area of the game. The truly massive amount of content in the game itself in addition to the DLC Issues that come out every so often with massive amounts of content on their own means that you'll more than get your money's worth out of it, especially now that you don't have to pay for a subscription, which is fantastic as well. A game I would recommend to anyone looking for a game to pump incredibly large amounts of time into, which is what I was looking for when I bought it, and boy did I find it. I'd also recommend checking out the Massive Edition since it comes with some pretty neat weapons, a baller pet, and other miscellaneous customization stuff along with three of the great DLC Issues that retail at $10 or so a piece, so it's a great deal at well.

												Isn't the point of a secret NOT to tell it?For starters, when I first saw this game I didn't even know it was an MMO. Silly me. I wanted this game for 3 years, then I finally got it. I like it quite a bit. The Illuminati are kinda jerks, but they're rich, so I put up with it. It's pretty realistic in that regard. The Templars are weird but they have the coolest uniforms, so there's that. The Dragons are... well I don't know what the Dragons are, they won't tell me.Anyways, it's got some interesting combat mechanics, and gameplay mechanics. It's got an interesting story. It's relatively fun to play, easy to learn. You don't have to pay for anything really, except the game and the last few episodes.My only problem with it isn't even in the game itself. My only problem is that it doesn't have the option to upgrade from normal TSW to Ultimate Edition TSW (or whatever it's called). But that's just semantics. BUY THIS GAME!			"

												A phenomenal adaptation/inspiration of HP Lovecraft's delightly horrifying works. Unlike traditional horror, which relies on jump scares and cheap frights, The Secret World draws upon Lovecraft's uncanny ability to tap into what truly terrifies the soul rather than what frightens the central nervous system. You won't be jumping out of your seat on this one. You'll be glued to it.Initially, I was hesitant to try this game out as an MMO, feeling it may better be adapted for single play, but I couldn't be more wrong. The community is just as friendly as my first MMO, FFXI Online, an experience I'd been unable to replicate until TSW. Although you can play through the game by yourself, you'll never feel truly alone, at least until you enter a wonderfully creepy solo instance, further reducing the frights and increasing the terror. Find a friend or sibling to play with, as I did, and you'll truly be in for an incredible experience.The Graphicsare good, even on a computer like mine that's overdue for a graphics card upgrade and experiences odd memory leaks. Even on low settings, the ambience of each zone feels truly unique, coloring each story in a uniquely terrifying way. From the uncertainty of what lies directly in front of you in the fog of Solomon Island to the unforgiving blistering heat of Egypt, this is a world flush with care, love, and lore from its developers.The Musical Score is very good. There's little else to say but that you won't be disappointed in the game's ability to match the cadence of your decesnt into madness with an appropriate tempo to accompany you.The Lore is what will entrance you for hours. Ragnar Tørnquist, the game's creative director, may very well be HP Lovecraft's reincarnation. You'll feel drawn into his world immediately, spending hours simply hunting down little bits of story to add to your knowledge of the secret world, and keeping your eyes open for new information.The Gameplay is truly phenomenal. While the control scheme is typical for an MMO, with your expected hotbar and somewhat uninspired movement, level progression is unique and entertaining. Eschewing traditional levels, you're allowed to select any ability, any weapon, and any strategem you desire, mixing and matching abilities from different progression trees to create a unique set of abilities. Tanks, DPS, and Healers are one thing, but the variety of choices you have on how to fufill those roles are quite large. Your Missions vary from simple collection quests and defeat a certain amount of enemies, to truly baffling mysteries where the game refuses to hold your hand. You're expected to use your brain, decode complicated ciphers with demonic runes, open up a bible to find a clue hidden in Psalms, or go online to one of the game's shadowy corperation's websites and find its employee directory for your next clue, using the game's own web browser feature. I will admit to you a remarkable frustration towards the morse code segments, though. I did not go to nautical school. I'm fairly certain most of us didn't either.For a fan of MMO's, this is a must buy. For fans of Lovecraft, this is a must buy. For fans of neither, this very well might be the game that endears you to both.			"

												This is an incredible game with great quests, characters and player choice. As these are covered in many other reviews I want to mention the few problems I did have.1.Its hardDon't get the wrong idea most of the PvE is totally fine but after beating most of the game (or when first entering an area) it can be difficult to beat certain missions. (FYI: Im talking about combat difficulty but some missions can be hard for other reasons, there is only one jumping puzzle in the whole game but it is still one too many)While its possible to do ALL of the quests solo it is very difficult if you don't put a lot of time devoloping a really good ability set.The best way to counter this is to play with a friend. A mission that is impossible for two people individually can be a walk in the park if they work together. 2. high level gearIn PvE, if you want the best gear available you have to work with four other players to complete a dungeon.The game has a LFG system which means you can avoid matchmade with someone low level but it can also be hard to find someone who can tank or heal since you will need at least one of each. (DPS isn't as much of a problem at low levels since people could just use their solo classes)The LFG system isn't used much for higher level dungeons so you will have to ask around in chat to find a group.Since dungeons are designed for 5 people they will require either everyone on the team doing their job and knowing what they are doing or if you're still at a low level, teaming up with someone much higher level.3. PvPits hardBasically what helps you in PvE doesn't mean anything in PvP so you will need totally different abilities for each. Doing PvP in a PvE build can result in you going the whole match without a single kill.Honestly with over 1,000 hours in the game i have never had any luck with PvP but since t isn't neccissary to play PvP for the PvE you could just skip it entirely.Or even if you are bad at it, you still get reward for participating, so if you are willing to grind even terrible PvPers can use it to get really good gear.This is honestly one of the best games I have ever played and since you could play hundreds of hours even if you skipped PvP, dungeons and the hardest missions I would say it is definitely worth trying.

												How do I recommend this game. It's unlike any ""MMO"" I've ever played. Let me start with what I DON'T like:1) Buggy. Development is always happening and the game is always getting better. But you do run into bugs from time to time. Generally it doesn't result an any major headache but rarely can.2) DX 11 is problematic depending on your video card. Game looks great with it on, but can reduce your FPS to -nil- during combat. Just change it to DX 9 in the options and bam, all your FPS problems are gone.3) Lock-out's are a flawed portion of the game in my opinion. You run a ""Nightmare"" difficulty dungeon and you can't it again for 18 hours. Even if your group failed. Now that all sounds fine, but heres the catch - if you lose a person, no one wants to fill their spot because the important currency that drops off the bosses has now been reduced. So that can be quite frustrating.Now for my favorite parts! I'll stick to the top three since to be balanced:1) This game is pretty dang dark. ""Dark?"" you ask? ""Like turn up the brightness?"" No. Like F****** dark. Like coming across people who've hung themselves and the details include scratches at the neck and her shoe that's fallen off from the ensuing spasims. ""Why would you like that?!"" Because I'm an adult. I don't need my hand held. I don't need my games 'kiddyized' or more friendly. There's more I'd love to spout off but some of it is spoilers and believe me...2) This story is fantastic. Plot twists, terrible betrayals and otherwise just well written STORY that doesn't feel force fed. You move the story along at your own pace.3) 500 abilities. 500. Takes time to unlock them all, but you can. You can unlock them all. Wanna heal? Ok. DPS? Sure. Tank? Please do. Play the way that makes you happy. There ARE fights that require certain abilities to be had or decks (Decks are ability combinations) that need to be used from time to time, but that's okay. It all works out in the wash.			"

												The Secret World is a buy once - play forever experience. Endless skill customization, a dark and gritty story set in the modern day and more clothing than a Paris fashion show.  Sharp and witty dialogue and a long are slathered over a large number of quests in one of the few MMO's that rewards players that explore and go off the beaten path.  The game shows its age in graphics and janky character animations, but is overall a rewarding experience and one that is easy to recommend.Not sure if you want to pay the price?  Trial keys are available!

												The Secret world is one helluva game, consisting of vampires, Cthuhlu, Secret Societies, and more. This game is worth getting its massive edition as well as the Fall of Tokyo (as the Black Signal, Nightmare in Dream Palace, and Reaping the whirlwind are all bundled in it, leaving only The Venetian Crisis to be downloaded from Funcom.) This game is definitely worth getting, especially because of the rich story, the character customization, and even the setting. Get this game. It's worth the money.			"

												A lot of mixed opinions about this game, but I think it's amazing. It's obviously made for a certain audience and I'm happy to be a part of it. I am really sick of the same old fantasy bullocks (World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, Tera, Arche Age, ect) so this is quite a breath of fresh air.9/10 "

												So compellng and such a great change from WoW (I miss Vanilla Wow....), although WoW would probably have me hooked again if I spent the 5 days needed to download it all again.Only drawback is the amount of thinking needed (LOL?)I mean the game has it's own in game Google you need to use to solve quests.  I think I'll try it again though - I can see it's worth the effort to get through the first few levels - just gets a bit confusing with how to character build and what to specialise in.  An awesome concept that more people should take a chance on.  And yes, it's addictive unless you have absolutely no patience! :)  Great graphics, items, lore, and really nice to be playing with ""real"" people and not just NPCs for a change.			"

												If you are looking for something different than the traditional hack-and-slash or ""kill 10 X and bring me 6 Y"" type game, and if you enjoy reading an intriguing novel, TSW is the game for you. Excellent storytelling, fascinating storylines, exciting quests given by realistic characters - this game pins me to my chair everytime for hours on end. Not to mention the unusual skill-ability system, which doesn't penalize you for thinking outside the box and creating a warhammer wielding thaumaturge mage (with a rocket launcher). Some of the research quests are highly complex, requiring real life research (Internet is available in-game), and sometimes solving codes and cyphers yourself. Creativity and logic really helps during gameplay, and prevents the game from turning into a point-and-kill. Overall a very much enjoyable experience. 10/10			"

												so i'm not very far into this game, this is basically a first impression of the game so far: the secret world doesnt play like most mmorpg's i've played before. in the ones i've played, y ou grow bored if you're just gridning or doing quests by yourself, but the thing i like about TSW is that you can play by yourself like its a regular rpg if you want to, and you won't lose interest, or so i haven't yet. one thing i would change is the combat, its not point and click attacking like in WOW or any other  mmo.  you don't attack with your mouse, rather your number buttons, which can be kind of bothersome when you encounter multiple foes. really cool storyline so far (i haven't played any other faction yet besides illuminati) and all in all, i'm enjoying this game so far. on sale righ tnow for about 10 bucks, i'd say its worth it.

												A phenomenal adaptation/inspiration of HP Lovecraft's delightly horrifying works. Unlike traditional horror, which relies on jump scares and cheap frights, The Secret World draws upon Lovecraft's uncanny ability to tap into what truly terrifies the soul rather than what frightens the central nervous system. You won't be jumping out of your seat on this one. You'll be glued to it.Initially, I was hesitant to try this game out as an MMO, feeling it may better be adapted for single play, but I couldn't be more wrong. The community is just as friendly as my first MMO, FFXI Online, an experience I'd been unable to replicate until TSW. Although you can play through the game by yourself, you'll never feel truly alone, at least until you enter a wonderfully creepy solo instance, further reducing the frights and increasing the terror. Find a friend or sibling to play with, as I did, and you'll truly be in for an incredible experience.The Graphicsare good, even on a computer like mine that's overdue for a graphics card upgrade and experiences odd memory leaks. Even on low settings, the ambience of each zone feels truly unique, coloring each story in a uniquely terrifying way. From the uncertainty of what lies directly in front of you in the fog of Solomon Island to the unforgiving blistering heat of Egypt, this is a world flush with care, love, and lore from its developers.The Musical Score is very good. There's little else to say but that you won't be disappointed in the game's ability to match the cadence of your decesnt into madness with an appropriate tempo to accompany you.The Lore is what will entrance you for hours. Ragnar Tørnquist, the game's creative director, may very well be HP Lovecraft's reincarnation. You'll feel drawn into his world immediately, spending hours simply hunting down little bits of story to add to your knowledge of the secret world, and keeping your eyes open for new information.The Gameplay is truly phenomenal. While the control scheme is typical for an MMO, with your expected hotbar and somewhat uninspired movement, level progression is unique and entertaining. Eschewing traditional levels, you're allowed to select any ability, any weapon, and any strategem you desire, mixing and matching abilities from different progression trees to create a unique set of abilities. Tanks, DPS, and Healers are one thing, but the variety of choices you have on how to fufill those roles are quite large. Your Missions vary from simple collection quests and defeat a certain amount of enemies, to truly baffling mysteries where the game refuses to hold your hand. You're expected to use your brain, decode complicated ciphers with demonic runes, open up a bible to find a clue hidden in Psalms, or go online to one of the game's shadowy corperation's websites and find its employee directory for your next clue, using the game's own web browser feature. I will admit to you a remarkable frustration towards the morse code segments, though. I did not go to nautical school. I'm fairly certain most of us didn't either.For a fan of MMO's, this is a must buy. For fans of Lovecraft, this is a must buy. For fans of neither, this very well might be the game that endears you to both.			"

												This is one of the best MMOs I've ever played, if not the best. The combat is the standard ""Press 1, 2, 3, to attack"" yet it feels a bit different. It may be the modern setting, the mix of rifles and magic, or hammers if you want aswell. The quest design is easily the best I've seen in a MMO. You aren't a ""god"", you are just a soldier for the faction that you choose, among others. At the moment the game seems sparsely populated, but it may just be the time of day. All in all I recomend this, though look at screenshots and the other reviews before you decide, since this isnt FTP. "

												The best MMO I've ever played, and one of the best games I've ever played in general. The story is interesting, but you have to work to find a lot of it in a similar fashion to Dark Souls' lore system. The mechanics work well, the graphics are actually pretty great, and the part that I think is most impressive is the sheer amount of content in the game. By the time I'd logged around 6 hours, I'd only done 2 and a half real story missions and chose to focus on side missions, of which I'd done perhaps 30 or 40, which weren't even half of the ones that were available at the time. And that's only in the first area of the game. The truly massive amount of content in the game itself in addition to the DLC Issues that come out every so often with massive amounts of content on their own means that you'll more than get your money's worth out of it, especially now that you don't have to pay for a subscription, which is fantastic as well. A game I would recommend to anyone looking for a game to pump incredibly large amounts of time into, which is what I was looking for when I bought it, and boy did I find it. I'd also recommend checking out the Massive Edition since it comes with some pretty neat weapons, a baller pet, and other miscellaneous customization stuff along with three of the great DLC Issues that retail at $10 or so a piece, so it's a great deal at well.

												Yo, this game is too hype. Lovecraftian stuff? Awh yeah. Boatloads of content? AWH YEAH. A fun skill based curve rather than level grinding? AWH HELLL YEAH.This game is everything you could want from a non traditional MMORPG. It's incredibly story based but you can ignore all of it and still have fun/progress fine. Character progression is as you see fit, you gain points to put into either unlocking skills (none of that levelling it up, once you have it, it's yours) or into a limited ""character stat"" set (more of a weapon and equipment roadblock to stop you steamrolling the game with Quality 10 gear as soon as you spawn, but also adds small but nice bonuses, well implemented imo)The controls are pretty cool and very forgiving, it takes a few minutes to acclimatise if you're not quite the most veteran kb+m/mmo player. But due to how 1-7 are your skill use buttons (in place of auto attacks) it's easy enough to map to a controller (using 3rd party programs like xpadder or joy2key). Personally I like playing my AoE based character with a fight stick, with 1 or two buttons supplemented by having they keyboard nearby.The way character progression happens is very loose and based on your preference, it allows you to pick two weapons (from the total of 12 types, each with perhaps a good 50+ skills each) and later a third of several auxillary weapons. But there isn't a cap to how many points you can accumulate totally, so if you feel like you don't enjoy one weapon choice as much as you felt you would, it's not the end of the world, there's no need to create a new character and start again, just branch into a new tree.I could go on and on ad verbatum about how much this game is such a masterpiece in terms of MMORPG's but honestly, I haven't even really scratched the surface.

												Pros:-Modern setting with good graphics, intuitive controls, and tons of lore-Delve into the story behind factions including the Illuminati, the Templar, and the Dragon-Many hours of gameplay (At 20 hours I had just finished the first main area)-No subscription required, some free items included in purchase (check 'claim items' in store in game!)-Unique travel system between maps using underground tree network Agartha-Cutscenes and voices for every major NPC/quest to draw you into the story-Decent character customization choices for clothes/appearance-Unlock special outfits by completing certain skill sets-Over 500 skills to select from including 9 different weapon categories.-Equip 2 weapons at once, allowing use of skills from both seamlessly without even having to swap manually-Choose 7 active and 7 passive skills from any that you have unlocked from all categories.-Given time a single character could learn all skills; no specialization prevents you from unlocking any others-Solo play possible for those who enjoy it for all but the toughest missions-Variety of mission types - action, sabotage, investigations, item, dungeons, etc-Investigation mission puzzles are likely the most challenging you have seen in a gameCons:-No auto attacks, no attacking without skill use; this means you spend lots of time mashing your main skill button-Equipping new weapons/armor does not change the way your character appears-Some puzzles so challenging you are expected to solve using web browser, which can detract from immersion-Although no subscription required, you do have to pay for further releases of content (issues).-No means of travelling quickly within maps so you lose a lot of time having to repeatedly walk/fight your way through-'No class / No level' system is not accurate; you still gain XP and are limited by your skill and item levels  -This makes it somewhat less clear when you are really 'level-appropriate' for a given area until you end up dying-Due to most missions being repeatable in any area, you have less of a feel of closure when moving on to the next area			"

												This operates on the same model as Guild Wars 2 now, so no subscription fee. If you like conspiracy theories and Lovecraftian horror, and don't mind some slightly dated hotkey-based combat, this is pretty good. The writing is better than any other MMO I have played and the voice acting is good (apart from, as ever, anyone attempting to do a British accent).Worth trying now you only have to pay once for the game.

												This is a great game what i could only recommend. The story is well written and immersive. This is one of the few mmos/games where its worth watching the cutscenes and dialogues and you don't feel the urge to just skip them.There is a vast amount of content in the game. With my 333 hours played (right now) i'm still only at little more than halfway through the story. You can do it more quickly if you want, but i enjoyed to explore the locations as much as i could and do all the missions. And in top of that the developers are still adding more and more content to the game.There are dungeons and various pvp modes too.Time to time there are various events  which are interesting where you can earn cool rewards.The character customization feels unique and its wery deep. There are 7 type of talismans, 9 type of weapons, 5 auxiliary weapons, more than 500 active and passive skills (which can all be learned to chose the best combination for you), augments for skills and now aegis shields. There are so many possible combinations to experiment with it.All this complexity it might be a little overwhelming in the beggining, but you can find some really usefull guides in the internet. Recently they even made it more easy for new players to learn the basics and to get better equipment. They also made it easier to progress in the story.			"

												I've had expereince with many MMO's and RPG's. This one is so refreshing. It isn't the standard pick a class and level up system. This one allows you to be whatever you choose to. Whether you want to be up close, ranged, a mix between the two, or some random combination of skills that somehow you are able to make it work.In the game, you are able to use 2 different weapons at any given time, (Not including auxilary since I still havent made it that far) which already expands your capabilites beyond most other MMO's. Now if you don't like what you chose thats fine. You simply earn more Ability Points and Skill Points (which isn't hard at all) put them into a different category and start using different skills and weapons.All the main missions include cutscenes which are fully animated and IMO well written. Then you have side missions everywhere. Some are just there for extra experience, but most actually tie into either the main storyline or one of the main missions.But out of all the things this game offers, so far my favorite, is the investigation missions. These missions are difficult. They make you think. They only give you hints as what to do, you have to figure it out. There are no waypoints with this one. You will have to search things up and read from books, myths, news reports, and anything else you can think of just to be able to complete these. But if you don't care for this, then just google the mission follow the steps get the experience and move on with your life like a lame person would. (No offence to all those who do this.)I haven't experience everything this game has to offer yet, so I'll probably come back and add to this after another 100 hours of gameplay or so. Cause at this point, I only complete the first story mission I was assigned. From what I know, I still have 3 other HUGE zones that the story will go across and I've only done 1.So if you want a simple answer on whether or not this game is worth it. Yes. No subscription, but offer's just as much content as a subscription based game.			"

Update: They ruined it. I kind of regret spending money on this now. They've made a lot of bad changes for their new free-to-play re-release(that replaces my Steam version) and totally screwed over the original player-base that spent $50-100 to play all of their very over-priced content, while also limiting your character slots to one in the re-release and making you start over, among many more changes I don't like. Screw Funcom. This is no longer the game I purchased, which is bullsh!t.----- Original Review: -----9/10 - Easily my favorite MMORPG, which is also an incredible single-player game. This is a unique experience I highly recommend.Pros:Mature-themed and intelligent dialogues--they don't hold back.The atmosphere is amazing; better than most games I've played. You'll never want to leave.Unmatched missions that have a lot of variety and plots that are better than some AAA titles, with great voice acting and solid cutscenes(featuring your character!) for at least half of them(There's a lot!).A lot of missions are repeatable.Investigation missions are unlike anything you've seen before. They require real investigation, whether it be using your knowledge of the game, searching the internet(there's an in-game browser), or even calling real phone numbers. Expect these to be insanely difficult. You should put some on hold and do other missions while you think about their solutions or hints, explore the vast world until something ""ticks.""It makes you think.Everywhere in every zone, there's rich content to be found, whether it be hidden lore or a mission.Tons of in-depth lore to uncover.Many large zones to explore with different themes, filled with great design, content and atmosphere.Encourages exploration.You can explore when you die, as a ghost, and it is required for some things. The world changes when you're dead.Lovecraftian horror.Choose from three factions, each with their own story and hub. Illuminati, Templar or Dragon.Great character customization with tons of cosmetics to unlock or buy.You get a hat for eating 7460 tacos.Countless in-game achievements with rewards of all kinds(XP, cosmetics, items, titles, etc.).There's no character levels. You earn XP to unlock Ability Points and Skill Points; the required amount of XP never changes. You're able to unlock all 500+ abilities on a single character to create complex builds. Skill Points decide which quality level of items you can equip.Since your equipment's quality level matters so much, it's not such a bad idea to rush to the next zone to get better loot, then go back to make things a bit easier(A mission may be required to advance to the next zone).Two weapon types can be equipped at once in any combination and you can change them at any time, then you can unlock a 3rd special weapon later in the game.9 Main weapon types include Assault Rifle, Pistols, Shotgun, Fist, Hammer, Blade, Elemental, Chaos and Blood.There's auxiliary weapons such as a Rocket Launcher, Flamethrower, Quantum, Chainsaw and Whip. These would be the 3rd weapon you can equip at once and they each have their own set of abilities.Seasonal events.Good pacing; not grindy as most MMORPGs are.Nice music, I never felt the need to disable it.Buy-to-play, no subscription.Over 160 hours in and there's still a ton of content I haven't done.Memorable.Dungeons and Scenarios have multiple difficulties.After completing 30 missions, you get 1200 free points to spend in their store, which can be used to purchase extra mission packs among many goods.The Issues(mission packs) that are sold don't really come into play until endgame and they're optional, so if you make it that far, they probably deserve the extra money anyway.It has PvP, for those that are looking for it. You can completely avoid it like I have.The community is nice and helpful. Be sure to join the ""#Sanctuary"" chat channel, great place.You can fast travel to anima wells you find at a very low cost.The zone maps seen via the [M] key are very nice, with coordinates as well as the ability to place text markers to label noteworthy spots. I use that feature a lot.Addon/mod support.Countless high quality textures and images you'll see in missions.Upgradeable sprint speeds(unlocked through faction rank. You have to buy the upgrade in your faction's hub and a lot of people tend to miss this feature for a long time).Item crafting and disassembling.Auction House(I like them, and it only helps this game).Expand inventory space many times simply by using in-game currency. You can split inventories for sorting.You'll probably only use one character, but you can have multiple.Makes time fly.Cons:Ridiculously underrated considering this may be the best MMO available. There's not a ton of people playing(a few thousand maybe), but that's okay, since at least 90% of the content is possible solo. It's pretty much a single-player game with social features, but you can group up if you wish. I'd say most of the players are using a non-Steam client, so ignore the Steam charts. It's actually not integrated with Steam at all, so you don't have to run it through Steam either. You get a key for the game that you redeem on your account to activate it.Some people don't like the combat, some say it's the only downfall, but I personally kind of like it; I've seen much worse. You'll be dodging plenty of attacks, kiting and aiming with AoEs or cone-style attacks, plus the animations and effects are nice.DX11 has a couple bugs, so you may be better off running it in DX9 like me. I think DX9 even gives a better framerate. The option is available.The framerate could be better, but it's acceptable and I get too immersed to notice. I think maybe it just doesn't like my 8-core AMD CPU very much, that's not uncommon with MMOs.The prices on Steam are fairly high, especially for Issues(additional endgame missions), but it's definitely worth it.It may be a bit difficult to get into at first, for some people, but that's because there's so much to it!50GB install size, but judging from the amount of high quality content and voice acting in the game, that install size seems fair.No Steam achievements. I would've enjoyed them.Update:10-Day Free Trial here[play.thesecretworld.com] "

												Looking up bible verses, defeating the pumpkin king and lovecraft type monsters and going to a hellish motel.  Plus things I haven't even gotten to yet like werewolves, mummies, and the like.  This multiplayer rpg has it all.  The right combo of puzzle solving and fighting.  Love every minute of it.  Definetly recommended.			"

												Just purchased this game a few days ago.  I have been thinking about it for a few months and was not sure I wanted to spend the money.  I would recommend the game, I have played a few hours so I am not an expert, nor have I seen everything, but I like what I have seen so far.  There still are people playing it which is nice, the missions I have played so far seem varied and interesting, the graphics are pretty good, and the atmosphere is nice.  The game is not ground breaking, but it is a fun mmo to play.  The only probelms I have had with the game are the long amount of time the patching is taking, not sure if that is because I just purchased the game, but everytime I have wanted to play it is patching, at first it took a long time, now it is down to about 3 minutes.  The other problem is that I had a lot of stuttering when using dx11, so I had to switch to dx9 which I haven't had any problems with FPS wise or stuttering.  I like the game, I would recommend it for some fun playing experiences, definetly not the greatest game every, but for me it is very entertaining.  FYI there are some pretty good videos on youtube by Totalbiscuit and others if you want to look at gameplay prior to buying.			"

												The greatest storytelling you've seen in an MMO (yes, story in an MMO, you heard me), combined with a cast of memorable NPCs and excellent voice acting makes TSW a worthwhile purchase even if you normally don't like this genre. You can play it as a traditional single-player RPG and still have a great time. And if you choose to stick around after finishing the story, the game has a surprisingly mature and friendly community that is always willing to help. Now go buy the Massive Edition, because it includes the last 3 issues, which are a treat to play.			"

												Having been playing since before its official release, I gotta say this game is a keeper. Intriguing story, plenty of stuff to do, plenty of things to see, and I personally find the combat refreshing for an MMO. Dungeons are there to grind if that's your thing, although the elitism can be annoying at times (don't be a 1970 please--use your keyboard). Honestly the main story and multiple side stories which all tie together are what really make this game wonderful. Everything is rooted in real life legends, mysteries, places, stories, and intrigues. There's TONS of lore to peruse through and investigation missions, while often being really frustrating to figure out, are also very interesting in terms of their topics and references. Animations and clothing selection could use a bit of work but at least the number of mission bugs has decreased a lot (LOL when this game first released). I also wish the main story mission was repeatable but alas, perhaps someday. In addition, I wish holiday events were laid out more simply and were not so heavily based on big team activities, BUT then again this is an MMO, and one based on the hidden ""secret world"" to boot. It should be noted that this game is fairly graphics intensive-expect it to be necessary to lower graphics for large groups and dungeons.Overall, this game lives in the spaces between genres in more ways than one and that's what makes it the memorable experience that it is.

Now i can play in the cold technologic modern world, where secret societies run everything. It's just perfect.And the quests aren't just ""go talk to that guy, skip the dialog and go back to get your reward"".Here you actually need to do research and pay attention to details and conversations.The only thing i don't like is to have a voiceless character, i never liked that from any game.And again, unlike other MMOs here you need a real strategy to defeat different bosses or even some mobs, it's not just go target and click some skill buttons.100% recommended if you like this kind of games.

												One of the few mmos that I can get into without a group of friends to play with. I'd say this one is truly original when compared to the WOW style mmos that are all too common. Pros No levels, just gear (enchanted belts, rings, bracelets, etc)Freedom to switch it up as often as you like (weapons,passives,actives) Clothing is completely aesthetic, wear whatever looks goodIt's pretty solid in the gameplay department as well. You can equp two different weapons and alternate their abilities to create unique combinations, and the game helps you out by giving you templates (""decks"") that give you a path to take toward an effective weapon combination.ConsWarning/spoiler:Story is complete gibberish, and most of the voice acting is sub-par. At no point does the main storyline even begin to make sense, so just roll with it. (lol)Overall, I think this is a great game that is worth maybe 30 dollars for everything that it offers.

												-----------------------------------------Battle Cthulhu, reclaim Hell, explore an abandoned amusement park, investigate the mysterious Orochi Group, haunted mansions, Indian legends, ancient cities, condemned laboratories, child experiments, buzzing bees, the growing Filth, mad scientists, soviet slaughterhouses, and all things occult. Come on in.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------State of the MMO:A niche game with a small but dedicated fan base. New content is still being added. I wouldn't worry that you are buying an MMO at the end of it's life.-----------------------------------------There are great adventure zones:Kingsmouth, where a mysterious fog has rolled in and brought its share of zombies.Egypt, where a group of cultists are working to revive a dead god.Transylvania, where ghouls and spectors outnumber townsfolk, and old soviet experiments have created deadly vampires.Tokyo, soon to be released.-----------------------------------------Skill System/Theorycrafting:There are nine weapons, from which you can use any two at a time. Each weapon focuses on two possible roles, like healing/tanking/dps/support. There are over 500 unique skills in total, and the forums are always buzzing about the optimal builds for each role. No weapons are really that underpowered, and each works well depending on the situation. Gear can get rather complicated at high levels. People who like min-maxing will have a blast. If you don't, tons of people will be happy to give you tips.-----------------------------------------Missions:Some of the best I have ever played. There are ""investigation"" missions where you must crack codes, solve mysteries, and investigate the occult. A lot of these bring back a pen and paper adventure game feel, but can easily be avoided if not your cup of tea. Most missions are on a 1-2 day cooldown, after which you can do them again if you like.-----------------------------------------PvP:I actually can't recommend this. There are some that really love it, but I would not say this is one of the games stronger points. -----------------------------------------The Community: This game has the best community I've ever seen. It's a more mature demographic than you might find on the average WoW server. It's easy to find a guild to group/raid with, and even at low levels there are tons of people eager to help. There is even a player made, in-game channel called the Sanctuary, devoted to helping newcomers.-----------------------------------------Cash Shop:There is a cash shop, but 90% of it consists of vanity items/exp boosts. There is nothing in it that could really be seen as pay-to-win. As the game is no longer on a pay-to-play, new content is a one time purchase in the cash shop. Again,  they are not strictly necessary, but I've enjoyed each one enough that I would buy it again. If the massive edition is on sale you might want to get that, as it will save you around $20 at a later date.----------------------------------------------Overall I would highly recommend it.			"

Posted: April 5, 2014
												The Secret World is a game I was tempted to play when it was released in 2012, but because it was most likely yet another MMO condemned to fail I just never bothered. The Steam sale reminded me of its existence and the removal of the subscription requirement gave me a reason to try it out. Yes, it's barely alive and (thus) not much of a MMO but the Secret World still manages to be surprisingly entertaining nonetheless. It may have been different before, but I'm very well able to play the game without even sharing a minute with another player. I even surprised myself with a feeling of rather irritation than excitement when I see another player, who is most likely going after 'my' quest mobs or about to spoil a future quest event. The only thing you might miss when playing on your own are the few dungeons the game has, but the solo-instances make up for them.Which brings me to the strongest point of the Secret World: the quests are captivating. Not just because of the dark (sometimes twisted) stories they have to tell, but also the refreshing gameplay. Most quests involve in-game cinematics and the occasional text (item) is often displayed to you in a very creative and attractive way. Yes, you're still more often than not killing # of these things and gather # of those items. But it rarely feels like a grind; as the mobs and the environment are stunningly original and demand your full attention: Traps are where you least expect them and the mobs are often well camouflaged. A step in the wrong direction often results in death due to a 'double pull'. The occasional 'research quest' are incredibly well done and connects the game with the real world in a fantastic way. Though people with a proper brain will still find some of them extremely challenging. Veterans might beg to differ, but the game is hard so far. As a newbie you're thrown into the deep after struggling with poor tutorials and a 'help'-system that seems to be half finished; on some meaningless subjects you're bored with a video, while some of the essential subjects consist of one empty sentence. While the game pretends like it doesn't matter what kind of weapon (spec) you pick, you will notice soon enough that without any strong healing abilities you'll end up dead quite often, as the healing abilities of some weapons simply aren't good enough. After I realized this and adopted 'Blood Magic'-healing, the game feels more doable. ConclusionThe relatively hard (combat gameplay and learning) difficulty and 'subscribe-to-play' competition were probably the main reasons this game wasn't succesful as an MMO. Yet the Secret World is captivating, rewarding and original in its genre. I sincerely recommend you to give it a go when you're into challenging games with good stories to tell.			"

												I'm only partway through the first world; I think they call them ""issues"" with TSW.  The first issue plays like a MMO version of Resident Evil almost, but there are epic puzzles, truly freaky moments.  The graphics are pretty nice on the highest settings.  Combat is somewhat like Guild Wars 2, except you can mix and match abilities as you like and all characters can heal, tank, or DPS.  Crafting is somewhat odd, but easy once you get the hang of it.  There's loads of little collectibles and achievements if you're into that sort of thing as well.  The mission system is fairly straightforward, although you'll wish you could pick up more than the limit of side missions the game allows.  There are three factions to choose from, although you will run through mostly the same missions, you will see differing mission completion text tailored to what zone you're in and what faction you're in.  Voice acting so far is excellent.  TSW is also the brainchild of Ragnar Tornquist, the creator of The Longest Journey (an awesome P&C adventure title). The one dungeon I've been through was awesome, hard, and epic.The game doesn't require a subscription, but rather an initial purchase, and here's where TSW makes its money.  The initial purchase (at least through steam) will get you issues 1-4 or 1-7, depending on what version you get.  Currently TSW is up to Issue 9.  Each issue if purchased separately is basically $10.  However, from what I am hearing, each issue averages at least 40 hours of gameplay.  I'm 28 hours into the first issue, but my companion and I are trying to hit every mission.  You can also buy clothing and special items.  It's not pay to win by any stretch of the imagination...it's pay once to continue playing for a long time, and pay to customize your character.I'd definitely recommend playing with another person, it's way more fun.  I don't even want to play it by myself.  I usually end up healing and hitting with ranged attacks while my compatriot tanks with melee attacks.			"

												So yeah this is my first review so I'll keep it short and sweet since there is much I can say. One I can't keep my system on three way crossfire I've noticed Issues with the script. So after switching to only one R7 all is good. Other than that the graphics are amazing, Its hard to believe this game is almost two years old. This game is just way too damn addicting. It has been my personal obsesion for the last past two and a half weeks since i got back into it. Off the bat one thing that is clear is this game is harder than coffin nails so if you don't like a challenge look else where. The secret world is one of those games I couldn't get into around its launch I actually bought a physical copy and couldn't get into it due to the lack of following, content, and just plain old not having the gear to have an enjoyable expirience. Around the hollidays last year they dropped the price down to fifteen bucks after seeing that steam provided the right forum for this game to shine. I said why not and bought another copy. I'm so glad I did, right away I noticed there was way more to do and much more of a following now. Now that I've got the ball rolling I can also say I've even enjoyed the story so far. I can see myself still playing this game two maybe even five years from now. Like someone else mentioned If you're unsure buy it on sale and see what happens. You might like it. For anyone wanting a break from MMOs as you know them this is it. For anyone who's never played an MMO before give it a shot. As for me this is my third MMO this is the first one to pull me in like this.			"

The modern day horror setting is a breath of fresh air in the world of tired and true MMOs. With the ability to build up your character to specialize in multiple things you can easily swap from a tank build to a healer. The quest are interesting, the enviroments are creepy, and the dungeons and the bosses they inhabit are fun instead of tedious. With the subscription fee gone, now is a good time to check out TSW.

												TSW is an action adventure game with MMORPG mechanics (combat, PvP, group content). The writing and art design are all excellent - enough to warrant a satisfying single player experience! If you're a fan of Gaiman, Lovecraft or King - you'll love the setting. Horror is a main theme here and there are many ""nope"" moments.I've been playing this game since early access and the story/setting still messes up my head big time. It slowly builds from mysterious text messages, words hastily written on torn-out pages, whispers from the faucet. To get a glimpse of what's happening, you have to piece it from lore entries, dialogues, small hints in dialogues or hacked emails.The production value is very high. Most quests have fully voiced cutscenes and there's a lot of unique art assets - all items you investigate have their own art work (cell phones, books, notes etc.). This is one of the most challenging MMOs I've played - both quests and combat require thought and skill. Investigation missions are hard, but even the basic missions require some investigating (in most cases you actually have to figure out where to go). Many quests play like an adventure game - you have to hack computers, combine items, finding hidden objects, solve environmental. Combat requires a lot of movement and the limit on active/passive skills requires a good setup.The game goes very cheap on sales and the basic purchase gives you full access to PvP, dungeons and raids. Subscription is totally optional and just gives you a small xp boost, points to spend in shop and a vanity item. There are paid mission packs released every few months and some of them are good to have for high-end gaming. The game shop is mostly xp boosting and clothing - there are ""magic boxes"", but it's nothing major (everything you get from them can be obtained by normal means).BRAINBONER 428/10			"

To get a glimpse of what's happening, you have to piece it from lore entries, dialogues, small hints in dialogues or hacked emails.The production value is very high. Most quests have fully voiced cutscenes and there's a lot of unique art assets - all items you investigate have their own art work (cell phones, books, notes etc.). This is one of the most challenging MMOs I've played - both quests and combat require thought and skill. Investigation missions are hard, but even the basic missions require some investigating (in most cases you actually have to figure out where to go). Many quests play like an adventure game - you have to hack computers, combine items, finding hidden objects, solve environmental. Combat requires a lot of movement and the limit on active/passive skills requires a good setup.The game goes very cheap on sales and the basic purchase gives you full access to PvP, dungeons and raids. Subscription is totally optional and just gives you a small xp boost, points to spend in shop and a vanity item. There are paid mission packs released every few months and some of them are good to have for high-end gaming. The game shop is mostly xp boosting and clothing - there are ""magic boxes"", but it's nothing major (everything you get from them can be obtained by normal means).BRAINBONER 428/10			"

												If you want a game that mixes thought provoking puzzles, a classless system, complex-as-you-want ability system as well as traditional MMORPG elements ... TSW is fabulous.  The graphics are very nice (intel i5 w/ Geforce GTX 670 4GB and 16 GB RAM runs ~60 fps).  The investigative missions can be VERY hard (for example, need to know or study Morse Code for one particular mission).  No other game I know of has a built in Web Browser just so you can look up which composer wrote a particular song so you can hack a password ingame.  FunCom is not trying to nickel and dime you but does offer boosts and vanity items in the online store.  Catch it on sale for 15 bucks you will be completely tickled.  Pay full price and you will not regret it.  You'll easily get your money out of this one even before you leave the first real zone.If you are not interested in having to think through problems and want everything handed to you ... THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU.  You do not have to do investigative missions at all, but they really do help set this one apart from everything else.On the bad side ... my only complaint is some of the monsters' models looks overdone.  Someone tried way to hard to give lots of detail and really only succeeded in a mess.  But they are monsters, so they shouldn't be pretty.			"

												This game is pretty damn good if I say so myself. The storyline is unique in a sense that it combines modern day cities and areas with ancient myths, giving it a farmiliar feel but also a very foreign vibe to the environments. The characters are completely customizable, both in the way they look and how there is no specific class system. The community is very helpful with different problems as long as you just ask, and overall it is a fun and addictive experience. The only complaints I have on this game is that the graphics seem outdated by a couple of years or so, and it is hard. And I mean HARD. Because of the way the game is built, there is no leveling however your character recieves skill points to level up different skills and items, most of which would keep you alive in higher skilled areas. I found it hard to just go in alone and do my own thing, and the community is smaller than a standard MMO so it usually is just solo questing. Of course, once skills and quality gear is found, the game progresses rapidly and you'll be in transylvania and egypt in no time. There isn't much of a learning curve, although it takes some experimenting to find out your own playstyle, as there is no class or leveling system. All in all, a buy to play game with no subscription fee is well worth the money, and in the case of the Secret World, is worth every penny. 9/10			"

												Excellent storytelling and a break from the fantasy and sci-fi mold make this game engrossing. The ability to level up all the different weapons and skills on a character and swap between different sets of them at will means you never have to reroll or level an alt or find someone that can fit the role you need. At 100+ hours I've still got lots to explore. Well worth the price.			"

												Very unique spin on classic MMO tropes; the investigation missions are very detailed and require such varied skills as breaking morse code audio, crytpography, and attention to small details within the game world. I also like the skill system; there are no levels just experience points to spend and if you dedicate enough time you can max out every available power in the game.

												A decent game with some unusual elements for a semi-action MMO. However, it seems that at one point during its development, the project suffered a few major hits (budget, staffing, production, etc) and to be brutally honest, I don't think this title ever really recovered. What went live was not what this game had the potential to be.I'm not going to ramble about specifics. The UI is a bit dodgy, the gameplay is middle of the road for semi-action MMOs, the writing is reasonable, the in-game instructions on how to play it are not, and if you don't have at least a moderate graphics processor, you're going to struggle with some of this game. Beyond that, all I'm going to say is THIS GAME IS NOT SCARY. It's more of a conspiracy theory MMO than anything else, regardless of what the first zone might be attempting. Oh, and... expect puzzles which involve knowledge you probably don't have.I'm going to recommend this game with a caveat: play it for free for a while, at least until you hit the content pay wall. Keep an open mind about it - you may find the design differences refreshing. If not, well... all you've lost is time.			"

												If you're a fan of horror movies or conspiracy films, this is the game for you. It manages to blend The Mummy, The X-files, Friday the 13th, and a bunch of other franchies into one perfectly.However, game play can be a bit repetitive. While this game does feature better combat than most MMOs, it will get stale after playing for a prolonged period.But what you're really here for is the story, lore, and the atmosphere, all of which are top notch. Plus, a ton of fun easter eggs and references to horror series.Give this one a chance if you're a horror junky. The game even manages to be quite scary and distrubing at times in its own right.			"

Recommended with CautionThe Secret World is a very artistic game full of varied and immersive content. However, it has its problems and people looking to purchase the game should weigh the pros and cons carefully before investing time and money into the title.ProsStarting out the game is really impressive. The acting and the writing work hand in hand to deliver immersive content early on to the player. You can chose from three factions and each has a different flavor. Missions are varied and don't come off like the typical set of chores ala ""Go to Farmer Fred's fields, kill 10 vermin in the fields, bring 10 vermin tails  back to Farmer Fred for reward.""Any grind is well hidden in the game world which is expertly crafted from the outset. It makes most of TSW highly replayable.Other plusses include the helpful community of users and the excellent response time of their customer service staff. When you run into trouble GMs will respond quickly and efficiently to your troubles.This is where TSW shines and it can't be emphasized enough - it makes the game unique and special. It almost makes its many cons forgivable.ConsThe game has a limited shelf life. You can do their lovely missions over and over and enjoy dungeons and two small raids and mini raids called lairs. However, their later end content lacks the polish that their first few zones have.As a composition, TSW begins to fall apart at end content. It comes off poorly coded and rife with bugs and very low in actual story content. Issue 8 and Issue 9 are blatantly grindy and are lacking in much story content. In issue 9's case the story is there, but there's little of it. It feels more like a beta than anything that should be ready for prime time.High end dungeons for end content players have many mechanical bugs as bosses will glitch and run off the field of battle and reset themselves. As a MMO it fails in encouraging cooperation. Their loot system is antiquated and follows a Need or Greed model rather than some of the more party friendly games like Guild Wars 2 or Wildstar. This doesn't pose a particular problem in the early parts of the game, but in end content where the game degenerates into a grindfest, it can be an excrutiating experience. For example, in issue 8 you can grind bosses and they can drop junk or uncommons. Other problems include a dated engine and poor graphics optimization so there are a lot of glitches, frame rate drops, and lag on even higher end computers which are well above the minimum requirements to play the game. Other ThoughtsFuncom went through some layoffs in the recent past and that has impacted the TSW team heavily. They are slow to put out content and the new content that is being delivered just doesn't have the polish as earlier content.It's blatant that they are cutting corners and delivering substandard content. Anything after Transylvania should be viewed with caution.Pre Issue 8 and 9 had its quirks. Like they couldn't afford to give you choice in the story or even hire a voice actor for your character so you get to play a mute. Or the writers were stuck on how to advance a story and so they have your character constantly derp their way through the storylines. The amount of times your character is punked is mildy amusing at first and then just gets blatantly annoying. More blatant signs start in Issues 6 and 7 where they couldn't manage to put females in the budget and used the generic male story line for females including resources in their cut scenes like male walking animations and story choices. So if you're playing a female or if you are a female player, you're not important enough to put in the budget. You get to move around and respond to story content as if you were male.ConclusionI'd recommend the game for its early missions. There's enough early content in the game that would keep a player and their friends busy for a good many hours and allow for a lot of cooperative fun. If you're an end content player, I'd suggest finding another title because this one just doesn't have what you're looking for.			"

												Want to play a game that allows you to play all the classes? Want to play a horror style mmo?  Want to play a game that keep you coming back?  This is that game.  I have played it since the closed beta, left three times, and come back.  I love the stories, puzzles, and play style.  It can be as hard or as easy as you want with the investigation missions.  The only advice i would give is when you start you might pick 1 of the healing weapons as either your first or second weapon.  (fist/blood/assult rifle).  it makes  building your survival build much easier.			"

												I admit the UI was a bit jarring at first, especially when FPS-style gameplay has become the norm. But by my third day, I had it down pretty good.What I like about the game so far:1. The option to actually walk. I don't run everywhere in real life. And the running animation actually looks normal and not superfast. People aren't hopping everywhere, thank God!2. The Lore collectibles. Really helps flesh out the world.3. The voice-acting and cut-scenes. At first, I was like... 'can we get on with the game?' cause there's a lot on the first day as you get orientated. But by the second and third day, I was actually enjoying them.4. The quests are logical. And most can be re-done after a cooldown period.5. You really can't power-level, due to the way mission difficulties are set up.6. Lots of atmosphere.7. Your items degrade, by a very small bit, when you die. And can be repaired.8. Crafting isn't your usual A+B=C. There's actual recipes for everything craftable, and require you to either have a copy of the item to observe (by disassembling) or, if you're desperate, a websearch.9. There's an actual story to the game.10. Unlimited APs. There is no need to ever respec, or desire to.11. I like the active ability toolbars. It makes sense that any character would have a limit to what he or she could do at any given time. And it encourages players to find the combination of abilities that works for them.12. I haven't seen anybody that looks like me... even though I do look pretty normal. And if I wanted to, I could take my jacket off, wear my glasses or change shirts and pants.13. The monster AI is not bad. Some will aggro you on sight. Some won't even be bothered until you're right up in their space. You can lure some out of clusters, and some attack in packs.14. Rewards dropped from killing monsters can only be picked up by you, for a set amount of time. No one's going to swoop in and claim all your loot, unless you just abandon it.15. There's faction vs. faction, with members of the dominant faction receiving a small xp boost. Something I really miss from my Dark Age of Camelot days.And the three factions have believable motivations. It's not just red team, blue team, yellow team.16. They're still adding content. Not that that's important to me right now, as I'm still in Kingsmouth and I have a loooong way to go to get caught up.17. The Chronicle, that's updated daily, gives you an overview of your character.I will say that there was a steep learning curve the first couple days, and everything did kinda overwhelm me when I started.But by the third day, I knew what abilities work best for me and I have a better understanding of how to play.To me, the game feels like DC Universe Online meets Dark Age of Camelot meets Call of Cthulhu meets Shadowrun.And it has vampires, werewolves and zombies, along with the expected cultists and demons.As for graphics...I play on Ultra with 1024x768 fullscreen and it looks better than a lot of other games that have existed in half the time this one has.

Dark Demons Cry GaiaAs someone who generally avoids MMOs, The Secret World hooked me fairly easily with its modern-day urban fantasy setting and Deus Ex-like approach to conspiracy lore. In presentation alone it’s a huge breath of fresh air.The game is “buy to play,” requiring an initial purchase with further subscription being optional. The benefits to a subscription are loyalty rewards for time subscribed ranging from unique pets to clothing items, an XP boost, a 10% discount in the item store, and, most notably, ten dollars worth of currency for said item store. The store itself is home to a great deal of items, but they can ultimately be placed into two categories: Cosmetic and Boosts; even the mystery Loot Crates only provide semi-randomized bonuses that fall into the second category. Paying real money for anything that affects gameplay is really only buying an accelerator for one kind of progression or another, and progression is nowhere near slow enough to make the player feel shoehorned into spending money if they don’t want to. In fact, it’s probably far more likely you’ll find a pair of pants you really want for your character in the item store than a boost you can’t live without.Being effective in combat is more about planning out builds and skill rotation than spamming abilities; players have a fairly limited number of active abilities at any given time, split between any combination of two weapon classes. Some combinations are, of course, better than others, but most weapons have something to offer any given role. The MMO “holy trinity” is present in any activity requiring a group, but because the game is classless and every player eventually learns every skill, there is significant wiggle room. One (in)famous dungeon is often done with a self-healing tank, for example, while the group’s healer switches over to dedicated damage-dealing. Another dungeon usually sees the damage-dealers also playing support roles to help the healer deal with the bosses’ tendency to spam damage-over-time effects.Aside from things specifically meant for groups, the main meat of the game can be experienced from start to finish by a solo player, although this severely limits play options; a soloist will have to be able to survive on their own, requiring some form of healing or tanking ability, usually the former. Co-op’ing the story and sidequests with even a single friend can result in a much more diversified experience with players able to pick and choose roles, but the capability of solo play allows players who wouldn’t normally be interested in a social experience to treat the game like a normal RPG with drop in/drop out co-op. While endgame dungeon grinds can’t be done solo by any means, the entire story can be played through without ever touching the endgame grind. A player uninterested in making the numbers on their gear go up will not find themselves hindered in advancing the plot.The story itself puts most single-player RPGs to shame. NPCs are lovingly voice-acted and animated, reflected in the game’s 40GB install size. Moreover, they are written as interesting people and do not lose the player to apathy while waiting for them to just say what item they need five of brought to them. Mechanics like player resurrection don’t just have lampshades hung on them, but are actually important to the setting; being dead and looking for something of interest on the other side is required for solving more than one quest. The actual plot twists and turns around the game’s various locations, avoiding frustration by giving the player character actual progress in solving the various mysteries before bringing up new ones. There is a lot of story to go through; sidequests often provide relevant information, if not easy access to the in-game codex, giving a reason to do them beyond the XP reward. Unfortunately, the plot does not vary greatly between the different factions; the different NPCs one must deal with provide greater variety between them than the faction specific missions, although a point in those missions’ favor is that they are each actually the same mission as seen differently by each organization. Still, at no point did I find myself not caring what happens next, and not just for the main plot. The player is actively encouraged to wander around Elder Scrolls style (though the game world is nowhere near as large as that comparison may imply, unfortunately,) exploring everything. Many quests are found in the wild instead of being given by NPC questgivers, and almost every quest involves exploring the setting in some way, even if it’s only fighting back a nasty overgrowth of the local eldritch horror.Quests are built with the setting in mind. An entire subset of quests is labeled as “Investigation,” and the game is not kidding. These often require serious thought and observation of details, a far cry from the usual MMO fetch quest. The fact that your character is given a high-end smartphone in the beginning is not just for flavor, as you will often use the in-game web browser to check information from company websites and blogs, or, if you’re very poor at puzzle solving like I am, to google the solution. There is absolutely no shame in giving up on a quest or three in this game. While the investigation missions may be unforgiving, they are rarely illogical and progress naturally; finishing one without cheating feels like one has made a genuine triumph instead of feeling like one has worked around obtuse design.If anything is obtuse, it’s not the quest design but, rather, the UI. Why a game that has not one but two quests involving morse code does not come standard with an in-game notepad is beyond me. Fortunately, many of the UI’s shortcomings (including the lack of a notepad) can be solved with third-party plugins. Quests are also not bug-free, but the developers have been very diligent in fixing them since release. They're also very attentive towards the player base; not only do events happen regularly, they last long enough for anyone interested to achieve even the most grindy of goals and once-in-the-game’s-lifetime rewards without playing the game non-stop for a week on end.The game does not have in-depth PvP, but what’s there is functional. Enough people play it that you’ll end up in a queue for the PvP areas more often than not. Starting players will have a stat boost when entering PvP so it can be played at any point in character progression, not just end-game. Effectiveness is entirely based on build, and the game encourages different builds not only for different situations, but for the different activities as well. A standard solo build will be less effective in a dungeon, a standard dungeon build will be less effective in the Scenario activities where each player must have some level of survivability instead of relying purely on the healer. The game makes it relatively easy to manage different builds with an easy menu for saving them and then switching between different ones.The graphics do not disappoint. High settings put a high amount of detail on everything, from paved road to grass to buildings to clothing. The game is fairly scalable but meeting the minimum system requirements are a must, the developers have not been conservative with them. If you choose to roll a Dragon, be prepared for an experience with the uncanny valley in the intro; by and large, however, the game avoids this problem. The writhing Filth lives up to the horror people speak of it with. The baked desert of Egypt is, as it should be, a far cry from soggy, dreary New England.The Secret World brings some much-needed variety into the MMO space, not just for the setting, but for the effort put into quest design that makes accomplishing things both interesting and fulfilling.

												This is without a doubt an interesting take on the MMO genre. Instread of the usual high fantasy route, this game decided to go with a more urban take and set the game in the modern world kept secret to all of us normal people. As your character is basically forced to join into a secret society; either the Illuminati (who are much less competent than you would think), the Templars (Think old guard, less sinester than Assassin's Creed would have you believe) and the Dragon (Far East Triad that does what the Illuminati wishes they were doing). Afterwards you take up your new powers and fight against supernatural horrors arround the world or atleast the Soloman Isles, Egypt, and Transylvania in the base game.Combat is mostly combo points to anyone familiar with WoW or Diablo, Firearms attach them to your enemies, magic has your character hold the points, and melee changes it up and works like a 5 point energy that restores over time. It doesn't take much to get use to.Quests come mostly in two favors, your 20 bear asses collect or kill quests and investigation missions. Investigation has you searching areas, solving puzzles, learning passwords that often require real world research to find. The game has an in game internet browser for this reason. Yes, investigation missions give more experence than almost anything else (that anything else being the main story).Overall this MMO is intresting, but I can only recomend it if you can find it on sale. I will also note that this is only for the base game. You will be paying more money if you want more content outside of the base game.			"

It's VERY story heavy, and the story is fiendishly engaging. A lot of the quests have fully voiced cutscenes which involve the NPCs giving you hints for what you should do. The quests are highly intuitive and unique and are, in my opinion, a fantastic study in how to break the 'Kill X monsters' or 'Find Y items' monotony of many MMOs. Prepare to use your brain because these quests actually require you to think. Pressing B in-game brings up an internet browser which they fully expect you to use to google things. One quest wanted me to spell out a specific word from a specific verse in a Latin translation of the Bible. Another had me go to a fake company's website to look up how to repair one of their radio dishes and then sent me a location in Morose Code. I haven't even covered a fraction of the content, but I'm excited to see what else they have for me.The game isn't perfect by any means, but it's still really cool. The setting and the world they put together is my all-time favorite type of setting, so I admit I'm biased on that but even so it's really well done and very coherent. I'll try and wrap this up without repeating things now:Pros:Super awesome atmosphere, interesting story line, really unique and memorable quests, gear and clothing are different things so you can dress however you'd like, go clothes shopping in London, punch some zombies, really flexible skill system which can and should be changed up as needed, most things can be completed solo if approached intelligently, it actually treats me as if I can think instead of blindly pushing me from quest hub to quest hub, you can phone in completed quests so you don't have to run back to the quest giver, look for quest clues while you're a ghost, there's a skinwalker type dude who can sell you GIANT STACKS OF TACOS in London. Don't want to use tacos instead of traditional health potions? That's cool too because you can break the tacos into giant stacks of nachos for quicker snacks.Cons:Skill system can be intimidating at first, the minimum specs are kind of high and it doesn't really play well if they aren't met, quests, especially investigation type quests, can get really hard, really fast simply because it's expecting me to do things I'm not trained to do in a game. One quest dealt with a ghost and I didn't know what to do because it turns out I needed to be dead to see the next clue.It's different, but I'd like to see more things like it. There isn't a subscription fee so if you're even curious you should give it a chance. If you're not sure it'll run, ask someone who plays for a referral and try it for 72 hours free.And remember, EVERYTHING. IS. TRUE.			"

												People may be put off by the big price tag, but its definatly worth the money you pay for it! The controls at first seem a bit hard to use, but after playing it for a few hours (which you will have no trouble doing so) you will get used to the controls and start to actually enjoy them! The game is huge. Ive only played for about 40 hours, over 2 different characters, and Im still in the first issue/expansion pack! The community in TSW is great. You will end up doing quests with a few randomers if you are doing the same quest, which is an experience you wont get in something like WoW. This is a great MMO with a subscription like experience, with a pay once, play forever price tag! Great MMO and I recommend it to anyone interested in MMO's, but is put off by the subsription based games.			"

												Great game.  Many reviews call it one of the most underrated games out there and I have to call that pretty accurate.  MMO in a modern environment with all kinds of fun twists.  The game has a great mix of zombies, cultists, conspiracy theory, and other crazy subjects that just fit well.  It keeps some of the favorite MMO conventions like tank, healer, dps roles---but at the same time, breaks away with a fairly complex skill system.  The game is overwhelming and pretty hard at times and always a bit strange--but very few games have captured me like TSW.  The quests are actually interesting and varied.  The cut-scenes remind me of GTA a bit in style and do a good job of drawing you in without being too long winded.			"

												I'm a sucker for mash-up urban fantasy/horror so I am so all over TSW's premise. The game's first (non-tutorial) zone, for example, features using local Native American magic and the favour of the god Thor to help the Illuminati and an expy of Stephen King fight Viking zombies dredged from the deep by Cthulhu-esque horrors, summoned by Loki using Aztec blood magic and the sword Excalibur, as part of a plot to bring about Ragnarok by stabbing a giant black cube-thing which is part of the machinery of Gaia. Things just get weirder from there.The story, cutscenes, characters, and dialogue in this game are, in my opinion, the best in any MMO currently out there, and it's one of the only MMOs I've played through multiple times solely for the story. This is definitely TSW's strength; this, and a particular type of quest the game has, called Investigation Missions, which will... well. There's an in-game browser for a reason, and I sure hope you like looking up Egyptian heiroglyphics and Hebrew plagues on Wikipedia, because you will be.They're the good parts.Unfortunately, then there's the rest of the game. TSW's mechanics are, in my opinion, as terrible as its writing is amazing. Mechnically, it's a tedious, frustrating grind that gives the illusion of choice in character building, but is ultimately so poorly balanced that I really hope you're playing the one spec that's actually useful because otherwise you're going to be spending an awful lot of time in the graveyard. (Slight disclaimer: all of this game's gameplay is built around groups. Though it's possible to solo--and I have--it is exponentially easier to complete with even just one other person along for the ride.) Not to mention that, once the story is over, the gear grind begins and, well. It's a gear grind. I hope you like raiding!There are going to be people who love TSW's mechanics, and more power to them (they're the sorts of people who like to use words such as ""oldschool"" and ""hardcore"" to describe their MMO playing). I'm not one of them. So take the last paragraph with a grain of salt.Mechanics aside, I have a lifetime sub to TSW and I don't regret it... but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone, either.			"

You can rank up easiliy by replaying earlier missions, which only get easier when you rank up. And with these new points you can start on new weapons and builds if you would like to explore. In the end you will have every weapon in the game and be free to switch at any time.			"

												I no longer enjoy MMOs these days. If you're looking for a good World of Warcraft fix, The Secret World won't help you at all. In the traditional MMO sense it's not that good. There's no feeling of progress in gaining xp and gearing up isn't satisfying so as a Diablo-style loot fishing lottery it's bad. The combat is a lackluster combination of Age of Conan and Guild Wars that feels hollow and has to be included in the game just because MMOs apparently can't exist without constant combat. The skill trees seem bland and honestly I don't see much difference between the fighting styles because they all have generic skills that do some damage. How do you even fire a shotgun in 50 different ways?HOWEVER, all of that can be endured or mostly ignored (combat hasn't been difficult either so far) to enjoy what this game does best, it isn't actually a WoW-style MMO but instead it should be treated as an online adventure game. The very detailed setting areas seem lovingly crafted, the lore is interesting and subtle and the NPCs are actually pretty well written and voice-acted. The world is a hodgepodge of secret societies and X-Files paranormal and Lovecraftian influences combined with just about everything else that fits under horror. If you liked how some of the areas in Age of Conan felt and looked, I think it's based on the same engine. It seems fairly taxing though so weaker rigs might have problems.Here comes the real reason why you should give this game a try: The quests. Sure, there are traditional MMO style quests that have you fedexing items somewhere or following simple map pointers to kill 5 of thing X and return, with cutscenes. These are enjoyable because the well-made maps make it seem like exploring instead of grinding. THEN you run into some of the investigation quests which might be the best content I've witnessed in MMOs. These are quests that don't have any easy pointers at all, only vague and cryptic clues. They're like Alternate Reality Game things where you must use google and wikipedia to decipher all the puzzles, they can't be solved just within the game (well, the game actually has a built-in web browser). Don't be tempted to go straight for the spoilery walkthroughs but try to solve things yourself! I don't think I've felt so clever in ages when I managed to crack a devious puzzle involving medieval lute music and googled actual score sheets.So, have you ever made that mistake in an MMO where you realize that a particular puzzle has to do with entries in the bible, so you look it up and fail to see how it all fits, only later on realizing you should've checked wikipedia based on another clue so you'd realize you had to look up the passage in the original latin translation? Other MMOs have done the Indiana Jones action side but this game does the library research/puzzle cracking side.I've played this thing solo just because I think it works nicely as an atmospheric single player roleplaying/adventure game where you sometimes bump into other players, I have no idea what the group instances are like. If they're like the usual raid combat stuff I'll happily ignore them because I'll focus on the content that makes me feel like a X-Files librarian instead of the usual warrior puppet flailing around to the beat of bosses.Oh, and because it doesn't require a subscription I don't need to handle it like a job that has a clock ticking ""play me now or you don't get your money's worth!"" Grab it on sale and you're set. Perhaps you'll even enjoy the combat side, but I don't think that's necessary to enjoy this game anyway.			"

												Imagin if patrick stewart played han solo in star wars... well this game is nothing like that! Despite this, TSW is a really smart game, I had to learn latin, morse code, cryptic roman cyphers, musical notes and scales, binary code, advanced mathmatics, oh, and i ended up buying a book the game recommended!! Which helped me solve a puzzle! ""I ♥♥♥♥IN LOVE PUZZLES MAN!!"" After playing 200+ hours when describing this game I often refer to that movie inception. Have you seen that movie inception? Well, if you have; imagin that movie if decaprio had won an oscar! YEAH! INTESE RIGHT?! Now add Dr.Who and all his adventures with a dash of tactical situations imploring solid snake-like stealth and you got this game! Oh yeah, indiana jones is in this, there's also the lost arc, dracula, Rosamund Pike, and theres even a belmont achievment!

												I have never played such a facinating, intense, clever single/multiplayer MMO ever and I have played a few! This game allows you to take many paths such as a main line quest to find the achient truths behind the whole back story of the game.  With three different factions and their own point of views on all the quests you will want to replay it at least 3 times! If history and future dont take your fancy enjoy many of the millions of side quests, each mission unique and significant. Level you character up to be who you want to be! You want to throw blood at an enemy fine! You want to be a swordsman go ahead, what's that you want to bludgeon people with a hammer sure! The game has so many possibilities from missions, to boss/dungeon fights or simply collecting history and enemy bites called Lores. Play on you own, with a friend or a group!

												TL;DR: Used to be great, now it's dead. I want to play, I want to love it, but can't.I used to play this game a lot. Sometimes I'd take a break of a couple of months, only to come back when the urge to dive in gets too great. I've got 9 characters all kitted out for end-game. But now, there is nothing to get back to. There is still only the old end-game content to repeat, which is just too easy now with the current end-game gear. The only hard part of the end-game is to find a group to play it with. There are hardly any players around to group up with. Community initiatives like Noobmares or Sanctuary also no longer function as a good place to find a group. There simply aren't the players for it. It's still a great game for it's solo content. DLC Issue 8 (?) has the scenario's, which is solo end-game route to take. Instanced 30 minute sessions of hard content, which require you to tweak your weapon setup to reliably complete it succesfully. However, with 3 scenarios at 3 different difficulty levels, it gets old.And that's the thing with this game. It gets old. There is no new content. The last big release of content was Tokyo, where Season 1 of the main story line has been concluded. It was delayed over and over again. It was supposed to include a new playing field to do missions in, dungeons, raids and a lair. However, by the time funcom started releasing it, it was cut up into pieces. The playfield came in 2 seperate DLC issues, with extra missions as purchasable content (now repackaged as DLC issue). The dungeons came in another seperate DLC, the raid in yet another seperate DLC. All to be purchased. Still waiting for the lair. And the promised auxillary weapon. Ok, rant over. Back to reviewing:Pro/con:+ Great atmosphere.+ No fixed classes.+ Enough to do solo.- No new content to speak of since ... forever?- Endgame group content practically dead.- No reason to fine-tune your build anymore, as you can breeze through 99% of the game with ease.

												I tried several times to get into the game, from its publication in 2012 until 2015. The ideas Funcom had were superb, The game's tone is as sinister and mysterious as intended. I can only recommend it for its vibe, and I suggest to everyone who is interested watching the first two hours of the game on Youtube.Where the game falls flat (for me) is the approach to player friendliness, or User Experience, as it is called in the software industry outside of gaming. User Experience is horrendous. Google for ""secret world frustrating"" and you will see what I mean. Many of the quests have you running or clicking around aimlessly, as you cannot find what you are supposed to do, or where you are supposed to do it. TSW's idea of mission design is like giving lego pieces to somone who has never seen any, and tell them ""Play!"".They follow the same route with the brilliant idea how a character's skills are built, then leaving the player completely in the dark how to do it efficiently, so that you can actually play the game. The forums do not help either, as the majority of good advice is from players who left in 2012 and 2013. With the game's changes since then, their advice no longer works, and trying to understand what experienced players talk about is like reading a foreign language without a dictionary.Some players claim that the game is the Thinking Man's MMO. They are entitled to their opinion. I view it as the Unfinished MMO that would have needed another two years of design and development, and with that it could have been a great title.I am utterly disappointed, as the game could have been so much more.

												This game is really good, it has pretty much everything in it, the pics on the review when buying don't give it justice. As for the game play itself, once you get used to the controlling of the character and immerse yourself into the game, time ticks by really quickly. the story is huge, and then having mian missions and side missions to help gain AP for lvling, there are hours of play just in the first area, without moving to the next. Well worth the money, i give it the thumbs upCheers			"

												Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is one of my favorite stories/story presentation ever in a game, so I am quite biased towards anything by this developer, that being said, there are several things that The Secret World does that I like that set it apart from other MMO's.  First, I really like the buy it once, no monthly fee model.  While the game didn't start out that way, it was that way by the time I got into it.  Second, the freedom in character development as far as what skills to get, and the unique (at least in my experience) way the weapons and skills work is very nice. I also like that in the main quests, all of the quest opening and closing cutscenes are actually voiced and acted out, while all the lore and everything you can collect can still give you a bit more backstory if you feel like spending some time with walls of texts.  Like any other online multiplayer game, this game does benefit quite a bit if you have some friends to join in on the adventure with you.			"

												When it comes to playing games in the MMO genre I've been around and I've been around as far back as when Ultimate Online kicked off. I've played many between then and now and must say that The Secret World provides an amazing experience and does a solid job mixing up the MMO formula. It really can play like a normal single player game if you want, outside of doing dungeons a few group quests and some end game material you aren't forced to group with others.With that said you will always run into people running around that if they see you struggling will generally give you a hand. Chat is mostly friendly with people offering to help or looking for groups. The class system is open ended. You build your character as you want. You aren't restricted and being forced to reroll, you just swap out your abilities and can change your playstyle or role in a group just like that. Obviously some builds are more optimized than others but part of the fun can be trying something different or new out. The great thing is you can unlock everything on one character. Sure it will take a long time but it is feasible. You start the game by selecting one weapon and as soon as you gain your first SP, you can unlock a second if you will. Having said that, you can only ever have 2 weapons equipped at any time but between combat you can swap them. This means you can use only active abilities for the weapons you currently have equipped.Combat plays out with a universal 1 second global cooldown with more specialized and powerful abilities having extended timers or requirements such as building up charges for effectiveness. You also have a dodge move that can pull you out of the fire, sometimes literally, fairly frequently.Now I want to tell you that it does a wonderful job with the horror themes and mythology. The voice acting...works but the dialogue is generally well written and each quest giver has their own personality and self contained reasons or stories for being involved. Mission variety is fairly standard ranging from gather ""x"" to kill ""y"" but where the missions really shine are the dungeon/group activities and the investigation missions. Both require you to actually think while some require you to just check for the solution online as it presupposes an understanding of say a long dead language. They make whatever you have played before from Point and Click Adventure games to Silent Hill/ Resident Evil/ Horror genre tropes look like grade school.The game does have an item shop that contains mostly comestic items and ""issues"" or DLC. TSW handles issues like DC Universe handles DLC. Now with TSW they also have the first 4 issues I believe for free to all players. So you'll just have to pick up the later ones and yes, they still are supporting the game with new issues and content on a frequent basis.The visuals are ok, a bit dated for the time and some of the abilities have recycled animations as I stated earlier some of the voice acting is bad (normally in a good way though) but on the other side the aesthetics/atmosphere/environments, ability control/combo system, interesting story/monsters, solo/group play, puzzles/mission variety and taking place in a modern setting far exceed the negative things I have to say about the game.So do I recommend this game? Yes. I highly recommend it. Snag it on a sale and give it a shot. It's pay once and play which is no different than the next Bioshock DLC, Madden or Total War game except when it's on sale it is about the price, or actually lower than, the price of the Bioshock DLC but has far more potential to suck you down to the dark and wet city of R'lyeh and keep you there either until you go insane or you find the secret to The Secret World *cue X-Files music*.J'ai fini			"

												Okay, here's the thing... This isn't an easy game to get your head around from the start. There's very little hand-holding to teach you how to play.

												A myriad of myths and legends.  This former pay to play MMORPG is now a pay-once play forever. Setting in an array of apocalyptic, corrupted version of our everyday society.  You are chosen by the secret powers that be.  From The Modern Masons of the illuminati.  To the extreme, lightsworn of templars,  or the chaotic, enigma that is The Dragon.You affiliate yourself with one, that you best beleive has the answers  ( or prizes )  you seek.  The game itself demands a very high-end computer. The game itself isn't very forgiving on traditional grind to level players.   One must immerse themselves on the dark storylines and the cinematics therein. Enemies consist from the Darkest corners of the mind of Lovecraft.  To the word of legends and myth of the forgotten past.If you're sick of killing little bunny heads made out of jelly, (not saying its GrandFantasia* )  and desire a more climatic and adult based rpg.   This game will offer this and a unique method of battling.And remember.    "" Dark Days Are Coming "" * ( Totally was talking about Grand Fantasia )			"

												I gave this game a thumbs up, but do realise it is an aquired taste. The strong point of this game is the story and the atmosphere. Compared to other MMO's it beats them by a mile (storywise). However compared to strictly story driven (stand alone) games, it is not all that good. I often wondered if this game would have been better as a stand alone. There are a lot of cutscenes, which are usually nicely done. The quality of the main storyline did suprise me as it flutters around and some side missions are actually better than the main storyline.The combat is rather rather dull and hp of many mobs increases faster than your dps. Combined with the story driven missions it makes the game feel rather slow. This does not have to be a bad thing mind you, but when indoctrinated by WoW or the like you will really have to get used to this game. The game can be quite unforgiving at times, which at certain points is a nice challenge, and at other times quite silly (making you want to read the mission guides in advance). Bringing a friend does help quite a lot (but be aware some parts of missions have to be done solo in mini instances).PVP is aweful at the moment. Players are ""balanced"" but not quite to the level of other QL10.5 types. Most areas are static most of the time, being at the mercy of the faction with the most players. On the flip side, it allowed me to read a good book while picking up points for epics, jumping in (and dying painfully) when we got attacked. All in all I enjoyed the atmosphere in the game and running around trying to find out what happened. I picked the game up on steam with a discount and I think it was worth the money. Though, as you noticed, I think it could have been a lot better. I have not played endgame content (raids), nor do I think I will. The replayablility does not seem that high to me, once you have seen a story, you will want to go to the next (even though they are repeatable).Ps. the game seems to be optimized very badly, at least for 32bit systems. I actually had to tweak my memory to make it run (I wish I could say smoothly). I ran it without steam, hence the low hour count.			"

												I absolutely love this game. It is a lore-driven MMO which seeks to immerse the player in tiered quest lines across multiple locales. Fantastic design.The leveling system is thrown out the window in favour of a much more involved (and often revised) system of skill and ability points which are earned as the player hits experience threshholds. Basic stat grinding does not exist. The auction house, as with any MMO, can cripple the feeling of progressive improvement so I would avoid it. Atmospherically the game excells, although I will note the graphics are nothing to write home about. There is occasional framerate slow-downs and sometimes the camera angles can be difficult to set. Otherwise, the game plays smoothly. I'd give this game a 8/10. A must buy if you have a group of friends who seem even remotely interested.			"

												As MMO's go this is by far the most unique and enjoyable,the storyline is fantastic, and great fun.The no levels thing works really well, it takes a lot of the grinding out of playing.  You're chasing points and tokens that you can actually use, not forever killing different groups of ten boars ad nausuem.the pvp system was designed by a genius and is incredibly fun to play, with a mechanic that gives it a high turnover and  constantly changing battlegrounds but it is far from perfect.Firstly it's an MMO, so it has the clunky and unpleasant control configuration that plagues all mmo'ssecondly, I prefer to think of it as an M-M-O.  because you don't always nessescarily have all three working together at the same time.  Sometimes it's massively online, and other times it's just Massively Multiplayer because you've been disconnected again.Solo instances are a thing...and there are quite a few of them, so you get seperated from any group you might be in because everyone has to grind these solo quests alone.there are no armours, so you can get your character looking more how you like rather than like (s)he just walked out of a garbage heap like you do in WOW.you'll roll your eyes at these faults when they crop up...but you probably won't stop enjoying the game for them, it more than makes up for it's shortfalls.

												I give this game 10 stars out of 10, it is EXCELLENT. I play WoW and GW2 and sometimes get bored with them, so SW is a great alternative. There is so much to do in SW: questing, crafting, PvP, PvE, dungeons, and puzzles to solve. I especially like the built in web browser so I can do research without opening up Firefox. The built in help is the best I have ever seen in a game. I already know that I will be addicted to the game, and play it for many years to come. The DLC is a bit expensive, but so long as I buy them only a few at a time, they are affordable. I really like the travel system also, very different than other games. One of my students recommended SW to me and I'm very glad that he did. In fact, I'm about to message a few friends of mine to invite them to join the game. I'm glad that the company dropped the monthly subscription, I wish Blizzard would do the same. Having free play, with an online store, and DLC is a great way for the company to make their money. Most people will NOT subscribe, especially because their are so many F2P games out there. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ALL IT IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT!!!			"

Mysteries, X-Files, Cthulhu and oh... Well! First, when you are interested in this game and you are a veteran in MMOs, try to forget those experiences. This game is different in so many ways. Still the game leaves a lot open, and you can actually wish for more, it does so many things right that I have to wonder why this game isn't more widespread - especially since you have a Buy2Play game, with an Item-Shop and Subscription options (The subscription refunds you some worth for the item shop at a really good value).The genre is a mix of many different Pen & Paper RPG's and relies on Missions (Quests) - it features one of the best Quest-Systems to be seen on an Computer game. First, each Main Quest is told by a little in game animation, telling the story behind your quest - you have to listen carefully and attentively - especially on research missions. You could call the Game a mixture of Call of Cthulhu meets Torg meets Nephilim meets Villains & Vigilantes... among some things, also some Arcane Earth is mixed in (A Freeware RPG from the early 1990s).The developers did a great job with the storytelling, and I have to say - the game is quite versatile on a technical level too, at the moment I am using a low end PC with on Board Graphics - the description says, the game won't run on this machine... but wondrously it does - of course some finetuning required. But it runs like a charm... still I can't wait for the spare parts of my main computer falling into place, just to see more of the marvelous dark and sinister graphics of the game.The game has some bad attitudes though, there are some jumping riddles that are hard to solve, because jumping works like a mess in this game. Some ""Boss"" Fights on the Main and Story-Quests are frustrating, and sometimes even botched up (not all, some are on purpose a challenge - mind that) and of course, the game still is not really finished. I think the secret world is a game, where the money spend is a really good investment - it offers a lot, without being made for fanboys. Parts of the game show, that it was made for Mature and Adult players - this should stick in the back of your mind.Pros:Good Questing System, that is showing the advancement within each quest. Levelless RPG, you are building your character around skills and equipment. Even further enhancements are possible, later in the game.Deep Stories, sometimes with some eastereggs and blinking towards media and P & P RPGs. Challenging without overburdening the player... if you aren't strong enough to solve a quest - you might come back later - after some more skills.Cons:Some quests and boss fights seem to be bugged, but the game is constantly cared for and even in the month I did play the game there were some changes.  While the game runs stable, it's sometimes the Servers that are overacting - I had some troubles during the past month, but that might just be temporary.Highly Recommended!This game has everything a good MMORPG should have, plus more. The Devs actually put a lot of thought into their gameworld, and the sinister mood of the game isn't just transposed by fog, rain, thunderstorms and bad weather - but more by the storytelling and the immersive gameplay.There are some celebs in the game, as voiceactors of course. It's a shame that this game hasn't drawn a massive amount of players onto the dark realm of a Secret World... At last, it's far more entertaining than a lot of stuff outside, because of the steep learning curve and the challenging content.I hope the developers still have some surprises for us in reserve!

												An amazing MMO worth atleast checking out. Been playing since, but decided to recently re-buy it on steam just because it was on sale and wanted it in my steam library. Apart from the combat, that needs improvement, this game is an amazing work of art that obviously had a lot of time and effort into it. I promise, you will not regret picking up a copy of this game.8/10			"

												The Secret World is an interesting deviation from the usual MMOs. The skill and ability system allows more customization to your character's battle strengths than most games in the genre. It also involves a bit more thinking, given the number of puzzles included which need solving prior to advancing in your quest line. On the other hand I also find it a bit more repetitive than other mainstream MMO options, and find myself less invested than usual. Perhaps this is a result of not requiring social interactions, since the rare group quests are optional through most of the game.The final thing worth noting is the Item Shop - always a point of contention with MMO gamers.

												A very unique MMO which actually maintains a stroy naritive and high quality of story telling. The game really works the horror gerne and keeps you engaed with a fairly good mix of quest types. Some quests are crazy complex but with an inbuilt brouser(or just use your own brouser and google) but they feel really rewarding if you do them yourself.All in all a great game, end game maybe a little weak but in time it may evolve, content is released in fairly regular bitesized chunks which you can buy at your own pace rather than subscribing(although you can sub/lifetime sub if you wish) Tokyo has just released givingthe first whole new area since lauch so I hope to see more people noticing this little gem of a game and giving it a little time in the near future.

												The Secret World is a great MMORPG. Players choose one of 3 secret societies to join - The Templars, The Illuminati, or The Dragons. Each of these organizations has their own base of operations and a rich history (Though the Dragons are fictitious). The game gives you access to 9 weapon trees, and unlimited Ability and Skill Points to spend.  As long as you continue to complete quests, you will receive both AP and SP, and there is no cap as the goal is to eventually unlock every ability and explore every weapon tree. This game is a great experience, and I would highly recommend it. The fact that there are no subscriptions makes this a great MMORPG to pick up and play!			"

												Whe it comes to this game, I fell in love with it from the start, with the amazing story. I loved how different this game was. While this still will be true with the TSL relaunch, I am hesitant at best with some of the things I am hearing about what is changing. I will be playing it , but I have VERY high expectations, which I hope will be met.For now I will keep my review positive for the sake of optimism. However I sincerely hope the game will not be dumbed down, like so many others have. it was another reason I fell for this game, because of it's difficulty. While I see making a better tutorial system for new players, this does not mean you have to dumb down the game.			"

												Here's the thing about The Secret World: it's a game about risk taking, character building and overcoming circumstances bigger than yourself. If you're looking for an average MMO romp that holds your hand to the point of nearly crushing it, then TSW is the wrong game for you. However, if you're patient, enjoy challenge, thrive on deep skill/character customization and enjoy stellar plotting/writing, then there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be playing this game right now. Funcom's diamond-in-the-rough makes up for its lack of polish with an incredibly intuitive, level-less skill system that blends TCG-like deck building with the simplicity of Guild Wars 2's weapon-based combat system. Armor is invisible and only provides your character with stats, leaving you with cosmetic outfit pieces to dress your character in. All quests, except for the main scenario quests, are repeatable and provide you with in backstory on characters and locations, as well as providing you with clues that enrich your main scenario experience. The cash shop provides no pay-to-win items--with the ""AP Injection"" boosts being arguable at best--and instead gives you more options to customize your character with (that are also affordable). You can be a part of the Illuminati (just saying).I could go on and on about this game, but I'll check in here for now. I promise you won't regret investing your time and money into The Secret World.

												This game is great. It is great because it is challenging due to the fact that the quests sometimes involve puzzles or stealth missions, and there are many opportunities to go off the beaten path. This game plays more like a real story from dnd than just some hawked up and spit out mmo by one of the other companies. You should play this game if you like full immersion story lines that allow you to take your own path, and let you choose which quest to do instead of a normal zombie quest one after the other. Also if you like skill trees instead of just boring levels, this is the game for you.			"

This game allows you to take many paths such as a main line quest to find the achient truths behind the whole back story of the game.  With three different factions and their own point of views on all the quests you will want to replay it at least 3 times! If history and future dont take your fancy enjoy many of the millions of side quests, each mission unique and significant. Level you character up to be who you want to be! You want to throw blood at an enemy fine! You want to be a swordsman go ahead, what's that you want to bludgeon people with a hammer sure! The game has so many possibilities from missions, to boss/dungeon fights or simply collecting history and enemy bites called Lores. Play on you own, with a friend or a group!

												A very unique MMO which actually maintains a stroy naritive and high quality of story telling. The game really works the horror gerne and keeps you engaed with a fairly good mix of quest types. Some quests are crazy complex but with an inbuilt brouser(or just use your own brouser and google) but they feel really rewarding if you do them yourself.All in all a great game, end game maybe a little weak but in time it may evolve, content is released in fairly regular bitesized chunks which you can buy at your own pace rather than subscribing(although you can sub/lifetime sub if you wish) Tokyo has just released givingthe first whole new area since lauch so I hope to see more people noticing this little gem of a game and giving it a little time in the near future.

Mysteries, X-Files, Cthulhu and oh... Well! First, when you are interested in this game and you are a veteran in MMOs, try to forget those experiences. This game is different in so many ways. Still the game leaves a lot open, and you can actually wish for more, it does so many things right that I have to wonder why this game isn't more widespread - especially since you have a Buy2Play game, with an Item-Shop and Subscription options (The subscription refunds you some worth for the item shop at a really good value).The genre is a mix of many different Pen & Paper RPG's and relies on Missions (Quests) - it features one of the best Quest-Systems to be seen on an Computer game. First, each Main Quest is told by a little in game animation, telling the story behind your quest - you have to listen carefully and attentively - especially on research missions. You could call the Game a mixture of Call of Cthulhu meets Torg meets Nephilim meets Villains & Vigilantes... among some things, also some Arcane Earth is mixed in (A Freeware RPG from the early 1990s).The developers did a great job with the storytelling, and I have to say - the game is quite versatile on a technical level too, at the moment I am using a low end PC with on Board Graphics - the description says, the game won't run on this machine... but wondrously it does - of course some finetuning required. But it runs like a charm... still I can't wait for the spare parts of my main computer falling into place, just to see more of the marvelous dark and sinister graphics of the game.The game has some bad attitudes though, there are some jumping riddles that are hard to solve, because jumping works like a mess in this game. Some ""Boss"" Fights on the Main and Story-Quests are frustrating, and sometimes even botched up (not all, some are on purpose a challenge - mind that) and of course, the game still is not really finished. I think the secret world is a game, where the money spend is a really good investment - it offers a lot, without being made for fanboys. Parts of the game show, that it was made for Mature and Adult players - this should stick in the back of your mind.Pros:Good Questing System, that is showing the advancement within each quest. Levelless RPG, you are building your character around skills and equipment. Even further enhancements are possible, later in the game.Deep Stories, sometimes with some eastereggs and blinking towards media and P & P RPGs. Challenging without overburdening the player... if you aren't strong enough to solve a quest - you might come back later - after some more skills.Cons:Some quests and boss fights seem to be bugged, but the game is constantly cared for and even in the month I did play the game there were some changes.  While the game runs stable, it's sometimes the Servers that are overacting - I had some troubles during the past month, but that might just be temporary.Highly Recommended!This game has everything a good MMORPG should have, plus more. The Devs actually put a lot of thought into their gameworld, and the sinister mood of the game isn't just transposed by fog, rain, thunderstorms and bad weather - but more by the storytelling and the immersive gameplay.There are some celebs in the game, as voiceactors of course. It's a shame that this game hasn't drawn a massive amount of players onto the dark realm of a Secret World... At last, it's far more entertaining than a lot of stuff outside, because of the steep learning curve and the challenging content.I hope the developers still have some surprises for us in reserve!

												The Secret World is an interesting deviation from the usual MMOs. The skill and ability system allows more customization to your character's battle strengths than most games in the genre. It also involves a bit more thinking, given the number of puzzles included which need solving prior to advancing in your quest line. On the other hand I also find it a bit more repetitive than other mainstream MMO options, and find myself less invested than usual. Perhaps this is a result of not requiring social interactions, since the rare group quests are optional through most of the game.The final thing worth noting is the Item Shop - always a point of contention with MMO gamers. Many of the items available are purely cosmetic, several others can be obtained without payment. The implementation of the item shop does not break this game, in my opinion.

												Enjoying it so far. Suprisingly good story with plenty of voice acting and cutscenes are present at the beginning and end of almost every quest other then the side quest. The other interesting thing about this MMO is the investigation missions which require you to do research and solve puzzles with little to no help from the game. These missions are pretty difficult to give you an idea in my 10 or so hours of play I have had to decode morse code(or at least attempt to :P), solve ingame riddles by studying ingame lore, and figure out passwords by using the ingame browser to solve the hints. The maps are also pretty well done and while not as massive as many other MMOs the maps are still quite large and space is well used. FInally the one thing that really suprised me and which will probably keep me in game is the dungeons. I have only done 1 so far but it was great basically no junk mobs just bosses and mini-bosses, and i must say the bosses are amazingly well done.			"

												Really hard for someone like me who doesn't play a lot of MMO's. Has interesting and unique story arcs that form the overall plot, with classless and level-less skills and abilities. Picking a faction only seems to change the faction specific quests and your overall appearance when it comes to costumes.Ties in a lot of real world conspiracies, myths and urban legends so it's not your regular fantasy genre settings and I commend Funcom for that.From early on, it's best to focus on only two weapon types as any more than that will drastically increase the difficulty of the game and the time taken to level up.Graphics are pretty nice, especially the attack effects, lighting/smoke and character models. Cutscenes are mediocre, with lots of out of sync lips when characters are talking but it's tolerable. The network ping is pretty bad from time to time (from Australia) and the minimum latency is around 280ms so feels sluggish even though I'm running at 60fps.Full of helpful players and cabals (clans) that can make it a lot easier for newer players.Lots of customisation and options to tinker with and it's easy enough to add friends or meet up with someone on the same server as you.

												A myriad of myths and legends.  This former pay to play MMORPG is now a pay-once play forever. Setting in an array of apocalyptic, corrupted version of our everyday society.  You are chosen by the secret powers that be.  From The Modern Masons of the illuminati.  To the extreme, lightsworn of templars,  or the chaotic, enigma that is The Dragon.You affiliate yourself with one, that you best beleive has the answers  ( or prizes )  you seek.  The game itself demands a very high-end computer. The game itself isn't very forgiving on traditional grind to level players.   One must immerse themselves on the dark storylines and the cinematics therein. Enemies consist from the Darkest corners of the mind of Lovecraft.  To the word of legends and myth of the forgotten past.If you're sick of killing little bunny heads made out of jelly, (not saying its GrandFantasia* )  and desire a more climatic and adult based rpg.   This game will offer this and a unique method of battling.And remember.    "" Dark Days Are Coming "" * ( Totally was talking about Grand Fantasia )			"

I will be playing it , but I have VERY high expectations, which I hope will be met.For now I will keep my review positive for the sake of optimism. However I sincerely hope the game will not be dumbed down, like so many others have. it was another reason I fell for this game, because of it's difficulty.

												Here's the thing about The Secret World: it's a game about risk taking, character building and overcoming circumstances bigger than yourself. If you're looking for an average MMO romp that holds your hand to the point of nearly crushing it, then TSW is the wrong game for you. However, if you're patient, enjoy challenge, thrive on deep skill/character customization and enjoy stellar plotting/writing, then there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be playing this game right now. Funcom's diamond-in-the-rough makes up for its lack of polish with an incredibly intuitive, level-less skill system that blends TCG-like deck building with the simplicity of Guild Wars 2's weapon-based combat system. Armor is invisible and only provides your character with stats, leaving you with cosmetic outfit pieces to dress your character in. All quests, except for the main scenario quests, are repeatable and provide you with in backstory on characters and locations, as well as providing you with clues that enrich your main scenario experience. The cash shop provides no pay-to-win items--with the ""AP Injection"" boosts being arguable at best--and instead gives you more options to customize your character with (that are also affordable). You can be a part of the Illuminati (just saying).I could go on and on about this game, but I'll check in here for now. I promise you won't regret investing your time and money into The Secret World.

												PROPlenty of intrigue, mystery, and spooky appeal. These qualities make this game unique amongst my steam library, i will likely never uninstall this. ;)CONControls are hardcoded, need AHK (third party program) to rectify this so you can bind abilities to mouse clicks and customise the targetting modes. There is an AHK file floating around out there called advanced reticle mode or something like that which does this.BUILDS AND GEAR (early on)For the beginning trash mobs you'll want some AOE attacks and self-heals for solo survival. I suggest getting the sword early on, there is a very early ability available which functions as a self heal if you slot the corresponding passive for it, and there are plenty of aoe sword attacks available. Fist weapons have alot of HoT abilities, which can be quite good to use just before heading into a fight, so I would suggest getting that as your secondary weapon when starting out a new character.BUILDS AND GEAR (endgame pve/pvp)It can be quite difficult to play any build you want if you do not have gear with stats that compliment them! Endgame gear can be hard to get for either pve or pvp purposes, however pvp is a bit more forgiving in that you get a stat buff depending on what pvp role you choose, and then the stats on whatever gear you're wearing will replace the least-prioritised stats from the stat buff (also known as equal-footing buff). This makes it a little easier to make viable, specialised builds for pvp without having to attain endgame gear.			"

												The Secret World is an underrated gem in terms of popularity, with an unique psedu-real world setting and mythos. Funcom once again proves that with just alittle discipline and polish it could make a name for itself in the games market, but falling short. I adore the mission styles, moving away from typical pig intestine fetch quests.Graphics:7/10Gameplay:8/10Music:8/10b] "

												The Secret World is a really fun MMO that suffers from some population issues. Unlike some MMOs, though, that shouldn't hinder your enjoyment of the base game. The questing is fun and the combat is very interesting. I certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys story content in an MMO, or just questing in general. The quests are engaging and the story is intriguing.There's enough content to get you your money's worth, and if you've got friends, even more so. 78 Illuminati conspiracy theories out of 100.			"

												I never thought that I would be into MMO games. In the one's I've played the quests tend to all feel the same after a while. This game has great content, the quests don't feel grindy, there are a lot of themes and variations in the story, great characters and the fact that you aren't leveling up in a traditional way means there's room for making errors and it let's you experiment with different builds and playstyles without having to make a new character.

												After trying dozens of MMORPG's, TSW was the first game that let me care enough to try the dungeons, to go on the raids, and take part in special events.  The setting and lore is fantastic, the story is enthralling, the locations are varied and the NPCs are remarkably well realized.  With no classes, there's no frustrated restarts and tedious level grinding. TSW is the game I play when I don't have the money for hyped new games and need to forget the marketing.  It's solid all the way through.			"

												What a mind blowing awesome game! Cant believe i had never come across this game before. Ive never spent 20 hours in a game so quickly before, and to be honest im not even 10% into the game yet. I can easily see this game being over 500 hours especially with the expansions that i got included with the ultimate edition!After 20 hours, im no way near bored, still discovering and learning new things every day and the missions are so much fun! None of the quests feel boring or repetative, they actually feel like real quests that you are doing. Plus for the main quests i love seeing the FMV sequences play out, they can be quite fun!!If you havent seen this game before, i urge you to not think about it, just buy it! The only problem is that when you get into this game theres no getting out, and you wont be able to play anything else for weeks to come (probably much longer!)!!! "

												Hello I walk into emptyI can't recommend this game enough. Funcom's central product, it seems, is individualistic and memorable experiences, and The Secret World is exactly that. The base game is good quality, with haunting and horrifying settings and strange and memorable characters. The quest structure mixes episodic hubs that introduce you to fleshed out and interesting characters, and an overarching narrative that has you unravelling the designs of some unknown force.The game also offers something unique to MMOs: the investigation mission. These are augmented reality puzzles, drawing you into some truly challenging and lateral riddles, while using alternate reality to beautifully blur the lines between our world and the secret world.But it gets better.The DLC take off and make everything good about the base experience more spectacular. Issue #5, The Vanishing Of Tyler Freeborn, is the first great example of this, with a climax taking place inside a psychedelic nightmare brought on by a cosmic horror called ""The Filth"", a major antagonistic force running through the game. This sets the stage for what is to come in the remaining DLC, with the lines blurring ever more.			"

												I know you might have already heard/read all of this before, but I'll say it anyway. The Secret World is both a wonderful game and a wondeful MMO.Its game mechanics are good : dynamic fight, complete lack of classes allowing you to build your character according to your play style, very different types of missions...The writing is absolutely marvelous. Every single mission has a story behind it, and shows it to you. Every. Single. One. No ""fetch me twenty wolf pelts"" or ""bring me ten goblin heads"". Here, you even have missions that ask you to think and do proper research to solve the riddles.And there is so much I could say about the setting or the story but that I won't because I'd be serious spoilers and they are both worth discovering on your own.

												For fans of mmos and lovecraftian stories, I gotta say this game has left a pretty strong impression as I'm hooked in the world. The stories of the characters from the towns and locations you visit just suck you into the whole experience. I'm the type of person who can't stand playing mmos alone for too long, but Secret World just does it in a way where I feel completely driven to keep going solo and enjoy the bits of lore that the developers has left for us to discover. Absolutely one of my favorite games and I highly recommend for anyone to try out if they love dark stories and conspiracies/occult in their games.			"

												tl;dr: Great ♥♥♥♥ing game with innovative mechanics and ideas, reminicent of the World of Darkness and the Dresden Files. Go try it!Some thoughts; The Secret World (TSW) is one of the most exciting MMO’s that I’ve had the pleasure of trying, with a deep and intriguing setting that encourages exploration both of the world and the narrative. The setting is heavily influenced by the works of writers such as H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, where you awake to a secret world, filled with monsters, spirits and ancient horrors from beyond this world, where all the legends and fairytales have a kernel of truth in them. The game looks stunning design-wise, and every area of the game draws heavily upon both pop cultural and historical representations of such settings as dreary New England or Ancient Egypt. You’ll spend a lot of time enjoying all the references that pop up and the new takes on myths and legends, all tied nicely together with the game’s central lore. TSW boasts some of the most intriguing quest systems I’ve seen so far in a MMO, especially the investigation missions, where the answer to a given problem often is not to be found in the game itself, requiring that you make use of the game’s built in web browser to investigate the clues for an answer. This can lead to some very frustrating moments as the difficulty of these investigation missions can be rather steep at times, showing that the game priorities not only combat as a challenge mechanism. TSW also makes heavy use of the graphical representation of the world itself to give you clues to further you on missions, where you can have walked past something several times, only suddenly to realize that there is an actual reason behind the design, beyond simple esthetics; they are a clue. But it also feels familiar to traditional MMORPGs.When it comes to the combat, TSW is complicated, simply put, and many a player has had a running face-first meeting with the metaphorical brick wall, as the game suddenly demands that players develop a deeper understanding of the mechanics of the game in order to bolster combat efficiency. The in-game tutorial of this is a bit lacking -especially given the huge amount of freedom the player is given concerning builds- which leads to no small amount of frustration at times, but once you have overcome this wall and started to learn how abilities work in conjunction with each other, the gameplay is rewarding and deep. Given that TSW has turned Free to Play, it is well worth giving it a go, both as a single player experience and as a deep and challenging MMO. The main critique I have of the game is the end game, where it turns into a traditional MMO and focues upon raiding and grinding, but this too is fun and challenging. Funcom regularly updates with Side Stories, quest chains and new areas that both further the main storyline and act as smaller short story-like experiences.			"

												This game is amazing. The environment and setting are far better than any other MMO I have played. The fact that a large majority of the quests in game have voice acting and cut scenes sets it apart right away. The gameplay is fun and feels more involved than other MMOs. The quests require actual thought and I have found myself using the built in web browser to look up random facts to figure out how to solve the current puzzle many times. If you try to solve every puzzle on your own without looking up the solution this game will keep you entertained and sometimes stumped for days. Even the few and far between ""gather"" quests are all unique. There are awesome dungeons 5 man+, random server events where you are tasked to work with people on the server to defeat things that appear, PvP and a great guild(cabal) system.The leveling system is great. No levels. Ok levels.. kind of.. whenever you gain enough experience you unlock ability points to put into either skills or areas where you can modify your stats. At no point are you locked into a class you can spec for another class and switch when you like with the points you gain from ""leveling"" and no cap or even really a level number(as far as I know)The story is really where this game wins though probably due to the extra effort put in for the voice acting and very regular cut scenes. The missions as I said above really make you think and keep you invested in what is going on. The amount of lore you can find either by the hidden lore items you find or just by talking to quest givers and NPCs that you find is insane. If you play.. when you play.. make sure to click the dialog text multiple times I did not know about that when I first started. The NPCs have a lot of dialog if you are into that. The lore mixed with the awesome environments makes this game by far my favorite MMO.			"

												Currently in Egypt and taking my time. There's so much to see and do in this game, from auctioning things off to questing and farming monsters for achievements. With the new museum, there's even more to do in the game. Cosmetics are just that in this game, cosmetics. There are no clothing stats and no leveling, so you can go at your own pace and enjoy it. There's no really forced grouping beyond maybe the dungeons, so you could reasonably solo the whole game if you wanted to. The dungeons have different levels too, as long as you complete the normal level first. The item store has lots of cool things, and you can get the DLC content easily if you save up on points. The quests are fun and challenging, with investigation quests being the hardest, but most rewarding kind of quest. The story carries easily over the worlds, despite some little hiccups, overall you can just take it all at your own pace and enjoy it, changing gear and weapons as you go along to find your own style.

												The setting is what originally got me to buy it. When I first heard about it, I figured it would be like Hunter: the Vigil but online, and settings-wise, it is similar.What has kept me playing are the NPCs and the ability system. I play with subtitles on and I take screenshots all the time because of the awesome, funny, or insightful things the NPCs say. Player abilities are built around selecting 2 weapons, 7 active powers and 7 passive powers. It gets more complicated as you go because synergies emerge as you earn powers that set conditions and then exploit them. There are no experience levels; content is separated mainly by the quality of your talismans (talismans because pants and shirts are divorced from in-game effect, freeing you to look how you want). Group roles tend to fall into tanking, healing, support and damage. You are free to change roles any time you aren't fighting: just use the gear manager to switch between ability and equipment sets.Every MMO seems to want to avoid the ""kill 10 rats"" type quests, but The Secret World is one of the few that succeeds. Those missions still exist, but they are clearly labeled Action and they appear along side Sabotage missions, where the player must avoid detection and Investigation missions, which actually require researching the clues on the Internet.PvP is the primary deficiency I've seen. It is kind of unpopular and my computer can't handle it. (Assault rifle particle effects can be crippling.)TL;DR - Not a straight WoW copy and great if you're into Lovecraft & World of Darkness			"

												The only MMo you need to play. a wonderful look into the world of the secret societies. The individuality of the characters is what shines through, and the voice acting is spot on. A superb game for anyone interested in a modern day MMO. Beware though this games is not optimized and polished, it does contain bugs and glitches, but Funcom are doing a great job fixing these.			"

												This game rocks so much on so many levels. It's not your average MMO. It's way more than that.The skill system is pretty nice and you can build your character as you want. 3 kind of weapons, 3 weapons in each, loads of skills to choose from, and the possibility to change these at any time. Bored with swords? Well then take a rifle and start building your character again. :pThe graphics and level/world design are pretty awesome, and I am not even running the game at best quality.The gameplay is nothing special, but it doesn't have any flaws, at least I haven't met any.But what makes this game so amazing, is the story and the quests. Yes, that is the true heart of this game. The setting is pretty simple, since basically, it's our modern world. Yet, it's so more complicated. The story is greatly told, with a lot of cinematics with good voice acting, and loads of quests that allow you to discover things you wouldn't even believe. There is especially one type of quest that I like, it's the investigation quests. Instead of giving you a goal and showing you how to go there/do it, it makes you search your way through it. Riddles and enigmas to decipher, to get through the quest and finally achieve your goal. It's really interesting.What's really interesting in this game is that it's really a MMO and a RPG. It really mixes a classical RPG with everything you have in a classical MMO: PvP, different builds, chat, dungeons, guildes, etc... It's not your boring MMO with meaningless quests, it has a real story and feels really cool.I mean, who never wished to be a Templar? These guys rock. Well, ok, the Dragon rocks too.			"

												The Secret World is a really fun MMO that suffers from some population issues. Unlike some MMOs, though, that shouldn't hinder your enjoyment of the base game. The questing is fun and the combat is very interesting. I certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys story content in an MMO, or just questing in general. The quests are engaging and the story is intriguing.There's enough content to get you your money's worth, and if you've got friends, even more so. 78 Illuminati conspiracy theories out of 100.			"

												The Secret World is one of the more unique MMORPGs out there - and it's certainly one of the best in terms of its world (every conspiracy theory of our modern world is true), story (putting even TOR's Imperial Agent to shame) and some Quests (Investigation-Quests); however - the MMO aspect of the game is more of a hindrance than anything else - at least in my opinion.+++unique setting+++a very good story (sadly shackled in an mmo)+++interesting NPCs; very good voice acting+++investigation Quests (which e.g. require you to deciper a morse-code, use a bit of latin or visit websites set up by the devs themselves (http://www.orochi-group.net/)++Wardrobe-system: You only gain stats by your weapon and talismans (which are invisible). So you can buy clothes in the store (both in-world and microtransaction) and mix-match however you see fit; you can also unlock sets by doing certain quests/challenges)++no 'real' leveling (instead you spend earned AP and SP on your weapons and your 'skill-wheel)++challenging dungeon encounters (nightmare), where each dungeon tells a story of its own++Quests are voiced+You can equip 7 Skills (1 Elite) from a maximum of 2 weapons, so it's more of a tactic choice than anything else (mix/maxing in nightmare-difficulty dungeons is a real thing, though)+a bunch of weapons, ranging from sledgehammers over assault rifles (terrible animations, sadly) to blood- and chaos magic)---the animations are mostly terrible--the endgame is somewhat stale (and over pretty quickly if you're with a group of friends)-sabotage missions and other quests-pvp is fun, although somewhat broken (Cardiac Arrest/Bloodshot // gear plays a MASSIVE role!)Overall, the game is very good if you're willing to ignore or tolerate its shortcomings and I totally recommend it. (I, for example, always return when a new Issue is released [these continue the main story])			"

												I have played many MMo's almost from the start.  I played this last year for 6 months, and stopped. Since that time, I have purchased almost all the MMO's available on Steam. The problem is, that sooner or later, they all become the same. Same mechanics, same p2w issues....or broken economies. I decided to come back here - to the ""Secret World"". It really is unique. The most adult...and an experience not found in other MMO's. Without pointing out things already discussed by others....I can simply say, that if you want a deep experience, one you can handle mostly on your own, until you are ready to seek out and join others (or not)...this game can't be beat.The mechanics behind the skill systems are varied, deep, and potentially endless in their set ups. Its like   ""X-files (the creepier episodes) meets I am legend meets the Seventh sign. What more can you ask for?This is the only game ( MMO) that I have actually spent significant time changing my outfits to suit the atmosphere of whereever the missions take me.   And trust me......I would never have thought clothing options would be so fun?  (omg)Get this. Play this.Learn what is happening in the world around you ......			"

												This game is great. It is great because it is challenging due to the fact that the quests sometimes involve puzzles or stealth missions, and there are many opportunities to go off the beaten path. This game plays more like a real story from dnd than just some hawked up and spit out mmo by one of the other companies. You should play this game if you like full immersion story lines that allow you to take your own path, and let you choose which quest to do instead of a normal zombie quest one after the other. Also if you like skill trees instead of just boring levels, this is the game for you.			"

												The secret world is an MMO focused on all things found in Lovecraft lore. The game looks nice, sounds nice, and plays very well for how ambitious it is. The game boasts a large world and replayable missions while lacking tried and true character leveling instead opting for experience based skill and ability point on a threshold system. This lends itself to a feeling that no point spent is wasted. I highly recommend the game to anyone looking for a solid MMO with a moderate difficulty who isn't a fan of a monthly sub fee. Worth the money.			"

												One of the few games I can recommend for the story and possibly the only MMO I can recommend be played just for the story itself. The writting is brilliant enough to put many novelists and script writers to shame, albeit that might not be saying as much as I hoped with what passes for novelists and script writers. It is quite qoutable and if it was a tome would be quite respected as a great work of the early twenty-first century. However, I, again, admit that may not be saying as much as I hoped with what has been considered great works in previous centuries.			"

												While at first I was leery of starting on another MMO after a long stint without more than scattered gameplay on EVE and The Old Republic, I found myself interested in the concept behind this game. After the initial ""WTF"" phase that most gamers go through with a new style, I discovered that not only did I enjoy the game, I'd found one that had topped any MMO before it in my opinion. While it seems TSW starts off slow, it picks up the pace almost instantly after the starter missions. Grinding away in the same area constantly seemed unappealing until I saw the way the game encouraged not only teamwork, but communication between party members (a feature I hadn't seen since the early days of Everquest).Following the introduction to the gameplay alone, I found that the storyline was not only well-constructed, but engaging for the players. Every time I finished a mission, the one following it left me more than curious enough to progress through the line following it.This game, despite its seemingly grind-dependant system, is one I would highly recommend to any MMO gamer who lost their spark, lost interest in gaming, or just wants to try something new.

												The Secret World is probably one of the best MMO's at the moment. The graphics are good and if your graphics card is good enough, you can even get tesselation into the game which makes the game look pretty awesome. The game is also optimized pretty badly, it runs mostly in quite good fps but there are some places which makes your fps spike pretty low, especially if you use the tesselation.What makes this MMO stand out from every other MMO's currently available is that the ""class system"" is unique and works pretty well, because you can make your own ""class"". What would be cooler than playing with a group where one player uses firearms, one magic abilities and another a mixture of melee and magic? The class system is so cool that you can even mix two different types of abilities into one. There isn't any levels in the game, complete quests and kill enemies to gain ability points which are used to unlock more abilities for you to use.Also, the game takes place in present time. The enemies are mostly created from different urban legends which makes them quite interesting and unique from other MMO's. The storyline kind of mixes things with real life, urban legends and myths which makes it really interesting and different. One of the things I like the most with the quests are the research missions, which tells you what you need to find out, then you use the in-game browser and find out the answers yourself to continue the mission. Sometimes it is too hard to find out the answers yourself though, so you need to find a mission walkthrough to get past one obstacle, but they are pretty fun and sometimes they make you involved deeper into the story.Although, the early stages of the game is pretty easy with a group, I recommend playing this with a few friends. The game gets tougher when continuing towards the end, and once you progress long enough you can't solo the quests anymore. One of the biggest reasons why you should play with a group, and it is more fun than playing alone.If you want a good MMO, which is different from other MMO's at the moment, you want this one. So what are you still waiting for? Buy it, play it, treasure it. Whatever, just stop reading this and go join the war!			"

												I'd like to apologize ahead of time for the lack of a pros and cons or other in depth analysis you might see in other reviews. I'm just here to brown nose a little.I don't write reviews, ever, but for this game I can make an exception. It's story telling is genius, its graphics don't even need to be good (Even though they are) because they way they've managed to capture the atmosphere is so perfect that I lack words to describe it, and the voice acting is top of the line.The Secret World is like playing through a really good psychological suspenful, mystery, horror movie. I captures all of the best elements of story telling and its lore has a deceptive depth to it. For the life of me I cannot understand why this game hangs on the fringes as something of a cult ""classic"" when it has the potential to be something huge.Between solving puzzles and wracking my brain dechipering codes or unravelling painfully obscure mysteries I find myself at a loss for exactly how to convey just how much I like this game. It's strange really. The feeling it gives from the music right down to the appropirate scenery. Every lovecraftian thing, every eldritch monstrocity seems enough to make anyone's skin crawl with creep, fear, and confusion.In more than 100 hours of gameplay I've played solo, I've not completely a single dungeon, and I still find this game incredibly entertaining.I'll say this and shut up. The story writers for this game could have easily written a series of novels and even the scripts for award winning movies. Hell, even a television series would be mindblowing with the kind of writing they do. I don't know what intellects they have behind it all (Never watched the credits) but these folks are top notch.

												It's been a long time since I've fallen in love with an MMO. So many of them these days seem exactly the same and it's been hard to truly get excited about anything new. In that regard, The Secret World is a breath of fresh air. Based in a modern world, the storyline is captivating and the quests are really unlike any other. Sure there's the typical ""kill this many of these"" that you get with most games but that's to be expected. What really stands out are the investigative quests which actually require you to do your own research and problem solving. Character building is pretty interesting too although complex in the beginning. Once you understand how decks and synergy work with your talismans and weapons, it's actually wonderful. You have an extraordinary amount of options in how you want to play and it's rare that any two people will play their characters the exact same way. I can see that the learning curve is a bit of a turn off for most people starting out with this game, but if you stick with it, this game really is a gem. There's also a lot of special little surprises and references that show up that appeal to fans of nerdy culture. Unlike most MMOs this one actually works really well as a single player game but it is absolutely more fun when playing with a group.			"

												While at first I was leery of starting on another MMO after a long stint without more than scattered gameplay on EVE and The Old Republic, I found myself interested in the concept behind this game. After the initial ""WTF"" phase that most gamers go through with a new style, I discovered that not only did I enjoy the game, I'd found one that had topped any MMO before it in my opinion. While it seems TSW starts off slow, it picks up the pace almost instantly after the starter missions. Grinding away in the same area constantly seemed unappealing until I saw the way the game encouraged not only teamwork, but communication between party members (a feature I hadn't seen since the early days of Everquest).Following the introduction to the gameplay alone, I found that the storyline was not only well-constructed, but engaging for the players. Every time I finished a mission, the one following it left me more than curious enough to progress through the line following it.This game, despite its seemingly grind-dependant system, is one I would highly recommend to any MMO gamer who lost their spark, lost interest in gaming, or just wants to try something new.

												Good fun MMO, like the fact that one character can spec for any and all roles, Tank/DPS/Healer and can come up with a very wide range of different ways to achieve the same thing.  Not so keen on the fact that it needs specialised roles but havent tried a dungeon yet so don't know how serious that is.			"

The game isnt worth the 30 dollars, but if you ever see it on sale for like 10 or around that and you want to get a mmo then I would say pick this up. But be sure to have friends, or search and do every quest you find along the way.			"

												steam says 1662 hours spend but it is actualy triple that since i no longer use steam to play it.best mmo out there. quests are great fun. the dungeons are the best i have seen in an mmo *perfect difficulty, great lore, not to short/long. and offer lots of replayability when you get to nm level you can pretty much make any builds and stat combination you can think of to be the best dps/heal/tank out there.end game players are helpfull and there is little to no elitism.game may seem quite at first but if you join #sanctuary #event and #pvp your chat box will never be empty.pvp while unbalanced at times is rediculously fun just make sure you have some hear first or you will get destroyed as players tend to be endgame level. (this is my fav part of tsw) cabals are very nooblet freindy and if you are new dont be afriad to ask in generel agartha (hub) to join one as there are always recruiting to help you get to endgame and it will be much easier to participate in lairs, elites, nms and even pvp!the zones are very diverse and fun to expore made up of almost entierly unique textures  and picking your own faction is super fun.it is quite performance heavy so make sure you have a somewhat decent computer to play or you will have bad fps most likely. since i love this game so much i will give it a 10/10.

												An MMO is only as good as the sum of its parts: the story, the multiplayer aspect, the cash shop, the ""hook,"" and the company that makes it. The Secret World is a very good MMO, but because its director has changed, the end product is a bipolar mix of MMO design philosophy. The early and middle parts of the game are rich, interesting story, supplemented by detailed environments, memorable characters and enemies, and well-written plots. The endgame is a punishing grind for gear and skills. Additionally, the latest holiday events were grind-fests, as well. Would I recommend this game? Yes. The story itself is such a beautiful thing that it deserves recognition. However, the endgame is a bucket of cold water to a damn good Sunday afternoon nap, so be sure to prepare yourself.			"

												For the LAZY PEOPLE! - If you want to see a PRO-CON list immediately, click ""Read More"" and scroll DOWN!Categories!!! - Positive commentary.!*!*! - Negative Commentary!!! - I can't recommend this MMORPG enough. I can't get enough of it. Been playing it non stop recently and I don't think it'll end anytime soon. The game mechanics are superb for the style of gameplay it utilizes. Gunplay and melee combat and spectacularly executed, and I have seen few games that can pull it off. Especially in an RPG style game like this. The magic is also well done. Each weapon and fighting style can be combined in hundreds, if not thousands of different ways! The skill trees and the abilities are very well done as well as thought out. Once you learn it, it becomes quite easy to figure out what you want to do with your character, and at that point, the posibilities become endless.!!! - To start, one of the most important things I really want to mention about this game is it's setting and style. It is MODERN DAY. And there are no fairies or anything! Which is a really fresh getup with the game. Now you're probably thinking, ""There are muthical creatures in this game!"" Yes! There are! And each one of them are gruesome, disgusting and AWESOME! They look beautiful. Much different from a futuristic and fairytale style setting. Oh! And I forgot to mention. It has the Illuminati, Templars and Dragons! Secret Societies for FACTIONS!? That's a win/win for everyone.!!! - You could become a pistol dueling swordsman, a elemental mage who uses shotguns, and even an Assault rifle marksman who bashes enemies heads in with a HAMMER! The combinations and playstyles very in so many forms it takes player variety to a whole new level. I still have yet to use all the weapons and magics with all their main inner ring abilities.!!! - The questing as well! Man oh man, whoever designed the quest lines and missions on this game knew what the heck they were doing! Along with the main storyline that you play along(which is also extremely compelling) you are allowed to do extra missions along the way with an additional set of 3 extra side missions possible. Now they are not given to you, but as you move to your next objectives you can pick them up along the way, rewarding you with money and some awesome trinkets and gear.!!! - The game mechanics are also something extremely notable. The way combat is done is fairly simple and straight forward. It is hotkey based but is simplified to the first 7 number keys on your keyboard. You can apply 7 active combat or supportive abilities of which are all really fricking awesome! Along with that, passive abilities (7 of them as well) can be activated as well! This makes loadouts limited, but it allows  you to experiment with combat combinations and permutations.!*!*! -As for the bad parts, there is few to say but the ones that are there are something to note of. Grinding is definitely an aspect of this game, but it doesn't really feel like it as you have much to explore and kill. But repetitive killing will come if you are focusing on acquiring AP and SP points. And there is no Leveling up system, which is pretty cool but it makes guidelines for the newer players hard to follow as they try to progress.!*!*! - The monsters and enemies on this game are a problem as well, especially when trying to get through the storyline. Determining whether you can fight and KILL the monster you are about to engage is hard to predict since there is no definite sign. Fighting something you can't kill is of serious consequence since you have no real ability to flee. The storyline throws you through missions/tiers quickly, meaning you get through the mission faster than your character can keep up with. So you WILL have to grind and wait a bit to be able to kill or fight the monsters coming up in the next section of the mission.!*!*! - The learning curve on this game is also a bit of a moderate level. The interface and hotkey tutorials is easily forgotten so you will have to dock some time into learning it. Understanding some of the combat mechanics such as Resource Pooling and Ability screening can be a bit tricky. Figuring out what your supposed to do, how to get stronger character wise, how to get better clothes and MUCH better gear can also be a bit of an issue for new players unless they delve into some research. Noobies might find it frustrating a bit to figure out what they're doing.The All in All:PROS-The Factions are Illuminati, Templars and Dragons. Awesome in a box.-New and Fresh setting. Set in the Modern Day rather than fairies and Knights in shining armor.-$29.99 is a GREAT price for what you're getting.-Combat is fun and well executed.-Great Mission and Questing opportunities-Graphics won't murder your computer. (CPU may be an issue)-Thousands of different play styles and combat combinations.-Really. Fricking. Fun.CONS-Learning the game is a bit tricky.-Character Development vs Monster Progression is hard to keep up with.-Some might find the game a bit repetitive in combat.(Vary your playstyles as you go through! Don't stick to one or two weapons!)-Most of the ways to make yourself look cool is by paying REAL MONEY. But it is not a requirement. Faction armor is provided.The Verdict, Should you buy this game?YES! For 30 bucks you are getting a SWEET deal. Any MMORPG fan is going to fall in love with this game. The factions are each unique and great! The weapons and magics are all cool and well designed. The quests feel endless. For not subscriptions, this is a MUST BUY! This is definitely a 9/10. I say 9/10 since there are definitely some fixe(not just bugs) and tweaks dearly needed. But otherwise, almost perfect. Get. This. Game.			"

												One of the best story driven games I have played, online or not. Very unique, interesting world and events, way different than any other mmo quests. You actually pay attention to what is going on, not just follow the big arrows and click the same buttons over and over. I never got to end game though, it works best if you have friends playing too as the matchmaking or finding groups to run with while leveling never really clicked for me. The leveling system is really cool with you can pick and switch between any of the many areas to level in however it does make it hard to determine relative level of content and dungeons that you should be running.

												It's been a long time since I've fallen in love with an MMO. So many of them these days seem exactly the same and it's been hard to truly get excited about anything new. In that regard, The Secret World is a breath of fresh air. Based in a modern world, the storyline is captivating and the quests are really unlike any other. Sure there's the typical ""kill this many of these"" that you get with most games but that's to be expected. What really stands out are the investigative quests which actually require you to do your own research and problem solving. Character building is pretty interesting too although complex in the beginning. Once you understand how decks and synergy work with your talismans and weapons, it's actually wonderful. You have an extraordinary amount of options in how you want to play and it's rare that any two people will play their characters the exact same way. I can see that the learning curve is a bit of a turn off for most people starting out with this game, but if you stick with it, this game really is a gem. There's also a lot of special little surprises and references that show up that appeal to fans of nerdy culture. Unlike most MMOs this one actually works really well as a single player game but it is absolutely more fun when playing with a group.			"

												This is the first MMO I've played, and I must say it's been quite a treat. The base game includes plenty of content, but I would strongly suggest the Ultimate Edition. At first, I was wondering what I was getting into it. The gameplay seemed overwhelming without much of a tutorial. However, after digging around for info to get a grasp of the game, I began to realize how great of a game it was.The story is immersive and the quests are excellent. I especially love the investigation quests; these quests will have you googling and cross-referencing the most obscure information, which may rack your brain, but anyone who loves reading up on random facts and history or once dreamed of being Sherlock Holmes will surely love these quests. And of course, I have to recommend a game that has me using a pen and tons of scratch paper. And of course the combat. Not being much of a combat-game person, I do enjoy it in this game. I was in-experienced in deck-building (still am), hence how it may be overwhelming to a newbie MMO player at first. In terms of community, you're not going to see hundreds of people running around and the amount of general chat in most areas will be pretty minimal. But there are ways to find groups to join. Most people tend to be playing solo unless they're playing in dungeons or PVP.Only con I have is the occasional crash, otherwise 10/10. "

												The first MMO I ever played was Anarchy Online, also by Funcom.  I bought it when it was first released and played for years to come.Since I've tried to find an MMO that I felt had as much depth as well as a breathtaking atmosphere and nothing could compare.  That is until I got my mitts on The Secret World (again by Funcom - it appears they got my number).  So, I'll break it down into a few categories outlining my favorite part of this game.Story:One of the largest problems I have with MMOs is that I live in Japan, a time zone that makes it difficult to get online during the busiest hours of play.  Usually when I hop into an MMO is sparsely populated and just finding a team can be nearly impossible.  Therefore, it's necessary that an MMO have a solo experience that is every bit as strong as the multiplayer experience.  On this, The Secret World does not disappoint.  The questing and story mission are some of the best I've ever experienced in any game, much less an MMO.  The number of story missions, main missions and side missions is staggering, but what's even more staggering is that they all interweave into each other, contributing to the overarching story as a whole.  Everything feels connected and it's the most rewarding solo experience in a game I've played to date.Multiplayer:At first, I thought the multiplayer aspect of the game was sorely lacking, but upon joining the Sanctuary chat channel and finally getting powerful enough to start enjoying dungeons, playing with a team really opened up.  Even though there aren't that many dungeons available, they're of the quality that I relish playing them over and over with different teams.  The enjoyment comes not from figuring out the dungeon, but figuring out how best to work with your team members.  You can constantly tweak your build to fill in gaps in your defense or build up your offense.  What this results in is that at the beginning of the dungeon, when the team is still freshly formed, the team is weak.  As you plunder through the dungeon, each member slowly tweaks their build and play style to work well with their teammates and by the time you reach the boss of the dungeon, you're team is working together like a well oiled machine, soaking up hits while dishing out the pain.  Or, if you don't gel well with your team and try to figure out the best way to work together, you all die.Character depth:The reason the multiplayer aspect works so well is because of the depth of the character build system.  There are no classes, you can learn any weapon on the fly.  You can be a healer for a particularly tough fight, but on the easier parts, you can switch over to a damage dealer and help knock the enemies down faster.  Or, you can build a leech healer that steals HP every time you deal damage, creating a nearly indestructible solo build.  The ability wheel at first seemed simple, buy the most expensive abilities and equip those.  You can't think about individual abilities, just like the theme in multiplayer, you have to think about which active abilities and which passive abilities play well with each other.  As you dive deeper into the ability wheel, you start to realize the complexity of it all.  This allows countless different builds and allows you to make a really unique character that tailors perfectly to your play style.  It requires some serious thought though.  I have a stack of notes on my desk of build ideas (some borrowed from others, some my own creation and some blends of the two) that I try out depending on the situation.  Additionally, there is no one universal build.  There is so much diversity in the enemies you come across that sometimes you have to use a completely different build just to survive.  This is by far one of the most rewarding aspects of the game.Atmosphere:Graphics have come a long way since the days of Anarchy Online.  This game is nothing short of gorgeous.  I have a fairly serious PC (Phenom II X6, Radeon HD 1950, 32GB DDR3) and I still only manage an average of 30 FPS, so keep that in mind.  The visuals are stunning and each area has its own unique feel.  Nothing feels like it has been reused or recycled.  But, in a way, this game reminds me of the Stalker series of games.  It's not just about pure graphical power, because in that sense, there are many games out there that can outshine it.  It's about the whole package  The visuals, the sound, the music, it all works in wonderful unison to pull you into the game.  It's so easy to get caught up in the atmosphere and depth that I often found myself completely letting the real world surrounding me dissolve and disappear (much to the chagrin of my significant other).  Community:I've found that the community is even better than the community in Anarchy Online, which is to say, amazing.  The Sanctuary chat channel in particular is a godsend.  Some of the most helpful people I've ever met in a game, I've met in this game.  Everyone is good natured, willing to answer any questions (no matter how menial they may seem), and even help us lowbies battle through some of the more particularly difficult situations.  Getting into a Cabal (the equivalent of a guild or org) is taking the wonderful community and adding in a very strong sense of camaraderie.  The community is always active, helpful, fun and downright pleasant.Overall:If you would have asked me in my first 10 to 15 hours of play what I thought of the game, I would have said it was good but not great.  If you were to ask me now (at just 150 hours in), I would say it's downright amazing.  The game unfolds piece by piece, drawing you in further and further.  If you're looking for a unique gaming experience you can share with thousands of wonderful people, this is your one stop shop.			"

												No fall damage, 100/100!  No but seriously, This game is amazing. It's really unlike any MMORPG I've ever played. It is the nicest most newbie friendly (Depending on the server you're in ) game I've ever played. I will continue to play this game.The people don't kill you unless you're in that kind of server, you can play the game with your friends or random people and still have a lot of fun. I've never heard of a MMORPG with nice players, but I guess they're is a first for everything. Saying I recommend this game doesn't do it justice, You need to stop reading this review, and buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game NOW! WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS, BUY IT NOW! YOU BUY NOW!			"

												At this point I have only played through the first area (Kingsmouth).  I have to say that this is quite possibly the best mmo I have ever played.  I'm not exaggerating.  It's not perfect, but so many things are done right it's amazing.  The skill/ability system, the gear, the quest system, atmosphere, story, and don't even get me going on the voice acting; I'll just say it is by far the best of any game I've played, escpecially mmos.  The combat is similar to GW2 or DDO, where it's action oriented with no auto-attack but you have a target; well, soft-target since it targets whatever is closest unless you lock the target. This game is so good I wish they would overhaul Anarchy Online and use the same quest, skill, and ability system; it would fit there perfectly, and they already ported it to the same game engine.  If wishes were dollars I'd be a billionaire.			"

												There is nothing like The Secret World. In a MMO marketplace dominated by fantasy and ""space"" titles, TSW has attempted to do something unusual and has succeeded. The developer, Funcom, has a history of releasing cerebral, out-of-the-box titles and TSW continues this development strategy. While not tied to a single famous IP like Funcom's Age of Conan MMO, TSW reaches into many lesser known or less celebrated genres such as spy (James Bond), explorer (Indiana Jones), and horror and also the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, and John Carpenter as well as many conspiracy and secret society tropes found in movies and fiction. The updates to the game are released as Issues (complete with comic book cover art) and the hundreds of game missions are connected as part of a vast, interwoven story which unfolds as the game is played. Fully voiced and animated cut scenes for main missions add to the feel of a film or television series with recurring characters. All of the conventional MMO features are here too with a crafting system, PvP, pets, mounts, raids, and guilds (Cabals) but unlike anything found elsewhere in multiplayer online games. For a new experience intended for an adult audience, play The Secret World.			"

												I can't tell if I hate The Secret World or love it, it has really nice story telling, solid combat and intriquing locations, but it plays on the perfectionist, you'll never find the ""perfect"" build because there's so many abilties and combinations to mix around with in the games ""deck"" creator (Essentially a create your own class) but you can't be one thing, tanks and healers NEED a dps build to get through the story or swap to something like a Heal Tank or Leech Healing (IE: Stealing health from the enemy using DPS and redistrubiting it to your team or yourself) as someone who wants to always be at their peak, it's infuriating finding a deck that feels nice but just doesn't have the DPS or heals, and with the announcement of Funcom being up for sale, it's a risky buy but I'd still recommend it, if nothing else, for the storyline. and you WILL need the expansions for this (called Issue's) as the game's story heavily relies on them so do yourself a favor and get the ultimate edition.

												Excellent game if you are in to conspiracy theories, horror(zombies,vampires,ghouls etc).  A good story that is mostly narrated in cut scenes.  If you are not too fussed about pvp and enjoy running around doing single player type missions and bumping in to a few other players now and then, and maybe doing a dungeon or two, if you can get the team, then give this game a go.  If you know someone who already has the game ask them for a free 3 day pass to check out the game, you will know within a couple of hours if this is the game for you. If you think there are too many 'ifs' in this review, you may need to ask yourself, 'IF it was worth reading all the way to the end'			"

												This game is mindblowing. I have been playing mmos since UO, and I seriously started to think that the mmorpg genre can't show me anything new. I was wrong, and this game gave me back my faith. We can often meet with the expression of a game having no ""level system"" which is always untrue, only the hardcore fanboys/girls believe it strongly. In a hidden way there is always a level system. However in the case of The Secret World my statement is only partially true! You get XP, and by reaching the right amount you get one of the two types of points. One type is used to purchase skills, one is to level up the abilities needed to wear better stuff. So basically if you want to equip endgame items, you need more xp, so thats paralel to a leveling system, since a new character cannot equip lvl 10 talismans for eg. but pretty much that's it. The skill system is amazing! Confusig at first sight, but in reality it's so simple, yet refreshing and new. And there are lots of skills. Lots, but not overwhelmingly lot. Amazing flexibility, you can really mix anything with anything, you can mix guns with magic or meelee weapons, no matter what you choose, if you choose the right skills for your 2 weapons, you will be succesful.The story is awesome. The game is filled with cutscenes, everything is fully and nicely voiced. You can skip them though. If you hate the ""next-next-next-accept-close-next-next"" type of games, you'll loooove this one. If you love stories, you'll love this one. Why? Because accepting a quest is EASY. 2 clicks, open and accept. And you know what type of quest is that from it's color and icon, even before opening it. If you want it's story, you'll have a cutscene. You don't like it? Just skip it, and go. You don't have to wait. Story maniacs, like I am can find many NPC to interact with with a small symbol. If you ask them, they will tell you stories and information. Again: fully voiced.Sounds are awesome. Period. What about the music? Astonishing! Beautiful. Period. The kind of music which I can listen outside the game, too. Soundeffects are also super. Graphically the game is nice, and runs smoothly on almost max graphs on my few year old, veeeeeryfar from atomic-high-über gaming PC. It has surprisingly few errors. I only found one so far, my sword sometimes goes trough my character's arm, which is pretty good comparing to other mmos (WoW: worgen's fur vs armor, rings a bell to anyone?).As for the atmosphere... AMAZING. Gloomy, but not depressing, apocalypic feeling, cool horror monsters and some quests really bring the true horror feeling. Also the game has brutally CHALLENGING (I mean it!!!) puzzles, if you are as clever and educated like me, you'll only need the chat or the game's ingame internet browser (yeah, for obvious reasons they made one) 50-70% of the time. From deciphering morse codes, to translating latin texts, to finding things in a Bible, realizing a painter's or a composer's name, there are tons of things which gives you the feeling that you're inside of a treasure hunting movie with a freemasonic theme.This game is pure genious. Some monsters become repetitive after a while, it's a common mmo sickness. Luckily you can choose to start another type of quest instead, if you don't want to butcher anymore, and when you would get too tired of the monsters, you'll be sent to the next areas.My biggest problem so far was the fact, that I haven't bought the game with all issues, while on sale, since you can't get them without the game on steam. Now I'll have to buy them for a full price. No, seriously my biggest problem with the game is that you cannot drop a quest. If you want to pause it, you'll have to take another from the same type of quest to take it's place. (There are a certain number of quests from each type that you can have at a time.) But the thing I like in it: if you pause a quest, and later return to take it again, you can continue it from the point you've abandoned it: most quests have steps called tiers, and after completing each tier, you get XP, and after completing the whole line, you'll get the final q reward.If you love mmos, buy it. If you love mystery games buy it. If you love horror, at least watch some gameplay videos! If you prefer gore/guro style things maybe it's not for you, but if you like mild horror too, you'll love it. There were some moments which gave me chills, and in one case I even screamed (:blushes:).			"

												Probably one of the most interesting single player games that I've played so far. But seriously, if d20 Call of Cthulhu (with a non-sadistic DM, of course) was an MMO, this would be it. Considering that it's only $30 when not on sale and that you can easily get over a hundred *fun* hours off of it (which, sadly, my steam profile doesn't reflect since I originally played before I realized that TSW was on steam) and that on sale it could even go down to $5, I can't recommend it more. Long story short:-Kinda bad combat system that takes some getting used to-Cutscenes before a lot of quests (when the quest giver is human, of course)-Long story quest that gives you an actual reason to go to the different zones (unlike a certain game made by blizzard)-Non level-based experience system (you still gain experience, but you get a certain number of ability points or skill points after a set amount of experience that never increases; you get to choose where the points go, rather than being what the game wants you to be. Sandbox elements too good.)-HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥THE INVESTIGATION MISSION. THE ♥♥♥♥ING IMMERSION IS STUPIDLY GOOD.-Press b to bring up a functional internet brower in-game (which is used for a lot of quests)-The amount of effort put in by the devs is too damn high (http://www.kingsmouth.com/ = the website for the first town you go to. There are twitter accounts for important characters, and other websites for important companies)-Immersion immersion immersion-Stuff-Things-If its on sale, buy it-etcYes, I recommend this. It might not have taken 5000+ hours out of my life like Maplestory or WoW, but I'll be damned if TSW isn't a good $30 game. Also, no subscription needed. "

												I have played this game on and off for a while now, can honestly say it is well worth it for the price I got for it on sale.Pros:+ Story is immersive.+ looks pretty good, even at the lowest settings+ isn't terribly optimized. As of writing, I am currently playing on a dell Laptop/tablet, which is thin as hell and does not have beefiest of integrated graphics. It runs at 40 FPS despite this+ Absolutely oozing atmosphere. This is combined with all of the fully voiced cutscenes for almost everything. It must be staggering how many hours of dialog have been recorded for this.+ Scratches that (murder) mystery itch*+ can be played alone or with friends. Soloing is perfectly viable, but it gets lonely in the middle of abomination torn hellscapes.+ The playerbase alive is for the most part. There will be someone to raid with most of the time. (Better with friends though)+ Sound design is superb.Cons:- Combat system is awful tedious, even with optimized builds. It uses a building system, with basic attacks setting up for stronger attacks for the cost of a resource. This is also combined with the idiocy that somehow an M4 isn't tearing through a bunch of waterlogged zombies, or a Spas-12 isn't turning a scarcrow into straw. Nothing has any impact. (This could be subject to change because I heard through the grapevine that combat is getting a few changes at the end of March 2017, so this could be moot around then)- Be prepared to go through a ton of older missions to level up, because leveling is an absolute b!tch in this game. I have had to retread a ton of old quests that I already finished for some exp boosts, because the next part of the story would absolutly thrash my @$$. - *The leaps in logic you will have to make for investigation quests will require you to visit a walkthrough routinely, unless you're Sherlock frickin Holmes or an absolute madman. Like seriously, I am not some great intellect but I can say with some confidence that I am not a massive idiot, and the reach I would need to get most of this is absurd, like a BROKEN CLOCK ON THE WALL SOMEHOW REFERNCING A BIBLE VERSE TO LEAD TO A CLUE. If I have to play this game without a walkthrough, I am pretty sure I would be an absolute lunatic by the end of the first story arc.- Takes up a lot of space, file is hueg.			"

After playing it I was hooked I played for all 32 hours straight I was sickened by the amount I played and time and energy put into the game.

												Probably the best story driven game, with some very complex puzzling. This game should be on peoples bucket list.The game does not go without a few graphical glitches/animations… today what game does not? Hell some games literally release broken, then have the audacity to bombard you with DLC content before they even fix their game.This game is cheap, you can find it online a lot cheaper than on Steam Store, all that aside.The game sports 3 factions, The Illuminati, The Templar, and The Dragon. Each of these factions have their own story behind their motives, I won't spoil anything though. The game has hundreds of hours of cut scenes and amazing voice acting, and so freaking many characters each with their own story and motives as of why you get to meet them and why you do what you do for them. That alone makes almost every character worth remembering.The combat is a bit clunky I won't try to sugar coat it, but it works, there are many builds out there and the game provides many within the game for you to cookie cut around. There is a lot of gear in the game many of which can be upgraded into more powerful versions as an end game gearing method. You don't need to do end game content to make your own end game gear, although it would speed up the process a bit if getting the best gear was your priority.The game has a crap ton of cosmetics, some of them are locked behind achievements, and goals that make it all that more worth to pursue. A lot of them can be found in stores within the game, or the auction house, it's pretty cool to run into a store and just try on clothes.The game has a huge world that expands quite a bit, hell the game has 15 expansions and more being worked on. The game has multiple settings, one of the areas you will be doing story missions is in Egypt.If there is any game out there worth 20 dollars… I'd say this game honestly will give you the bang for the buck, of course... if you can get past the few glitches and clunky combat... the story will be one of the most rewarding you'll ever play in history.

												There really is no class and you choose what ability you want from a really long list but because of that you need to understand what all of those ability do and dont do, what i mean by that is that choosing a set of ability that is not trash to play with is a pain to do because there is so much to learn, unless ofcourse you find a build made by somebody else and you use it instead of making your own but i always found that this never really feel right to me since it was made for somebody else play style. While there really is no class the traditional role of healer/tank/dps still exist and are needed in group play, you can make a hybrid ofcourse but they have the same problem as hybrid in other game, they dont excel in a single role.Puzzle/enigma solving seem to be common in this game.The story is often important in this game to solve puzzle to make progress in the story and it sometime need information from the real world to be solved, they tried to merge the two so much that you even have access to an internet browser ingame that take you to the real internet and you need to search for information from the real world to solve some of the puzzle/enigma.Those are the biggest difference that i saw in the few hours i played but since i was looking for a mmo that is more friendly to casual gamer than this i stopped playing.So if you want a mmo with a lot of ability customization possiblity and that the dev try to ""merge"" with the real world this is for you. It too bad there is not a trial version for those that are not sure to like it or if this is what they want.			"

												I honestly am not sure what to write about. I mean, there's a lot that I can write about, but would take quite a bit of time to flesh out. There's a lot of content to this game, and I mean A LOT. The missions have so far almost never been just a purely, ""Go here, kill X amount of this enemy and then come back for your reward."" (You can actually just ""send in a report"" when you're finished instead of returning altogether.) There are missions that have unique requirements to them such as learning the lengths of two songs IRL to find the coordinates for a buried treasure side-mission, figuring out the password of a doctor's computer by using the hints provided, and figuring out the keycode by learning which song the pastor of a church was going to play first on Sunday. The combat gameplay is pretty decent as well. It feels a little stiff in some things you do, but it is overall a good experience. Enemies are also capable of being unique as well in what they do. They can be very unforgiving if you don't figure out your♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can actually die in the tutorial level easily if you don't get your head out of your♥♥♥♥♥Classes are... class-less. There's no real defined class or set, besides how you decide to build your character. ""Wanna be a glass assassin? Alright! Wanna be a glass healer? Okay! Wanna be a tank assassin? Fine! Tank healer? Healing Tank? Tank Tank? Glass glass? Vampire(Metaphorically speaking)? Sniper? Ninja? Errr.... Vegetable? Cake? Umm... A pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Your choice!Abilities work as you need to have the weapon equipped to use that the ability is used by, but you can use every ability and weapon in the game. However, you can only pick 7 active abilities and 2 equipped weapons at a time, but can also change them out whenever you like. You also get to use the passive abilities from the weapons WITHOUT needing to equip the weapon associated with it which you can also switch out whenever you like. You're able to save your ""class"" sets and switch between those so you can make a role switch on the fly.There's 9 weapon types total. Pistols (dual wield), Assault Rifles, Shotguns for the guns. Hammer, Sword, and Fist Weapons for the melee. Blood, Chaos, and Elementalism magic. They all have their own unique abilities and attacks and passives. You can use 2 of any kind whenever you wish in whatever combination. They have their own focuses, as being a DPS, Heal, or Tank focus. You get to pick 2 starter weapons, but you can try out each weapon when you're going through the runthrough with your character.Character Customization is... enough. There's enough there to make your own unique character(s), but then again, there's still more that you want and need to make YOUR OWN character. Enough, but still needs more to make you feel satisfied unless you can get what you're looking for with what there is.Areas are very expansive and full of content. I'm actually still stuck in the first map. I've been able to put about 20 hours into just the first map so far.PvP is actually very balanced. I have been able to deal enough damage to just about nearly kill veterans in the PvP wars with only my starting abilities. (PvP Wars places you on an even playing field in terms of stats, not items or abilities.) PvP war is the only PvP I've played so far, but you can be as weak as a first-timer when you're a veteran since there are not ""Levels"" and ""Classes"".This review will run on even longer if I continue, I will stop here and allow you to make the decision of whether or not you want to make the plunge to buy this game! They also allow TSW buyers to send people 72 Hour keys to play the game for free to see whether you'll like it for yourself! If you know someone with TSW already, ask them to send you a key!My honest opinion: 85/100 (so far).			"

												Definitely the best MMORPG I have ever played.  Entirely devoid of your average generic ""go pick this plant, kill 10 of these mobs, and escort this snail paced sissy lala to his moms house"" type quests...the missions are incredibly intelligent, immersive, like a good book you can't put down, and have a Lovecraftian atmosphere.  If you want to put your brain on auto-pilot and mindlessly hack and slash mobs, then this is not the game for you...you HAVE to use your brain.     You can be any role on one character, because you can learn all of the skills, unlock all of the weapons, and get all of the gear, all on the same character.  Weapons range from wolverine like fist claws, to assault rifles and different melee, range, and magical types.  Reading the passive skills, and learning what weapons/skills/talismans to use in different situations is the key to your survival...you'll do a lot of learning from mistakes, that's for sure.       This game also has one of THE most helpful communities I have ever experienced on any game, and I have made a lot of good friends here.  My wishlist is forever stocked with special Collector Editions, Issues, and other DLC for the game, as I have fallen in love, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who thinks it sounds interesting.  Also a game that is best played with a friend, and I also recommend joining a cabal (guilds in game)  If you do join, I'm on the Arcadia server, I'm a Templar (one of three factions) and my IGN is Jennory, I'll help you with any questions you may have :D			"

												Unpolished and buggy, clunky, mediocre combat. Very hit or miss in every regard but story, as the story and world in The Secret World is on par with most good single player RPG's. Very cautious recommendation.			"

												As a bit of an older player, The Secret World is exactly what I am looking for. Interesting stories? Tick! A bit of horror, a bit of humour? Tick! Challenging quests? Tick! Multiplayer content so I can play with friends? Tick!I love this game and am having a blast. My only concern is that the first couple of hours didnt really do it justice and it wasnt until I got into the first quest zone (Kingsmouth) that it really started to shine. If you are sick of grind and want something thats actually interesting, mature and challenging then this is a great MMO.			"

												I was a big fan of this game on release, but I ended up going back to World of Warcraft because I could not keep up two subscriptions at the same time. Now that the game is subscription free, and absolutely FULL of quality content, this is the perfect time to come back. The game is alive and well, with a vibrant community and constant updates, it's really nice to see.Definitely recommended, quality MMO!			"

												The game story and world building is really amazing. I wish that the main player was voice-acted (I'm spoiled from playing SWTOR and Mass Effect) but for what it is, it's quite good. It does seem to be a bit harder to figure out for new players compared to other MMOs like SWTOR and ESO. Very distinctive and stylish though so an A- overall.			"

												Amazing MMO with no subscription, story focus and active community. Make sure to join the server-wide community made channel '/chat join #Sanctuary' to always stay in contact with people. Explore Kingsmouth (a city mixing Kingsport and Innsmouth from Lovecraft), Egypt and Transsylvania, uncover conspiracies and deal with ancient evils. Combine weapons and hundreds of skills and passives together to make a build tailored perfectly for you - or follow one of the pre-built decks. Assault Rifles combined with Blood or Chaos Magic? Entirely possibole in The Secret World. (as always, wait for a Steam sale)			"

												I first experienced The Secret World at PAX 2012 when they had a small demo available to play.  While there I got some Illuminati dog tags and a free code to try out the beta when it became available.  Well, I did the beta and fell in love with the game.  The combat system can be challenging as it gives the player free reign, you can use whatever weapons and skills you want, you can tank, heal tank, dps, heal, or heal by causing damage (leech heal).  The storyline is the best of any game I have ever played.  If you love story driven games, this is the game for you!  The incorporate lore and stories from all over the world, the in-game lore items are an amazing read and gives you some insight into the NPCs you encounter.  Overall, its a great game, optimization is the only downside to this game as running DX11 can cause random crashes and frame drops.  On DX 9 it's still graphically good, but fps can still be an issue.			"

												For what it's worth, the base game of Secret World is fun and very immersive. It's also great fun to co-op. However, the end game content is lacking. There's not much point in having alts since you can easily respect your character. Plus, the ""missions"" for each faction can be are terribly frustrating so once you get through you'll be hard pressed to ever want to do them again. Dungeon running is fun but it takes a lot of time and practice to get the hand of it and with each new issue (what... I already paid and now I have to pay again!?) you'll find yourself further and further behind.			"

												*****VERY IMPORTANT READ ME*****If you go onto Humble Bundle you can buy the ultimate edition for 18$, which includes a HELL of allot more. On The secret worlds website it is 70$ but not on humble bundle. On Steam it cost 30$ ( FOR THE STANDARD EDITION) and all you get is the game and first 4 episodes (which are free..) I wish id known before i bought it, as each episode is like 25$ and there are 15 of them and 11x25 (NOT GOOD FOR YOUR WALLET; 15-4 from the 4 free episodes = 11). The ultimate edition gives you a unique outfit, in game boost, and starter weapons and episodes 5-11 (6 episodes). I do recommened. I heard of this ""Humble Bundle"" From a friend during a dungeon in the game. It's legit, you can google it.Additionally if you already bought the game on steam like me and want to redeem the bundle after purachasing it, you must enter the key code on steam after linking your steam account to humble bundle. Once you activate the code on steam, it will show it as unlocked. You must then go to library --> TSW --> Hover/click/ something (you need to find DC CODE and then copy it. Go to TSW website, activate THAT code onto your account. (NEED HELP? DM ME; i got a bit paranoid at first when i couldnt find my items.)Hope this helps. DEAL IS ONLY AVAIL FOR 6 MORE DAYS (it has a countdown timer). Anyway hope this helps please feel free to read the rest of my review before i bought the bundle P.S Will remove this portion of the review once the bundle is no longer on sale***READ ME/IMPORTANT ABOVE^^**Very fun game with very fun character cuztomization. You can join 3 Factions, Illuminati, Templars, and Dragon. Each are extremely unique and interesting and have all very different vibes to them. The game is not really focused as much on your faction (from what i can tell so far; ive been playing for about a week). Instead, your story is based on ""Episodes"" (i think thats what they are called, and there are around 12 currently out). Each one is focused on something super interesting and different from the next. What i mean, is one episode may be about zombies, while the other about wearwolves, and another about killer clowns). You do get Faction quest as you get promoted ( every episode has an♥♥♥♥♥load of side quest, main missions, and ""story quest"", which the Xp granted from these qust also go towards your faction rank). Faction quest deal solely with what your faction believes in or is trying to accomplish personally, rather than what another faction is trying to accomplish.Character cuztomization: Very unique, you can change race skin color, tattoos, lots of hairstyles, blemishes/freckles, the eyebrows, jaw line, lips, eye color ECT. You also get to choose starter clothes (which are just regular clothes like hoodie/ tank top, converse shoes). UNFORTUNATELY you CANNOT change the body type.. Which is annoying if you want your character to look like you. You can change their height but not their actual body or fit level. They all ahve the same buff as ♥♥♥♥ ripped body.Purchasing the game: Game cost 30$ comes with first 4 Episodes (my purchase version did at least), but every episode after the 4 you have to buy which I looked at the price seem to be over 20$ PER episode. Character progression: The game is so unique in the way that there are no calsses, rather, every character is different. There are 3 different weapon TYPES: Guns, Melee weapons, and Magic. Each TYPE has 3 more weapon options to choose from. GUNS: Assualt rifle / Dual Pistols / Shotgun Melee: Hammer /Claws (like wolverine claws) / Sword Magic: Elemental magic/  Blood magic / Choas magicEach weapon has its own ROLE. For example, Blood magic can Heal and deal damage, while Shotgun can tank and deal damage. Each weapon has 5/6 different build types geared towarard that weapon. These build types all have different usable abilities and passive abilities, You can mix and match abilities and Passive abilities. Although you can only use blood magic, hamme, pistol, etc IF you are using that weapon. YOU CAN CHOOSE 2 WEAPONS THATS IT (but can switch at any time). Its very fun to choose weapons. Being able to take out hords of zombies with a shotgun then use Elemental magic to take down a boss.DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT buy ANYTHING for your character!! CLOTHES, MOUNTS, PETS NOTHINGGG. I only say this for new players as you will realize your first character will likely be a ♥♥♥♥ up or you simply just do not like the character. There are no levels and there are an INFINITE amount of ability points (which means you can basically unlock every single ability in the game) BUT THIS TAKES A LONG♥♥♥♥♥TIME TO DO AND it kinda screws you over in the beginning. As in the start of the game you really need to focus on a main weapon or two main weapons to actually get further in the game. The game is hard (actually literally impossible) if you do not do any side quest to gain XP to upgrade your weapons. I recommend trying all kinds of weapons in the starting room (at the start youll get to try every weapon) and take a good♥♥♥♥♥look of that weapons abilities and your secondary weapons abilities to see if they pair well. You may want to DPS in dungeons, and thats fine, but you wont get far if you are squishy and cant heal yourself during the solo gameplay. I wasted 20$ on clothes and a mount because the character i had sucked, and then i tried questing more to regain ability points to retrain into a new weapon, and it takes to long that at mid start area its kinda too much of a hassal.Faction: Factions are all fun as previously mentioned. IMO Templar seem to be most popular, then illuminati, then dragon. There is also PVP and conquering between each faction.Crafting: You can craft, but what i have seen it does not seem to be super OP weapons or anything, just like alterations. Story: Beyond amazing with great lore, keeps you interested. MMO experience: Seems to be lacking. DEF a large amount of players, and you also pass other players, but you dont seem to really group up with anyone besides with dungeons. No two characters look alike. You can also choose names, first and last name being whatever the hell you want even if someone else already has that name. Then you have like a ""Nickname"" which is literally a middle name except it has to be one no one else has which is what you are in the game data base i think, BUT other characters still see your first and last name. It appears like this.Samuel ""Bigfoot"" Renalds The name in quotation marks is the nickname/middle name and thats how it is ingame as well. Episodes: Episodes are meant to take a long time, so do not try to speed through the episodes. The zombie area for me has lasted a week and i have not yet gotten past to the other episodes quite yet. Cinematics: Has cinematics which is cool and keeps you entertainted, graphics are good but not not 2017 Good. Reminds me of old grand theft auto graphics on PS2.. Which isnt bad.Subsciption: You can buy subsciption 15$ a month but you still have to buy episodes even with VIP. All it does is increase money gain and xp gain and stuff like that (again there are no levels, so really this just makes it easier to get Ability points, which again, is an infinite amount of!). You get VIP rewards based on how many days youve had. 30 days you get an animated walk thing. Like as you run around it leaves a trail of golden honeycomb looking animation behind you. If you buy through steam you also get additional free goodies like shirts and hoodies and stuff (which eventually you wont care about but at first is cool!) OVERALL YES I WOULD PLAY AND BUY AND ALL THATgot lazy and now i dont feel like writing anything else but hey hope this gives insight			"

												There really is no class and you choose what ability you want from a really long list but because of that you need to understand what all of those ability do and dont do, what i mean by that is that choosing a set of ability that is not trash to play with is a pain to do because there is so much to learn, unless ofcourse you find a build made by somebody else and you use it instead of making your own but i always found that this never really feel right to me since it was made for somebody else play style. While there really is no class the traditional role of healer/tank/dps still exist and are needed in group play, you can make a hybrid ofcourse but they have the same problem as hybrid in other game, they dont excel in a single role.Puzzle/enigma solving seem to be common in this game.The story is often important in this game to solve puzzle to make progress in the story and it sometime need information from the real world to be solved, they tried to merge the two so much that you even have access to an internet browser ingame that take you to the real internet and you need to search for information from the real world to solve some of the puzzle/enigma.Those are the biggest difference that i saw in the few hours i played but since i was looking for a mmo that is more friendly to casual gamer than this i stopped playing.So if you want a mmo with a lot of ability customization possiblity and that the dev try to ""merge"" with the real world this is for you. It too bad there is not a trial version for those that are not sure to like it or if this is what they want.			"

												Despite it's age, this game has some amazing voice acting, Is very solo friendly, and a large amount of Lore pulled from the real world to mess around with. Grinding can be a bit dull at points but I find it easy to ignore as they're far apart. Finally the 30 dollar entry fee can feel a bit steep this far out from relese, especially since there are DLC that cost around $25 a piece. There's a membership option, but that isn't so cheap either. I may be griping over nothing but I feel with these particular transactions that I'm dealing with a freemium without the free entry.			"

												The Secret World is an amazing game.  The game puts a new spin on the mmorpg genre while still keeping with familiar gameplay mechanics.  This game does not hold your hand, in fact it barely helps you at all, and I love it.  There are no levels, instead you gain skills through experience that are weapon based, and you can use as many weapons as you want, switching entire gear sets on the fly, changing up your gear, as well as your active and passive skill sets.  The setting is very dark, with a ton of different monsters to slay and the tiered questing system is also very cool.  The devs are still involved and very active, the community is actually really great, and the game caters to solo and group play, so whatever your style you can find your niche in The Secret World.  If you enjoy mmo's or rpg's this game is for you.			"

												I read few negatives comments about this game and was bit skeptical about it. So far I've been surprised positively and I think it was well worth the 29EUR price.It's not the basic MMORPG with tons of quickbars filled with skills - you can only have 7 active and 7 passive skill memorised at time, but you can still learn everything and adjust your build from the fly to go well with your party members. Someone compared it like having every soul tree open in Rift, but only 14 skills at a time.Game world is beautiful, just like in Age of Conan. (Funcom knows how to do nice eye candy) I'm liking the story telling and videos, not just walls of text tossed to your screen. Quests and puzzles are actually fun, very different compared to the regular ""kill 40 creeps"", though there IS lots of killing to be done. :)Guns, swords and spells in modern time - a nice change from the ever so boring fantasy theme!

												If you ignore the click-click-click combat, the strangers spouting specialized acronyms, the clutter of semi-opaque inventory windows... you will find puzzles. Glorious puzzles. And when I say puzzles, I mean it in the true sense of the word: these are enigmas designed to test your ingenuity. You will need to pay attention, write things down, reasearch, translate, sketch, stretch, shower, stew, contemplate, contemplate, contemplate, and even then you might not be able to put everything together. But when you do, oh! Such a sense of accomplishment. I have never experienced a game as stimulating and rewarding as this.			"

												First of all, this is an MMO -- so it suffers from the usual MMO problems such as network lag, grinding and cash shop.However, as far as MMOs go, it's actually quite good. The story writing is surprising for an MMO, and they hand out experience generously -- there is no penalty for advancing in the game, and you keep getting progress no matter what. Most of the game can be soloed, although you'll probably hit a problem or two along the way, especially if you don't have dungeon- or cash-gear. Still, it feels much less penalizing for me than other MMO""RP""Gs did.The progress itself is extremely fast, but feels very slow -- while you have hundreds of ""abilities"" that you can get, and points just keep rushing in, you can only ever equip 7 (or 8, if you count the special aux weapon ability). So, for the most part, you'll just spend your points on abilities that you'll never use, which fills up your ability wheel but doesn't change the game.Same goes for weapon skills -- most of the time you'll just advance weapons that you don't use, because you've already maxed out the weapons that you do use... so, again, spending points all the time for only cosmetic progress as your skill bars fill up and the game stays the same.If you have access to good gear then you're probably running dungeons. Since you can get all abilities and use all weapons, you're not locked into a specific role (like DPS, healer or tank) --instead, just get suitable gear for each role, get familiar with a set of abilities useful for that role, and you can just switch your setup whenever you want.Bottom line -- it's still an MMO, but one that feels recommendable enough. It's definitely not a ""thumbs down"". "

												I throughly Enjoy this game once in awhile, I played it alot just when it was released, ran Endgame content, which, while buggy as hell, was fun to do, Abilities, Spells, Passives, and Aux weapons are all fun to play with and make weird crazy synergies, and quite honestly, if it weren't because I mostly play games with friends to have fun, and none of them seems to like this game, I'd probably have more then 5000 hours by now.The story is pretty catchy if you actually read into the quests, or just watch the cutscenes unfold, there are some funny and some interresting NPCs and characters in general, I like the gear system, and loved the Fashion system, you can look however you want and not have it mess with stats at all, and planning and synergizing skill and strategies with allies in Dungeons, and Raids, aswell as Nightmare areas, are really fun, (though you do get groups that don't communicate at all, but that's the same in all games).The UI is wank, and the game is still to this day riddled with bugs, though it's alot less bad then during release, and getting higher up in gear level can be tedious to start with, but it has alot of good qualities that overshadow its flaws for me, and what problems the game has, I can live with.Would I recommend this game to people?Well, ask yourself, do you like a deep skill system can allows synergies between weapons and spells you didn't even realise were there? Yes? WellDo you bother following the narative of a games story as you progress through it? Yes?Do you like quests that challenge you, not nessesarily your character in the game, but you as a player, that have to sit down and actually do some research to get on with certain quests? Yes to this too?Well does the game being buggy at times put you off, that said alot of it is minor now, and you can usualy work around it? If it doesn't put you off from a game, then absolutly I'd recommend it! It's a great game and very fun to mess with, Builds, Dungeons, and some pretty interresting quets await ahead in this game.All this said, I'll mention that the game does have PvP, but I'm not much of a PvP'er so I've barely touched it, it seemed okayish to me, but my guess it that there are probably 2-5 builds that completely dominate the PvP Areas, and that if you don't play those that you won't do too well, but I don't know for sure, this review is all from the PvE aspect of the game for me.

												The story is something I'd like to see. I wish there were more MMOs with a horror theme and a real-world setting.But this is one I cannot enjoy. There's a lot of 'stealth' and timing elements that are very hard, impossible for me. There's a lot of frustration looking for well-hidden and hard to find objects. Every mission is repeatable and I find myself doing the same ones over and over instead of finding new ones. It gets boring.Combat is weak compared to other MMO games and the character development system gives the illusion of free will but really traps you into buying a set of skills with synergies or else having a terribly innefective character.It's hard to get a group together and the world looks vacant with very few other players.I'm disappointed in my purchase and will be going back to LotRO. That being said, I'm sure there' an audience for this game. Just be aware that it's got a very high element of a scavenger hunt. It's complicated, rather than complex, and a lot of times it's east to be totally lost as to where to go or what to do next.			"

												There're no good nor bad MMOs. Every MMO is tailored for different kind of people, some MMOs focus on storytelling, some on good combat, role-playing, trading and crafting. I never recommend MMOs, I just say what I like/dislike, because in the end, it's all about personal preferences. I gotta say that The Secret World is a pretty good game. But I did not like it.I've played the game for 10ish hours, which is not nearly enough to fully understand an MMO, but it's enough to grasp the basics and realize if I like the game or not.Let me tell you how I felt during my time playing.So right after I clicked the character creation button, 3 factions popped up - Illuminati, Templars, Dragon (which is some Chinese organization?) - and I got to see a video for each one, showing me what's their ideology. I picked Illumati as they seemed the most appealing to me. Cinematic rolls in, recapitulating what happened during the last week. Long story short - a bee flew in my mouth, gave me super powers and apparently now some weird energy bursts out of me from time to time (not in a sexual way). Alright, the story is a little bit odd, but let's run with it. After 10 mins of high-quality cinematic experience, I have sudden need to go pick my laundry. I meet this Russian guy, let's call him cousin Roman - and he tells me he's being watched by the Illuminati, I look around and soon find their base located nearby in an old building (not so super secret afterall eh?). All of a sudden I'm being dragged by some guys, screen goes dark and when I wake up, an Einstein-looking mofo greets me, I go through briefing and finally get to weapon selection room, where I picked two of 9 possible weapons. Up until now I was actually fine with what was happening, despite the fact that the story might not be the best one ever. What really throws me off is how all the weapon animations and poses look like - one of the main things, that make me interested in an MMO, is how I feel when playing my character - it doesn't matter whether I play as a cute anime chick or a muscular man. Or a muscular anime chick. Whatever it is, I just want to feel like a bonafide badass and The Secret World has the exact opposite effect - I made a pretty cool-looking character, but after I got to try out the weapons, I felt like a cringey, awkward neckbeard weaboo warrior. The pistols don't even aim at their target, I just shoot them in random directions and the bullets land regardless, the swords remind me of The Blade[imgur.com] meme and the magic... why even put magic in such a mature, modern world? It's all such an odd mashup, as if the developer was trying to put in as many different combat styles as possible, but I really don't think it's necessary.Alright, weird story and awkward animations, I can live with that. After that I went through a portal thingy and got ported into a heaven-like place with a bunch of giants chilling around. Scratch the mature, modern world, forget I ever said that. We full fantasy now. I went through another portal and found myself in a post-apocalyptic world, where human survivors fight zombies and finally got a taste of combat, gotta say it was a bitter taste. At this point I have 4 abilities, 2 for each weapon type, which would be fine, if only there was at least some synergy between them - but there wasn't. I could mash the same single-target button, switch it out with an aoe button from time to time, but I didn't feel like it makes any difference. Also my buttons felt unresponsive, like every ability needs to finish its animation before I can do stuff, which I'm not a fan of either. As my next ability, I picked a drone, not only did it not synergize with my kit at all, it also seemed to be completely useless. This combat just doesn't make me feel like a badass at all, it makes me feel lame, slow and bored. It's just not fluid enough, not fun for me. Instead of being a god among humans, I'm a weaboo neckbeard gun-wielding ninja warrior.I really like the quest system, you can find quests pretty much wherever you go, no giant exclamation marks above NPC heads, you just talk to them, or find a random item laying around in the world and voilá quest started. I also gotta compliment the crafting system, which involves disassembling and assembling all kinds of items. Character customization is also well done and the game doesn't seem to be pay-to-win. However, I can't play without a combat system that I'd enjoy, that's the dealbreaker for me.Ever since WoW's Cataclysm, I've been desperately trying to find an MMO that would fit my tastes, played over 25 different ones. Is The Secret World ""the one""? Unlikely. I might give it another shot, perhaps the combat gets better eventually, but at this point I say no, I still like WoW more, even though I don't really like it. Gotta love WoW. And hate it. Eat donkey d, Blizzard. "

												Amazing game. It's an MMO that plays like a single player game, and the atmosphere and lore are incredibly immersive and detailed. I read that, in some areas, you will hardly ever see any other players (by design) in order to enhance the player's immersion in the environment. Pretty kickass. The Ultimate Edition is a great deal in terms of value, so if you're thinking about buying TSW and wondering which version to get, pick the Ultimate Edition. You'll save a bunch of money on the other issues (storylines) in the long run: you get issues 1-4 with the base game, but you get issues 1-11 with the Ultimate Edition. You also get 30 days of membership, 1200 bonus Funcom points (which you can use to buy issue 12 or 13 if you felt like it), an exclusive outfit, some other items, and a bonus game key for the standard edition of the game that you can give to a friend. It really is worth it to get the Ultimate Edition over the base game.			"

I downloaded this game based on the Extra Credits review, especially the section about the investigation missions.My only problem with it is the standard MMO grinding. Yeap, I killed that group of zombies last time I walked around the block and they're back for me to kill again. Killing the baddies in this game is too grindy for my likes. Especially when the baddiest are so frigging powerful. I definitely prefer games where I seem to be making an impact in the world. If I shoot a bad guy in the face I want him to stay dead.However I did really love the setting and storytelling of this game. I just wish I could have gone further.			"

												This game is great.  The story and quest writing is excellent.  The puzzles actually require you to think.  I'm enjoying everything about this game.  It actually has some difficulty to the game, which I like.  Many MMO players may find this to be a turn-off since I constantly see people whining about difficulty in MMOs and almost all MMOs now hold the hands of all the cry babies out there.To address the biggest complaint I see people make about this game.  The combat is action bar based...  why is it such a big deal that the game isn't ""innovative"" in 1 aspect?  The most popular MMO in the world has action bar based combat, so obviously it doesn't make or break a game.  Plus, this game makes you think about how to level your character and equip abilities, unlike many other MMOs.  The number of combinations of active and passive abilities is huge and gives you so many possibilities. "

												Alrighty, The Secret World is handsdown the most enjoyable RPGMMO I have played, It's a gritty modern day Horror type, Which is great if you are after a break from the fantasy happy worlds most other RPGMMO's offer. The combat regardless of being hotkeyed is fluent and fun! Collectables? Well you've got tons of lore lying around for collection which also offers a deeper insight into the Backstory of anything the game has to offers Ranging from certain towns to mysterious fog. How many hours will I get out of this you ask. Well with the help from people who had already cleared and made notes on the first town, I managed to get through with 20+ Hours Just doing the starting quests. The second town offers a massive amount of new enemies Including Succubi, I mean what's not to love. In short, BUY THIS GAME!See you soon Space Cowboy.			"

												Surprisingly a good game! A hidden little treasure. The questing can be a little confusing due to players not having levels. So you may find yourself beginning quests that are too difficult. But once you find the right area to quest in it goes rather smoothly. I do enjoy the fact that the game sometimes encourages players to do research outside the game to complete quests. I also like how open the skill tree is and how each player can have a unique set of abilities. The voice acting is phenomenal, the music is addicting, and the ability animations are fun and exciting. The in-game store items do not seem too game changing so there’s really no worrying about rich players having OP characters. It’s definitely better than many free-to-play mmo's out there and even better than some pay-to-play games. I bought the game when steam had it on sale and am so glad I did. Just wish I would have gotten a few more copies for skeptical friends because I believe once you give it a try you will enjoy it.			"

												I have waited for an MMO like this for a while. I played Everquest back in the day, and of course WoW, but they all ended up boring me to tears. Even City of Heroes and Champions lost their luster quickly as the ""get a sandwich gaming"" style started to wear on.Don't get me wrong, TSW still has its grinds, but it has enough stuff that you don't find in most MMOs that you can ignore the grinds. There are investigation missions where you have to figure out the clues for yourself. The game doesn't always hold your hand. There is even a little 3D platforming in there. While you can find yourself in a ""gather 10 wolf pelts"" mission, you may also find yourself trying to inch through booby traps while a crazed survivalist watches from the shadows.I can't say enough good things about the skill system. Not having to follow a class and only chose that class' powers? Magical. Sure, it could have been expanded (and a stealth tree would have been amazing), but it's still nice that you can focus on guns and swords, and then suddenly switch to fists if you want to. Also, the customizable clothing options are hard to beat. Sure, it's like dressing up dolls, but I just don't care. You can dress your character any way you like, and then strut down the street as if the BeeGees are playing. It's a great idea. There are a few clothing options I hope they'll add later, but that would mean YOU playing this game. My buddy summed it up best: ""This game has style.""			"

												the secret world or, tsw as it is known by its ever growing fan base, is a free to play open world rpg adventure game. I looked into this when i got tired of fps games, and endeavored to find something different to indulge my minds ever yearning need to be placated. no easy task i can assure you, but tsw hits the mark, it has a story line which will take you from the gloomy rural outskirts of kingston town all the way to the frozen warewolf ridden hell of transilvania, along the way you will run through, tombs, deserts, hidden tree fortresses, grave yards, and encampments of npcs ready to guide you on your way as you journey through the vast and diverse landscape that is the secret world. the story line itself is complex, and if you fail to watch part of it you will find yourself wondering what is going on throughout the rest of the game, but then half the fun of this game is that you do actually learn from it, and its maturity level is fairly high, unless you have an iq of 140 and consider yourself to be ""quite the historian"" or your primary place of residence is in a library i doubt that you will get all of the obscure historical references left by the game on hand, and will more than likely have to do a bit of light reading before it all starts to take form. to be fair, I think i learned more from this game about ancient european history and folklore than i did in school. you will also find that unless you have that knowledge you will probably be looking up solutions to quests online quite frequently, i know very few people that can speak all the languages that you would need to know to even begin to fathom what the quest is asking you to do. but that doesnt really work against it, the game has a built in browser for exactly that purpose, which has been adjusted to provide search results that will only give you a clue as to the answer and not give the entire game away.they have obviously put alot of thought into it, and i liked that it took me a whole year to level up just to complete the main ability tree, it keeps you focused and goal oriented for a long time, even after you have finished the main story line, there are sub stories and seasonal stories constantly being released, plenty of which are free to play. id look into this one if you like adventure games, or rpgs, or massive online multiplayer games, and also enjoy an intellectual challenge, this might have what your looking for.

												I have played through much of the starting area and I have to say that it is one of the most innovative MMMOs I have ever played. It is uniquely story-driven compared to many other MMOs that have story elements tacked onto fighting in order to level up. Of course, with any MMO one aspect is to see your character advance. The Secret World is no different but FunCom has somehow removed the grinding elements. You can learn any skill and max it out if you wish—so there's very little sense that you can ever screw up and select an ""unworkable build"". Instead, you take the abilities you've learn and configure them so that they work well together. No re-spec is necessary. Gear is important, but not absolute, and its readily available.If you're the sort of person that ""wants to love their MMO"" but somehow just quits without ever going very far, this may be the game for you. Now that it is subscription free like Guild Wars 2, playing is a one time investment. There is a real world store but it sells consumables and cosmetics which are unnecessary. There are even ways within the game to get new outfits without spending any real world cash.If this goes on sale at Steam, I heartily reccomend it.			"

												This game is AWESOME! It's quite emmersive. There are 3 types of quests. Main quests, side quests, and small quests. Main quests and side quests consist 3 types of quests, Action quest (the usual fighting stuff except most of the time you have good reason to do it), Sabatoge quests (these are inflitrating something, usually an underground hideout, or some sort of enemy related building, and well.... you sabatoge it with various things to do), and Investigation missions (these are what seperates the secret world from everything else. Basically it's an ARG where you have to find clues, solve puzzles, and investigate things both in and out of the game with reasearch via google and books). Small quests are just small things like go from point A to point B and do something or fight these monsters. The more generic quests. And every quest besides small quests have a fully voiced cinematic cut scene. Combat is very free and open. The only downside that's preventing me from playing right now is that I don't have anyone friends who play it and the game is significantly better with friends. #4EverAlone :(			"

TSW is a magnificent adventure to be had, but truth be told, some of the puzzles are insinely overcomplicated... and thats where playing with friends really makes this title shine.

												Hey all !Just want to put few words in here about this tittle. I have been playing MMORPG for over a decade now. Seen better and worst many times before. The secret world is definitely worth your attention if: you like horror climate in games, if you like freedom from start of the game, if you likke innovative ways to build and progress your character, if you dont mind progressing through most of the game on your own and dont mind spending lots of time looking for groups. Then this game is a perfect choice. Myself however i had a large issue with lack of group runs on the low level, i dont mean QL1 or 2 here i mean QL5 and above. Sadly there is no groups for new players, yes the Sanctuary chat is friendly and full of people but none of them is willing to do group runs below QL10 cause they dont get anything out of it. The facebook page is almost dead and apart from devs putting up the news there the response is very very little. Seem that the game is largely populated by high level players who dont bother with newbies. No LFG tool also does not help in this type of game as fresh players have no way to learn their class in group. Personally i think this takes a lot of good out of this game. MMORPG is all about teaming up with people and overcoming obstacle in groups and i am sad to say but you will not see this in here untill you waaaaay deep into the game and bored of feeling that you play another single player rpg.Iam recommending this game as a good game on its own but not for hard fans of team work.

												Currently at Savage Coast.This game has a lot of mixed reviews, and for good reasons.I bought this game last year (I think) and it's sat uninstalled since the first time I played it. At the time, I couldn't figure out what I was doing because I was focussed on other stuff and couldn't be bothered trying to get into something new (my own fault, obviously).But anyway! Installed it recently again and I've got to say it's excellent in some ways. The story and overall concept is absolutely brilliant, I love it. Modern setting in a good looking environment and plenty of cool places for roleplaying. Unlike most MMORPGs (including Champions Online, which is a favourite), the questing doesn't feel linear at all. I haven't had two quests that have felt the same, and I've completed more than I can count. The combat is great fun aswell, though I would prefer it if this game was gamepad compatible. Still, other than that, no complaints really. Questing gets tough though, and you have to pick your upgrades carefully or you'll not enjoy your time. Playing with another person (preferably someone you know, who is an active player) is insanely good fun!The character customisation is great, appearance you might find a little limited. But then again, I say that after playing Champions Online which is simply insane when it comes to your character's appearance choices. Speaking of CO, this game is pretty much Free Form the whole way through. You're not stuck to any particular tree of abilities, and you can even (if you have the patience) keep going until you get enough skill/ability to points to unlock ALL the powers *insert raised torch* and alter your build however you please. It's pretty endless, and there seems to be new content every year which is really cool.The environments themselves look great, from London to Egypt this game offers some great adventure. The enemies are well designed and sometimes things get pretty spooky...also BIG THUMBS UP FOR VOICE ACTING!The loading times are...horrific, at least for me. Just logging in takes longer than you'd think necessary, and then switching from Agartha (probably didn't spell that properly!) to London is equally as irritating. Updates aswell...despite being able to get 1.9mb/s on Steam, the game launcher gives me an average of below 1mb/s and just goes up and down seemingly without end.Weapons/Talismens seem scarse. I've completed a lot of quests and so far only received one weapon (that I actually use with my powers). However, I found the auction house to be very helpful and the rare weapons you buy with tokens from completing quests in specific areas give you a great punch! The community has to be one of the best I've come across. Very helpful, there's always someone around to help out. The RP community is very good aswell, the TSWRP addon from Curse makes it very comfortable to create a character. The lore also is very clear so there's not much confusion to be found.Consumables are suprisingly fun, SMOKING A CIGAR HEALS YOU IN THIS GAME. Also, they're cheap (in the Horned God bar) which makes it handy for characters who want to have a shmok'! Great game for Roleplayers, great game for PVPers, great game overall with just a few flaws that can be overlooked with ease. Also, anyone calling this game ""pay to win"" has either not played the game at all or have some other reason to moan about a problem that doesn't exist in this game.8/10, may seem a bit of a high score considering the flaws but in this case the benefit SERIOUSLY outweighs the cost.

I looked into this when i got tired of fps games, and endeavored to find something different to indulge my minds ever yearning need to be placated. no easy task i can assure you, but tsw hits the mark, it has a story line which will take you from the gloomy rural outskirts of kingston town all the way to the frozen warewolf ridden hell of transilvania, along the way you will run through, tombs, deserts, hidden tree fortresses, grave yards, and encampments of npcs ready to guide you on your way as you journey through the vast and diverse landscape that is the secret world. the story line itself is complex, and if you fail to watch part of it you will find yourself wondering what is going on throughout the rest of the game, but then half the fun of this game is that you do actually learn from it, and its maturity level is fairly high, unless you have an iq of 140 and consider yourself to be ""quite the historian"" or your primary place of residence is in a library i doubt that you will get all of the obscure historical references left by the game on hand, and will more than likely have to do a bit of light reading before it all starts to take form. to be fair, I think i learned more from this game about ancient european history and folklore than i did in school. you will also find that unless you have that knowledge you will probably be looking up solutions to quests online quite frequently, i know very few people that can speak all the languages that you would need to know to even begin to fathom what the quest is asking you to do. but that doesnt really work against it, the game has a built in browser for exactly that purpose, which has been adjusted to provide search results that will only give you a clue as to the answer and not give the entire game away.they have obviously put alot of thought into it, and i liked that it took me a whole year to level up just to complete the main ability tree, it keeps you focused and goal oriented for a long time, even after you have finished the main story line, there are sub stories and seasonal stories constantly being released, plenty of which are free to play. id look into this one if you like adventure games, or rpgs, or massive online multiplayer games, and also enjoy an intellectual challenge, this might have what your looking for.

												Good game. Once you get used to the controls, and unlike other MMO's you don't have to stand still during fights, it's pretty fun. The missions are fun and not just ""Run kill 5 of these and return"". They even have Investigative missions, where there isn't much combat, but alot of puzzles. Which they added an ingame Brouser to do research with. All in all, good game. I'd give it 4 outta 5 stars!			"

												Hey all !Just want to put few words in here about this tittle. I have been playing MMORPG for over a decade now. Seen better and worst many times before. The secret world is definitely worth your attention if: you like horror climate in games, if you like freedom from start of the game, if you likke innovative ways to build and progress your character, if you dont mind progressing through most of the game on your own and dont mind spending lots of time looking for groups. Then this game is a perfect choice. Myself however i had a large issue with lack of group runs on the low level, i dont mean QL1 or 2 here i mean QL5 and above. Sadly there is no groups for new players, yes the Sanctuary chat is friendly and full of people but none of them is willing to do group runs below QL10 cause they dont get anything out of it. The facebook page is almost dead and apart from devs putting up the news there the response is very very little. Seem that the game is largely populated by high level players who dont bother with newbies. No LFG tool also does not help in this type of game as fresh players have no way to learn their class in group. Personally i think this takes a lot of good out of this game. MMORPG is all about teaming up with people and overcoming obstacle in groups and i am sad to say but you will not see this in here untill you waaaaay deep into the game and bored of feeling that you play another single player rpg.Iam recommending this game as a good game on its own but not for hard fans of team work.

												Currently at Savage Coast.This game has a lot of mixed reviews, and for good reasons.I bought this game last year (I think) and it's sat uninstalled since the first time I played it. At the time, I couldn't figure out what I was doing because I was focussed on other stuff and couldn't be bothered trying to get into something new (my own fault, obviously).But anyway! Installed it recently again and I've got to say it's excellent in some ways. The story and overall concept is absolutely brilliant, I love it. Modern setting in a good looking environment and plenty of cool places for roleplaying. Unlike most MMORPGs (including Champions Online, which is a favourite), the questing doesn't feel linear at all. I haven't had two quests that have felt the same, and I've completed more than I can count. The combat is great fun aswell, though I would prefer it if this game was gamepad compatible. Still, other than that, no complaints really. Questing gets tough though, and you have to pick your upgrades carefully or you'll not enjoy your time. Playing with another person (preferably someone you know, who is an active player) is insanely good fun!The character customisation is great, appearance you might find a little limited. But then again, I say that after playing Champions Online which is simply insane when it comes to your character's appearance choices. Speaking of CO, this game is pretty much Free Form the whole way through. You're not stuck to any particular tree of abilities, and you can even (if you have the patience) keep going until you get enough skill/ability to points to unlock ALL the powers *insert raised torch* and alter your build however you please. It's pretty endless, and there seems to be new content every year which is really cool.The environments themselves look great, from London to Egypt this game offers some great adventure. The enemies are well designed and sometimes things get pretty spooky...also BIG THUMBS UP FOR VOICE ACTING!The loading times are...horrific, at least for me. Just logging in takes longer than you'd think necessary, and then switching from Agartha (probably didn't spell that properly!) to London is equally as irritating. Updates aswell...despite being able to get 1.9mb/s on Steam, the game launcher gives me an average of below 1mb/s and just goes up and down seemingly without end.Weapons/Talismens seem scarse. I've completed a lot of quests and so far only received one weapon (that I actually use with my powers). However, I found the auction house to be very helpful and the rare weapons you buy with tokens from completing quests in specific areas give you a great punch! The community has to be one of the best I've come across. Very helpful, there's always someone around to help out. The RP community is very good aswell, the TSWRP addon from Curse makes it very comfortable to create a character. The lore also is very clear so there's not much confusion to be found.Consumables are suprisingly fun, SMOKING A CIGAR HEALS YOU IN THIS GAME. Also, they're cheap (in the Horned God bar) which makes it handy for characters who want to have a shmok'! Great game for Roleplayers, great game for PVPers, great game overall with just a few flaws that can be overlooked with ease. Also, anyone calling this game ""pay to win"" has either not played the game at all or have some other reason to moan about a problem that doesn't exist in this game.8/10, may seem a bit of a high score considering the flaws but in this case the benefit SERIOUSLY outweighs the cost.

												I barely hit the minimum requirements. Even on the lowest settings, the graphics are better than Skyrim or Fallout. Gameplay's great. Ingame shop has cool and conveneinet stuff, but nothing you really need, which should be the point of an Item Shop. Membership gives you some pretty cool perks, but similarly, nothing you really need. Which should be the point.Overall, best fantasy MMO I've ever played. Plenty of new stuff regularly. Lots of thought went into this and it shows.			"

Review - some tips for upgrading at the endI am an MMO Snob.   What does this mean?   I love the idea of MMOs and have loved the idea since it first was given a name (I beta tested Ultima Online).    However, I am really picky about game play and the vast majority of MMOs because of how the stories and quests are laid out I believe I would prefer as single player.   Like I said a snob.The Secret WorldIs an exception for me.   It uses similar MMO mechanics, but the way the story is laid out and the reasoning behind why there are many of people running around just works for me in this MMO.   Also it has a one of a kind atmosphere and story.   If you are a fan of Horror, Urban Fantasy, Conspiracy Theories, Urban Legends, and the Supernatural then this MMO has all of that.   There is no other game out there (including single player) that quite catches this atmosphere.   I'd love to play some of those if they existed.This MMO can be played solo for the most part, or with a group.   There are some side DUNGEONS that you need to group up to play (they are cool) but, they are optional.The game has basically three varieties of quests.   It has your standard quests you'd expect from MMOs with killing something, fetching something, delivering something , etc.It has sneaky quests where the goal is to destroy or sneak around.It has these puzzle quests... and yes they are TOUGH and intended to be so.   Many of them you couldn't solve on your own unless you happened to be a genius biblical scholar.   However, the game has a browser built in or you can even launch a browser outside of the game.   It is intended that you use web pages and such to help you solve these puzzles.   They are COOL.   I doubt anyone could solve them all without searching the web.   There are also numerous sites offering walk throughs that are helpful in this.   You can pound at them and try to solve them and then when you start to get frustrated enough you are thinking about stopping go hit a walk thru and continue on, or you can use the Walkthroughs to power through these quests and still experience the story and vicariously feel as though you solved them.   It leaves this to the player's choice, so they work well.They recently updated the game so special currency you could only earn through PvP you can get just playing the game in general.   This is used to purchase nifty special items.If you hate MMO mechanics that might wear on you like it does for me.If the atmosphere and story appeal to you though you may find that it is easy to overlook that like it is for me.UPGRADING EXISTING ACCOUNTSOnce you purchase this you'll get a new steam key.I get the key by going to LIBRARY then GAMES then Right click on The Secret World and click View CD Keys.   Click on the ulitmate edition.   Click copy to clipboard.   Go to the Secret World website and login to your account.   In the lower left corner is a KEY REGISTRATION area... put this key there and click register... then scroll to the bottom of the page again and tell it GO to apply it to your account... then scroll to the bottom again and click CONFIRM.   You can then purchase any of this stuff for 0 in the in game store.My older ReviewThe mechanics in this game are not anything earth shattering.   If I were basing this review on that alone this would get a downvote from me.   However, it has a very cool atmosphere, and a great story.   It is unique from that perspective and in my opinion is worth the price of entry just to enjoy some of the environments and stories.			"

												If I don't keep this short and sweet, I'll just ramble for days, so I'll say this:The Secret World is great if you're looking for something you're not used to. Yes, the combat is a little tab-targety, but the combo system and ability synergy gives it a fresh coat of paint, and let's be honest, we're really just here for the immersion and amazing questing. That's right; the questing is the standout point of this game. You meet new characters, get involved with their plights, and are often forced to think outside of the box to complete quests. This brings about a certain world-building not exactly present in a lot of MMOs.On top of this, the setting is world-class dark. Think the Illuminati meets Lovecraft. Really helps if you have a taste for dark, mature themes (not to say that you can't, but seeing as there's not a huge market for mature MMOs, this one scratches a rare itch). The music is really grand as well and helps immerse me even further.The group content is a lot of fun and there seems to be a lot of WoW-raid level mechanics in just the small group dungeons. This helps keep things interesting while you're grinding through looking for loot.In summation, this is a game you should get if you're really ready to invest in the universe. You don't have to dedicate hours upon hours every night trying to gear up like most MMOs; you can go at your own pace (though, you're likely to get sucked in and spend hours playing this anyway). I'd say treat it like an online singleplayer experience (a lot of the questing is encouraged to be done solo) with solid group content added as a bonus. This way, you can hop in, get your dark fantasy mythos fix, then hop in some dungeons with a few friends, then log out for the night. Overall, it's a really fulfilling experience. Hands down one of the coolest MMOs I've played. I've been a huge fan of WoW (during the Wrath days) and Guild Wars 1 and 2, then a little bit of DCUO. Currently, The Secret World is the only one that I find myself logging in to from time to time and still loving to the core (and I haven't even gotten to a majority of the DLC content).Oh, and it's free to continue playing after you buy it, so why not pick it up on a sale? Of course, membership sub comes with some pretty nice perks, but the game is more than playable without a sub (I'd say more so without a sub than most MMOs these days).Give the game a shot. My opinion might be biased because I dig MMOs and I am a sucker for what Funcom is selling here (that is, an dark, immersive universe filled with conspiracy and monsters), but I think it's definitely worth a shot. Website should have a trial for those afraid to take the plunge. Good luck!			"

												What i can say for now - Not a bad game. Combat system is crap, to be honest. Character customization is good from one side, but bad from other. Few faces to choose, few eyebrows, few lips and noses. Few skin colors and they are bad.Each face has its own preset colors. For example, face No1 can have white man skin color, but face No2 can have light brown as lightest color. No racism intended =).With clothing it is much better. You can wear T-shirt and vest above it.Two combat styles for character, your choice. Pistols, sword, chaos magic etc. Combine as you like.Best thing about this game is plot. How many MMO`s with plot you know?  Star Wars the Old Republic maybe? This game has voiced dialogues. It can be played alone and that is good. You don`t need to wait for group.			"

												I love The Secret World.  The storyline woven throughout the game is compelling. The environment is submersive, and the music adds to that quality. The missions were well thought and cohesive, and kept me anxious to learn what happens next. I love the way you can customize your game play to suit your style of play. There is so much content and so many things to do...work on achievements, crafting, lore, unique dungeons and raids. The game also has a sense of humor. Some of the NPCs are really funny. I highly recommend this game.			"

												If I don't keep this short and sweet, I'll just ramble for days, so I'll say this:The Secret World is great if you're looking for something you're not used to. Yes, the combat is a little tab-targety, but the combo system and ability synergy gives it a fresh coat of paint, and let's be honest, we're really just here for the immersion and amazing questing. That's right; the questing is the standout point of this game. You meet new characters, get involved with their plights, and are often forced to think outside of the box to complete quests. This brings about a certain world-building not exactly present in a lot of MMOs.On top of this, the setting is world-class dark. Think the Illuminati meets Lovecraft. Really helps if you have a taste for dark, mature themes (not to say that you can't, but seeing as there's not a huge market for mature MMOs, this one scratches a rare itch). The music is really grand as well and helps immerse me even further.The group content is a lot of fun and there seems to be a lot of WoW-raid level mechanics in just the small group dungeons. This helps keep things interesting while you're grinding through looking for loot.In summation, this is a game you should get if you're really ready to invest in the universe. You don't have to dedicate hours upon hours every night trying to gear up like most MMOs; you can go at your own pace (though, you're likely to get sucked in and spend hours playing this anyway). I'd say treat it like an online singleplayer experience (a lot of the questing is encouraged to be done solo) with solid group content added as a bonus. This way, you can hop in, get your dark fantasy mythos fix, then hop in some dungeons with a few friends, then log out for the night. Overall, it's a really fulfilling experience. Hands down one of the coolest MMOs I've played. I've been a huge fan of WoW (during the Wrath days) and Guild Wars 1 and 2, then a little bit of DCUO. Currently, The Secret World is the only one that I find myself logging in to from time to time and still loving to the core (and I haven't even gotten to a majority of the DLC content).Oh, and it's free to continue playing after you buy it, so why not pick it up on a sale? Of course, membership sub comes with some pretty nice perks, but the game is more than playable without a sub (I'd say more so without a sub than most MMOs these days).Give the game a shot. My opinion might be biased because I dig MMOs and I am a sucker for what Funcom is selling here (that is, an dark, immersive universe filled with conspiracy and monsters), but I think it's definitely worth a shot. Website should have a trial for those afraid to take the plunge. Good luck!			"

												Are you tired of constantly seeing the phrase ""Illuminati Confirmed""?Well tough luck --> the Illuminati are CONFIRMED and you can either do or get done.On a side and far less relevant note The Secret World (from now on TSW) Is a Buy to Play MMORPGFPSRTS xD You buy this game once and all of the vanilla content and some of the expansions (i think 1-5) are in your playing reach. If you want the full experience and if you want to show off some style, be it with pets, clothes, emotes or dances, be prepared to fork out some more cash for the rest of the expansions (Issue 12 has already been announced).The gameplay however is freaking amah-zing! You start off as a loser who swallows a bee (yeah what an idiot right?) WRONG! You suddenly get super/magical powers and one of the three conspiracy factions shows upandtells you they want you to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up on their behalf.So now you either get a gun, a bashy or slicy stick or a magical trinket that makes you poop fairy dust (oh and charr enemies with your freaking eyes).So get up kiddies and swallow a bee :D (don't. Just don't.) And join us in the magical adventures that TSW has to offer. Believe me the storytelling in this game is so off the freaking charts that you'll sink hundreds of hours into the game before you realise you lost your job and your wife left you. Don't get me wrong this is not a hating review, I'm addicted to this game like noone else.Oh and a GIANTass plus for this game is that EVERY single main and story mission has FULLY VOICED CUTSCENES and i'm not talking about people that just phoned in their voices, no im talking about pain staking voiceacting for EVERY single character you meet. And the characters even have personality! (Suck it WOW) And this isn't just another fetch me this and that grind game, no one mission ends where another begins, usually interconnected with (again) FULLY VOICED CUTSCENES :D so it feels like a really organic experience :3It's also set in a modern day setting where monsters decided to ruin everyones day and started ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥up...But who cares!

												The Secret World is one of best Single Player MMORPGs that I have ever played. There's story missions and lore everywhere you look. The story of the Secret World isn't necessarily unique but it is told in a way that entertains and keeps your interest.I originally started playing in 2012 and the game was clunky and buggy. It has improved greatly in the past few years. Most of the content they added in the form of issues is worth doing. The content isn't just tacked on at the end, quest givers throughout the game recieve the new missions.The Ultimate Edition, containing issues 1-11, is on sale many times throughout the year. There's also a Complete Edition available from Funcom which contains all of the issues. This is usually on sale around October 31st.			"

												The Secret World is a SUPER fun mmo, that has hardly any attention and should be better recognized. The questing system is really good and not boring at all unlike most mmo's which consist of solely fetch quests and the like, you actually feel a sense of accomplishment when completing puzzles, challenges, and missions, not to mention the cool ""class"" system. The game has no set classes so basically whatever kind of weapon you want to use is what you will use and then you will rank up the skills of the weapon. You can use 2 weapons at a time to make your own hybrid set up. Want to combine an AR with magic? You can do that, lots of choice and freedom. Plus its an mmo that is isn't pay to win and doesn't require a monthly sub to play. The game does have a cash shop, but you can only buy cosmetics and unique mounts and clothing in it. No P2W items available. There are also world bosses, dungeons, raids, and a good pvp system in place. All in all The Secret World is a great mmo and needs more time in the spotlight!			"

												(Don't let my playtime fool you, I've only spent about 8-10 real hours playing.)I've just recently gotten back into this game after a long hiatus and I've never really examined an mmo in such a way as I have with this one. I guess I'll just start: 1. The game definitely scores well when asked about its battle system and variety. There are plenty of skills to mix and match to create a versatile and powerful character. 2. Time = Success. Like most games, the only way you'll prosper is by spending time in the game and really cracking down on how you build your character.3. EXPLORATION/MYSTERY. It may seem trivial as I continue to explain this, but this game has a special component that makes it stand out when compared to other MMOs. Mystery Solving. Although some aren't very difficult to piece together, it takes a bit more effort than just simply reaching a destination to complete a quest. You must closely examine objects you receive during quests to complete certain puzzles correctly. ----------A short but sweet review. I am still actively playing this and I will change my review as I further experience the game.			"

Very unique game for folks not looking to grind out pick-up and deliver quests and raid group instances all the time. Very much enjoy this game and I hope the devs find a way out of their financial troubles as this game deserves even more support.Well worth checking out.M13			"

												Tired of the same hand-holding quest system used in a majority of MMOs today?Want something different from the same old fantasy world?For the past four years, The Secret World has managed to be (to my knowledge) the only MMO in a modern-day setting filled with lore and a quest system that isn't afraid to assume you're able to solve riddles requiring the use of bibles and musician names.While Steam has good sales on the base game and Ultimate Editions, you'll usually get the most bang for your buck with the Complete Edition on the official Funcom site when they have sales (like Halloween, for example).

The questing system is different and requires a little getting used to because the lore requires you to piece the story together.

The horror atmosphere is great and the game has 8 large zones that are incredibly varied and range from spooky New England towns through parched desert landscapes in Egypt, vampire infested Transylvania, and finally to Tokyo after an apocalyptic infection.It has a large variety of missions, some with very interesting stories - one big stand out for me was an issue in Egypt that included a section on a train. It felt like being in an Indiana Jones movie.As a rule the community is quite supportive and there is still a stream of new players joining. The server system is such that the population in zones is controlled so it never feels crowded.			"

												Thought it would be cool to play an RPG where you don't have the usual MOBs and environment as most of them out there.  But after a while, I started getting bored. I did not have any fun factor in it. Felt more like a do this, do that, grind this, grind that.  I might get back to it one day.  But if you want something different, then yes I recommend it.			"

												hi, i know i dont have more than 10hrs in this game, from the time i've bought it: mid 2013my friend wanted someone to play this game with, so there i was waiting for the 50gig goodness that is a mmo game.i joined a faction that he wasnt in....so i just deceided to just do a few missions & such.a light novel story short, i got stuck on a thing that wanted me to ""research"" on a individual's fav band, i guessed all the good ones i personally know, this was for a password on a computer thing with info on stuff.i spent 3hrs. three....hours. on that one quest. i didn't findout the passwerd, then quit the game entirely.so, why was this format, for this quest a thing? the only reasons why people still play wow today is the raidz & stuf i dont really know why they still play it.i'm only doing this review because i wanted to make a few points.1. idk, maybe make hints for quests(i dont really like having to know some irl dude's fav boy band, just to complete a quest)2. i didn't acutally play world of warcraft....like never thought about playing it3. i just wasted 3hrs on that one quest, i did try to do stuffz on researching the dude i had to know every single thing there is to know about him but...i dont care4. iz jus geam.5. i like simple things, E.D.F. is a simple game, buy that instead6. i wasted 2hrs writing this review(dont take this review for cerial ) like i did spent 3hrs on a quest i didn't want to do research on, that much is true)7. i did just quit this game after that one quest, if there is more quests like this, then i have my own opinion/right to say; ""i quit""(dont take this next comment to the heart)10/10 - was triggered via remembering darker times of my life.buy the game, bring a friend(thats not dead)			"

There is so much story content it completely and utterly blots out any semblence of a plot. So get engaged and choose a path...because there are no levels. Only levels of reality.			"

												I have to say I really like this game. Having played multiple MMO's, what fascinates me about this one is it's simplicity. You don't need to spend years figuring out the best builds or the most successful mechanics. People who fancy the sophisticated stuff might dislike that, but I'm really into it.The atmosphere is pretty good (for an MMO at least), and different quest types like sabotage (sneaky-stuff) and investigation (use knowledge and research to solve complex riddles, some of them are really difficult, don't spoil them by cheating) increase the overall feel.Those of you familiar with the works of Lovecraft will find some resemblences in the game, something I'm highly enjoying (especially since I feel there's way too few Lovecraft-themed games out there).It might not have the larges community, the fanciest graphics or the most complex system, but this game has it's own elegance. In a certain way, it is truly unique.If you're looking for a simple, rather easy-to-learn MMO with a rather different setting than most, this one might just be right for you.			"

												Story rich, classless lvling system, great community and superbe ambiance.The game has some flaws, it suffers mostly from the different budget funded for each episodes with some clearly much better than others.That aside, the world is consistent and enjoyable, either by yourself or in group. The game designers nailed quite well the genra with the secret society and things hidden in plain sights.You will often be challenged to actually read/look for clues in your environment, there is also some puzzles that will take you time and knowlege to solve them, hence the in-game built browser.All in all, a great MMO with a good concept and even the first 4 free episodes are pentyful enough to want to get some more.The classless system is really refreshing too, you almost can't go wrong with whatever you decide to build. There are more optimum builds than others but if you follow the general guidelines you will be all fine.One thing I didn't really liked was the interraction with the secret society. You are a field agent but you hardly have any dealing with your group aside sending reports at the end of missions for rewards. Everything you need to learn is on field.I would have loved a bit more on that aspect but it is relatively minor concern of mine.			"

												tl;dr - Some will be turned away from the lack of convention; however, those who embrace it will be rewarded.Let me first get this out of the way: this game is not for everybody. If you want a typical, linear fantasy story; then, you are going to be very disappointed. The story of the game isn't one fluid narrative, it's the opposite. It tends to give you bits and pieces of what the storyline is as you complete quests, and you don't understand what or why you do things most of the time. Yet, that matters little in a game like this. As matter of fact, that might be the main attraction.The best part about Secret World is the apparent lack of convention. There are no classes, no levels to speak of. The level of freedom with constructing your character is quite refreshing from typical wizard/ warrior/ archer mmo's. If you make a mistake in your build or skill tree, you have the safeguard of knowing you can simply earn more SP or AP to fix your character. It's even possible to earn every skill from every weapon, and every ability from every weapon. As a matter of fact you are given a reward for doing so. The Secret World rewards players for thinking outside the box, I've never used Google to solve a quest up until I played this game. Become very comfortable with the idea that you'll be using search engines for trickier questions and riddles being asked in the game. However, there is an in-game web browser for your convenience, should you choose to use it.Yes there is grinding; but the number of content available and the variability between each quest never makes it feel like you're grinding. You can choose to rush your character to high faction ranking, or you can take your time and explore the game. The game often rewards you with achievements, lore, and some surprises if you choose to do so. This game has arguably one of the best mmo communities I've played in so far. Helpful veterans always help lower level players, and Cabals (the Secret World's version of guilds) are diverse in their members and goals, and players always seem to be working with each other to support other players who ask for help. Cabals can also hold a large number of members (I'm currently in one that has over 250 members).I bought this game on sale, and I am sad I didn't buy this sooner. However, even at full price this game is still a steal. I would definitely recommend it to those who are looking for something different and unconventional.			"

												I used to hate MMO before this game.PROs:It has everything a great MMO should have:- interesting story (plus I LOVE horror and dark stories in it).- amazing power costumization: you can literally have all the powers in the game and mixing them as you want.- it's challenging: if you are looking for an hard game to beat, this is your game!- awesome factions: you could be Dragon, Illuminati or Templar.CONs:Obviously it's not a flawless game- poor character personalization.- a bit ""rusty"" gameplay that you have to metabolise in order to truly enjoy this game.Best feature:Investigation missions are the real deal for me. They are a series of missions that you can beat just by using your intelligence, intuition and the in-game browser. As the whole game, these missions are a pretty hard challenge, but beating it without the wiki feel so awesome you'll get fast addicted.			"

												The Secret World is my first MMORPG and it really is a quality game. The horror atmosphere is great and the game has 8 large zones that are incredibly varied and range from spooky New England towns through parched desert landscapes in Egypt, vampire infested Transylvania, and finally to Tokyo after an apocalyptic infection.It has a large variety of missions, some with very interesting stories - one big stand out for me was an issue in Egypt that included a section on a train. It felt like being in an Indiana Jones movie.As a rule the community is quite supportive and there is still a stream of new players joining. The server system is such that the population in zones is controlled so it never feels crowded.			"

												TSW gives an interesting spin on the Fantasy genre by placing it in a modern setting rather than the classical Middle Ages theme.  It bares more resemblance to a Lovecraftian horror than a Tolkien work, dubbed by my friends ""Call of Cthulu; the video game"" (even if only few parts have sanity meter mechanics).Settings include a small town in New England overrun by undead, a city in Egypt fighting against a new uprising of one of its ancient foes, and a series of post-Soviet occupation Trannsylvanian towns besieged by vampires and werewolves.The foes run the gambit from classic design to compleately reimagined, whatever needed to fit into a modern setting.  Zombies in track suits, golems made of scrap metal, cultist in hoodies, and vampires covered in parkas and gas masks (to protect themselves from the sun, duh), scuttling wendigo, sloshing dragur, glowing will-o-wisps and more.Characters are distinct and memorable, with NPCs that will make you laugh audibly, cry physically, and moments that will make you go ""what the f###?!?""  Every one of my friends who have played this game have a favorite, and a least favorite, character.  Dialogue is well written, better than some TV shows.Quests vary between standard assult and dungeon missions that require slaying of hordes of mosters (or one big one), sabotage missions that require tact and subterfuge, and research missions that involve extensive out-of-game study.I cannot emphasise the awesomeness of research missions enough; they are incredible in-depth puzzles and can make you do anything from learn arabic to visit game-based websites on the real world internet to scribble notes about demon runes like a madman.  The lazy can simply Google search for a walkthrough, but those who enjoy mystery will have a blast connecting the dots.As a MMO RPG, it still suffers the stanard MMO RPG flaws; other players mercing your tagets before you can reach them, small pools of active players looking for group for the dungeon you want to run, nessicerey grinding to become strong enough to handle the next area, player characters in gaudy outfits providing jarring contrast to the scenery, the silent protagonist, and so on.  However, these flaws don't detract significantly rom the game.When all is said and down, I would recomend this game to any fan of modern fantasy.			"

Although I 've never encountered a bug that made me feel angry or frustruated.Skill bar has only 8 Slots . This is a huge Cons for me because there are tons of spells to use and only 8 slots . I would love if it had at least 12 slots . And thats it ... Basically the only complaint I have is the spell slots ... I ve never had a big problem with bugs , just wrote the bugs in CONS because I hear many people complainingThanks for reading			"

												The reviews present are largely for 'The Secret World.'  Funcom has relaunched the game with different mechanics.  'Secret World Legends' and 'The Secret World' are two different games.Sadly, I have been forced to provide a negative review, only because Secret World Legends has attempted to co-op The Secret World's reviews.While 'The Secret World is an amazing game with fabulous writing, 'Secret World Legends' is a separate game, and I can't in good faith give it a positive review.  Funcom produced an amazing title with 'The Secret World,' but I will not permit them to decieve potential buyers by simply switching titles.   I can't say enough good things about 'The Secret World,' but 'Secret World Legends' remains up in the air.  I would recommend waiting a time before committing to anything.			"

												I honestly can't play this game anymore.  I tried to give it a chance, it has a pretty interesting backstory to it, but the combat and movement mechanics are just unbearable.  The Movement is slow and klunky and the camera is always fixed.  I spent about 10 minutes reworking the keybindings to try and make the experience more comfortable, but there was still a lot to be desired.  Fighting is especially annoying because the mouse buttons cannot be rebound for attack purposes.  You can get guns, and there is even a way you can aim with a reticle, but trying to use movement keys while mashing another button to attack is just too annoying.			"

There was little intuition when using the UI, because it didn't seem to follow the regular formula. There was also an issue this text never displaying properly, and looked closer to some made up language than actual latin characters. The combat, while fairly well made, simply wasn't very appealing to me. Ultimatly this review is personal preference, but I feel that someone out there might appriciate it, so whatever.			"

												I have a problem.No, but really..I love this game for two main reasons: there is LOADS of buy2play-content and this content is SO freaking immersive.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ Graphics 8/10 (realistic to a degree, crisp and flashy) + Sound 9/10 (veeeery eery and atmospheric) + Gameplay 11/10 (LOTS to do, lots of different mission types, PvP and PvE, dungeons, scenarios and raids - overall great and helpful community)+ Replayability 10/10 (3 char slots[extendable] with 100s of hours to play, no pressure cuz there's no mandatory subscription fee - GREAT ""re-installing and getting back in the game after a while"" possbilities+ Buy2Play 9/10 (I have invested about 140€ by now - only for content, and I could play 1600hrs+ with this - compared to a subscription model, this just ROCKS) EDIT: Now, that the ""ultimate edition"" came out the price is just riddiculously low :P - 10/10 )+ Moddable 7/10 (lots of ""Curse"" mods to further enhance your style of play, but lots of integrated enhancements/settings as well)+ Clothing/Achievements/Titles/Pets 10/10 (there's LOTS of different clothing to get.. everyone can look different - also you'll get rewards for ingame achievements, like titles, pets and clothing!)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are downsides of course - which IMHO don't really matter. As long as you enjoy the game as it is, nothing to worry about.-----------------------------------------------------------------------  some people criticize the repetitive-ness of the missions and the need to farm/grind to get to the endgame - I myself don't think the game is too much of a grind (8 years WoW speaking here)- it is slightly underpopulated - especially when it's daytime in GMT+1- it is HIGHLY addictive - this should serve as a warning to those who get easily hooked and I mean it.There's just SO much to do, in a COOL environment set in reality. The mythical background stories are immersive as ♥♥♥♥ and you cannot help but notice that the clock somehow shows 10 hours later than when you've looked before :P-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Summary:Get this game, if you're into MMORPGs.Get this game, if you don't wanna spend too much money on a game.Get this game, if you enjoy secrets, mysteries, fantasy tales, conspiracy theories and more.Get this game for a healthy dose of humor, addiction, fantasy roleplay, slicing hoards of zombies, ocean creatures, vampires, mummies, werewolves, ghosts and dancing on the roots of Yggdrasil.Otherwise, ... well, why are you reading this review anyway ?

												Based in a modern world setting The Secret World is very unique and sets itself aside from all the other MMORPGs out there and that is a really good thing when the market is flooded by online games that are all very similar.  The Secret World is not for everybody though. While it is heavily story-driven there's a lot of puzzle solving to do and they're not always easy. One of the things I like the most about the game is the skill tree. Actually, it's not really a skill three but a skill circle, which means you can spend points in everything and make the most hybrid builds ever. Theres lots of possibilities and yes there is no particular ""winning builds"".If you want to discover the mysteries of our world and dig deep in the illuminati's secrets then this game is for you.

												This one is special. Its more of a story based RPG then an actual MMO while questing. And while there are things like dungeone, hard open areas (lairs) and monsters that hit like trucks, everything is managable solo with a little tweaking on your abilities and gear. Which is probably its biggest strenght (besides the obvious audio visual fidelity and the fantastic story). There are no classes to choose from, instead you have the ability wheel to spend points into while you gain experience. No levels either (though you can relie on your gear quality to be your bog standard mmo level equivalent). Everyone can become everything over time and you can swap your deck (your set of 7 active and passive skills you choose) whenever you like a change.Endgame, or the traditional mmo grindfest for gear, are the dungeons, which come in 3 flavours. Normal mode while leveling, Elite mode while entering the last three areas, and Nightmare mode for people that like serious challenge. There are some raids in there too, and as of issue 8 (the latest big dlc patch) the new scenario system. Which is basicly solo/group oriented defend objective gameplay with a little horde mode thrown into. They intend to release new modes for this one over time. Its a nice little change in playstyle if you dont want to grind dungeons for gear. And with the new augment system that came with it, a nice little incentive to play those scenarios to further increase your toons power.If you love a nice story and deep customisation for your toon, then this game wont dissapoint. Its not your ""wow-clone"" type of game like RIFT or that star wars one. This here is more mature (until you see all those half naked girls with chainsaws most people tend to play) in terms of content and style. This one is special.It has its fair share of annoyances though. Loading times are somewhat longer then usual, frames tend to drop when theres an open world event with 200 people cramping at the same spot trying to kill an big boss and sometimes the controls feel sluggish, and there really is not much in terms of pvp to brag about. 3 maps with each having a different mode, but nothing really special about it.Id recommend it in a heartbeat, especially if you like to quest alone to immerse yourself in the story of a mmorpg (or any other crpg)!

												The Secret World was definitely one the more interesting games I've played, it uses real world applications, history and incorporates it with the game. (Ex. using Google to search forum sites and read what ""other people"" have seen/heard) While the combat is extensive, it's still a little lackluster, the guns feeling especially boring to shoot, everything else seems to have it's charm though. The enemies have the standard, shoot here, dodge this from red telegraphing enemy, ect. ect. I do recommend it to anyone having a few friends cause it's hard(-ish) to solo but it is fun none the less. Character customization feels nice, it's finally nice to see a game where clothing is a bit extensive and LOOKS GOOD for once so you don't look like every other agent in your entire corporation. The only reason I stopped playing this was mostly because it did seem to get a little too grindy in some areas, and I'm usually not one to moan much about grinding XP and doing side missions in games, but good lord there were a LOT of side missions, all coming with a cutscene with nice voice acting. (That and the launcher seemed to have issues when starting up.) Overall, I'd say give the game a chance if you have some extra money, it's nothing too different from standard MMO formula but with an extremely immersive storyline and very challenging puzzle system. (God have mercy on your soul, should you choose to do the puzzles without a walkthrough)			"

												As a former WOW addict, I can definitively say that this game is not WOW.  That doesn't necessarily mean  it's bad.  In fact, it is a fairly good game and has a decent online community.  End game content is a little sparse and redundant, but that is not why I picked it up.  The content (occult based post-apocalyptic backdrop) and the voice acting are amazing.  The plot is interesting enough and the characters are enjoyable and often hilarious.  The gameplay mechanics, specifically the 7 and 7 skill deck setup, allow for a lot tweaking and keeps things fresh.  However, while the game is immediately addicting, it wears on you after awhile.  I found that stepping away for a few days, I had little to no desire to resume play.  Also, microtransactions...lots and lots of microtransactions.  Be prepared to spend way more money that you intended to on cool new outfits and various other game additions.  Overall it's a fun little light MMO.			"

However, the endgame game play isn't easy to break into, groups are unnecessarily elitist, leaving long queue times, and ultimately the reason I rarely play now. For the price,  0 - end game was well worth it.			"

												The Secret World [TSW] is an MMORPG that has a great Storyline. At least thats what i felt. =)Due to my lack of obedience to the publishers rules i unfortunately got banned.But nevertheless i can recommend this game to anyone that is looking for an  MMORPG in a mystery setting that even brings actually challenging riddles to solve.If you do not play for maximum progression you got a really big varienty of skill -and weaponcombinations to choose from and if you are the type who want's to minmax there is enough research material and guids or theory chrafters out there to give you the most efficient build for the things you are doing.

												Ill be honest, Im no fan of mmo's. But this one did catch my eye, content wise. It has more than any mmo Ive seen so far and thats worth. But for $30... it is not. I bought this game in high hopes paying for such amount was going to be worth. In my opinion it is not, for several reasons. Im not too great at reviewing, but I will say I am gonna try to get a refund.I reccomend this for the people with either no lives or love all MMOs. Youll love it then. Cons-1. Slow gameplay.2. Some levels of p2w but not much.3. lies about being a non-typical MMO4. there is classes, its the weapon types. Another lie.5. Boring solo, and you basically need a friend or 3 at times otherwise youll get lost in a puzzle or will have to grind for a whole 2 days to kill a enemy.6. $30 DOLLARS ? NAH. Id rate it a 20 max.  Theres more but I dont wanna bash a game too hard. And oh i can with this. But lets get on the good parts. Pros:1. Fantastic artwork in my opinion.2. skill tree is alright, better than most.3. The community is good, some will help you level, do quests, and go through dungeons. Mostle helpful. (Some will be trolling aswell.)4. Lots of content, like quite  a damn bit. They sure put work in that. 5. Easy and customizeable design of Hud and easy to use systems.6. If on sale for anything less than 30 dollars. GET IT. comes with free month membership which is how long youll play it.7. Some pretty hard quests and some that are new for any MMO. Like puzzles that you literally have to google details, become a detective, and wander far to figure out.Overall 6/10 for me not liking most MMOs, and a easy 8.5/10 for people who like them. "

												The Secret World or TSW is an excellent MMO produced by Funcom.For starters you can pick up most of the DLC and maingame for just $60 as part of the Ultimate Edition which is about as much as you would have payed for a AAA game without the DLC.Here is a good tip to those who do not know about the ""leveling"" process. Your character can learn every ability and skill in the game and can assign only up to 7 abilities on to two bars, one for actives the other for passive effects. You may be wondering what classes in the game there are, truth is their are none. You are only limited to the combination of weapons such as Pistol and Shotgun or Blood and Sword when it comes to how you play your character. So you might have messed up your build, don't worry, you can repeat any mission except the main storyline missions. As these will provide you with the necessary experience to gain ability points and skill points.Although the setting is modern day and it presents itself in a grim dark fantasy, the story and npcs are very meaningful and quiet human for how they deal with their situations.The most populated shard, according to my research, is Cereberus. I mention this as you may notice that the lower level zones are quiet empty so bringing a friend in is a welcome idea. Although when it comes to raiding and dungeons, don't fret as you can join parties across shards.The game is definetly my recommendation as its very well made for an MMO in today's market.			"

												First off 350 hrs spent and still not done!!! Love this game with the different aspects that it brings to traditional MMO's. There are so many different classes and skills sets that you can really change how you play the gmae to how you look. It's a small company that runs the game and a good group that still maintains the community. Which is friendly compared to others out there (DOTA-sneer) Have no shortage of content if you buy the memership for life which is steep but the content and story makes up for it. There is again no shortage of content or skill building inthis game. Is there a end game? Yes and brings more to the table. The lore and backstory to this game is one that everyone should read and playthrough at lest once. Again 350hrs and still playing. Just check it out before deciding to go full membership. (no subscriptions for full membership and FREE stuff to boot)			"

												i never really got to play cause steam gave me a bunk key to the game i jumped thru all there loops and sense a lot of the replies from suport were a different person they statments kind of cortidicted eachother so not vary personable suport obviously. looks like a good game but i spent all day trying to get it runing and no one knows what to do. but steam has been contracting a lot of low trashy games latlly so it doesnt suprize me. im not even going to try to ask for a refund cause times are hard and integrity is low, and they will try to put blame on someone ells and not pay me back most likely and i dont want to deal with it either. idc it was just 12 bucks big deal at least it wasnt 50$ thats like water bill bro. f all that.. there games may be cool but ill never no so i would have to give it a thumbs up i hope you get screwed over too..

												A MMO that strives to differ itself from the rest by offering innvoative puzzles that are interesting and actually requires brainwork.  It has an interesting real world setting, as well as a freeform combat system which encourages the player to mix and match skills to create their own unique styles.At the end of the day it still plays a lot like a traditional MMO, but with no subscription fees it is definitely worth checking out if you have any interest in the occult or in MMOs at all.

												If the game is on sale like it is now for $9.. I'd say this game is worth it. The story is a little confusing but you can tell they put there very best into it. The combat is just like any other MMORPG except for the class choices which are diverse and interesting. I would have to disagree with buying this game for the price of $30... it just seems like too much (especially if the DLC are priced at $5-$25 each) The game is different and that's what i find enjoyable about it.WARNING: If you are thinking about getting a refund and meet the limit of being under 2 hours to get a refund, know this. Even when the game is closed, it runs an app relating to the game in the backround. This causes steam to believe that the game is still open when it is not. Your hours WILL go up and you may go over the 2 hour limit. This is what happened to me and why i have 15 hours at this moment. (I should really have 3-4 hours but the little backround app was running while i was away and increased my hours causing me to not be able to get a refund... although this may just be my problem, always check that steam doesn't say your still in game once you have closed it.)Also, Team dragon :P			"

												It's an MMO. If you don't like MMOs, just pass on this. The characters are surprisingly good for an MMO, but that agonizingly slow slog through the ""gameplay"" keeps the player from actually getting to see anything fun or interesting. It's standard MMO fare. The settings are different, but all these damed MMOs seem to be the same. Piles of players run around, killing crap while you kill your own crap, you get a quest that sounds interested but amounts to killing X # of zombies and getting X # of items from their corpses, wash, rinse, repeat. I was a fool for buying this and thinking it would be any different from other MMOs aside from the setting. Save yourself time and money. There are so many better games out there. This is not even the least bit enjoyable. I wouldn't even recommend it if it were free to play unless you already love MMOs in general.			"

												This is a very underrated MMOG it  is beautifully done and not your run of the mill typical elves and orcs mmog either. The game has a modern setting which is refreshing to say the least and also there are no levels. This is not the type of game you play and worry about grinding to catch up with the vetern player base. I  seriously recommend buying this game if you are looking for a change of pase from all the other MMOG's out there.			"

												Вам надоели типичные ВоВ и Линейка?Хотите увидить что-то интерестное и новое в mmorpg?Тогда Вам в The secret world.Действие разворачивается в современном мире,это один из самых важных моментов.Представьте, что каждый миф, каждая теория заговора и каждая городская легенда – правда. Вообразите реальность, в которой вампиры охотятся на живых людей в модных лондонских клубах, где в канализации под Сеулом рыскают оборотни, а в темных закоулках Нью-Йорка обитает нежить. Таков мир многопользовательской ролевой онлайновой игры The Secret World, разрабатываемой компанией Funcom.Вообразите мир где вы можете стать тем, кем вы мечтаете, мир где нет таких ограничений как классы персонажей и уровни.Представьте себе мир, где правительства стран незримо управляются кардиналами из секретных сообществ. В игре The Secret World вы сможете приобщиться к их тайнам. Иллюминати, Драконы и Темплары – каждое общество отстаивает свои интересы и ведет войну с надвигающейся тьмой. В зависимости от того к какому секретному сообществу вы решите присоединиться, ваш игровой персонаж и все ваши впечатления и события в игре будут полностью изменены.ОСОБЕННОСТИ !  ○Ни классов, ни уровней – только полная свобода. В The Secret World нет ни классов, ни уровней. Вы можете стать кем угодно и играть так, как вам хочется.  ○Узнаваемые страны. Действие The Secret World разворачивается в современном мире. Исследуйте города и участвуйте в приключениях на различных континентах!  ○Вступайте в тайное общество и сражайтесь под его флагами. Пополните ряды ордена Иллюминатов (Illuminati),              Драконов (Dragon) или Храмовников (Templars), чтобы сражаться против других игроков (или плечом к плечу с ними) за власть над миром.  ○Потрясающий сюжет, какого еще не было у MMO. Над игрой работает гениальный Рагнар Торнквист (Ragnar Tørnquist) – автор The Longest Journey.  ○Тысячи единиц оружия и множество специальных возможностей. Пистолеты, штурмовые винтовки, черная магия, катаны, взрывчатка – вас ждет множество видов оружия и особых приемов.P.S:Игра стоит своих денег.			"

												Secret World is a very interesting MMO currently on the Market, for a unique still of game like this i would rather have a list of Pros and Cons for it;ProsAmazing QuestsThis game has some of the best MMO quest's i've came across they make you actually think and solve problems. You will need a Bible, know Binary, know Borse code and much more just to complete these quests.Interesting Story/ArtCurrently i can't find a good mmo with a story similar to Secret World it has a very interesting approuch to Mythology. Overall i enjoy the feel of the game.ConsBoring Animations/EffectsCurrently in the games current form the animations/effects are very basic along with the Combat System while i enjoy the idea of the game most of the animations are simple spins with colorful effects tied to them. Nothing to be impressed by and very dull to look at all day not to mention it doesn't give you that feeling of being a Powerful being when you are a ballerina 24/7Confusing QuestsI'm not asking the quests to baby-mode me and i do enjoy the overall idea of the quests however, while they are Amazing they are still confusing... If anyone spends too much time on on quest they will most likely lose intrest and just quit the game. The quests are a double sided sword.PvPPvP on this game is very boring in my eyes... The damage output on the game needs to be overlooked with a few other things to make this game be very successful. However, this could just be a personal opinion when i'm trying to be biased as possible.Try out the game yourself, Its truly something you should experience yourself (As i think almost every game is) Overall the Cons i listed are a few of the things i dislike about the game but you might not see as a Big deal or even enjoy			"

And why would that ever be bad?The story is absolutely captivating, the details put into every aspect of it are bound to catch any fan of horror/sci-fi and it is lovely, as a long-time fan of Ragnar Tornquist's work, to see tiny elements of The Longest Journey in there.It brings something new to the MMO genre and while it's certainly not for everyone, its uniqueness and niche content are certain to draw only the truly interested. It's never going to be BIG, but it's never going to suffer the social downsides of more generic MMOs like Guild Wars, Rift or WoW. TSW is a mature game catered to a specific niche audience, and it's great at what it does.As a downside, combat can and often is either repetitive or frustrating. Builds require a lot of tinkering and calibration to be made viable, but in the world of Google this can be easily by-passed by looking up various builds perfected by the community and just using those. Therein comes the second problem: repetition. Rotation-based combat works, but people are getting bored of it and many modern MMOs are doing their best to steer away from it. Not TSW sadly, and I often find myself pressing 12311111241111... ad infinitum until something is dead. Thankfully, the necessity for dodging out of the way of many attacks keeps me on my toes, and is one of the things keeping combat from being unbearably dull. But hey! Repetitve combat gives me the chance to spend my time admiring the awesome monster models, which are beautifully designed, crafted and animated.In all, fantastic game with some mechanical drawbacks, but as long as you don't mind mashing buttons, you're going to enjoy the hell out of it (literally, perhaps).

												I loved parts of TSW.  The lore is great, and the quests are some of the most interesting that I've ever played.  Some of them were genuinely moving, or laugh-out-loud funny.  The investigation quests are unlike anything that I've ever played before.  All of these things basically made for a fabulous single-player game.  I played that game, and loved it.  I'll probably pick up the various expansion packs as they're released, and play the new content.  The mmo parts... are not so good.  The Dungeons are ""meh"" and the pvp combat is dull and grindy.  I could never bring myself to play the raid content, because I'm allergic to grinding.  The single-player aspects of the game are good enough, however, that it's absolutely worth buying and playing.			"

												One of the best... if not the best mmorpg i have ever played. Definitely a game to try!!!EDIT: ... Still the best mmorpg I have ever played, its got tactical and strategy situations, character development is very vast and there are at least 300+ different builds for tanking, dps, support, medic, etc, also it is updated quite often and there are new players joining all the time.BUT.... best of all it never ever EVER gets boring!!! there are way too many  things to do o theres never a dull moment, which compels you to keep playing... which in my opinion bumps it to 1st place.=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=SPOILERS=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=I dont know why I marked this section as spoilers... even if I keep talking for an hour I still wouldnt even scratch the surace of this games amazing storyline.So... you start with one of 3 factions in this game, Dragon, Illuminati and Templar. The faction you are in only makes a difference when it comes to boosts and buffs which changes dependiing on how your faction does in PvP. You also choose 2 wapons from a selection of 9 different kinds of weapons (3 Melee, 3 Ranged and 3 Magic), although you are limited to 2 weapons at a time there is no rectriction on how many weapons you choose to master ... meaning that there is a huge lot of customizing available and choosing the right 2 weapon combo is all up to you ...(I suggest Assault Rifle and dual pistols for beginners :D). Each weapon has active abilities and Passive abilities which you can chose from but you can only have 7 active and 7 passive abilities equiped at once, but there are over 40+ different actives and passives for each weapon which makes character development very very interesting. You can also import and export your builds or other builds from different players and this is an in game feature not a mod. So players can share thier builds with each other. PvE builds and PvP builds can be the same but usually they differ a lot. I usually tank in PvP and my builds for PvE are vastly diferent, they might have the same weapons but totally different actives and passives. You can find a lot of good builds for PvE online but PvP builds are not so easy to find, players who do well in PvP want to keep it that way so hardly anyone shares good PvP builds but I guess thats expected. What makes this weapons customizing even more awesome is that you are not limited to the passive abilities of the weapons you have equipped, for ex: If I have chaos magic and elemental magic equipped (good weapons for intermediate players) I can equip a passive ability of assualt rifles which increases accuracy even when no assualt rifles are equipped. SO ... I guess you kinda see why i said it never gets boring... but this isnt even the tip of the iceberg lol. After weapon abilities comes armor/armour. The armor aka talismans you can equip come in levels, so level 1 talimans <lvl2 talismans<lvl3 and so on. But its not so simple as that, there are different lvl 1 talismans with varying stats. To equip higher lvl talismans you have to master the lvl in your skills table first. Same is for equipping higher lvl weapons. There isnt a character lvl system, but rather a stat based system. And your stats get affected by weapons and talismans. The higher the lvl, the better the stats. Doing missions grants you 2 different kinds of points, AP which is ability points and SP which are skill points.  To unlock wepon active&passive abilities you need AP. To increase the lvl of weapons or talismans you can equip you need SP. Generally AP is gained faster than SP but that kind of balances out as you progress in the storyline. I suggest that when using SP, focus on talismans first then weapons and there are 2 different streams for weapons, max out one stream first then move on to the next because if you spend SP equally on the streams, you might have both streams at lvl 5 lets say, you will only be able to equip lvl 5 weapons even though the total amount of SP spent, if spent on one stream only, would allow you to equip a lvl 7 or lvl 8 weapon. But in the end its up to the players as to how to spend thier AP and SP :D. Lastly, for weapon customizing, you can greatly impact your stats by glyphs. Glyphs are an accessory for weapons and talismans. There are tons of different glyphys that each have different stats that can be applied to the weapon or to you (talismans). Sooooo.... that was JUST weapons and that was a brief explanation :P. Theres quite a lot more to weapons, talismans and glyphs but this should be enough to get you started. Moving on to other things I love about this game... Crafting. Not a lot off players like crafting in the beginning of the game but thats only because its not easy getting materials early on. But you can craft any weapon, talisman or glyph as long as you have the materials. But crafting is a little different in The Secret World. You dont just click craft and voila the equipment is crafted, thats boring. Luckily we have a way more interesting crafting process which you will learn very early on in the game so im not gonna type up another essay to explain that, just know... they found a way to make crafting fun :D.PvP: PvP is again a lot of fun. There are 3 different battlefields you can fight on and each has completely different set of rules and objectives. So its not just 1v1 or team battles. The following site can explain PvP briefly or in detail a lot better than I ever could so make sure to check it out, https://forums.thesecretworld.com/showthread.php?60445-PvP-101-The-Beginner-s-Guide-to-TSW-s-PvP.Theres so much more I can talk about, relating to this game but it would all be but words you are reading, If you really want to know what the game is like you should play it :D. The cost is so meager compared to content of the game and its just a one time fee. Also theres no kind of pay to win scheme. The only thing ive ever bought from the store is boosts. Other than boosts theres not much that money can buy to give you an edge over others which is the biggest selling factor in my opinion. I wont deny that there are other mmorpgs with similar characteristics but I am positive that The Secret World is one of the very few (I can count them on both hands) that combine all these amazing features into one very very very amazing game :) If anyone needs any help dont hesitate to send me a message here on steam on in game (IGN: NexisX)			"

												Best storytelling and worldbuilding I've seen in an MMO, and I've played alot of MMOs.  Where most settle for excuse plots or contrived backstory for the PvP backbone developers hope will keep people interested once they've reached max level, The Secret World has a continuing story that's both brilliantly written and exquisitely voiced.  Even the intros to what would otherwise feel like 'filler' quests are made interesting by great writing and every one is fully voice acted.On the contrary, combat options are strictly limited during the fray, but needlessly complex during setup.  The most difficult achievements in the hardest dungeons are those which require all players to refrain from changing skill setups between bosses.  TSW is a great game for story, and absolutely worth playing for that reason, even if you're a single player without a group to run with.  Finding answers to the deeper mysteries will require the aid of 4 helpful folks, but helpful folks are easy to find in TSW's many custom channels.  I wouldn't recommend this as someone's first MMO, but I'd absolutely recommend it as a second, just to show players new to the genre what a difference a great story can make.			"

Product received for free
												Overall: 8/10This game is a lot of fun to play, and that's what's most important. It's a lot less focused on character class (In fact, there are no classes) and more focused on your particular play style. You can find what works for you, character customization is top-notch in terms of outfit options, and the game's story is deeply interesting.My personal favorite part of the game is the 'Investigation missions'. These missions require you to use your brain and think logically -- a skill sorely missed in other mmo's. Also these missions often require you to think outside the box and even outside the game-- they're very immersive. Combat took me a little getting used to but once you figure out how it works it runs fairly smoothly. Voice acting in the game ranges from decent to sub-par, nothing exceptional but nothing that has me scrambling to mute it either. The overall story is excellent but character dialogue could use a little improvement in its writing; for example, there are many quests where you'll approach an npc, they'll give you their life story without so much as a hello first, and then you're scratching your head as to why you now have a quest to kill 15 zombies.I don't know whether this is a pro or a con, it's up to you: This game does not hold your hand at all. In fact, it throws you into the deep end without even a 'good luck'. You're given a very basic tutorial and then pretty much sent on your way. You have to figure a lot out on your own and if you're like me you'll spend a lot of time on google during the first few hours of the game. There is a web browser built into the game but it's often easier to just minimize the game--the browser is slower than average, and it can't be minimized, only closed (though you can move it off-screen).I can't take any points off for this, but it is a con: Unless you know people who play the game it's a fairly lonely experience. I rarely see other players except in the capital cities and they're very very quiet. This is a great game and I think it deserves a lot more players than it has. Please give this game a try, it's totally worth it! And at $30 it's a steal! (I received it as a gift several years ago)Highly recommended.			"

												Now that I've put some time into this game (The Secret World, not Secret World Legends) I think I can leave a better review.Pros:1) Amazing storytelling. It's detailed, creative, and always leaves you craving more.2) The investigation missions. These babies are hooked me into the game. They are challenging, require all sorts of random knowledge/skills, and they leave you feeling extremely satisfied if you solved them without refering to a guide for answers. 3) The environment. Personally I am playing this game on a POS computer, but even on low settings this game is beautiful and creates an atmosphere that draws you into the horrors of the events surrounding you.4) The skill wheel. While it was confusing at first, the freedom you have from being able to create and adapt your deck to your playstyle is a breath of fresh air from other MMO's where you need to take x skill over y skill or you're bad. 5) The community. The people in this game are kind, funny, and helpful. It is always a pleasure checking into #Sanctuary to see what those wonderful ladies and gents are up to.6) The lore. The lore in this game is detailed and feeds into your understanding of the world if you take the time to read it. It is also amazing when someone in your group finds a piece since it tends to lead to a loud ""LORE"" in the voice channel, followed by everyone else scrambling to make their way over to the lore.Cons:1) Jumping. This jumping mechanic in this game (at least from my experience) is not always accurate or consistant making certain missions that involve a bit of platforming more frustrating than they need to be. 2) Solo instances. While these are fine overall, it was frustrating encountering them early on while playing with a friend. We were building our decks around the working together which meant when we were not grouped that things became way more difficult and we would have to grind out some extra AP to fix one of our decks while the other person waited to progress further. So overall this is an amazing game and I hope that Funcom does it justice with their relaunch of Secret World Legends.10 out of 10. Would (will) eat the bees again.			"

												I've had this game on my computer from the start and I keep coming back to it.  They stories are the best in any MMO you have ever experienced and the cinematics are fantastic.  They do an absolutely wonderful job of giving you that Cthulhu feeling of a world gone mad for the unclean ones.This is also the best take on the Filth I have ever seen.  Really superb use of that particularly unpleasant aspect of Cthulhu lore.  Just a superb game all around.  Try it.  You will be glad you did.			"

												This is perhaps the most inventive and engaging MMO out there. Like many, I first played this and treated it like any other MMO. I hit a wall, became annoyed and quit. After coming back for a second try I realised that so long as you get how it is different, and play it slow, it is by far the most rewarding MMO out there. There's nothing bad I could say about it.Aside from its mind-blowingly unique and varied mechanics and flexible play styles the number one thing I adore about this game is the story. It weaves together a diverse band of deep characters in fascinating environments. Each one memorable and multifaceted. I can’t count how many times they’ve made me laugh, shout and cry.			"

This can be a pro or a con (pro for me), but it has a very single player feel to it. But in an MMO setting.100% Worth the price, and maybe then some. While on sale it's a no brainer. I've gotten 48 hours from it so far and I've barely left the first 2 areas.			"

												This is perhaps the most inventive and engaging MMO out there. Like many, I first played this and treated it like any other MMO. I hit a wall, became annoyed and quit. After coming back for a second try I realised that so long as you get how it is different, and play it slow, it is by far the most rewarding MMO out there. There's nothing bad I could say about it.Aside from its mind-blowingly unique and varied mechanics and flexible play styles the number one thing I adore about this game is the story. It weaves together a diverse band of deep characters in fascinating environments. Each one memorable and multifaceted. I can’t count how many times they’ve made me laugh, shout and cry.			"

												If you're looking for a MMORPG with a good storyline and great environment this is a great game. Repeatable quests, immersive storylines, and rich environments really bring a lot to the table. As well as hours of customization in your character's playstyle and look. If you're looking for a MMORPG with good PVP, go play something else. The PVP in this game is so insanely unbalanced and even more unfriendly to new players. As a new player you will have to grind PVP through endless hours of getting one shotted to be able to get PVP suits to use only in PVP zones just to be able to contribute to your team in some way. Before that point you're really just filling up a slot on the team that a geared player could have taken and provided help in some way.This game could really use some form of balancing or some way for new players to get the gear that would make them capable of lasting more than 2 seconds against the players who are fully geared.

												I can see why some people would like it, I enjoyed the combat, and I really like the cinematics of the game, but I cannot recommend it. From what I played, most of the quests were puzzles that were very annoying to solve. You need to link obscure clues to obscure answers that lead to more obscure clues, and if you cant consistantly do that, you will be checking google quite a bit. For example, in one part of a quest you need to put ""...under fireworks set to my favorite composer"", ""music of the seasons"" and ""1723"" together, and get ""Vivaldi. So if you want a game that you can play without opening a browser and following a bunch of steps every couple minutes, this is not the game for you.			"

												One could argue that this game has a good storyline, but to me, the gameplay mechanics of a game are much more important than it's story, which is why I do not recommend this game.This must be one of the blandest MMOs I have played. The combat is simply horrible.The weapons (I am an FPS player so I have experience with good implementation of firearms) have no impact. They don't feel like anything, its all hotbar based, no aiming, no skill, just button mashing till oblivion.They sound bad, they look bad.Animation is really not one of this game's strong points either. They look very clunky and not at all fluid as they should.Graphics wise, the game is okay. This is one of the criteria I generally don't spend too much time judging, it's all right. It could be leagues better, but it's definitely passable.Customisation is one of the worst I have ever seen in an MMO. Customisation in an RPG is important. Customisation in an MMO is ESSENTIAL. Character customisation is what makes you unique. If you can only choose between 5 preset faces and 6 hairstyles, then there's no point.The only metric in which this game exceeds expectations is the voice acting, which is honestly baffling. Everything else feels so mediocre and then you hear movie quality voice acting coming out of people's mouths. Real shame that the animations during cutscenes (mostly) suck and that you're just another silent protagonist with no choices.As mentionned, combat is just plain.So much so that I can't in good conscience recommend this game.If you want a good MMO with some actual decent gameplay, look towards GW2, or TESO.I usually don't get sick of games this fast, but this just feels like a cheap browser game that you play for free for 20 minutes until you realise it is just another WoW clone.If only the combat held up, I would've probably been drawn into the story and lore, but there is a limit to what I am willing to subject myself to, and all this game did was bore me.I could recommend this if you really REALLY didn't care what you play as long as you have a good story, but even then, better games will do this for you ie: the telltale series.A disappointment, probably unjustified given the release date of the game and me treating it as if it was released in 2016. But now is when I bought it, and I regret purchasing it, even for the low price of 10 pounds for the ultimate edition.To me, this game feels like it should be free to play because of it's massive lack of certain essential aspects. I think it's too late to hope that the game will change for the better, because it's already been very long since release and it's base concepts are flawed.4.5/10 - a below average game that failed to captivate me even though I felt that the lore was well set up, because of bad design decisions concerning major gameplay elements.PS: I should probably also mention other small things about this:- The initial loading time is ridiculous. (like upwards of one minute from executable launch to game launching -albeit, without an SSD-), and you can add to that 30 seconds of logos before you get to the main menu, which won't remember your password, forcing me to alt tab out to get the password from my third party password storage software - it's a pain. EVERY game should have an auto login function (Warframe I'm looking at you!).- Servers aren't location based (which is afaik stupid af) So I was matched with a Canadian when I was playing, which in itself isnt much of an issue, because whatever lag there is, the combat is so approximate that it doesn't change much. in PvP though? I assume there will be some consequences.- The text is really small, which is frustrating when you're trying to read up pages and pages of lore. I'm half blind. I've looked through the options and for now I haven't found a way to increase the font size. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Maybe the settings menu is badly designed... who knows?-The UI sucks so bad. and I think I know why. It's because it's positionning was badly coded. I think the issue is that it was hard coded and linked to a low resolution, and therefore, because im playing in 1080p, things that should be on the bottom of the screen are now in the middle. This is the first time this ever happens to me in a game.			"

												The User Review on steam usually says 'very Positive' but of course, they're gonna get 'mixed' reviews. I mean, TSW, the sort of older twin of SWL, is a great game with amazing storyline and a combat that basically lets you be what you want to be. But It's not like we can give it a proper review anymore because The Secret World is dying, in comes this f2p Secret World Legends. Is it gonna be better than TSW? That's what the devs and players-alike hope for. Will it ever live up to TSW which many of us loved? Who knows.At this point, all we can do is hope that they made it better than before. I'll leave this review for others to see and read. This is one of the best mmo games out there. It's quite a niche game as is, but it has it's own perks that no other game has. For now, this is my review for both TSW and SWL. Because I don't have access to beta for SWL as of yet. May edit this in the future.			"

												I would hope that people are intelligent enough and research enough to know not to let personal prejudice or assumptions over business models influence their reviewing a game not even out yet. Even fans of TSW like myself, that have stuck with the game do point out it has many shortcomings and have voiced a desire for the game to update or fix these. It costs nothing to remain positive that these changes will be the driving force for TSW Legends. It being its own game could function similarly to the quite popular Path of Exile (which has shops but shockingly not seen as greedy or P2W, imagine that!), if the story and world narrative plus the investigative puzzles are kept as a core tenet, there is no reason to think this won't be a positive boost. The original TSW wills till be active in maintenance mode, which is a lot more merciful than a lot of developers have done with much healthier MMOs and their shutdowns.All in all, there is no need to be insult-slinging naysayers over a game not even out yet, if it IS indeed as horrible as prematurely stated, one would hope it is reviewed as such after actually having given it a fair shot and played it.(giving a positive in lieu of no neutral option, may change on release)			"

												I just got this game not too long ago, 2-3 weeks. Put in some time & while the leveling & story telling in this game is really in a league of its own in the MMO world I'm a pvp player and this game is prob the 2nd worst game I've played from a pvp view(ESO is the worst obviously).Basically you get 2 battlegrounds to que up in, which pop quick in primetime, not at all after 1A est. But when they do pop 1 faction always has a full raid and the other 2 have half a raid usually with no healers. Why the devs let a match start with such huge imbalance is lost to me, I'd actually be ok with this if it wasn't the same players every single match.. I swear during my whole itme I've seen maybe 50 or so different people in pvp. Pve Idk not into it so I didn't try any of the raids or whatnot. Not recommended if your a pvper UNLESS you like to completely dominate games with double numbers and stacked premades, in which case sign up and be sure to roll Templar!			"

												Although Funcom sucks bad at making PC games and has no idea how to make one correctly, this is a (despite its numerous technical issues) very original, very fun mmo that is set in the real world. It's game world is very fun to play in. Now that this went subscriptionless, it is definitely worth the one time cost of $30. It breaks away from the monotony that every new MMO brings by being unique in that unlike all other MMO's, it is set in our real world and every horry story is true: secret societies, zombies, vampires, werewolves, illuminati, gay marriage, all the nightmares are real. So unlike games like World of Jack Black Kung Fu Panda Craft, it is not a big looney tunes f--kfest. It also actually makes you use your brain sometimes to figure out tough investigative quests. There are also no levels in the game: you gain ability and skill points to use on upgrading your ability to wear higher quality weapons and armor and to buy new active/passive abilities.The dungeons in the game are the best dungeons I've ever played through in a mmo because of one thing: they don't ♥♥♥♥ around and waste your time. It's straight up boss after boss after boss fight with only a couple of filler mobs in between bosses, but mostly it's just back to back to back bosses. Dungeons are quick and rewarding, the way it should be. No ♥♥♥♥ing around with piddly little who-gives-a-♥♥♥♥ easymode mobs.The biggest drawbacks about the game are that combat is a bit on the generic side, the ability system is awkward and somewhat confusing for quite a while until you get the hang of it and ask a lot of questions about it in general chat, and the game, despite being out over 2 years now, is still buggy. I am always discovering some new bulls--t technical problem with it that I have to email their tech support about. I've never had the kind of odd problems I have with this game with any other game ever before, but they are not deal breaking problems; I can still play the game relatively fine. That is until I hang at a load screen and have to restart the game once in a while. Funcom sucks♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at making pc games... The combat and ability system and technical issues are what I think to be the reasons this game went f2p in a year's time, but it gets a bit more satisfying the deeper you play into the game. The ability wheel system could have been done way better though. Groupmaking could be way better implemented also.Besides that, the reason it is for sure worth playing is everything else it offers. Its real-world setting and original story are a nice fresh take on an otherwise bogged down genre that has become way, way too over-cliched with the fantasy and dragons gimmick. I love fantasy and dragons, but God damn take it easy on that♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game could also be optimized much, much better so it runs better, but does not detract too much from the fun. A nice game, pick it up for some interesting fun. Unless you are an adult toddler queer who likes World of Jack Black School of Rock Kung Fu Panda Big Bird Teletubbies Craft.			"

												Unfortunately, I'm going to have to give a thumbs down for this game. I bought it on a discount for something like £18. I thought that was fairly decent for an MMO, they're usually games that soak up playtime like mad. But I regret doing so now.Side note: I am still only in the 'Lovecraft style' zones, so I never got to the end. But a game that won't keep me to the end isn't a game I'd ever recommend.Don't get me wrong, the theme is great. I love the whole urban legend, Lovecraftian, monster-world feel. But the gameplay is just awful. Every single fight is a long, drawn out case of spamming a few buttons. Dodging is alright but it's really just a bit of a gimmick, where most other MMOs will have the same thing of 'get out of the way of attack' without a dodge button.The mission pointer is also frustrating. I had one that pointed me in one direction, only to find it was sending me into primary teleport world (can't remember the name, it's where all the bees come from), to the portal that I hadn't unlocked yet. Other times it's pointed me right into a cliff, or on the wrong side of a building. It also fails to show the '3D' location, so sometimes the point is underground and you're standing above it thinking 'but I'm right where it says I should be'.The missions themselves are just generic quests of go here/kill this/gather these/find this/click this. The only twist they have is that some of them are complicated. They force you to have to look up things, like Bible passages, or co-ordinates, or binary stuff. That sort of thing, where the game alone won't suffice. The clue requires research, which I suppose is in-keeping with this sort of game.But this is where the downside kicks in: the playerbase is small. Which means there aren't a lot of guides out there. If you want to just save time and look something up, chances are you won't find anything about it. It isn't popular enough to actually warrant online activity, so there's not much information out there.What I can say is that this game really isn't very different to most other MMOs. It has the same sorts of quests, the same sorts of combat, the same sorts of interfaces (just re-named to other words to confuse new starters). The same things but they don't do it half as well as other games.Edit: I did miss something quite important. This game is marketed as one without levels or classes. This is actually a falsehood.Levels are still there, you just don't get a number by your character. Instead you get points to spend on upgrading your skills. The higher your level, the more skills you have, the better your character is. In fact, if you don't have enough points in some areas, you can't equip items. Your 'level' is too low for them.Classes are also still there, only they are tied to weapons instead of characters. Each weapon has a different role and has different skills to upgrade. A player can carry multiple weapons (so multiple classes), and if their level is high enough they will have upgraded multiple class lines.That particular dishonesty on the part of Funcom does grind a little bit on me.Edit 2: It's also probably worth mentioning that what few players there are in this game are rabidly fanatical about it. A harmless criticism of the game is equal to a racist killing spree for them. And they group together.Just check out the reviews for a slice of it. Go to positive reviews and look for the lowest rating you can find. Then look for the highest rating you can find in the negative reviews. You'll probably notice that even the lowest positive score will be 15-20% higher than the highest negative score. Why? Because they stick together.It's pretty apt that a game about cults would produce such a cultish mentality in its player base.			"

												The only modern setting rp. Combat is a mix of action combat with tab targetting. This means you need to face your target for your attack to connect. There is some dodging involved but combat is basically you turning and going through your number keys. The lore is fun. The game still looks pretty good and the models are interesting, especially the creatures you encounter. There are lot of references to HP Lovecraft's stories. The strength in this game is its quest. Besides story quest, there are investigation quests which require you to do research, solve puzzles. Do not look up the answer. When you solve, these you will be so proud of yourself! I highly recommend the game.			"

												Secret Worldis an mmo like never before set in a post apocalyptic modern day world you play as a special agent for one of three organizations, either Illuminati, Templars or Dragons, dragons suck though. Anyway when you join the game you choose between a variety of weapons since their are no classes to speak of, you can have magic to guns to swords and hammers choice is yours and in the game you can level up whatever skill you desire aslong as you ahve the weapon to use it for, this opens many combinations for your character and the game has 500 skills, that alot. The bad part about the game is its a slow start and you really have to think this mmo will not hold your hand like wow or guild wars but I think thats apart i enjoy. Another thing is its more casual mmo so its not too addicting as say guild or wow but its still real fun, if your a pvp guy though play a different game the pvp sucks here. overall this game is fun and creative, trying something new for once, if you play this game I promise you this is one you will remeber I give it and 8/10 "

												I'm not an MMO fan, and despite claims this game is solo-friendly it failed to interest me. The first few hours is basically 30 minutes of getting past the patcher and steam login issues, then 2 hours of listening to exposition with a very little running and shooting mixed in. I presumed the running and shooting during this intro period are the game putting its best foot forward, and they are so uncompelling compared to other games vying for my time I don't think I will ever launch the game again.

												A complex and intriguing MMO that offers immense gameplay flexibility and diversity depending on your tastes. Personally love this game since it gives me vibes I used to get when I first played Half-Life 2 (on the soundtrack alone, but embraced by everything mysterious that keeps coming afterwards). Some really amazing sights to see. Some mysterious plot thrown in, and I loved it after the first three hours.Note: there are plenty of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments that will utterly make you rage quit unless you've been focusing on one or two particular skill trees - and even then it tends to push your buttons at the worst of times. Just be ready for some hard♥♥♥♥♥♥-------------------------------------------------------------------------As of recently I have ""finished"" the game. I also have changed my rating from positive to negative. Here's why.1. At a certain point in the game you are introduced to a specific location, wherein you gain access to new mechanics in the game - cool stuff. However, within a very short span (approx. 30 mins.) you find out that this cool new stuff was primarily introduced just so you'd have a larger motivation to pay out for content to continue playing the story.2. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off laugh) Yes, the ♥♥♥♥ing key event that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game has been building up toward, ever since the beginning cinematic sequence, is a ♥♥♥♥ing purchased expansive ""content"". I emphasize ""content"" because the the content being offered is sorely lacking when in comparison to a number of other game ""expansions"". In short, I bought the game expecting an in-depth (and FINISHED) story experience, but it came up wanting at the end with a pay-wall.3. There is no excuse for the level of aborrent glitches and bugs in the game. I did mention them prior, but had apparently figured out that those bugs and glitches have existed for months or years... So the only explanation is that the Dev's could not be bothered to fix their game since they're too busy pushing out new content. -----------------------TL;DR: The game has excellent story, interesting mechanics, and intriguing mythos & characters, however it has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bugs/glitches, lack of community, downright ""unfair"" enemy-types, and limits your experience for the sake of money.

But, in real life, there is a possibility you could get hurt by delving into the Unknown.The Secret World provides me with the oppurtunity to explore the Unknown unharmed and at a safe distance (behind my computer screen).+ The combat is engaging, immersive and fun.+ There are plenty of conspiracies, monsters, myths, secret socities and puzzles to keep you invested for hours and hours on end.+ The replayability factor is extremely high.+ There are plenty of customization options for clothing, such as hats, jackets, masks and pants/trousers+ You can build the character you want to build, as there are a lot of options you can mix and match within the skill tree- The Starter Character Customization is basic, bland and way too simplified- Not Optomised for low end computers- Can feel like a chore to finish a mission or quest "

												First off i would like to notice, that i like the premise and the style of this game. A bit gothic, a bit mythology and a bit sci-fi. Feels and looks great... but then the gameplay - especially the comba!Yeah there are no classes and yes you can learn every skill with one character... and while i get that many feel this is the strongest part of the game, to me it's the weakest (or most annoying, to be more precise). How do i explain...? Imagine you got a construction kit for a sword and the manual says ""create the ultimate sword of your imagination"" and you go  ""yeah, let's get this started! Here a bit aluminium, there some carbon and some iron... finished"". Then you start combat and your ""ideal sword"" get's wrecked instantly and you die. So think ""hm... well let's start over and be a bit more methodic. Less aluminium, more carbon..."" then again combat and while your sword does not break, it's as dull as it could be, does no damage and you get overwhelmed. So once again you start to fumble around with the kit. And again... and again... and again...Seriously, there're a ton of character builds and so many guides on the net. I tried over and over and yet never felt once optimal even though all i wanted was a damage build with shotgun for single target ans AoE-Elementalism. With all the cross-effects between active and passive skills, it gets confusing as HELL.Yes, i appreciate some freedom with my character-developement but when i can't even create an effective DD or Tank, then f*** this!And using the 1-7 number keys for a dynamic-combat-system is less than optimal. For exampel, Neverwinter's controls hold up a lot better. Furthermore, even though the Maps are huge, there are no mounts (except for those expensive ones in the ingame-shop) and no kind of fast-travel. Going from a to b  gets tiresome as hell. And with all those ""wheret he f*** do i go"" kind of quests, this game burned me out really fast. Sad, because i wanted to get into it... but every time i try, it takes about an hour and i'm pi**** off as hell. SO if you (like me) want some kind of red thread in your game, this is nothing for you.    "

												A great mmo rpg game dealing with the occult and the paranormal.  This game puts you in the shoes of an agent for one of the 3 main secret societies you can choose from.  Like any mmorpg, you pick up missions from NPCs or points of interest/objects scattered throughout this very huge world.  The more I play, the more I'm drawn into learning more about it's mysterious and intriguing storyline.  I came back to this game after not having played it for about a year now and I can honestly say that I'm still having a blast picking up right where I left off.			"

												So, you choose the Asians, the Americans, or the Europeans.Then you spend 50+ hours trying to stop Loki from destroying the [secret] world with his keyblade.  After that, the setting, VA, and writing lessen in strength.It avoids many typical MMORPG conventions to give itself a niche and maintain freshness, but your mileage may vary.  The focus is more-so on gear and character building rather than leveling up, and you can change anything you want about your character at any given time.  Except: for your hair and face you'll need to see a barber and a plastic surgeon, respectively.			"

												Ok, how to put this, Ive been playing for over 200 hours now throughout the course of a year.  I say give it a chance especially when you get over $150 worth in content for $20 or even $60 when there is no sale, still worth it considering the price of each issue and side quest pack alone being almost $10-15.  This is how it works. There is no official class system, get used to it, you will never be successful using just one build literally.  You can solo the story content with the right builds, Pvp is decent, they have your straight Deathmatch, to capture points of interest to gain points, if your faction wins a Pvp match, you get a buff, World domination is key for a nice buff. The story is great, when i watch people on twitch who have never played skip some cutscenes, i laugh because its not that simple if your the type who doesnt use guides, the game is much more fun if you play it and actually figure the puzzles out for yourself, they even have an in-game browser, which for people running two monitors, doesnt matteer much, but still nice, add-ons become dam near essential later so pick up some mods when you start getting to the beef of the game, dungeons. Dungeons start like normal, though not centralized around dungeons or raids, they are practically necessary end game, because of the drops. I wouldnt be able to even put a dent in how much content there is in a short paragraph or two.  Lore is damn near endless and increasing, with the release of issue 13 in December 2015, you can tell Funcom does not ♥♥♥♥ around with this game, yes there are minor bugs here and there especially with one of the cutscenes in blue mountain the horror of this girls face is just awful lol her mouth is off set, but regardless, the game itself is not nice to people who think they can pull mobs and gain a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of xp, nono the game is much harder than you think, there are viable builds that can last throughout the game and there are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ builds like really why would you think thatd be good? But experiment with it, try making your own build after you read up on how penetration is almost the most essential for dps builds in the beginning, and how some specs like physical and magical defense are♥♥♥♥♥♥no matter what you try to accomplish lol.  As i said before i have not even scraped the surface of how big this game is, it starts slow, and progressively gets better.			"

												On of the best MMO's in the universe. Past. Present. Future.The team behind the longest journey franchise.The writing is truly superb...some of the best i have seen in a video game.The  atmosphere is really astounding.It's pretty creepy form time to time too.There are these special missions called investigation missions...i love them...i really, really love this game. it's for hardcore rpg enthusiasts though, probably...if you like tabletop rpg's and you like call of chtulhu? this is basically that, only in 3D.EDIT!!!So I decided to venture back into Agartha and the universe of the Secret World.And this is what i have discovered thus far.It's been ca three years scince i last played this game, and...well, the bugs i encountered back then are still rampant. with some additional ones, it seems.nothing directly game-breaking though, at least not too much, but the 4th wall is being broken all over the place.missing textures, windows freezing up, dialogue options locked and frozen solid, the same odd look of the textures of a characters skin and sometimes they even have 4 eyes...weapons go completely black because of lack of textures. so you see, some serious texture problems in here, and guess what, they we're present three years ago. also there are some serious, SERIOUS latency and framerate issues. and what do you know, they we're there at launch. so obviously nothing has been touched or refined scince, at least, the effort was a waste, because nothing has changed.i know that they have been adding some content to the game, but come one, how about cleaning out the trash before you horde in new stuff? i don't know...seems lazy, and though i do not know the intricacies going on at the company (funcom) these days, and even though i ardently believed in them...it doesn't seem strange to me at all right now that the company if unravelling at the seems. the fundation was obviously poorly built, and thus, the building crumbles.all of this is a great shame. because the game has such incredible potential. It's the most unique mmorpg out there. with a heavy lovecraftian atmosphere and story, highly intelligent and crafty writing and some really great concepts and designs. i still love it...because it's redeeming features thankfully outnumbers the grotesque listlesness of the development team in regards to fixing things.having said all this, i still claim that this is one of the greatest mmo's out there, and even one of the most unique and interesting games of all time. so should you still play it? definitely.the bugs can be ignored, and the beauty of it absorbed. but if you are not into dark lovecraftian lore and stories of the grave...you might not be able to abide all the bugs.if you want to play a truly amazing and huge lovecraftian (how many times have i written lovecraftian at this point?) universe where all deep things sealed in ancient tombs have been unsealed, with some incredibly fun investigation missions, something that i completely unique in the mmo genre as a whole, then yes. buy it, and play it forever.

Future.The team behind the longest journey franchise.The writing is truly superb...some of the best i have seen in a video game.The  atmosphere is really astounding.It's pretty creepy form time to time too.There are these special missions called investigation missions...i love them...i really, really love this game. it's for hardcore rpg enthusiasts though, probably...if you like tabletop rpg's and you like call of chtulhu? this is basically that, only in 3D.EDIT!!!So I decided to venture back into Agartha and the universe of the Secret World.And this is what i have discovered thus far.It's been ca three years scince i last played this game, and...well, the bugs i encountered back then are still rampant. with some additional ones, it seems.nothing directly game-breaking though, at least not too much, but the 4th wall is being broken all over the place.missing textures, windows freezing up, dialogue options locked and frozen solid, the same odd look of the textures of a characters skin and sometimes they even have 4 eyes...weapons go completely black because of lack of textures. so you see, some serious texture problems in here, and guess what, they we're present three years ago. also there are some serious, SERIOUS latency and framerate issues. and what do you know, they we're there at launch. so obviously nothing has been touched or refined scince, at least, the effort was a waste, because nothing has changed.i know that they have been adding some content to the game, but come one, how about cleaning out the trash before you horde in new stuff? i don't know...seems lazy, and though i do not know the intricacies going on at the company (funcom) these days, and even though i ardently believed in them...it doesn't seem strange to me at all right now that the company if unravelling at the seems. the fundation was obviously poorly built, and thus, the building crumbles.all of this is a great shame. because the game has such incredible potential. It's the most unique mmorpg out there. with a heavy lovecraftian atmosphere and story, highly intelligent and crafty writing and some really great concepts and designs. i still love it...because it's redeeming features thankfully outnumbers the grotesque listlesness of the development team in regards to fixing things.having said all this, i still claim that this is one of the greatest mmo's out there, and even one of the most unique and interesting games of all time. so should you still play it? definitely.the bugs can be ignored, and the beauty of it absorbed. but if you are not into dark lovecraftian lore and stories of the grave...you might not be able to abide all the bugs.if you want to play a truly amazing and huge lovecraftian (how many times have i written lovecraftian at this point?) universe where all deep things sealed in ancient tombs have been unsealed, with some incredibly fun investigation missions, something that i completely unique in the mmo genre as a whole, then yes. buy it, and play it forever.

												Ok, how to put this, Ive been playing for over 200 hours now throughout the course of a year.  I say give it a chance especially when you get over $150 worth in content for $20 or even $60 when there is no sale, still worth it considering the price of each issue and side quest pack alone being almost $10-15.  This is how it works. There is no official class system, get used to it, you will never be successful using just one build literally.  You can solo the story content with the right builds, Pvp is decent, they have your straight Deathmatch, to capture points of interest to gain points, if your faction wins a Pvp match, you get a buff, World domination is key for a nice buff. The story is great, when i watch people on twitch who have never played skip some cutscenes, i laugh because its not that simple if your the type who doesnt use guides, the game is much more fun if you play it and actually figure the puzzles out for yourself, they even have an in-game browser, which for people running two monitors, doesnt matteer much, but still nice, add-ons become dam near essential later so pick up some mods when you start getting to the beef of the game, dungeons. Dungeons start like normal, though not centralized around dungeons or raids, they are practically necessary end game, because of the drops. I wouldnt be able to even put a dent in how much content there is in a short paragraph or two.  Lore is damn near endless and increasing, with the release of issue 13 in December 2015, you can tell Funcom does not ♥♥♥♥ around with this game, yes there are minor bugs here and there especially with one of the cutscenes in blue mountain the horror of this girls face is just awful lol her mouth is off set, but regardless, the game itself is not nice to people who think they can pull mobs and gain a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of xp, nono the game is much harder than you think, there are viable builds that can last throughout the game and there are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ builds like really why would you think thatd be good? But experiment with it, try making your own build after you read up on how penetration is almost the most essential for dps builds in the beginning, and how some specs like physical and magical defense are♥♥♥♥♥♥no matter what you try to accomplish lol.  As i said before i have not even scraped the surface of how big this game is, it starts slow, and progressively gets better.			"

												A great mmo rpg game dealing with the occult and the paranormal.  This game puts you in the shoes of an agent for one of the 3 main secret societies you can choose from.  Like any mmorpg, you pick up missions from NPCs or points of interest/objects scattered throughout this very huge world.  The more I play, the more I'm drawn into learning more about it's mysterious and intriguing storyline.  I came back to this game after not having played it for about a year now and I can honestly say that I'm still having a blast picking up right where I left off.			"

Product received for free
												I don't normally leave reviews for games (even ones I extremely hate; looking at you Dementium II), but since this game has been catching a lot of flack for some drastic development choices lately, I decided to give my own two cents. So here we go:(Please note this is mostly my review for the TSW base game with a few of my opinions for the upcoming remake. As for Funcom carrying over positive reviews from TSW to SWL, it hasn't even been established whether they will delete them all upon release or not. I think saying they're trying to deceive consumers on something that hasn't even been released yet is jumping to conslusions. If deceit is actually occurring, I do not condone it, but as of right now, without knowing the full scope of the situation, I will remain positive on the matter. It's not like anyone can buy the game right now anyway. Funcom at least had the decency to remove the ability to purchase the base game, so nobody would continue to spend money a soon-to-be defunct product.)I am fairly new to The Secret World, but I'm glad I was able to play a bit of the base game before Secret World Legends came out. I've been enjoying TSW greatly and although the gameplay can be janky at times, I've so far enjoyed it more than the last MMO I attempted to play. (I'm really glad that TSW doesn’t have a lot of lengthy back-tracking along with no ungodly long skill rotations.) The storylines in TSW are interesting and the large variety of enemies you can combat is very satisfying. Most, if not all, the characters are voiced (by very well-picked voice actors) and they are very entertaining to interact with. The ability of solo play and the freedom to choose whatever weapons and skills you want while not being restricted to a class is also very welcomed and appreciated. Overall, The Secret World universe exploits a lot a lot of the niches and themes I enjoy very much and blends them together in a new and unique way so it really is sort of a dream game come true for me; I really don't know why I haven't tried playing it sooner.As for Secret World Legends, I am actually looking forward to it. I am following  SWL's development fairly closely, and it seems like most of the changes are improvements on the base game. The Funcom dev team seems very competent and it looks like they know what they want to achieve to make the game more enjoyable as a whole for both new and veteran players alike. The main change I'm personally looking forward to is improved gameplay; the new reticle system looks like it removes a lot of previously-mentioned jank of the base game. There will also be a legitimate dressing room mechanic so you can see all the cosmetics on your character better. The only thing I'm a bit leery on so far is the use of keys to unlock chests in dungeons, but it's been said that you will get free keys daily and that you can also buy them with in-game currency, so I don't think that will be too big of a deal in that case. The skill wheel also seems like it will be simplified for ease of use while still allowing enough freedom to create your own unique build. I personally would recommend looking into the details that have already been released about SWL to form your own opinion before jumping to conclusions about the Free-to-Play formula. The Funcom Twitch streams certainly clear up a lot of the misconceptions and share some helpful insight on what to expect, so checking in on those is also highly recommended. (Also, check on them because Andy the community manager is a beautiful human being. Never change Andy.) If you also watch the streams when they’re live, there’s even a chance you could win a beta key to Secret World Legends in a raffle, so hey, you could potentially be awarded for taking the time to look into the development.I feel like I should also mention that I actually got The Secret World as a gift from a friend. I wouldn't shut up about how cool the game looked but I was unsure if I should buy it after my sort of ""meh"" experience with the last MMO I tried. Turns out, he purchased it for me like a week or less before SWL was announced and before the ability to purchase the base game from Steam was removed. At first he was a bit disheartened that he wasted money because SWL will be F2P but, after further research, it has been stated that returning players will receive rewards for owning and playing the base game (along with its DLCs), and most of the cosmetic items from the base game will be carried over. My friend only bought me the main game (without the DLCs), but I did plan on upgrading to the Ultimate or Complete edition later. It looks like I won't have to do that now, but I would have definitely done so if SWL wasn't announced. IF I play SWL (either in beta or when it comes out completely) and my opinion changes or if Funcom *is* actually trying to deceive by review swapping, I will either change or remove this review, but for now, I’m mostly happy with what I see so far.So, for anyone who has read to this point, I hope my overly long review helped some and I thank you for taking the time to read. I wish you all a good day and happy hunting.			"

												I have not played this title in so long...I pretty much quit playing after the game decided to drop me in the middle of nowhere and hide my main quest from me.When i came back after a year or so, the game was hacked or something, i found a ""Dress"" or some sort in my inventory, but when i put it on my character was naked except for panties, and two smiley face stickers on the nipples... Couldn't undo what had happened, so i quit yet again.With these MMO titles that offer character customization, i try my very best to get my sense of fashion translated into the game, so when this glitch/bug whatever it was happened, i was disgusted and lost all interest in playing it ever again.I am going to give this title one more chance, hopefully a large majority of the issues i had are a distant thought from the past now.Fingers crossed?  Will update later if anything is different, otherwise it's a great game!			"

												The Secret World.... where to begin?This game is basically one giant conspiracy ... theres millionsand yes you can play one the illumanati teamThis game is great in my opinion!  A good change from the average push a button and wait.You only have to pay once and you don't have to pay again unless you want premium features kinda like Guild Wars.The story is good.  Kinda repetitive with questsoh one thing... you don't have levels just skill pointsso if you wanted you could be good with swords and guns... maybe magic and swords it's up to youthis game is great with optionsone thing i dislike would be the fact that once you're done most of the story mission packs you have to pay for the rest of them... kinda sucks.... but that's what they had to do since they went Pay once Play forever.Overall I recommend this game!

												The original version of this game is/was one of my favorite games of all time, as my playtime would indicate. It had one of the best stories and communities ever, and took me from playing single player games only into the world of MMOs. I made many friends, killed thousands of monsters, and served as an officer in one of the game's largest guilds for a time. The original developers truly made something special in creating The Secret World.As for SW: Legends, only time will tell, but I am not holding my breath. I strongly disapprove of their actions in porting in the old reviews onto a new game, and what I am seeing thus far in rolling out the ""revamp."" Unless Funcom does anything to indicate that they will value their story, their community, and honest business practices moving forward, I do not plan to spend any time or money on their games ever again.

												Expect to be offered incentives to 'continue the story' only to discover that there is a huge hole in the progression tree for the story between zones 3 and 4, which you will have to then buy extra 'side' content to progress through, or play dungeons over and over for gear grinding.If you like grinding continually, get the game. If you like story and are a new player, the game is fine. Just don't expect to be treated fairly in future, and absolutely do not buy into any of their returning player 'offers' unless they're offering ALL the content. Which will probably just mean having to re-buy the whole game. Again and again and again.Game left me feeling I'm out of pocket for gameplay I can't access, while competing MMOs with similar business models are far more welcoming.Unless you absolutely love the setting, take your money elsewhere.

However due to its glitchy nature, slow loading, and the terrible controls. I cant recommend this. The concept has so much potential, and If they could fix the problems, update the control interface, and put a little less focus on micro purchasing with no fixes to game play I could change my mind. I hope that someday they correct this or let the rights go to someone else and develop a sequal with a better interface.With its age and comparative to other MMOs this needs a major change that just isnt happening			"

												Funcom keeping the mostly good reviews for ""The Secret World"" when ""Secret Wolrd Legends"" will be the same story, but different gameplay is misleading to fraudulent in effect, if not intent. I am certain if Funcom is an honest business, they will agree to review wipe; I am certain if Valve is an honest business, they will do a review wipe irrespective of what Funcom wants.There, I have said my piece; hopefully it'll be lost in a review wipe. If not, it truly needed saying.Do not try to question why Funcom appears to be resorting to a deceptive, dishonest business practice anywhere they have moderation privileges (e.g. Steam community hub, Reddit, their forums,...). They will abuse those privileges to kill all mention of this issue. Valve/Steam apparently will not. Draw your own conclusions about whether appearance might be fact.			"

												May be okay for those who like the horror genre, since it has decent story telling.  However if you don't like horror or are in it for the game play, I would steer clear.  The skills, weapons, combat are poorly conceived and implemented.  If you don't like horror the story is also a complete nightmare to experience.  I had hoped this would be a game I would like since Ragnar Tornquist was one of the designers, but this game is nothing like the amazing The Longest Journey games he created.  If I were Ragnar I would be hesistent to count this as one of my achievements.			"

												I want to love this game. I REALLY do. And it provides so many amazing ideas about how MMOs could work. Integrating the real world in a semi-ARG is phenomenal. The setting of modern day instead of medieval fantasy is a brilliant move. Limiting quests and abilities is such a great design even if it seems counter-intuitive at first. But I just can't recommend it. There are so many problems from unclear storytelling to a really bad UI that it makes the game too difficult to enjoy. Ultimately it's a fantastic single-player investigation game wrapped in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MMO. Many people would love it, really, but most will not. I recommend you try it at least, because it really is worth it. Any attempt to change what we believe MMOs are supposed to do is worth it, IMO. But as it stands, I just can't recommend it to the general public.			"

												The gameplay is a lot more fun in third person shooter by pressing T - however, the loading screen will make the game unplayable and a lot of forum threads out there won't be able to help you out.PS; The story with the Illuminaty is a fun start and so is the Templars, but the Dragon... Anyone playing with the Dragon will have a hard time with the story and the chaos theory.			"

												I realize that I have very little playtime in this game, but I really didn't need to for this review.   The gameplay is just...clunky. The character model moves around like an older, boxy game, when the game is clearly trying to be more. Although the gameplay videos make the combat look smooth, and smash-em-uppy, it's not. It's still the same tired old ""circle around the enemy"" formula. The game even has a targeting mode, which makes it to where you don't have to hold your mouse button down, and it gives you crosshairs, but it seems like the innovation for combat stopped there because they didn't do anything with it. Once in combat mode, my mouse buttons are useless (why can't I reassign combat buttons differently from non-combat controls?), and it basically just targets the closest thing most times, or in the case of you having a weapon that has a range on it, the furthest enemy possible so your attacks wont work. Lets not mention the whole micro transaction thing, and the fact that they're running a campaign on ""pay once play forever"" thing, but you have to pay more to advance and get more episodes to the story. Let me give a tip to any game developers reading this about micro transactions: DON'T CHARGE PLAYERS TO ADVANCE IN YOUR GAME. Charge me for cosmetics if you have to (and people will buy the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥out of cosmetics, i.e. every MOBA out right now), but don't charge me to keep playing your game, just because you came out with a bit more content.I really thought this game had potential, and when I saw it on a steam sale I grabbed it out of impulse. I'm regretting my purchase now, and refunding.			"

												The Secret World is difficult for me to recommend or not recommend, because its an interesting game to say the least. Overall, its a wonderful game, with terrific story and writing, great atmosphere, beautiful and creepy locales, wonderful voice acting in places you wouldn't normally expect any voice acting at all, and some great quests, including some genius investigation quests that sometimes require going outside the game to look for clues at fake websites made for the game. The problem with it is that its a lackluster MMO. Everything that makes an MMO good (in my opinion at least) is lacking. The community just isn't there for the most part, even on the most populated servers. Even if you can manage to get enough people to do a dungeon with, none of the different traditional MMO roles of tank, healer or dps feel that fun to play as, and everyone else is rushing through the dungeon so fast you cant even catch the story that frames what you're doing in the dungeon in the first place. I never got into endgame content but it doesn't sound much better. Some people say theres grinding involved, but I never got to that point. Never tried PvP because I never got geared enough to be able to compete, which is pretty crappy in itself. The Secret World is a great singleplayer game for the most part (combat feels a bit tedious, but I blame that mostly because its an MMO), and luckily most of the game can be played and enjoyed solo. But as an MMO, it just doesn't do it for me. So if you're looking for a fun single player experience and can deal with some tedious combat, I would recommend this game. But if you're looking for a good MMO to play, skip it.			"

												At first, I did recommend this game, with a ""warning"" about some aspects. However, as I poured more time into it, those aspects become more and more frustrating to the point that I doubt I will spend much more time playing this.Firstly, it handles fine. Combat is interesting, with different branching pathways and such.The community is very nice, and willing to help new players. The lore is great. This is one of the very few mmo's I've played where quests are completed more for LORE's sake, then for the experience or item rewards.What ultimately killed this game for me, was the guides. And Walkthroughs. Ultimately, I spent more time browsing the internet, looking at detailed walkthroughs/build guides/storyline guides to see what areas I should go to next, that in a 4 hour period of playing the game, I spent 3 hours of that looking at guides, with 1 hour of actual play time. That's not enjoyable to me. It killed any sense of enjoyment, of desire to keep playing.If you don't mind doing a LOT of research, then this will probably be fine for you. For me, personally, it gives me a splitting headache to try to play this for any length of time.			"

												i've played this one off and on for a few weeks, delving into it enough to ensure i hadn't wasted my money. The game itself is different than any other MMO i've played in the aspect of it's puzzles. Some of these are literally undoable unless you google the answer (which they actually tell you to do,even call the quest a ""google quest"") or if you happen to be a brain.Now in my opinion  that isn't a bad thing, it's a new form of challenge and a game without challenge gets boring easy.Gameplay itself is pretty nice. Not class based whatsoever. The weapons you equip decide your skills and there are many skills to unlock. If you get tired of a weapon and want another, you can switch anytime you want. You aren't restrticted.  You'll find out pretty fast the best gear comes from dungeons  (as with most games) but the playerbase is pretty low so finding a group for the dungeon can be difficult sometimes although i have to say the community is very nice. There is usually someone willing to run newbies through dungeons just for the sake of entertainment. Armor doesn't affect style. You can wear what stats you want while wearing a cosmetic style over it. Character creation is pretty lame. Not many choices to pick from and no long hair choices at all...well they say long hair but it's shoulder length..That's about as much as i can say as i'm still pretty new to the game still.			"

												This game is seriously THE BEST mmo game I've ever played and honestly mmo games USUALLY turn me off badly. The story in the beginning with the bug (literal), that freaky dream, then you with your powers, thats something you won't get to revisit unless you create a new character. The Three Story Arcs depends on the Faction you choose, but take a big note; There are NO Classes & seriously, NO levels. Don't bother creating a new character cause you THINK you screwed up, cause you CAN unlock every single skill in the game on just ONE character - How you design your character's build? 100% up to you.Now there's a number of things you SHOULDN'T expect from this game:1) For it to be Easy - if you're expecting that, you'll rage quit pretty quickly, this game is NOT easy at the start. First you have to build your character's abilities & create the best build suited for you, once you have it figured out & that'll take a while, THEN it might become easy (at least til you get to the harder areas).2) You wiped them out easily the first dozen times, next you change your build, you expect things to be the same - No, you change your character & you alter your pros & cons. Sometimes you'll find build set that feels better, just be sure it is better against everything.3) You expect to be a Legend real quick - Sorry, but thats not gonna happen. Maybe much later in the game, but not immediately after you start. There is no rush, pace yourself, and be smart. Otherwise, you could easily get yourself killed quick.4) You grinded on WoW an rose fast, this is no different - Actually it IS different. All enemies have difficulty tags, and they only change based on your build set & Quality Level (QL) of your gear. If you're expecting to slaughter Red Skull enemies (to WoW that's equivalent to Elites), you'll be slaughtered, also you won't gain much anyways - you'll spending most of your money on repairs than the loot these enemies will drop. 5) All MMOs are the same - Not all, sure there are many out there that are just copy & paste, but this game IS different. 90% of MMOs have Classes (Fighter, Archer, Mage, etc), Secret World has NONE. Most MMOs will restrict you because of your level, Secret World has NO Levels and lets you play any quest you want even if there's no possible way you could beat that quest, they'll still let you try. Most MMOs restrict abilities based on Classes, Secret World doesn't have that restriction, you can be ANYTHING you want and can use EVERY SINGLE SKILL in the game.This game is like Dark Souls in terms of heavy hitting enemies with very different abilities meant to destroy you. Even simple zombies if you're not careful or you're overconfident could easily overwhelm you. Many quests are pretty straight forward & direct, others expect you to literally use your brain cells & quick thinking, while some others require perfect stealth to get the best rewards. This game is also like EVE Online in terms of intricate character designs, great stories, and fully customizable ability sets  (heck you can even use a Passive ability from a Melee set to buff an Active ability from a Magic set - I'm not joking an yes it does work). Big Plus: Celebrity Voice Acting. EVERYTHING is voice acted! Such as: Laura Aikman, Jimmy Akingbola, Ben Aldridge, Adjoa Andoh, Leigh-Allyn Baker, Tara Lynne Barr, Tim Bentinck, Brian Bloom, Steve Blum, Steffan Boje, Nicholas Boulton, Bertie Carvel, Jeffrey Combs (Frighteners & Deep Space Nine), Jonathan Espolin-Johnson, Christopher Fairbank (Alien 3), Christopher Fairbank (Mass Effect 2 as Warlord Okeer), Camilla Frey, David Hoffman, Bob Joles, Irwin Keyes, Andrew Kishino (BulletStorm), C.S. Lee (Dexter tv show), William Mapother (LOST as Ethan Rom), Jenny O'Hara (Wishmaster), Tim Russ (Voyager as Lt Tuvok), Armin Shimerman (Deep Space Nine as Quark), André Sogliuzzo (Transformers Revenge Fallen as Sideswipe), Dennis Storhøi (13th Warrior), Peter Stormare (8MM as Dino Velvet), and many others.- Yes, you can invade Hell an you will feel like you walked in to DOOM's version of Hell. - Yes, you can not only fight the Deep Ones, but even Cthulhu himself!- Yes, you can join The Templars, The Illuminati, or The Dragon (not literal flying beast dragon, basically a Chinese Triad who is just as dangerous as the other two).- Yes, you can craft your own weapons, gear, and Glyphs (equivalent to Diablo's Runes).- What if you unlock every single skill? There's still more! You can augment your skills to make you character even more deadly & powerful, plus there's the Auxiliary Weapons (special very powerful weapons that will make your character even more unique & unstoppable depending on your build). - What if you want you character to look like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ Yup you can definitely do that, every faction has their own Faction Uniforms and you can buy other cosmetic outfits anywhere in the game. - Want to replay a quest to build up your character? Do it as much as you want (of course there is a cooldown), replay a quest however many times as you please an you'll still get experience for skills & loot regardless of how powerful you are.- Not liking the interface or something in the game is bothering you? Mods are fully supported in the game to alter the UIs and even make things easier to adjust, make quests easier to find, auto-upgrade your stuff, disassemble loot for you, help make crafting stuff easier, even mods to help you build a powerful character, yeah Funcom, the owners of the game fully support mods. Of course if you get/create a mod that acts like a cheat, those will not work (even if you somehow do get them to work, the cheat mod, Funcom can just as easily ban you, so don't try it).There's honestly too many awesome things that make this game THE BEST out there.I've played WoW, EVE Online, Guild Wars, ARK Survival Evolved, Warframe, Rift, Requiem Memento Mori, I lost interest in all of them - Secret World is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!!

It's mind blowing. I can't recommend this game because the graphics are so disturbingly, distractingly bad. I want to set my computer on fire.MAJOR EDIT: SO apparently this game does not auto-detect graphics and mine were on low. So there's that. They are a little better now (on ultra), still not great.

												You find this written in micrographia on the side of a fire hydrant: ""File of cleric ran for pie sideways with a broken, bloody proboscis and nearby found the stars.""""File of cleric"" is an anagram of ""Circle of life,"" indicating that you need to walk counter-clockwise while quoting from the Necronomicon. ""Circle of life"" is also the first song on The Lion King soundtrack, and if we look at the 3rd letter in its lyrics (which is an o) and chop off 10% of it (thus giving us the 3.1 of pi) and turn it sideways it becomes a u. This tells us that we need to use an emote which has only now, and without announcement, been made available to us (/u) which contorts our avatar into the foetal position (also a u shape). If we then follow the direction in which our avatar's nose (proboscis) is pointing and drop all of our money (thus making us broke) at the end of the map, a vendor will materialise from the ether and hand us a scandalous article from a celeb (star) worship magazine, on which we need to wipe our blood. Given the scandalous nature of the article we have bloodied, this brings to mind ""blood libel"" indicating that we need to then translate the article into Hebrew. At this point the next clue in our investigation quest will have become apparent.If this (lack of) logic does not appeal to you and you don't get off on repetitive, undercooked combat, do not buy this game.

												I have a love hate relationship with this game.Pros:THE STORY: OH GOD THE STORY.  TRIPLE AAA STUFF RIGHT HERE.  Every singe cutscene is animated and every single mission has a cutscene to go along with it.  The writing is superb and I rate this as probably the best plot in any MMO.Attention to Detail:  You don't usually notice the little things in MMO's since they aren't the point, but this game makes them the point in some missions and with a setting like the one it has, it fits in exceptionally well, speaking of setting.The setting:  It's odd how few MMO's, or games for that matter (besides Deus Ex) have had any major foray into this kind of setting with multiple secret organizations in a modern/slightly futuristic world fighting for control.   Its great yet brings about a layer of familiarity.Clothing:  Yeah this is a pro because how many options you have.  No more is your armor cosmetic since its just talismans that dont show up on your model, instead you can truly decide how you look instead of being say a person in a can.The cons:Mechanics:  Read any review of Secret World and it will probably mention the god awful mechanics.  Combat feels sluggish and a chore, more so then other MMO's.  That and any group that is not a group mob will kill you with 100% certanty making progression fell dull.  Speaking of progression you dont really discernable grow in strength you just kinda end up stronger without knowing why (usually cause gear).  The big problem with progression in this game is that if you are going a one weapon build you can max out by the end of the 3rd area with many more to follow, meaning after that its just outfit collection.  The stealth missions made me want to kill myself IRL everytime I got one.  Not only is the stealth shoehorned in and terrible to begin with sometimes they shoe in another poorly done challenge into it that makes them so frusterating I nearly tore my hands apart at one point.Pacing:  Some points of the game feel exciting and feel like you are doing things, someother times not so much.  This wouldn't be unusual except for the fact its kind of a reverse curve.  I felt like I was doing less as the game area went on meaning every area had some good hook, but failed to keep it.  Lairs:  The biggest noob trap every which really just feels like they are there to kill noobs repetedly.  Lairs are essentially end game dungeons stuck in the overworld and can be found as soon as you reach an area.  This of course gets you curious so you investigate only to die to the end game level enemies you find.  There is one every area so that means you need to leave areas uncompleted in order to progress which, for completionists, is like cutting yourself.Die to quick travel: A small con but one you visit a lot.  In order to use the quick travel system you need to die.  Thankfully there is a suicide button in game but its still a pain and damages your equipement which you then need to get fixed before the overpowered enemies rip you to shreds.Overall: I really wanted to recommend this game, I really did.  I absolutly love the atmospere, I love the story and I love how its not another Fantasy MMO and tries to be something.  This game could probably be one of the big MMO's if funcom fixed the mechanics of this game as honestly, everything else is bearable except for the mechanics.			"

												A really well built setting doesn't make up for the tedious grinding.  The cutscenes and voice acted quests do help cover up the traditional mmo kill x of y or get b at c, but after two hours it get old.  The difficulty curve is all over the place, either the mobs are too easy or you are dead.  Combat consisted of trying to move your character backwards from the target, while, keeping the target in a narrow cone to the front of the character, all while trying to hit the key to activate your attack.  So you had one hand on the WASD movement, one hand on the mouse to align your character to the target, and then had to either select the attack with the mouse or move your hand off the movement keys to trigger the attack.  Either way, you will stop to attack and be eaten.  I can't move and attack effectively at the same time.  My character would randomly dodge at times and seemed in capable of properly aligning with targets.  The initial mission in the tutorial does not describe the frustration of combat.  I found myself hitting a wall of things that I couldn't fight.  Graphics liked to bug out once in a while, mostly artifacts and flashes.  And mobs will teleport in just after you cleared out an area and think it's safe to proceed with the objective.  Creating an account and registering my cd key was difficult and required reading the forum.  Lore was confusing and only distracted from the details that helped build the narrative and world.  The very atmospheric zones really help the story, but at the end the game is about playability and the only way I could advance was if I were to team up with other players.  In otherwords, expect to never get out of the first zone if you are soloist.If you are the sort of person that finds World of Warcraft requires too much skill or Eve Online too tedious, then skip The Secret World.  Also skip it if you have no tolerance for trying to register a game and the publisher won't accept your CD key and instead tries to get you to buy the game again.  Skip also if you hate games that try to sell you on being an empowered player and then says enjoy the corpse running.  A game almost 15 years old, Oni, did a better job at running and gunning, and it was fun.  I can't help but compare this to another flop that I wanted to like, ""Champions Online"".  It's pretty much that minus the travel powers, but with better story telling.			"

												Too much forced solo play for an MMO. I really wanted to like this, the lore is very Lovecraftian/X-files and the modern day setting was a breath of fresh air. Sadly, when I get the chance to play with friends, the last thing we want is to be funneled into our own instances, to play the content separately and in parallel. The game mechanics are very mmo-like and not especially fun of themselves, which begs the question why you'd play this rather than a more fun single player game. Not recommended unless you like to play MMOs by yourself.			"

												I wish I could write a review for this game. According to Steam I'm been playing it for some 97 hours... But that's not really true. See, I have never played it. Funcom's account management is not exactly easy to navigate... And when I finally got my account business all squared away, there is the problem with character generation... See, I get logged off the servers before even finishing the character creation. No other game does that, and I have a really ridiculously robust internet connection.Anyway, I hear it is a good. I look forward to watching videos about it on Youtube. But sadly, despite sinking a whole lot of dollars into this title, I don't get to play it.Caveat emptor.			"

												Im a huge MMO fan. But some of the popular titles just arent my thing. The huge NONO for me are the ones where you keep to spam one button over and over without any rotation required. This game falls into this category. There might be a pletora of skills. Sure, but if im limited to few on my bar i just dont care. If you get the Steam client, you are still forced to update the game on the laucher, wich disables you from trying the game before your time to turn it back runs out. Bought it on sale, so whatever, but its already gone from my hard drive. Graphics are outdated, animations are bad, story might be interesting, but combat ruins it completely for me. Cant recommend.

												I really love... errrr ""Loved"" this game, but i will be honest, unless you are willing to dish out a few hundread, Do not get sucked in. The issues cost about $25 each (You only get issues 1-5 with base game) unless you get the Ultimate pack (Which is $60.) I was really into this game  UNTIL THEY I DISCOVERED SOMETHING TOO LATE.  The cosmetics store stuff is over priced, and yes, I am a sucker for cosmetics, I mean who isnt right, but the way they get you is everything is CHARACTER BOUND!Sure, it says account wide, but there was fine print. Allow me to elaborate:* Clothing items are gender specific and will only be unlocked for characters of the same gender.In other words, if you buy an account wide item.. it is ONLY Account wide if you have ALL OF THE SAME GENDER! Yes, yes, I understand that it is my fault and what is a few dollars down the drain right? What ever happen to ligitament account wide items? I mean.. seriously, only unlocks for males on the account? GTFO with that.   /rantAnyways, the story is amazing, I will not deny that, but I feel like I got ripped off and I just do not like to condone that kind of stuff. I have dropped thousands of dollars to games simply because I want to support the devs (I am looking at you Riot and EnMasse) and have no regrets, but when you say account wide and then jip me for it.. na, ill pass.I guess this rant has gone long enough...Game: Solid 8/10Funcom: AnotherTrionDev/10			"

												The Secret World is a very close call for me.The NPCs, story-lines, dialogue, voice-acting, factions, and clothing-customisation are all great. I should really love to play this game.I do not.There are three main reasons:1) The UI is extremely frustrating, and borders on unusable. The widely varying font-sizes make it hard to read. The difficulty in customising the UI into a pleasing, or even useful, system is annoying, although getting a little better over the years. The various menus & windows are extremely unintuitive & hard to get useful info from.2) The combat. Oh, god, the combat. I find that every fight is you & the mob standing 1 foot from each other, and you're pushing 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2... or something similar until it dies. It might get more interesting later, but it's still likely to be just standing way too close to each other. Just some very unfun, irritating combat... and I actually often like tab-targetting combat in general.3) Many of the quests. Listen, a lot of the quests are pretty great when they're developing the story-line, and you're finding out about obscure NPCs, or interesting things that've happened, or general lore... but there are a pretty fair number of filler-quests that are ""Run down the block, kill 15 of __, come back, run back to the same spot, kill 20 of __type2"", etc.. There's enough of these that it gets annoying, because it seems that you're doing exactly the same motions over and over when you just want to get to the fun, interesting quests again.Now having said that... if you honestly don't mind having a frustrating UI, uninteresting combat, & repetitive filler-quests because your interest in story means more to you, then the rest of the game is extremely interesting and would be well worth your time. For me it was not, because I couldn't get over the frustrating elements.			"

												I'm running a 4790Kl @ 4.0GHz, 16GB DDR3, and a 270X which should be sufficient.I can tell that a lot of passion went into this project, but I feel like it was made by 100 people that have never met, released, and updated endlessly with band-aids rather than being fixed. I want so much to play and enjoy this game but my patience has been tested to the brink. It took a full day to download it and patch it. The patch tool bugged out (kept downloading even after it completed) and had to be restarted. Some of us still have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet (not by choice, but by monopolized service areas) and having to download 30GB and then 10GB and then re-download 10GB because the patch tool broke is really annoying.Then I finally started the game and all the intro screens glitch and stutter.LOADING...The videos for the factions stutter and I can't watch them.LOADING...Character creation: Oh wait, there is no character. All the squares are gray and there is no character present to customize.Restart.LOAD stutter LOAD stutter LOAD stutter.Look online for solutions: ""If you run it in a window the cutscenes work but the fps in-game are cut in half. Also don't use DX11.""OK, uh DX9 then. ""Must restart."" OK. Restart.LOAD stutter LOAD stutter LOAD stutter. No improvement on cutscenes with DX9. Turn back to full-screen.Character creation: Hey! Check it out! The character is not there but at least the gray squares have been replaced by actual images of reading glasses!::Google missing graphics in character creation... no dice::Still missing.5 minutes later, ""Oh wait, it popped up! Yay!""Wow, why does my character look like a dwarf girl with thunder-thighs? Why does everything look so PSONE?OK finally! I get to start the game!LOAD stutter LOAD stutter LOAD stutter... stuttering cutscene stuttering cutscene.COOL I get to finally play the game! Hmmm my clothes constantly disappear and reappear. I'm glad I picked the girl.Cutscene - she's bald and naked! Oh wait, there, her hair just popped in... OK now her clothes. Oh wait her outfit changed. Oh wait it is back.Finally - a day and a half in, actual gameplay. Wow, this really does look like a game from 15 years ago but the sound is good, music is good, seems like the story is going is cool. Oh wait. I'm lost. Oh, I can't accept this mission. Oh LORE! Oh wait, why bother showing the Lore detail text if it immediately flies off the screen. Wait, where should I go? OK this must be it. Oh no, this is a surgeon and I can't accept any of these missions. Ah I can't seem to skip his voice-acting. I'll wait. And wait. OK lower the graphics settings. OK zero issues with gameplay at the moment, just cutscenes (and they are everywhere).OK I made it to my destination. That was actually really cool. OK I met some NPCs and I finally have a weapon.Fight! Wait,♥♥♥♥♥♥I can't see anything. I appear to be fighting this monster while being inside it. OK tab shoot... tab shoot... I can't really see what is happening, everything is so dark. Ok next part. Uh oh, this is some kind of boss! Wait, glitch glitch... The game has gone black. There is a background noise and a black screen. I cannot do anything.Alt+Ctrl+Del - task manager > End task.Damn. So there you go. 9 hours of frustration, 20 minutes of gameplay and then a hard freeze.Imagine what I could be creating or what wonderful things I could be doing IRL instead of trying so hard to make this game playable. There's no excuse.			"

Character building is innovative and the modern day twist makes it feel real.So why would I not recommend it? Your friends will never play it and the people in game are just like you. Paranoid, delusional, consipiracy theorists who want to indulge in a World that placates to their whimsy.Now ask yourself. Would I reach out to talk to someone I don't know in game?Great, now you know exactly why this game is awesome but so heartbreaking at the same time.			"

												Seems like a promising game.  I am a fan of Funcom in general, I think theydid a great job on AO> However, the ""minimum"" requirements are prettymucha lie and total garbage.  This game will not run on older systems.  If you are evenanywhere close to the minimum specs, don't expect to run this game.  You candownload 40 gigs, play the intro, tutorial etc. but once you get to the first actuallevel with mulitple quests, tons of other players running around etc, just expectto crash constantly.  You need a solid rig, great GPU, 64 bit OS and tons of ram tobe able to run this game at all.   The game actually recommends you to get a 64 bit OS.  This might be fine if it were in the minimium reqs, but it's misleading as is.Hopefully the game runs great for those of you with awesome rigs, but for anyonehoping to run this game on the low end, forget it!

												I might recommend this if you just want a mediocre solo game.  The issue being there are much stronger solo games out there with much better storylines, graphics, and npc interactions.  I ackowledge that the story is ocassionally above average for an mmo, but I prefer social interaction and grouping in my mmo's... so as not to defeat the purpose of an mmo.  There seems to be a general reluctance to use any form of voice chat by players and a strong preference for solo play.  There is very little community and what little exists is largely relegated to build discussions.  If you want a solo game with in game forum accesss... have at it.  If you are seeking interaction with others, group strategy and mechanics... play an actual mmo instead.			"

												Let's start with the fact that I really wanted to like this game. Pros: story telling, the world, and overall atmosphere.Cons: Combat feels disconnected, animations are a bit weird, hard to play with friends.I bought a pack that included the Ultimate Editon + 2 months of membership - If I had gotten the game and I didn't have to continue to pay the monthly subscription that would be one thing. However without subscription things like jumping around the game started to cost in-game currency.I was trying to play with a friend which was fun - until we got to dungeons. Most dungeons seemed to be solo instances. In one particular case I struggled for about 30 minutes while my friend just had to sit and wait if we wanted to progress together. No, being in a party won't save you from this fate. My biggest disappointment though was the combat. It seemed a lot of repeatedly pressing one key over and over without feeling I was actually doing much. There's no real substance to the mechanism and it makes it feel very disconnected. The animations for combat are poor as well. And the online store is horrible. Half the time I was on website, half the time since I had purchased through Steam I was on another.			"

												I do and do not reccommend this game, The creators have made this game exceptionaly fun and a unique experiece. The gameplay and mechanics are very well done as is the story line and quest lines. HOWEVER.....some major things they messed up on.....badly. Making bosses that are extremely difficult and nearly impossible unless your a healing classs build....I do not exagerate this in the least....why is this?.....they make these boss fight's SOLO INSTANCES - you are by yourself even if your in a party. I run with two others that play it, one of us has made it, he is a blood magic/rifle build...a healer dps. I am a elemental/pistol build a dps tank. The third member is a shotgun/hammer build, a heavy tank.  Our healer has killed and surpassed every boss we have come across thus far....and we arent even off the STARTING area and we've been at it for 2 months. Me and the main tank however.....have not. Healing items are scarce and unobtainable outside random drops. Sure there is ONE vendor we know of who sells extremely weak ones, well below our levels but will only accept black bullion.....4 a piece and these bullion can only be obtained through completing quests, these are also used to buy the best ranked weapons and equipment for you at a time. At most you will earn 3-4 per quest that has 9-12 tiers to complete. I would be posting this on the normal forums however they seem to have been shut down or some such. My user name and password are no longer valid on them and I know I'm not banned as I've never recieved a notice nor have I ever posted before. They have disappointed me dearly, this could have been something epic.....sadly it has fallen short, one should not need veteran rated gear and weapons and or dungeon A+ grade gear and weapons to complete the task. They have decided to put raid bosses in the game without the choice or ability to have....ya know...a raid. A team of 8+ people. I have put money into this game past the initial purchase.....so I feel I have been ripped off and stolen from. I would rather see this game be done correctly....with the choice of having friends assist you...alas that does not seem to be the case anytime soon. Unless you plan on putting a butt ton of money into the game to get the high tier stuff early on.....I do not reccomend this game to you or anyone for that matter. - Correcting this two hours later after checking, chances are putting all that money in wont really matter either as the only usefull thing you could buy are more skill points.....which mean very little against these bosses.

												I wanted to like this game. The premise has amazing possibilities. But the execution ruins it.The combat system is bad-most of the time you'll be mashing the basic attack button while running in circles, hoping you don't get hit. Since the dodge move takes a while to recharge, you'll barely use it in combat, and most of the advanced attacks either take too long to prepare or are too ineffective to use against the majority of enemies. I haven't tried the PvP aspect, but if it uses the same combat system, it's almost certainly horrible.The quests range from ""meh"" to bad. Most of the time, they're simple: go here, get this and/or kill that, return. When they try to be more complex, however, they actually become worse- the stealth quests have you use tank controls mixed with some platforming to evade lasers and (erratic) cameras, while the research quests, aside from being convoluted in general, often fail in the actual research part: you are far more likely to find an online guide of how to do the entire quest than you are to find the answer you are actually looking for.The inventory system is also bad- the controls are wonky, the weapon upgrade system appears to be copied from Minecraft, and it appears as though you can't get more storage unless you pay for it through microtransactions.The story is better, but not by much. My biggest problem is with the intro- you gain magical powers and strange dreams by swallowing a random bee, then either (a) a representative from either the Illuminati or the Templar comes into your apartment, tells you that they're from a secret society, then hands you a either business card or a sealed letter; or (b) a representative from the Dragon comes into your apartment, knocks you out, kidnaps you, and dumps you on a random streetcorner in Seoul. Then, after some more visions, you join the faction and are sent to do their bidding. My problem with this is that, since your character never talks except for asking questions, you are seemingly ok with being kidnapped then ditched in another country (and possibly another continent, depending on where your apartment was).The factions are good, overall. The Templar and Dragon behave exactly how you expect them to (though I don't know how the Templar is a secret society when they have a building with their insignia plastered all over it). But the Illuminati? I don't feel like I just joined a secret society that is actually in control of the entire world. I feel like I just joined a corporation based in a sewer and composed entirely of the biggest morons on the planet.They have a trail of easily recognizable graffiti leading you to their HQ, Doc Brown himself as their chief scientist, and your boss? Within 5 minutes of meeting her she had told me her entire life story and made me wonder if my entire playthrough with them is going to be composed of jokes and references. Seriously, I don't know how they got the Illuminti so wrong, especially since all they had to do to make a good Illuminati is copy Deus Ex's.I'll admit that I haven't spent much time with this game, but I've seen enough to know I won't enjoy the rest. It had alot of potential, but it was wasted.			"

Unfortunately, I reached a point where I wasn't able to advance any further while soloing.  I wasn't interested in raiding or doing dungeons, so the MMORPG aspect of the game wasn't a big draw for me.  I still had fun while I played, though, and it reminded me of some aspects of Anarchy Online.			"

												I never played any MMO, this is my first. I couldn't resist the theme. I have to say, I find the game pretty hard, especially when it comes to bosses you have to defeat solo, but there's so much good in this game that I can't stop playing. I play with my brother and I kinda feel like Sam and Dean from Supernatural. Hunting various monsters (of all size), resolving impossible riddles (Taking notes is back!), meeting other players (Great community)... It's pretty cool. Maps are great, at least the ones I've seen, there're lots of different things to do, though you pretty much always end up shooting things. I couldn't do it alone, but lots of people do, it's hard but It's addictive. One of my favorite game!			"

												First of all this is going to be a salty, biased review (or rather experience) from someone who had a bad time.Game sounded great, I liked the idea, never really played an MMO before and this sounded like fun. The game takes a lot of GPU to run for what it is, and I visited the forums after trying to get this to work and they said a lot of users with beefy computers complain about FPS issues. The game is just programmed bad and won't work for some computers.For reference, I can run The Elder Scrolls Online (2014) on computer, well above the minium settings. I eventually found out that I can't run The Secret World (2012) at more than 55% of minium GPU settings. The RAM and processor is fine, though. I'm not going to say this game has bad graphics, but let's just say when I bought this, it had absolutely nothing to do with the graphics, didn't even come to mind. Never thought I'd have a problem, either.So the start of the game I'm at an almost playable 24 FPS, then when I'm in the overworld with a bunch of players it's virtually impossible to play the game. 8-12 FPS. For more reference, I've played recent-ish games like Dishonored and Alien: Isolation with smooth FPS and not problems.Anyways, I asked for a refund through Steam support. It was denied because I went over the 2 hours of ""gameplay"" with 5 hours. The thing is the first 3-3 1/2 hours were spent on the desktop staring at a broken installer & patcher. It kept going over. So say it's ""548 MB"" download, it'd show ""590 MB/548 MB"" and it'd just bug out. I did some googling and visited The Secret World forums. I've ran multiple ""repairs"" in the options of this patcher, which take a long time. Keep in mind the game is over 40 GB. And I'm just leaving it in the background, glitched out and incapable of finishing, then I find out through hours of digging in the forum that you have to disable your anti-virus. Did that and after 3 hours I can actually start the game.So, say you buy this and for whatever reason and you need a refund, technical issue or not, you could potentially lose your refund over a poorly designed program. The game never instructed me to turn off anti-virus, neither did Steam. I got about 20 minutes of a choppy, studdering tutorial, 3+ hours staring at a broken downloading bar, and an hour and a half of tweaking video settings while alt-tabbing to google people complaining about how the game doesn't run right.I have nothing against this game, I think I would have enjoyed it, but it shouldn't be on the store. It has too many problems. And Steam's customer support is the worst. No wonder they were graded an F. I'm going to go be a salty sailor and carefully research every game I download now.I hate people.			"

												After having played other MMO games like ''guild wars'' or ''Marvel heroes'', I find the interface terrible!I love ghost storys, mytholgies and scary monsters, but the gameplay and interface are just wrong for me.I guess the gameplay is do able with practice, but all the other stuff...There is almost no guide, or explanation of everything in the beginning. I don't know what to do, because missions are terribly given and there is mostly no information. In the start screen, the menu is ok. I know what buttons do, but in game. The menu is un user friendly to my thaughts. I tried to equip some clothes or something, ''for example'', now. I think the armor and items are gone or something! i could't find it anymore.I need some explanation and a guide in the beginning. Sure there was something i could say as an introduction, because it was skip able. In this cas rather, it was just you being trhown into the deep. Find stuff out yourself, know when you must equip stuff, know where you can upgrade or spend skills or something, know what every button does and how this game works, cause thats normal.Well. i quess what i am trying to say is:BUY AND PLAY IT,! ! !ONLY IF YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT AND HOW IT WORKS! ! !

The combat is the worst thing i have ever seen, ever. you use wsqe (thats correct) to move with a and d to turn left or right and q and e to strafe left or right, the mouse must be on right click to actully move and controll your character. this sucks beacuase the combat is you standing 5-10 meters away from you opponent and then hitting 1-5, if he gets close to you the you run away, repeat untill there dead. its boring and repetive, what more could you want.

												Swing and a miss. While this beautiful horror MMO has an engaging world, a fun character custumization tree, and fast-paced gameplay, it lacks one critical element: playability.  Multiplayer missions (which are optional) flow by quickly and are a blast to complete. Single-player missions (which are mandatory), by contrast, are three times as hard and painful to finish. While this may enhance the feeling of horror by occassionally forcing you to be all alone and out of your league, this makes it fail utterly as an MMO.  If I am signing on to play a few missions with my friends, and defeat a big boss, few things are as annoying as forcing the group to disband so we can each slog through the next segment of the mission seperately.  Since the single player missions are harder and therefore apt to take longer to complete, the result is that you sit around waiting for the one guy who is getting lost, or has a build that is all wrong for the misson to get through it, or to throw up his hands in disgust and log out. I want to like it, but I just can't.			"

												I'd love to like this and go into detail about why this is the best MMO, but it isn't.  Even if it was free, it has glaring problems with basic mechanics, progression, PvP, microtransaction bombardment, and even continuity (which is astounding for a game built on the premise of conspiracy theories existing). If the theme is something you love and you can overlook a lot of problems and a very small playerbase, go ahead and try this out but just be warned that the devs have a habit of forgetting to complete old storylines, ignoring bugs, and spending hundreds of man-hours developing content few requested.TL;DR Niche theme done okay.

I'm used to the standard MMO controls but it just feels weird in this. Nobody plays it, the quests are weirdly hard sometimes, it's really dark (lighting not story) and overall not worth it. I recomend Guild Wars 2, or World of Warcraft if u want to pay £9 a month. Oh also, they customization and leveling up is so ♥♥♥♥ing complicated I just don't get it.			"

												While this game is rich in the way that it tells its story parts, there are three main problems with it. The first is that you really determine how in depth your character is going to be when running around and piecing together the plot. Normally this would be a fine example of roleplaying if it weren't for the second problem. The second problem here being that you don't really have a character in this Role Playing Game. Sure, you have an avatar, that runs around and does things and hits all the appropriate buttons and whatnot, but you aren't really given much of an option to say anything in conversation to any one of the seemingly infinite number of quest givers. You can 'ask' questions afterward, but they don't really have much of an impact with all the people talking either like sceptics, zealots, or inferring everthing in a way that nauseatingly reminds one of 'Wicker Man'. So without any real Character building, the only role that you would play seems to come from the Society you join, however... The third major problem comes from there being no real difference between the societies. Of course, your taskmasters are different, you have different cutscenes and different cities that you are based in, but they still all ask you go to the same places, to do the same things, and nothing changes.Aside from the lacking in character, the rest of the game holds up well. The enemies are varied and lean heavily on horror inspired literature, the difference between the gloom and harsh lighting in the game gives the palpable feel of hoplessness the game strives to achieve, and the combat mechanics are very MMO.A decent game, but not one I'm willing to sink my teeth into.

The game will force you to play properly. I would honestly say that the game is not for everyone. The casual gamer will probly get frustrated with it and quit. That is why I am not recommending it. On the other hand if you like to be constantly challenged, this may be the game for you.			"

												Started off as a refreshing MMO experience, with quests that were original, intriguing and challenging - using the web to invesigate cases being a good example. However, the more you play, the more you notice the classic mmo trope of kill 20 of these, collect 10 of that, and the annoyance begins to grow. Couple this with bugs (should have been sorted by now) and a confusing upgrade system, and you have a game that, overall, isn't enjoyable to play.			"

												Okay so the premise sounds good: modern day setting, H.P Lovecraft theme (amongst others), free class system where you can switch around any and all skills available till you get exactly what you want.So to keep it short I will list pros and cons.Pros:-Questing storys have great dialog and voice acting...I'm pretty sure the guy who was Tuvok in Star Trek voiced a random character but I could be wrong-Free class system really helps you understand there is no need to ever reroll a toon (Don't do it, I thought about it a couple of times then kept playing some more and ended up getting what I would have rerolled for without much effort)-Great atmosphere-Really in depth and puzzling investigation missionsCons:-Glitchy old combat system-Dated graphics (but graphics aren't everything)-Feels extremely single player for an mmorpg (after looking this up I found that areas are instance based so there are never a ton of people around to break the feeling you are alone) but with this also come the empty almost useless chat box.  I know I am not at the end game yet but I still see people running about .  I wave and try to talk but in 30 hours only three people have ever responded (and yes all my chat systems are working fine).  I do see people but I get the feeling that while the game may not be dead and gone it certainly is on its last leg as far as population is concerned.  All in all so far for the beginning part of the game it is pretty lonely for an mmorpg.-investigation missions: you don't have to do it, and while it is certainly cool some puzzles are down right time consuming for the reward you get when you could just be doing others and when you use the internet to help you with clues...and you will...you have to sometimes... you will be bonbarded with sites that just flat out telling you the answer. (Not gonna lie half they time i just click them to get the mission over with)All in all...The game is a great game that will give you great stories and a fantastic atmosphere and you can really easily sink your time into it as long as you don't care about teaming up that often.  I recommend the game if you have free time, love Lovecraft and don't really feel the need to have much of a community to be involved with.  I don't recommend it if you want: a solid always there community, a game that you can play without thinking too much, and the classic leveling/gear system.  Also don't buy the expansion until you are sold on the game, I did and hopefully I'll continue to make it worth the while.  Still with the mmorpg genre really decreasing its a good refreashing game I enjoy playing hence why I recommend it			"

												Well - I have have only played one MMO before this game, and it was TERRA - which was a FREE skill based gameThis game is not skill based. I read online that the controls for this were 'typical' for an MMO - in that case, anyone who plays an MMO or thinks the controls for one make them good at gaming need to hang their head in shame.This is an interetive adventure, Monkey Island minus 5000 fun points. Utter, utter rubbish. Good story, wasted on a skilless cash grab.No wonder people say PC Gaming is dead, with this kind of carry on, I don't doubt it anymore.If you want to not use your mouse, play a console game, you useless gamers.

												Sitting at an endless download launcher for so long that it logged enough hours that i can now not chargeback. Beware! **Problem solved** the launcher freaks out if you have razer synapse running and has been a know problem since 2012 and hasnt been fixed.Now i am having the problem of it not accepting my username and password. I can log into the website, but when i log in in-game it says ""Authentication failure. Please not that passwords are case sensitive"". Everything about trying to play this game has been a wreck and i havent even gotten to the part where you have to create a character nickname that is damn near impossible because the name is either taken or deemed vulgar (my wife tried mstactical and it was denied as being vulgar)			"

												TSW lacks the social platform that's come to be expected within most MMOs. The mechanics remain untuned, the skill tree is sparse, and the quests are vague. You'll too often find yourself underleveled in a zone you shouldn't be because of the confusion surrounding quests.			"

												Okay so the premise sounds good: modern day setting, H.P Lovecraft theme (amongst others), free class system where you can switch around any and all skills available till you get exactly what you want.So to keep it short I will list pros and cons.Pros:-Questing storys have great dialog and voice acting...I'm pretty sure the guy who was Tuvok in Star Trek voiced a random character but I could be wrong-Free class system really helps you understand there is no need to ever reroll a toon (Don't do it, I thought about it a couple of times then kept playing some more and ended up getting what I would have rerolled for without much effort)-Great atmosphere-Really in depth and puzzling investigation missionsCons:-Glitchy old combat system-Dated graphics (but graphics aren't everything)-Feels extremely single player for an mmorpg (after looking this up I found that areas are instance based so there are never a ton of people around to break the feeling you are alone) but with this also come the empty almost useless chat box.  I know I am not at the end game yet but I still see people running about .  I wave and try to talk but in 30 hours only three people have ever responded (and yes all my chat systems are working fine).  I do see people but I get the feeling that while the game may not be dead and gone it certainly is on its last leg as far as population is concerned.  All in all so far for the beginning part of the game it is pretty lonely for an mmorpg.-investigation missions: you don't have to do it, and while it is certainly cool some puzzles are down right time consuming for the reward you get when you could just be doing others and when you use the internet to help you with clues...and you will...you have to sometimes... you will be bonbarded with sites that just flat out telling you the answer. (Not gonna lie half they time i just click them to get the mission over with)All in all...The game is a great game that will give you great stories and a fantastic atmosphere and you can really easily sink your time into it as long as you don't care about teaming up that often.  I recommend the game if you have free time, love Lovecraft and don't really feel the need to have much of a community to be involved with.  I don't recommend it if you want: a solid always there community, a game that you can play without thinking too much, and the classic leveling/gear system.  Also don't buy the expansion until you are sold on the game, I did and hopefully I'll continue to make it worth the while.  Still with the mmorpg genre really decreasing its a good refreashing game I enjoy playing hence why I recommend it			"

												So I decided to give this game a whirl...  first found out that Steam's ""Ultimate Edition"" is NOT the complete edition.  If you have patience you can find the Complete edition floating around for $18 or so....  but that was not my luck.  I had to spend another $18 on top of the original payment to make it complete.  Thus my irritation with the way this game is handled began from the start.The game itself is great.  Intriguing stories, great innovative character customization and development... until you finish the third major story arc then it comes to a crashing halt and becomes a grind fest.  Getting to this point you realize that the game is unbalanced as you progress.... Yes, you have all this freedom for customization but there's many points where your leveling mistakes will bite your♥♥♥♥♥hard.The game already does very little to hold your hand to figure things out, which is good, but the sudden focus on grinding in the 4th act strikes me as a weak attempt to add more content without actually doing so.  Simulation scenarios....  Joy, because I'd rather be doing X-men training room exercises instead of solving a mission.  *sarcasm*  Cripes it's not like there's a famine on Occult Detective or Urban Fantasy ideas.... but I digress.Funny thing... I let it all slide...  Funcom's ""store"" is filled mostly with crap costume items.  What would I need there?...I was a happy little bee leveling up and knowing my ""membership"" that I got with my Ultimate pack was about to run out.  I was ready for the decrease in EXP, Bullion, and Cash....  the 8 hour mission cooldown didn't worry me too much because I usually get on a few times a day and the cooldown never bothered me.  It says ""No Subscription Required"" right?  I wasn't too worried.Membership ran out:JESUS ♥♥♥♥ING CHRIST....  I found out the hard way that some mission cooldowns are almost THREE DAYS!!!  WTF! This is totally unreasonable.  Absolutely unacceptable.  Already forcing me to grind, but NO, I can't grind on the missions I like the most because, frankly, the others just aren't worth it or are boring.But wait... there's a 1 time use ""cooldown"" vial you can buy for about $5.... or just shell out $15 a month for 8 hour cooldowns.  Can I honestly reccomend this game?  UMMM..... NO.Overall...  Great game ruined by unbalanced progression and greedy game breaking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.-------------------I'm adding more because I'm bored.  Why am I bored?  Loading screens.  Be prepared... to wait... and wait... and wait... a fourth of my entire time playing seems like loading screens.  Those missions that have problems?  The ones where you have to go to multiple locations are the worst because of the endless loading.Gaaahh.... just fix it.  Someone put some shine on this pearl in the muck.  Please?  OH... wait.  It had been staring at me the entire time, like a giant 666 on the forehead, until it finally hit me.  EA...  right in my face, but now it's sunk in... EA has marked it... thus it is only for the damned.			"

												Basically when this game came out I was like, ""that sounds cool"" but I didn't think it was worth investing into another MMO.  Then they took away the subscription fee and I was like, ""maybe I'll check it out"" and then it was on sale so what-the-heck.  Basically first of all the actual ""societies"" are not as cool as you think they are, they are kind of lame.  There are missions that do not involve combat, which are different and interesting, but the game is still combat-intensive and honestly the combat system sucks.  The game comes down to an MMO gearscore grind, while the combat system sucks.  Low level PVP is a complete joke, or at least it was when I was playing it a year or so ago.  While it is ""pay once play forever"" you still have to buy the DLC or maybe call them ""expansion packs"" so that's another $30.  It was originally concept-developed by The Longest Journey guy, which I didn't even know but there you go.  Honestly it is just not that great of a game.  I don't play it for different reasons not limited to needing a new video card.			"

												- Game crashes way too frequesnt under 32 bit systems (50/50 on any loading screen), hence nop recommendation on purchase. - No player character animation, which makes one look like a mannequin among living NPCs- No player background to speak of. You discovered some spesial powers, you were recruted. You chose a weapon (why I considered needing one in first place?). Then we jump straight into action...- No connection of player to the story whatsoever. Why are we here, why do we care? Should we stick around, do we need something something from this place in particular? Why people we meet trust us, tell us stories about what happened? There are no answers to these questions.- World feels unfinished, like a painting where leaves of the tree are fine-made, but the whole picture is absent. Why is Kingsmouth left to its own devices, why no help is coming? Is something amiss in in world, and they are all alone, or there is some mistery bubble around them? Why they do not just evacuate the few living people left alive?- Very fast enemy respawn, making solo playing rather hard- Subtle progress of character+ Only two ""major"" servers (makes difference for PvP only) which makes trade, chat and all other actions easy and seamless+ Quests tips include item interaction, pictures, etc. + Quests cutscenes are possibly one of the best around+ No subscription+ grim Lovecraftian world living up to its promiseNA Style can be seen on screenshots, they are pretty accurate.NA Leveling differs from most online games__________________________Bottom line - playing possible only on 64 bit systems, pluses and minuses are mixed.

												As many people stated, there are aspects of the game that are fun and exciting. Then, there are the terrible aspects that just make the game not fun. Everyone talking about brain testing, is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They put an ingame browser in the game that you can access with the press of a button. This guide can access ANYTHING on the internet, so it's no brain teaser.Developing a character build is painful, because there just isn't a real point to building anything other than what you think would be fun. It is worth saying, the cookie cutter classes are kind of removed becuase you can actually master EVERY skill in the game. You're not bound to a specific set of skills. It's just mind numbing to try and mull through the days it will take to get the points needed.The combat system is just awful, and the lack of hotkeys makes it even worse. Every time you pull a mob, it always runs PAST you. This makes melee combat chains frustrating as hell. PVP is a joke, fighting over nodes and the normal song and dance. While not particularly exciting, the part that sucks is the combat itself again. You basically just have people who stand still and AoE because there is nothing to worry about. There is no skill or tactics, just spam your AoE and hope the other person dies first. The only part that is even worth looking into is the actual capture of the nodes, which is just more PVE.The conspiracy theory that fuels the game is interesting. The story drives you to want to play, it's just the other parts that make you stop. Lackluster character creation, inventory management, and a rediculous crafting system makes this game a no brainer. Find something better to play.			"

												The writing and story in this MMORPG is superb. Top notch. I loved the storyline and plot twists. Unfortunately, the game's difficulty level shot upward WAY too fast. Read up on builds and synergies to no avail. The ONLY way I could progress was by ""outleveling"" the content....which shouldn't have been both possible and necessary. Possible in the fact that the game touts ""no levels""...which is true in a sense. You..the character have no level. YOUR GEAR DOES. If you don't have the very best gear(which takes an ungodly amount of grinding to get) you're not going to get very far. Necessary in the fact that despite the advertised ""create your own character""...if you don't have certain abilities and weapon sets, you're not going to be able to complete even the basic storyline. The loot system is an archaic and terribad need/greed system.Character models are clones of one another, with badly represented character models from Age of Conan copy/pasted over.The grind starts early and doesn't let up. No, what could've been a visionary and revolutionary game went the way of the dodo.			"

												This game struggle to know if it's a mmorpg or a single player game. If you want to play with friends be aware that in this game they have something called ''solo instance'' you cannot do them with others and some of them are in the main quests, so you will have to do it everyone in their ''space'' and then wait for everyone to regroupe at the end.  For me it's a major flaw for a mmo. If you love pvp be cautious, yes the game say that you can build your own skillset and no class exisst, but in pvp you gonna see the same combo OVER AND OVER.I really wanted to love this game. Great music, great setting , descent story. But the game mechanics ruined it for me.			"

												Ok before you read the rest. I am an MMO veteran of about 10 years.  Started with WoW and played pretty much most of the MMO's on the market up until a few years ago.  MMO's can be fun but take ALOT of time to progress through all the content.  With that having been said, TSW is a VERY fun game to play.  I couldn't put it down for about 2 weeks. My wife was hounding me to hang out with her but I was so addicted to getting as many skill points as possible to get all of the abilities, that I put her off that whole time.  The game is very addicting if you like to progress your character.  TSW has three factions.  As you progress through the story (which is pretty fun too) which entails alot of content from HP Lovecraft's Cthulu Mythos, you will obtain faction missions that eventually make you rise in rank to the point where you're like a second in command of that faction.  When I played TSW a year ago, the Dragons were the least played faction and usually lost PVP most of the time.  If you want to pvp and have all the locations under your control, join the Templars.  What Funcom got right with TSW:  fun exciting storyline with all fully fleshed voice acted missions. The missions are hard and require doing research on the internet to get the answer.   Engaging character progression with the ability to buy any skill, any ability you want.  Thats it!  What Funcom got wrong:  TSW is still EXTREMELY linear.  You cant go to any zone you choose like a sandbox mmo.  You go through the zones the game deems is your level until you level up your weapon skills and equipment skills so you can equip higher level gear...that determines your level basically.  You'll notice after the first zone, your skills in whatever weapon you want are at 1 and progress to about 3 or so.  All the mobs go from yellow to green, meaning they are easy to kill, just like any themepark MMO.  Funcom states you are free from classes and levels.  This is bull.  You still have a class per se with the many decks the game reccomends.  Your levels are basically the levels of skill you put into each skill so you can move on to the next zone.  Its an utter facade.  In addition, the combat is utter garbage!  The controls are so incredibly clunky and unresponsive that its a test in frustration every time you want to engange a mob.  You dont have 50 abilities to use like in WoW, instead you have 7.  Luckily in thisg ame you can assign hotkeys but the abilites are so boring, the animations so stiff, that it's just plain frustrating to play the game.  It's unfortunate that funcom screwed up such a great concept for an MMO.  Modern setting with Call of Cthulu elements mixed in.  If it wasn't so themepark orientated and had such god awful control's and animations, it could've been an real gem.  Basically Funcom is milking the idiots that buy crap from their online store before they move on to another game.  I don't think TSW will close any time soon as Funcom's first mmo, Anarchy online, is still going strong after 12 years.  I would wait until it hits a 75% off sale then buy it as there's no longer a sub fee.			"

												I'm sorry but I just haven't enjoyed this game very much. Like any MMO, it can be fun with a friend but that's where the fun ends.Good:-Nice graphics with modern setting(something you don't see in typical MMOs)-Lots of different quests that come with cutscenes of very weird and mysterious NPCs-Lots of modern weapon options-Modern clothing customization is unique to this game- no other MMO lets you dress just as you do in real life!-Scary monsters that are fun to kill especially around Halloween season-No subscription requiredBad:-Players used to being told what to do will be completely lost in this MMO and its unique quest structure(kind that makes you try to play detective and decide on your own what to do next) (YOU WILL BE LOOKING UP HOW TO DO MOST QUESTS)-NPCs are mostly uninteresting and ramble around hoping you care to try to decipher what they are talking about-Community is nice, but mostly non-sociable and while you will always encounter people during your adventures, majority will not care to try to help you-Higher PC requirements than other MMOs(I can run WoW and GW2 just fine with my GT 555m but I struggle to run this game at a good FPS especially in highly populated areas)-Story(s) are mostly uninteresting-PVP is underwhelming-UI is still unintuitive to this date-Lack of direction early on in the game in what weapons and skills you should focus on could result in disaster(If you don't focus on just two weapons and instead try to be good at everything, you will ruin your character and will take a long time for you to get past many quests on your own)All this said, it's unique enough that I can see why most people recommend this MMO. I really have had some good times playing with others and I will probably continue to play this game to waste time. But it's definitely not my main MMO and I am not always having fun. At least not most of the time. Too many negatives for me to enjoy.			"

												If you like doing modernday call of cthulhuish horror mmo this game is for you.  Though getting punched in the butt by zombies while trying to figure out a puzzle gets very old after the 15th time.  I'll summarize the game a bit more for those curious.Reasons to buy the game:Provides a unique atmosphere in a modern day enviroment.Several large areas to explore in various terrains.Decent graphics and good visuals.Provides several puzzles and stealth areas as an alternative to kill grinding.Tends to be heavy story focused and not grind focused.There are tons of cutscenes for every quest NPC chacter.Reasons to avoid the game:A lot of the scares feel lack luster and not very scary after all it is an MMO.Other players will be more then glad to pull you out of the immersion with their outragous outfits and actoins.Puzzles at times can not work for you and can break.There are a hand full of issues with the game that cause it to freeze and crash.Enemy spawns are built for groups so, soloing it will get annoying exteremly fast.There is a leveling system where you gain points and spend them to allow yourself to get better gear thus better stats and content to high level for you will be unplayable until you grind up points and get gear for it.Theres a death penalty for a game that requires you to die to complete quests.The acting in the cutscenes at times can feel very forced and many have unbelievable backstories.The combat is pretty standard MMO fair and gets repetetive quickly.So if you want a modern day horror game with elements of puzzle and stealth go for it.  If you are looking for an MMO to solo or play for combat avoid this title.			"

												This is without a doubt the worst MMO I have ever come across! On paper I wanted to like this game, but I can't find a single good thing about it.  The world and areas are dull and lifeless, the missions vary from uninteresting to insanely complicated, if you try to use the web search for clues it becomes pointless as the top few pages end up just being the whole solution.  The crafting is terrible, grouping with friends half works, but missions don't always clock up together.  The combat is 'ok' at best, but  nowhere near good enough to save this game.			"

												I bought this game when it came out and I don't know if it's only giving me a month to play because at the time it was a monthly subscription or what. I finally downloaded it on here and it is utterly slow. I was above the spec requirements and it would just slowly do what I wanted to do. I thought it seemed like a pretty nice game though when it first came out, and the gameplay I played of it wasn't bad at all. Anyway I guess that's basically it ._. I hope you all have a nice day.

												Amazing story and surperb combat handling and a very customizational freindly game.  the reason why im saying hold on to your horses is the endgame.  as much as i enjoy TSW the end game has led me to stop completely,  having to find people to rerun dungeons of upscaled difficulty in hopes of advancing with gear to play with where everyone else is currently.  That or take up in three way pvp which isn't my fancy.  So here i am faced with three descisions that are semigly endless in possible outcomes, you ether enroll in a group and have to deal with that, go at it alone and hope to find some other people willing to go, or you perish and fade into nothingness.

												This is without a doubt the worst MMO I have ever come across! On paper I wanted to like this game, but I can't find a single good thing about it.  The world and areas are dull and lifeless, the missions vary from uninteresting to insanely complicated, if you try to use the web search for clues it becomes pointless as the top few pages end up just being the whole solution.  The crafting is terrible, grouping with friends half works, but missions don't always clock up together.  The combat is 'ok' at best, but  nowhere near good enough to save this game.			"

												First the positives; I thought the background had incredible promise. Um... I think that's it.You know, you can say a game shouldn't pander to the masses by making it too easy, so anyone who QQ's that this game is too hard can sod off. Well, that's the thing. Notwithstanding the fact that this game is all kinds of boring (unimpressive graphics, mind-numbingly boring combat, too much walking around), the quest items you have to find are too small making questing an innervating experience characterised by ""what the ♥♥♥♥ am I supposed to look for?"" Note I'm not complaining about the clues you have to find in investigations; its the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tiny quest items you ""use"". Additionally, the fact that you'll probably have to use the in-game browser to find clues for investigations is immersion breaking. It got to the point where I was bored of questing and just used the in-game browser to spoil everything so I could speed the game along.And the gameworld? What kind of genius thought it would be awesome to have chapter 1 of the story set in the incredibly exciting and awe inspiring setting of... small town America, which looks strangely like the dullest parts of New England or Maine. Oh, how I indulged in the vivid hues of brown and gray, traversing down two lane roads on my way to a (wait for it) cake shop. So, packed with my spirit boosting memories of this town, I pushed forward into Savage Coast to find yet MORE ♥♥♥♥ING HUES OF BROWN AND GRAY. The designers really need to learn how to pace questing and environments - it gets incredibly dull after a handful of tens of hours, still waddling around the same place. WoW made sure that you saw something different just perfectly at the point when had enough of an area; TSW bludgeons you to death with tedium and does nothing in the way of variety.Seriously, what are the designers proposing in this exercise of tedium? What kind of players are still playing this and defending its game experience? Most probably a bunch of tragically clueless dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't buy.			"

												Your mission; to choose one of three maid services and clean up the filth pouring into this world.Welcome to the secret world of janitorial services.The 'choose your character' gimmick is actually a very standard level up system for MMOs. Most of the skill points earned while leveling will be making mistakes as like other open skill choice systems, there are more bad decisions to make than good. The punishment of choice escalates the further you progress, effectively bricking characters as you learn about the game and adapt.The puzzles are beyond obtuse. For example, no where in the game does it tell the player to kill themselves and enter ghost form to solve anything. How would you know if you play safe and don't die? So much dumb is included in the main story quests, let alone the side missions.Voice acting is very good and I only stuck around to see how bad the puzzles got. The writing is hit and miss though. I screenshotted about 12 scenes where the dialogue was rhetorical and needless for the sake of being cool. I would have more if I continued doing after the second hour.In case anyone thought a World Of Darkness MMO could be good, this game mirrors what that sort of game would be. Mostly flash, and a standard grind-a-thon MMO with heavy padding. I would loosely recommend this game when using a walkthrough. Without one, it's hell.			"

												ADDED: Tried one last time. Then uninstalled. Money gone. Funcom made this subscription-free because everyone canceled. The game is a ghost town and the controls are unusable. Money wasted.ADDED: I gave this game a second chance. It's just awful. There is no question why this game was a flop -- the controls and interface are a complete disaster. I can only imagine when they were making the game (it was over schedule by years), play-test after play-test resulting in testers going out of their minds about how horrible the control is, and the devs ignoring them and saying ""you'll get used to the awfulness"". You just want to scream at the dorks responsible for putting this game together for ruining a great idea.PREVIOUS: WHY did I buy this game? This POS has the worst contols of any game I've played. Jesus, what a mistake. No wonder this game was DOA when it came out.			"

												I wanted to get back into the Secret World and after trying initially to patch to 1.9.1, it failed and got an error.  So I did a database repair, which took a fair bit of time and then it tried to patch again, onace again error..and actually close to finishing too.  Desperate at this point I deleted the entire game from my PC and started over, waited while it downloaded the entire game from scratch hoping there was a client that included all new patches, I was wrong, it STILL had to patch to 1.9.1.  Guss what happened next?  I got ANOTHER error only a few 100 megabytes from being finished.  I give up Funcom, I cannot in good conscience reccommend a game that causes such frustration and wastes so much of my time!!  But on the flip side I wanted to play it again because before thyis current problem I really enjoyed the game!  *Sigh*  Maybe one of your support people will read this and take pity and offer a solution!

( solved this, graphics bug showing pointer higher than it actually was )This left me with a character I just had no real bond with........ ( character creation should be a great time for a new player ) ~even ingame with the plastic surgeon did exactly the same thing, you try to click on a different facial feature and the camera angle just turns or zooms..so frustrating.Skill table : Was just the same normal skills but made into a big pie chart, big deal. Again felt like no real path for your toon, just pick up any weapon and start to master it.Loot: Lack lustre, never got any good gear just bags of green vendor trash, no clothes items as rewards, nothing.If you want clothes, you have to buy them through the online shop ~ this was a big fail for me.You end up running a toon you didnt get to create at start up and then wearing the same look for 40+ hours. = boring.You need weapon craft tool kits to make new weapons, it took more than 20 hours of play to finaly get one by then I was over it.Combat: Boring, it is just a key mash, mash an attack, wait for it to build up 5 power then mash the power attack key, rinse , repeat. = boring.Mob AI is basic at best, I had no challenge whatso ever, at one point i just ran in a circle with my HoT on while spamming a sword AoE, everything died, even supposedly hard area bosses. It was a joke.Some monsters had telegraph AoE attacks you can jump out of but the lag and key mashing most of the time you just stand in it.Dungeons were dull, just the same random groups of mobs with a few bosses, no real challenge, just run the same one a bunch of time.Group dungeon finder is terrible. You have no idea what dungeon group to join because there is no item level guide to help. ( what dungeon drops what level of gear )Zone chat was dead, I came across 4 other people outside the starter area. Only time I really saw anyone was from dungeon finder or back in main hub where the auction was.Never saw any chat going at all in zones, asking questions was a waste of time, you are alone.This game should have been great.It was a nice idea but I can easily see why its not hugely popular.Even the graphics for character NPC faces looks bad, SWTOR which is an older game is way nicer.The music and dark scary areas are nice but the massive lack of excitement from character creation, loot , class skills just makes the game very boring.The game just never drew me in.I took sword and fist combo which allowed for heals and dps, making me almost unkillable.Game felt too easy and I was just waiting to see the next big role to play in the game, but it was ... go there, kill this, go there kill 10 more ( I thought we were over these types of quests? )30 hours game time max before the boredom starts to take over.Get it if you have nothing else to do.

In December 2012 Funcom said they would fix the memory leak in a patch, its been two years now without any other contact from Funcom.Instead they ""encourage"" their customers to upgrade their computers to 64 bit (basically getting new computers with more hardware) instead of fixing the memory leak.That does not inspire confidence in Funcom as a company, you buy this at a great risk so dont bother paying full price.Its unplayable for a large portion of all players who first bought it.

Loved the feel of the game and how you could be everything after you took the time to learn all the weapons and powers.  Sadly, after 2 1/2 to 3 years I burned out due to excessive grinding.  I've checked in from time to time and the game has continued to add fun stuff.   Will definitely be checking out Legends when it goes live.You really have to lol at least he butthurt crybabies handing out bad reviews like candy.  Try the game as it is now and see if you like it, but keep in mind Legends will have some differences, though (supposedly) the same kind of vibe.			"

												TL;DR 50/50 Secret World tries something new in the MMo genre and I don't think it works too well. Its an MMo you're basically going to love it, or truely hate it.   My biggest problems with Secret World is that it tries something different from the traditional MMo genre and honestly, it just really doesn't work to well.   So many quests are downright stupid, the player has to constantly press (B) to open up the in-game web browser and actually search for hints and solutions to quests because most just don't offer you any information at all - so that browser becomes a huge crutch through-out the entire experience.   I found very few of the usual cookie cutter kill X amount of mobs, or typical fetch quests that most MMos have - The problem that secret world has, is trying something new other than the cookie cutter, and I think for most people - it doesn't make it fun.   Far too many quests which try to make the player actually think, or solve complex puzzles -  (one puzzle actually requires you to read the bible in RL ~ luckily the web browser can pretty much give you all the information you need to skip that) These issues basically create a massively steep learning curve thats exceptionally harsh without doing plenty of research first,  such as what build your doing to make - any DLC your going to buy into ~ how to craft, how to allocate your skill points.  Everything isn't very new player/newb friendly. I personally had graphical issues too, many quests especially stealth missions are so poor that most are trial and error, or again - look up that online guide how to do it.   The first few stealth missions, I died constantly due to near invisible laser tripwires - seems to be an issue with nvidia cards, also the game constantly crashes each time I exit the game. It seems the developer also has taken a nickel and diming approach to the so-called free to play method,  the item store is full of good stuff...of course if you want to pay for it,  the problem here are the issue packs which are essentially the expansions,  if you really want to invest time and effort into this game, then the ultimate edition is the only way to go unless you want to spend a small fortune later.  Also worth mentioning is if you buy the individual packs on steam, you only get the regular versions,  so if you actually wanted the cool items, costumes etc - that would cost you ""double"" the money.   Example, I purchased the Tokyo DLC and I originally assumed that would come with the school uniform, title and gadgets but no,  a 1620 point ($15) extra cost was needed on top of the $15 cost for the DLC, making the actual cost of the DLC $30 for one DLC...  Each issue has its own dedicated 'collectors edition' which has all the cool items and obviously a huge price tag to match.			"

												I had high hopes for this game when I saw it at first. The trailers and game play is over played and is not what the game is fully like. Played for a while, the UI was horrible, The game lagged heavily during certain cutscenese and quests, as well as the combat system felt like I was trying to control my character while they were waist deep in tar. Over all I would ask for my money back if it was possible, a huge let down.			"

												MMORPG or not, this game has the worst controls (re-mappable or not) I've ever seen. Controling your character is an absolute chore. You know every 3rd person game you've ever played? You know how when you move the mouse, it moves your characters direction? Yeah, TSW doesn't do that. I tried for an hour an a half. I really did. But I don't think I'll ever come back to this game. As great as the reviews are, the controls are a game breaker. I've never played something so disorienting and backwards in regards to the controls. It's a bummer. Enough of a bummer to keep me away.Money lit on fire.			"

												I would not recommend this game, very glitchy and extremly boring. I got lost the majority of the time playing, and I quickly got bored and it's not worth the money or time. A very boring story line that doesn't draw you in for even a minute, and the combat feels lazy and uneffective. There are way better MMOS out there that are free or worth the effort. This just feels like they rushed it way to fast for me.			"

												Bought the game when it came out. It was fun, kept me entertained for a while.Went free to play. Didn't think much of it. Lost interest in the game and never went back.Recently decided to try it out. Spent an hour jumping through account/password retrieval hoops. Attempted to log in through multiple accounts, finding that every single one was not connected to a Secret World account.Even my e-mail that had the receipt for the stupid game was no longer connected. No payment history of the subscription fees I paid. Now I have to go through customer support, show them that I bought the ♥♥♥♥ing game, etc. etc., if I want to play.Now that I've put this much time trying to play the game I own, I've completely lost interest. It wasn't good enough to put up with this horse♥♥♥♥♥♥GG funcom. I tried to come back to you. I wanted to love you. But you took my house and all my money, now I have no job and I'm out on the street while you're ♥♥♥♥ing other guys.			"

												When I heard about The Secret World coming out, I was pretty excited.  Finally an MMO where its modern day and you are thrust into a Lovecraftian style world with horrors abounding.  I was even more excited with I found out it was going free to play.  I happily coughed up some cash at some point when it was on sale and off I went.  While I have a big red thumbs down I want to list the pros to this game.  The story is fantastic, the puzzle elements are GREAT, the music is decent.  However, as I sat there and played this, I felt that it wasn't really good material for an MMO.  It felt more like a really good RPG than an MMO.  Furthermore, combat is kinda crap and your choices to wage war on the darkness are extremely limited.  Its sad to say but when the combat element of a game like this is unfufilling, coupled by the fact that enemies are everywhere swarming you, it just feels like a job.  And honestly as cool as some of the puzzles are, I'd rather there be more of those and less combat.			"

												I don't get why people are going crazy about them keeping the reviews from TSW for Legends. Sure, it's a lot of changes, but it's intended to be more of a major overhaul, not a new game in itself (just a free to play ""re-launch"" of the existing game.) Sure, the changes may turn out bad, we don't know yet, but it's still the same game, just changed. You might as well say it's dishonest for ALL games to keep the same Steam listing and reviews when they're updated.			"

												Unfortunately no MMO has yet unproven that once you got tired of WoW it will be difficult to find any MMO enjoyable.The Secret World could have came close, since there are some things which are different enough (investigative quests and class builds), but unfortunately much of the content is still the same (go there, collect N of that, kill X of that, escort Y, etc.) and the combat is seriously repetitive, especially when you start off.The bigest problem though is the population.

												I can't recommand this game to anyone. I know there are many positive reviews, but these people must be gettings something else out of the game. The first 2 areas of the game are poorly designed. There are many quest which are harder than the abilities you could acquire at that level. Unless you are one of the folks that like doing a quest dozens of times, eventually you just get tiered of repeating the same quest and getting no where. If I had not bought the game, I would have stopped playing it weeks ago. I'm at the point now that there is not enough fun in the game to justify continual playing.  Use my review as a warning save you money and buy a better game. You will thank me later and you mouse and keyboard will thank you since you are not beating them in rage.			"

												If you like MMOs you should like TSW:UE. It is a little harder to solo after you reach certain levels in zones and has a slight learning curve for the slower learners. Graphics seem just fine to me for its age. You can level up by repeating quests which is nice because you can pick the ones to do over that you liked before. I am not sure if all are repeatable but most are. The story line for each faction is interesting as well. Who doesn't like the question or workings of secret societies? If the Ultimate Edition is on sale it is a no brainer to just pick this up to play alot or just occasionally for free. At full price I still think it is well worth the price. If there are any quirks in the game I don't usually worry about it unless it is a game breaker and I have not experienced any of those yet. I do have some videos of game play on my youtube with no sound or altered sound because of copyright music complaints so I am sorry about that. You can play your own music while watching. I say buy and enjoy whether you like MMOs or not since it has an interesting lore to it.			"

												For starters, it just didn't feel right. The second I started actually playing after all the cutscenes, I realized how awkward the controls were. Instead of the usual A and D strafe left and right, they turn you left and right, like how Doom originally was. You can rebind the keys, but it just makes things more awkward when you realize that you HAVE to use the turn function because thats the only way you can have your character face a differet direction, the mouse can turn the camera, but you have to hold down left click, and it doesn't move your character with it. Even though the controls sucked, I stayed to see how the combat was. I was dissapointed yet again. It turns out the combat is nothing like a shooter should be, like it was in the game Defiance. It was awkward also in how you have to press the number keys to shoot, instead of pointing and clicking with the mouse. I feel that this game would've been much better if it used more modern intuitive controls. I realize that this obviously wasnt supposed to be a shooter like Defiance was but I just find this type of cheapy MMO controls to be awkward, and unintuitive. I was expecting this to be like Defiance, but even cooler with different monster filled setting, but it was just a really awkward MMO that was nothing that I expected. I'm glad I got this when it was only 10 dollars, but I still want a refund. If your looking for a fun, actiony and quickpaced MMO, this doesn't seem to be it.			"

												I think if a male player character was forced to get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from another man, as part of the player's intro to the game, and the male player's character saw it as sexy, then I wouldn't be offended. After all, that'd be fair play. Because in TSW, if you play a female Dragon, you get oral sex from another woman as part of your character intro. You don't have a choice. But don't worry, it's not♥♥♥♥♥♥ your character wants it. This is typical lesbian fetishism, which I find offensive. It trivializes female sexuality. If male characters had to have a homosexual experience, then things would be equal, but for guys, this is a ""no homo"" game. That's sexist, because over and over again in video games, women are trivialized. This is an extreme case.I've noticed that, on forums, fans try to defend what happens. They point out the one giving the oral is a kumiho. In addition, they proclaim, nothing's explicitly shown. But come on: an incubus or other creature could easily appear for the men. There's no reason for homosexuality to be mandatory for girls alone. The kumiho even has a mysterious, demonic dude with her. Considering popular past reactions to games, and other media, two men being sexual would make too many male gamers uncomfortable. Male gamers got offended with a bisexual man in ""Dragon Age: Origins"" hitting on them. You can imagine how these same guys' male characters getting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from a male NPC, and making O faces in joy, as an intro to a game, would go over. It'd likely be hotter than ""Hot Coffee"" in the media, too. But woman on woman? Apparently that's seen as a perk for male players/sexy/easily ignorable, in comparison to man on man, and it doesn't get much attention. Meanwhile, people who protest are also often labeled as whiners, which is common for fans to do on anything. That brings up the next point the fans make: that nothing's shown. They try to say it's your own dirty mind assuming oral sex happens. When one person leads another to a bed, in a hotel, hovers over the person, moves his/her mouth seductively over the person lying on the bed, puts his/her head towards the person's crotch, goes on about giving, ""a moment of ecstasy,"" is a mythological creature all about sexual seduction, and your character makes an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic face -- that's not vague. That defense is like saying a box which says ""condoms"" might contain toothpaste, and you have a dirty mind for thinking otherwise.As for game-play? The idea of no levels is appealing, but it's moot. It supposedly goes off of skills instead of levels. Yet, the lack of levels isn't as imaginative as it sounds. The point with levels in tabletop RPGs is to gain experience to get better stats/skills. You get those stats/skills by leveling up, but levels are nothing more than exp markers, really.  So although you don't get a level number you can see in TSW, character levels aren't gone. Your gained experience points work the same as levels. They let you improve your skills and what stat-affecting gear you can equip. If you try to attack things which have more stat-power than you (aka are higher level), you'll lose. You won't do much damage and you'll take too much yourself. Essentially, this means that there IS a level system, but it's hidden. The only real difference is you don't see the exact level number on your character sheet.The skill tree looks like it allows for decent customization, but I wasn't terribly impressed with that. Most games allow for customization. And in most games, if you spread out your skill points too thin, then you're gonna have a bad time. So, TSW being classless isn't a big deal. Its point system is similar to many other games'. The skills available didn't look amazing, even when combined with others, but with the right tweaking you could probably find a play-style which would work for you.  Then there's the nauseating camera, which occasionally goes through the wall if you're in 3rd person-view. (There may be a way to lock it.)  Targeting was a little shaky but likely, once you get used to it, it'd be easy.The voice acting isn't great, either. The Dragon folks sound like they're straight out of a bad kung-fu movie. Unfortunately, the rest of the game's features, at least for the first couple of hours, lack enough awesome or corny to make this seem fun. It just seems lame.This means the real appeal would come story-side. That's why I originally wanted to get into it, too. However, the first two hours failed to compel me (I played 2, but I guess I went a little over since Steam's saying 3, and it's rounding up.) Instead, it bored me.  Before everything else, I was chasing butterflies, and my mute character listened to NPCs monologue boring dialogue. The script wasn't entertaining to follow. Since the game's story was pathetic right away, followed by it thinking it'd be oh-so-cool-and-kinky, I'm done with it. There are better games I'd to play, and the sexism was extremely off-putting.

												First of all, ignore the hours played according to Steam. This game can be played while Steam is closed. I have played over 30 hours of The Secret World.That being said, I'm just not having much fun. Let me give some background and say that this is my first MMORPG. I have never played WOW or any other traditional MMORPG before. I have played many online, PVP and PVE games, but none of them were traditional MMORPGs. PROSThis game is beautiful and dark. The game world is experiencing a devastating apocalypse from the Lovecraft universe, with some of the coolest monsters and characters as I have seen in any game. The storyline is pretty average, but interesting. The side missions are really well thought out, original, and entertaining. The community is also extremely friendly, which is a huge plus.CONSDespite all of the good points, this game is just not very fun. First, the small points: though the story and side missions are nice, your character is a mute: literally. NPCs will straight out ask your character questions and you will just stare back at them. This quickly devolves a thrilling mysterious plot into a pathetic attempt at humor (but it's not even funny), when a character says something like ""how does that strike you"" and you numbly stare off into space followed by their response, ""I agree, it doesn't even deserve comment does it?"" They could even have just made your character gesture or something and it would make more sense!Also, getting around is a pain until you put in enough game time to save up a ton of money to buy the sprint upgrades. The fastest one being a long way into the game until you can buy it (somewhere around 50 hours).The worst offense though, is the combat. Granted, there are a variety of weapons that you can mix and match at will, however, regardless of whichever two you choose, you will be spamming the same moves over and over again to level your character. Your weapons and attacks seem almost completely ineffectual, slowly chipping away at enemy health. Even the weakest enemies (zombie hordes) will waste your time, because you still have to use your cooldown attacks (special attacks) to defeat them quickly. Any game worth a buck would allow you to kill the weakest enemies in only a couple hits.On top of the combat are the million and one stats that you have to juggle for each build. I have probably spent hours just moving attacks, passive abilities, and weapons around trying to find a combination that is more powerful or fun to play. However, they are all so well balanced (good I guess) that there is little change between build, and so I still spend hours grinding to complete missions. If you have played MMORPGs in the past, I'm sure you are familiar with DPS, Tank, and Healer, which, surprise, are the same three possible classes to create in this game. I know that there is a common jargon among MMORPGs with acronyms like ""DPS,"" but Secret World does the thing where they replace all the original, well-known, terms with new ones in an attempt at originality. So ""hate"" is actually ""aggro"" and ""afflicted"" is actually ""bleed."" Which is compounded by the fact that many of the community members, even those that write the wikis/guides for new players, use the old terms instead of the ones used in the game.All of this combines to create a repetitive process: you grind away at identical enemies for hours using the same attacks to receive some moderately better equipment and a level or two, to move on to a new area/mission that is more challenging, to then grind for hours until you receive moderately better equipment and another level or two, stopping every now and again to mess with your loadout for an hour and then repeat the whole process again. I realize that this all sounds like how MMORPGs work, but then would someone please explain to me what is fun about that? Doing the same attack for five hours on the same enemies cannot be defined as fun.			"

While almost every game has memory leaks of some form, this one is very specific to 32-bit OS. Secret World loads massive amounts of memory at a time, more than the limitations of a 32-bit OS can handle.This is a known bug to Funcom, and while announcing that they will look into it, have done absolutely nil. This is a problem that has been present since beta testing. There is no know work-around. On the store page, they state a 64-bit OS is ""highly recommended"".

												The Secret World is an MMO for the masochist.During a quest, I was told to approach a black van and attempt to identify the people the van belonged to. In the back of the van, there was a laptop with a password prompt. The password's hint was 'my wife.' After some lengthy exploration, I was able to find two bodies not far from the van. They had ID cards, one was a man, and the other was a woman named Lucy. I returned to the van to type in her name, positive that I had the correct answer, and was met with an 'Incorrect Password' screen. I spent approximately 20 minutes running back and forth between the bodies 50 yards away and the van, inputing any combination of first name, last name, email addresses, and even the 15 digit number code on the ID. Nothing. I even realized at one point that they had different last names, so I tried Lucy's first name with the man's last name. Nothing.At long last, I had to Google the answer.

Very little information is ever given for any quest, enemies in the game are unfairly cruel, there is virtually no indication of enemy or regional level, and the puzzles are eldritch and backward.The final straw in playing this game was when I was oneshot by my companion 4 times in a row.I hope this review helps in your decision on The Secret World. Overall, it can be fun experience, just be aware that you need some level of masochism to enjoy it fully.			"

												The Secret World is an MMO for the masochist.During a quest, I was told to approach a black van and attempt to identify the people the van belonged to. In the back of the van, there was a laptop with a password prompt. The password's hint was 'my wife.' After some lengthy exploration, I was able to find two bodies not far from the van. They had ID cards, one was a man, and the other was a woman named Lucy. I returned to the van to type in her name, positive that I had the correct answer, and was met with an 'Incorrect Password' screen. I spent approximately 20 minutes running back and forth between the bodies 50 yards away and the van, inputing any combination of first name, last name, email addresses, and even the 15 digit number code on the ID.

												No subscription required. There is a reason for that. The servers constantly go down, inviting for parties fails frequently, combat is buggy and poor, weapons are uninspiring and you spend most of the time running around and not actually combating anything. Is it worth it? Sadly no. This game had a lot of potential but Funcom just couldn't pull it off it seems.  Recommend passing on it.			"

I thought it would be cool to explore the world of HP Lovecraft, but the fact that it is riddled with lots of bugs makes my experience less enjoyable.-No leveling system.-Hardly anyone on.-Server I play on is a ghost town. -The dungeons and raids are way to easy.-The plans for future content is very small.-They haven't added any new content in a very long time.-Doesn't play well with the newer gpu's AMD R series or Nvidia 700 cards.

												This is probably one of the only games I've ever played where the developers managed to set perfect examples of both what to do -and- not to do in one game. Some of the design choices the developers made were absolutely phenomenal, and should set an example for future MMORPG's looking to add a unique twist to their quest design. The setting for the game was also very interesting. They successfully tied conspiracy theories, obscure mythology, and even lovecraftian elements into the game that made it a blast to explore and see what you were going to run into next. There was also a unique skill system in place, where leveling up did not particularly make you stronger. Instead, it gave you points you could use to purchase more skills or traits to use better equipment. One extra little tidbit worth noting is the fact that it has an in-game browser so you can look up different things in-game to help you solve puzzles or look up information, which really helps with the immersion when paired with the great quest design. Unfortunately, the game falls tragically short of what it could have been. To start, pacing in this game is extremely inconsistent, this is partly due to the odd skill system they implemented. There were times I would be progressing fine through the game, only to reach a main story mission or rank advancement mission that was nearly unbeatable. One would think to simply go and level up in this situation, but unfortunately that method does not translate very well into this game due to the odd skill and equipment system. Also note that these extremely difficult missions were not the unique stealth missions they implemented where the enemies are significantly harder forcing you to be stealthy, these were enemies I had to kill -alone- to progress in the story. Oh yes, there are solo instances as well. These solo instances are also some of the hardest missions in the game.       Overall I really want to like this game. Actually no, I really want to -love- this game. But unfortunately, due to the terrible pacing, senseless solo instances, and overall buggy nature of this game, the great quest design and setting cannot carry this game past its negative elements. I understand trying to be different and, ""shooting for the stars"" so to speak, but I feel the developers got too ambitious and ended up trying to make the game -too- different, which sacrificed solid game mechanics and ended up being a detriment. If it goes on sale and you really want to try it out or see an example of great quest design then go for it, but otherwise it isn't really worth the money assuming they don't fix the pacing and scaling issues that sometimes made it unplayable.

												Well, I played it four a couple hours now. I bought the Massive Edition. I can't get past the controls, The commands are all over the key board. I find it to be quite clunky. No team work at all, everyone one just ignores each other. Graphics are ok, But my god the camera gives me a headache. It would be better if you could move around with the left mouse button. WASD controls with the 1234 commands are all you will be doing. Zombies spawn out of no where, annoying. I hit T so switch to crosshairs, and its messes with the whole interface. The interface is choppy, I click on a button like 5-10 times before it registers. I can't say anything about the story line because I havent gotten very far. I dont think it's worth $30, Definetly not worth $60! I feel like they put some effort into the game, But the controls are a real let down for me.			"

												Generic MMORPG. It tries to be clever and different but ends up being clunky, awkward and uninspired. I don't hate it; it can be fun but often it's more of a grind. The final nail in the coffin to any would be buyer would be that this is an MMO yet most of the story missions are SOLO ONLY. So if you solo in MMOs anyway, this won't be a problem for you. For the other 95% of you that play MMOs you will need to bear this in mind before paying for it. It has a plethora of other issues too, like inconsistant aggro ranges, some mobs which are too hard to find and some mobs which are packed so tightly that you have to spend a ton of time fighting through them to do the many fetch quests, often fighting the same spawns more than once because the mobs respawn so quickly and are packed so tightly, so by the time you've killed something and are fighting the next mob, the previous one has just respawned. I wouldn't recommend this game unless it's on sale. Luckily it doesn't have subscription fees anymore, so it's a pay once game, unless you want to pay for microtransactions, which I'm glad to say, aren't pay to win. All things considered: 5/10. Not horrendous but definately nothing to write home about. Far too generic and shoddily made for me.			"

												Can't recommend this garbage.It was on my radar since launch, but I kept holding back, not wanting to spend another monthly sub.  Once it went Free to Play, I had other games I was more interested in.  Had the chance to grab Ultimate Edition on Bundle Stars for 12 bucks and did so.  First sign of trouble - took a full - and I mean FULL - 24 hours to download the game.  Granted, it's 18 gigs but I get 5gig games down in 2-3 hours, so this was not a pleasant surprise.Played a little while, thought, well, it's ok, then the crashes started.  Drop into desktop for no reason and no error message.  The main transition hub where everyone passes through is a slideshow every time.  I was shocked at how un-optimized a game from 2012 is.  The final straw has been the sudden appearance of the infamous ""Loading Screen Freeze"" where a transition from one area to another leaves you staring at the loading screen, your HD spinning and the progress bar going nowhere.  You can leave it for 20 minutes that way and never get back into the game.  The only thing you can do is start task manager, kill the process and re-log.  Do that once every 30 minutes and you'll be to where I am, uninstalling and going to find something else that is going to work.  I'm sure it works for other people and my first 15 or so hours (after the 24 hour download) was enjoyable.  But the warts and problems soon were very apparent so I'm cutting my losses and dumping the game.			"

												DO NOT WANTBut seriously, this is the worst MMORPG I have ever touched, Do yourself a favor and shell out a little extra for a game like Guild Wars 2 or even WoW, this game feels like they didn't even try to polish the experience, The character customization is abysmal, the only noteable change is gender and shin color, and they try to coner up this oversight by letting you pick the color sweatshirt you want to wear. They decided it would also be super cool to give us a super janky web browser, even though both steam and oh, I dunno, OUR ♥♥♥♥ING COMPUTERS already have web browsers! This game just tried too hard to pander to too many fandoms in a market the developers clearly know nothing about. They took an amazing concept with boundless potential, and♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it. Please don't make the same mistake I did, do not purchase this.TL;DR.5/10 stars, and they only get that half a star because this game has Cuthulhu, or so I heard, I uninstalled this garbage before I could make any noteable progress.

												The only thing I ""recommend"" with this game is that you keep your $50 and wait and see if this goes free to play if you're interested. I do like the free movement, cast spells and use abilities while your moving action it has going on, but the story isn't interesting the graphics aren't that good, voice synching in cutscenes is horrible. I read an article and watched some videos on this game and convinced myself it would be worth the money. I was wrong.			"

												I don't usually review games with such little play time but I just can't play this game anymore than I already have. It just feels terrible for a B2P game. This wouldn't even be good for a F2P game. It's a tab target game with no auto-attack, what is up with that? I tried every weapon in the tutorial and I didn't like any of them. Maybe I'm just spoiled from all the fancy mmos I have played, but this combat is even worse than WoW. I see graphics glitches, poor performance, and this game still looks like garbage. The only positive I see to this game is the narrative. Maybe if this game had a different developer that actually cared about the game it would be good, but it doesn't even feel finished. I would think after 4 years this game would actually feel fun to play, but it just doesn't. I feel bad for not giving it a chance, but it's just not fun. If I by some chance manage to stomach the game a little further and my opinion changes I will update my review.			"

												Welcome to the atmospheric and beautifully written modern MMO! But first you must download it. 18 gig, no biggie. Then you need to patch the client. 35 meg. Easy. Right? WRONG! Top speed is 34kb/s so buckle up for a wild ride. You're all ready to play. But wait, first you need to patch the whole game! Yay for another couple of gigs at snail pace. Phew, that is over. Ready to kill some badass Lovecraftian themed monsters! But first, please create an account, which involved going to Funcom site. Good, I'm good to go! Urban legends and secret societies here I come! But no, first you need to connect your account to Steam, including their infamous security email, which sometimes doesn't get through. Now you can finally enjoy what little you have left of your evening off work. Ignore the awful UI, the completely pointless exposition videos about what secret societies are all about, and the most uninteresting character creation process I've seen in a video game. Let's rock and roll! Except you can't. Because you're stuck on a loading screen. Maybe the game is fun and atmospheric like the reviews say, but boy is it not worth the hassle. I might check it out later, but definitely not anytime soon.			"

												If you want to get oral sex in the very beginning of the game become a Dragon! You dont even have to wait or do anything to earn it! You just get  it straight away from some Korean hooker.Honestly, I find the dragon path a bit insulting of Asians. And its way more likely that females in the USA would suck you off before they know you at all. I think this is just someone wanting to live his/her fantasy through CG. Brings the value of the game down.*As soon as i started the game my character got oral sex and i didnt have any say in the matter, and it disconnected me from my character quite a bit, to the point im not even sure i will be playing her in the long run. Im aware theres sexual content in the game but i was not aware it would be done to or with my character and i had no choice in the matter, which is funny considering the context of the game being choice and free will and shaping your own character.I did make 3 characters, one in each faction, to experience each one and its storyline, and possibly chosoe one of the 3 to get deeply involved in. Though as far as I can tell, all of the factions are evil. There are no factions with good intentions to represent.I think thats important to know in the beginning of the game. And some characters are better than others. So far the illuminati has the highest number of lovable characters, for me. But I'm still not certain which faction i will stick with, if i continue to play this in the long run.The other two factions start off much better, which again is ironic considering the illuminati faction is meant to be the ones who desire power and control money etc so youd imagine them to be the more sleazy cult as well. But nah, its the dragons.And not only is this way out of context, its the exact opposite of actuality. The initial dialogue from the professor is very good but that girl opposes everything he says. But they make it seem as though it goes hand in hand. Sex does not make you more receptive to anything. Especially not on such a low level. It certainly doesnt bring you to enlightenment or make you more prophetic.You guys almost made me think youre intelligent, but then it just drops off the edge of the flat Earth.*From the very beginning youre left not knowing how to do what they ask of you, there are new concepts in this game, new names for things, and it would be most helpful if they explained the world youre in a bit more before asking you to use whats in it.I was lost in the training. Half of the instuction is dealt to you in quick fleeting boxes of text. Explain what we need to know, or let us opt out of it if youre concerned about people being bored from tutorials. Ive always used tutorials and ive been gaming for more than 25 years. I like to know the games im playing.And i really wish youd have told us how to Sprint in the very first moment we could contol our characters.*Also, youre going to have to deal with notifications being flashed briefly on the screen while someone is speaking or teaching you something so if you read that quickly and read/hear what theyre saying and process it all, youre good. Otherwise, youre going to be very frustrated.*The fighting so far feels a bit awkward to me, but ill give it time, wait until im more familiar with the gameplay.*Props for level design and dialogue, however. Both are top notch. This must be why the game has good reviews. I wish the rest of it matched this quality.And from what ive seen from before playing it monsters are designed very well, too. Ive been very much looking forward to encountering them.This is an early review, i will be playing this a bit more and will review it again to give it a chance to make good on some of the things i dont like about it currently. The beginning of the Dragon faction will never make good, however.More critiques since I wrote that stuff:I wish mannerisms were more specific to the characters. For example, Dame Beatrix of the Templars is communicating her concern for how one carries himself, is obviously concerned about being considered respectable, and yet shes cracking her neck and kicking the ground as idle moves. Not fitting at all and thus distances me from the realm. I would like to be immersed in it for the time im playing it, ya?Voice acting:Main characters seem to be well voiced, with interesting or fitting voices and good voice acting. All side characters, whether people on the street or bigger characters like NPCs in your factions, are not necessarily given fitting voices or believable voice acting.All the little things are missing in this.This particular review is a little messy i know, ill clean it up some other time.

												After only a few hours of gameplay I couldn't stand the terrible graphics and poor performance of The Secret World anymore. I bought it on an offer because I keep hearing people raving about how great the quest design, atmosphere, and character freedom is in this game. However, these things were not apparent to me in the first few hours of the game and the generally cheap feel of the product prevented me from sticking with it until it (maybe) would get better or more involved. If you're looking for something very different from all the other MMORPGs out there, then TSW seems to offer this, but beware, this game is very poorly optimised, runs like crap, and, quite frankly, looks like a game made in 2006.

												The secret world is a game with great direction and very interesting mechanics. While the quests are somewhat similar to a lot of other mmorpg quests, a few stand out with you having to actually try to search for the objective like a detective, or just using the in game google search bar. Instead of leveling up you build your skills in certain weapons, which unlock different moves to use, allowing you to multi class in two different weapons. The game gives you presets that fit different fighting syles, and once you unlock these presets, you get costumes to wear to relfect yours fighting style. However, the mobs go from weak to ball bustingly hard and many times I found myself overwhelmed. The quests also are made to be replayable, however because of this they don't give you enough experience to properly advance, making you replay quests over and over to grind. All in all its okay, and they made the right choice to forgo subscriptions. Great story, interesting mechanics, but still rough around the edges. hopefully if they continue to polish it, it'll come out a mirror shine			"

												I had some heavy doubts on this game. I was a bit surprised by this game, though it doesn't seem to hit certain things right either. It's got a lot of familiar MMO qualities to it, which may make it feel kinda stale after awhile, though for the most part its a bit TOO soloable in some instances. What I really liked though is the lore. If you enjoy Lovecraft, conspiracy theories, and so on... You'll prolly fall in love with this game. The Lore is the strongest point this game has thus far... I hope they can touch up other parts of the game. I havent gotten that far though so who knows. I'm a noob and a lot of things confuse me right now in this game. Also there is no sub fee required now.			"

												This is a very different approach to MMOs, and I heartily approve of the directions in which it's dared to be different. Some missions are investigative in nature, requiring a good deal of research on cryptic clues. And combat? Forget burning some blue bar to expend your more powerful skills: abilities are divided into generators and consumers. The weak ones produce resources (up to 5), and the stronger ones consume them, giving fights a tactical ebb and flow.			"

I enjoy the difficulty of the puzzles (usually in the investigation missions), the amalgamation of various mythologies (Lovecraftian horror, secret societies, vampires, etc.), and the design of the character/class system. Definitely recommend this to anyone who likes 3rd person shooter/MMO/RPG/story-driven games.			"

												The atmosphere, sound effects, music and the numerous cutscenes in this game combine to make it a fantastically immersive experience for me.  I love the fact that I can explore and complete missions in a vast landscape without having to rely on other players constantly to get through things.  Some missions even require the player to research outside the immediate game for clues and it has its own built in web browser with which to do that.  The npc dialog is engaging and there are many different types of npc characters,  none of which sound like they are reading from a script when they speak. I value that a lot, since badly acted dialog can yank me right out of that immersive feeling when I'm playing a game.Players can choose from one of three factions when they create their character, all of which are human. It is sort of refreshing not to be innundated with choices of elves and dwarves and other mythical creatures as a ""hero.""   Each faction starts the game in a different area, before moving on to to investigate the goings on in Kingsmouth, a fictitious New England town.Overall, the atmosphere coupled with the necessity to use both brain and brawn to get through the missions makes for a great game and its well worth the price I paid for this MMO.

												Medium paced, exstensive skill system as well as extensive weapon system and has little to no bugsIf you're looking for a game to kill time as well as to get tripped out on a freaky, ""Secret Society"" story line, this is your game!Pros:Wide storyline with decisons to be madeFun crafting systemFun side and story quests as well as investigations and sabotage, making an MMO where you have to think to get the rewardGrinding is a thing of the past. Skill points from quests and actions rather than how much EXP you haveFluid and Wide array of combinations of skills.PRESS B for MAGIC BROWSERCons:A bit buggyFrustrating as hell if you don't know what you're doing.

												This game is a real mixed bag. The writing and setting are all great, and tons of fun. The skill system is pretty unique and finding synergies between skills is really rewarding. It does have great puzzles, which range from interesting and difficult to ""how the hell am I supposed to know that, I should have looked up the solution ten minutes ago"". On the downside, it's not really intended for solo play - area difficulty spikes quickly, and most people seem to reccomend replaying the same low-level quests over and over again to get over the humps. If you screw up a build, there's no way to reset it. The dungeons heavily emphasize the ""trinity"" system, so if you're trying to PVE with a DPS build, you will be ignored in favor of healers and tanks. I would say give it a shot, especially if it's on sale. However, it may not be your cup of tea.			"

												Ignore the time spent playing as recorded by steam. I leave this game open and run it from the directory. This game is... well, it's pretty good really. It's not the most polished. It's not bug/glitch free. It doesn't have the best graphics, models, animations, or sound effects, yet despite all of that it has a very cohesive world and story line, and an deeply immersive experience.I've just hit nightmare dungeons, have most of my weapon skills maxed (only hammer to go) and ran my first scenario last night (we got our butts kicked). The thing is, this game is pretty much the only MMO entry in the sci-fi/fantasy/modern smashup RPG genre. Now that it is subscription free, you're only faced with the initial purchase cost - making the game much more pocket friendly.I was dubious at first, but honestly, I've already gotten my money's worth out of the game in terms of content experienced, time played, and enjoyment had.Are there things that could be better? Definitely. The dungeon queueing system has no automatic match making, and you can either queue for all dungeons of a skill level or one, not a specific combination. The head models are not the prettiest but they do the job and same for animations. The control system can be a little frustrating at times, but again, these are lesser concerns.			"

												Awesome game with a lot of dynamic customization. You can pick up and wield any two weapon and a total of sixteen skills at any time once you learned it. This offer ways of fine tuning your play style and if you are melee and and want to wield a bad♥♥♥♥♥assault rifle, it is possible within seconds. Also your clothing is purely visual so you can mix and match your looks with modern clothing (or medieval, or futuristic, or a mix of the stated styles) without being afraid your armor is weaker. Especially fun for all the girl gamer among us. You mix and match eight active skills and eight passive skills making powerful combinations. In a later expansion, called issue's here, you get access to secondary weapons like a rocket launcher, sadly enough for most “Auxiliary” weapons you need to buy these issue's as only 1 – 4 are free. The PvE parts can be completed without any help and the deep story and lore are enjoyable to play trough. The variate of interesting missions is also a big plus, besides the story missions you have the normal action missions which involves standard bring object from point A to B or kill something, but you also have sabotage missions which involves stealth and caution, or investigation missions where you have to play Sherlock homes and search for clues and use the internet. Or your lazy and just search the internet for a guide to farm the points. Most missions are repeatable, some once a half an hour and others once a week. Missions also give rewards in exp scaled to you own level so you can easily repeat the first area over and over again to get to ridiculous high levels with limited amount of effort. Last big plus is the atmosphere of the game. The sounds and modern setting are fresh and new although I don't understand the secret world while there are massive hordes of zombies roaming the streets and everyone seems, rather calm.However there are also some downsides. For example while you have this massive amounts of skills, it is not very balanced. If you look at other players especially in PvP there are only a few skills that you actually use. The skill unlock part is based on two rings and once you have unlocked a outer ring segment there is little use for the inner ring skills. This game is also based on a lot of grinding. You will repeat the same missions over and over again, especially in the first area, to farm skill and ability points. The highest end game gear can only be acquired by PvP over many months getting you royal behind kicked. Especially in the beginning where all these guys wear the highest gear and completely wipe you off the face of the planet with a single blow. So especially in the beginning PvP is far from enjoyable. Also the character creation is in my eyes very disappointing. Another minus is the fact that I don't feel unique, for example you have to choose a secret faction, but the fact every NPC knows the faction and the faction (with exception of 3 missions) aren't offering anything unique I don't feel it really makes a difference. I also don't get the fact these three rival factions are like against each other but you can freely join mixed clans, parties, dungeons and missions. I am still waiting for a endgame warzone area where you can kill every Templar that dares to come across you while you are doing your missions.			"

Illuminati and templars are awesome and Funcom has made it so easy to get lost into solving mysteries what sometimes take ages to crack. This game is like a revived but modern version of the old hardcore RPGs which were hard as hell. Definately would recommend this game and its only buy-once-play forever so i dont see any downsides to this.			"

												So, I got through my FFXIV: ARR trial month and had to debate whether I really wanted to continue enough to start subscribing. In a way, I was surprised that there was any hesitation on my part, because I'd been having a great time with the game; but I guess that I always uneasy with the fact that I was playing a really pretty, polished, and well-balanced WoW TC. Unlike FFXIV my time with WoW way back when was anything but enjoyable. What I hated about it most of all was the unvarying quest/mission structure: enter quest hub, talk to all the NPCs with floating exclamation marks above their heads, collect the requisite number of beetle asses or moose pelts for each one, turn in quests for XP, gold, and level-appropriate gear---repeat ad. infinitum. The moment-to-moment gameplay in WoW was garbage, but its secret lay in making sure that there was always a sufficiently-tantalizing carrot being dangled in front of the player's face in order to induce them to keep slogging through the rote content (and to keep those sub fees coming in): a new pet, a mount, l33t-looking duds, etc. To me, it was nothing more than a ruse and I ditched the game at around level 20 or so.I had to wonder, then, why I was enjoying FFXIV so much, given that it doesn't depart in any significant way from WoW's structure. The first thing that comes to mind is that FFXIV is just so much more charming. Blizzard games have always rubbed me the wrong way; I don't like the aesthetic, it seems cheap and cheesy for the most part, and the Warcraft universe is one of the most derivative and least-inspired  (is that a tautology?) I've ever had the misfortune of encountering. I remember the writing for the the Frozen Throne (or whatever) campaign literally making me feel nauseous  FFXIV, on the other hand, is filled to the brim with witty, imaginative writing, and beautiful locales, music, and characters. In fact, I think one of the chief lures for me was just how awesome my character looked (with a minimal amount of effort on my part ).There's also no doubt that FFXIV is great at coming up with inducements to endure the grind. There's the campaign and class quests, which feature better narratives than the last several Final Fantasy games, joining one of three interesting factions, getting interesting gear, unlocking prestige classes, etc. etc. But again, what are you doing to earn these rewards? Without exception you're: running instanced dungeons, running about picking shiny things off the ground, running between dudes with exclamation marks above their head, running to map marker x to kill y number of infinitely-respawning mob r, and so on. Just like WoW, Rift, ToR, and GW before it, FFXIV's unyielding structure precludes surprises of the naked Nord in Morrowind sort, discovery of the ""I can rob this insane wizard blind and he won't do anything about it"" in Divine Divinity sort, or multiple resolutions of the ""you know what, I think I'll just join up with the Powder Gangers and kill everyone in Goodsprings"" in Fallout: New Vegas sort. As charming as the world is, and as much as I enjoyed taking it all in, it did just boil down to navigating a sea of !s sprinkled with (admittedly well-written) flavour text.I've tried a bunch of different MMOs in recent (like two or three) months, and the only ones that managed to hook me even a little bit were The Old Republic and FFXIV; both very much WoW clones, even if they do the whole interesting narrative and characters thing a lot better than WoW ever didn't. My hope was to find a good non-WoW-like MMO, but there are very few of them, and none of them, with the exception of EVE Online---which just ain't my thing---are any good. After pretty much deciding not to keep playing FFXIV I still wanted to play an MMO, because this is one of those PC-exclusive genres which seems to hold so much untapped potential and which I hadn't been able to partake of while sticking to console gaming for the last several years, and began to see if maybe, just maybe there was a ""different"" kind of MMO that didn't completely suck.In my searches I kept stumbling on the same few answers to the question of ""are there any worthwhile MMOs doing something different?"", namely ""wait for Archeage/Black Desert Online/Everquest: Next, EVE, or... The Secret World. Now, as you can see in my previous post I didn't think very much of TSW after my brief time with it, but I began to read through some of the Massively articles, forum posts, etc. proclaiming its brilliance. They seemed to make a pretty good case for the quests in this game being different (even if the ones I had completed pretty much fell squarely into the aforementioned ""collect 5 beetle asses"" category), and I already knew that the storytelling, setting, and characterization were all top-notch. So I ended up giving it another chance, reinstalled it from Steam, and... sat there as it refused to start up. Hours of forum trawling and another reinstall later and I got the damned launcher to work and jumped back into the game. A few hours after that and I understood what they---the people who praised the game---were talking about.			"

												Despite being from Funcom, Secret World is a surprisingly great MMO. Unlike The Old Republic, TSW lives up to the promise of story centric MMO. In it, you are a member of one of three factions (Templars, Illuminati, or The Dragon) dealing with lovecraftian monstrosities as well as coming across well known conspiracy theories.  Another highpoint has to do with the missions, specifically the investigations. These often involve puzzle solving and can have you utilize internet to figure out how the clues relate to said investigation.Funcom did a phenomenal job with fleshing out the setting that hunting down all the additional lore pickups as well as exhausting all conversation options never seems like a chore.  The biggest surprise is the overall polish to the game, an example being the quality voice acting. Best part of all, there's no subscription requirement.			"

												Abandoning the RPG-typical class system and even the ageless numerical hierarchy of leveling up, Funcom's The Secret World is a bold and refreshing MMORPG experience. TSW demands players' attention not only in the heat of battle, but also in the cold depths of investigation missions. This is an online role-playing game for the thinker (or Google monger) in all of us. Its world's most cryptic mysteries are bound to challenge even the most intelligent and well-rounded minds. The familiar leveling system that seasoned RPG players are accustomed to is replaced with the soothing (yet at times intimidating) freedom to create any type of character you can imagine using Skill Points (SP) and Ability Points (AP). Consequently, players are no longer bound to specific weapon and armor types from the moment you choose a class. Instead, character customization is simplified down to the decision between three factions (Templars, Illuminati, Dragon), and the seemingly endless clothing options. Knock yourself out, and then indulge yourself into a world in which every urban myth and conspiracy theory immediately come to life. The recent drop of any mandatory subscription fee eliminates the worrisome pondering time on whether or not to commit to the experience. Give it a shot if you have the dough for the initial $30 entry fee!			"

												It's not easy.  Nothing's handed to you on a platter.  You get unique cutscenes, awesome characters, and an entrancing storyline that evokes your imagination, and allows you to paint your own interpretation of it.  There are several different types of missions (Quests), which are: Investigation (Usually involves researching, using google, or just your wits and own personal knowledge), Sabotage (Lasers. Cameras. Avoiding them. Avoiding being seen.)  Normal. (Kill things, collect things, or just scout around and look at things.)  Group (Akin to dungeon missions, usually.)Scenario. (Interesting addition-- Kinda like the Danger Room in X-men, or the Hologram room from Star Trek.  You go through different simulations in order to train.)You can open up all skill points and ability points in the game-- Nothing is barred from you.  This is both awesome and intimidating, because you create your own 'deck', or in other MMOs, 'build'.It has its flaws.  It may make most people tear their hair out.  But, if you like a good story, good characters, a challenge, and actually having fun while immersing yourself, then I couldn't recommend this game more if I tried.  If you like adventure point and click games, you'll have the patience to love this game.			"

												          Seriously addictive mmo that reminds me of a cross between Guild Wars and Dead Island. It does have minor issues in its lack of explanation to beginners and a lot of the puzzles I find myself using the ingame browser to guide me through. That also happens to be one of its strong point. The game is mission based reloving around quests more similar to Fallout than your typical mmo like SOF or PWE as there isnt the tedious grinding, killing a million of some enemy or needing to return back to your quest start point. The investigation quests are not like anything I have ever seen before. It claims to not have a leveling system though this is only partly true. It doesn't have a traditional level system with your skills and equipment roughly defining your progression. The ingame shop is good as it doesn't give big spending players a major advantage. PVP currently suffers major balance issues. I wasn't overly interested anyway as the storyline is right up there with Deus Ex.           Its a buy once like Guild Wars with subscription being optional (minor discount outfits and non fighting pets). You get one month subscription on purchase with a free pet. I do get server lag in heavily populated areas though living in Australia with crap ADSL wouldn't be helping and I rarely find it interferes with gameplay or killing. Message me your email addy if you want a 3 day trial key. And entering agartha can be a pain the first time. Do a 360 if you cant find it.			"

												Having played pretty much all the popular subscription MMO's and F2P MMO's on the market over the years I watched the release of TSW with much interest as the premise of it's modern day setting and 'classless' levelling system seemed to offer a welcome change from orcs and set-in-stone tank/dps/heal building. It received a mediocre response at release but as I have only recently starting playing I can only judge the game on it's current stateI picked this game up in a steam sale over Christmas (paid £8 i think) so as far as value for money goes I can't complain as for a buy once play forever game that's pretty good value (there is a cash shop but after 106hrs of play I have had no need or inclination to use it - no p2p here)When I first started playing I naturally settled into my usual MMO play style as I expected this to be much the same - how wrong I was. Once the you get over the initially steep/different learning curve I realised that the usual MMO rules didn't quite apply. The combat, though hotkey based, has a fluidity to it that requires you to keep on your toes. You can dodge attacks and simply by keeping on the move throughout combat will mitigate damage. The skill and ability system is wonderful and once you start unlocking more and more abilities you will spend hours 'tweaking' that killer DPS/survival build or tank/healer. The variety of avaiable skills and powers means that you can refresh your playstyle at the drop of a hat so I never feel stuck in a playstyle and this flexibility keeps combat fresh.There are five different quest types: story, group, main, investigation, and sub-quest. There is no need to 'hoover' up quests in a quest hub the way you would in Wow, just pick one quest and if you follow it to its conclusion (quests are multi tiered) this will lead you to another quest anyway so it flows really wellThe story and mission cut scenes are all voice acted and I personally prefer them to SWTOR. The only criticism is that they are not group friendly.The locations are wonderfully represented. The starting area is a real treat for Stephen King/H P Lovecraft fans and there is a genuinely spooky atmosphere to many of the quests in this zone. The graphics are good. Characters and loactions are well done and the ambience (in part to good music and lighting) is pleasing throughout.The dificulty spikes rather badly in the third area of the first zone and I felt a bit defeated at first but once I had masterd tinkering with builds i was able to sail through (the right build is very important to success in this game)So far I have not felt bogged down in an area and thanks to the combat and varied abilities i have yet to feel like I am grinding.For a MMO the game is catered well (maybe to well?) to solo play but chat is very active and no one seems to have any major problems with finding a group (which is all done in chat and the game has a lot to learn from the likes of wow and gw about group finding)I have not played pvp so cannot comment on that.Overall I am really enjoying this game. It is a welcome break from orcs and elves and the freedom of class building is almost a mini game in itself (a good one i might add). As long as you enter the game on its own terms (and not on the terms of any other mmo) and follow the natural flow of the game it will hopefully suck you in the way it has done for me and many others.This is a AAA title worthy of your time and money and I wholeheartedly recommend you try it out "

												Not as monotonous as WoW, and if you love conspiracy theories, and using various modern weapons with magical abilities to top it off, you'll find this game worthwhile.			"

												Great MMO that approaches questing and character progression in fresh, and effective ways. Modern horror setting is a welcome change of pace to fantasy mmos, and is backed up by a well written and voice acted story. Very much worth the one time purchase cost, as well as the issues of additional content. My only issues with the game is server lag, which is present, but not constant, as well as a disappointing selection of character customization items available through in-game currency. However, there are cool costumes you can unlock through deck building, which is a good way to motivate progression on different ability trees. A great game overall. One of my favorite MMOs of all time. Seriously underrated.			"

												The combat is a little more slow paced, but the game offers the most unique experience I've yet found in any game (mmo or otherwise).  If you're excited by the prospect of cracking codes, solving puzzles that require real world knowledge, or accessing company websites to obtain information (using your web browser- these are real websites), then you should get this game.

												Probably one of the most challanging and interesting games I have ever played. ALL the quests require actual though and knowledge. And the mere fact that this is set in the modern world is awesome. There is just something awesome about being a guy in a hoodie and jeans slaying zombies and monsters with a sword.			"

												Man, this game is fantastic, and I don't typically enjoy MMO's that often because I find it difficult to find people to play them with. TSW Doesn't force you into parties to complete quests, and the type of missions and stories are really interesting, though some sub-stories are sort of dull. I really love the investigation missions, too. It adds variety to the game, and the fact that they installed an in-game browser to help you research on the investigations is so cool. There are some negative aspects to the game, such as bugged missions, but can be easily solved. Also, some missions are a track and grab, and if there are a lot of people doing the same mission you'l; have to wait a while for the item to re-spawn in order to collect. I've only partied up a couple times, but if there were more people playing the game now, it would be much easier to do missions with others.9/10, beautiful game.			"

												I picked this game up when it went from subscription-based to buy-once-play-forever... And as of right now I am really digging it. Although the graphics are definitely not next-gen, the immersive story and interesting setting is highly intriguing. Working for a secret society... digging up secrets one bit of information at a time... it all leads to one highly entertaining mmorpg experience. Highly reccommended, if you like MMOs such as Guild Wars this should be right up your dark abandoned alleyway.			"

												I absolutly adore this game, the lore and storys for the world are just amazing; the leveling does take a bit to get used to but once you've got that down the game play is smooth.I could rant for hours about how customizable this game is but to save on time Ill just say there is alot.Overall this game is great; it does have its issues as all games do but if your able to adapt and work past them this is one game that will retain your attention for days at a time.

												so far the best if the only real modern mmorpg out there. though before it will get my praise, it will feel my wrath. this is a decent game and if your looking for a mmo to join up with some close friends in order to go stomp on some legendary and bad♥♥♥♥♥monsters this is your game. ive had many a vodka fueled night with a friend or two with this game and i have to say they were probably the best times we've had with an mmo.cons--it's grind is as bad if not worse than world of warcraft since i often feel it is much more drawn out. -the Slow sections are SLOW!!! -the skills can be changed out with one another and you wouldn't know the difference. save aoe vs direct attacks. -the puzzles can be somewhat challenging (not a con for me but for some i guess i can see the point.)-Makes the mistake of allowing you to master all the skills, which can be nice. But i feel that this kind of takes away from having specializations.-Free to play, but if you want the ""AWESOME"" stuff you best be ready to buy some funcom points and be a member.- vast space with no real fast travel or vehicle use so the game turns into a giant walking sim pretty quick-monsters respawn FAST so as you run from point A to points B and C you'll find the same jerks you killed are all back as you return to A in order to complete your quest. pros--WENT FREE TO PLAY (subscriptions suck)-MMORPG in a Modern setting with famous folk lore, Monster lore, Pop culture, and Religious stories creating a decent plot-fighting monsters is gratifying, especially boss fights.-Customization is vast even after you create your character-wide variety of weapons and fighting styles-actually has you think to solve a puzzle.overall you can have fun with this game. Which is the quid esssential cornerstone of any game. i play it here and there still myself .			"

												This is a different kind of MMO. Mostly. Its horror based and that's new (to me). Its story is on strict rails (you don't even get to say anything. ever) They really did a great job on the atmosphere. There's three types of missions to do so something for every type.  Its a lot of fun in many ways. In general ways.the problems:Character balance - much like MMOs of old, not every type of character is going to be soloable. Some areas are just going to be naturally harder for some characters than others.  But for those of us who like to play support, this is expected. When I make a healer or controller, I don't expect to be blazing through all missions alone. Likewise I'd hope that my healing ability will be welcome in a dungeon run. The problem is that nearly every main mission ends in a solo instance. This has gotten beyond annoying and into the whole frustrating ""WHY DID YOU DO THIS!"" realm. Its a serious double-bind. You make dungeons and have times when support characters is a great thing, but in order to progress throught he game, we NEED to be able to solo at the end of every mission. that's a big WTFStoryline variety - there isn't much. The difference between the Templar's storyline and the Illuminati storyline is in the details which is to say that the missions are ALL THE SAME. SO I'm running around int he same areas my ""rivals"" are. Which means I've already gotten used to grouping with them quite frequently. Yet...Guilds/Cabals - no cross-faction guilds/cabals are allowed. Again, that's a big WTF. If I'm not allowed to guild with anyone but my faction, WHY did you create a game where we all basically do the same things?Investigation missions - They really went overboard trying to make this ARG0-style. WAY overboard. Having to use the web (there's a browser in-game for your convenience) for every single clue of every single investigative mission is beyond frustrating and into the realm of stupid - there is no sense of accomplishment when the puzzles are so hard I have no prayer of figuring them out by myself in under an hour. IN fact, the basic rule of thumb should be about twenty minutes; if I spend more than twenty minutes trying to just figure out a CLUE in a mission, I'm going to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I don't get on the game to do homework I get on to PLAY. After 20-30minutes I""m sick of the whole thing and just want to smash faces in. Clues in dead languages? Really? A snatch of a song from the 1800s? Really? Come on, guys, you don't have to make the clues impossible, just challenging and not all of us enjoy trying to figure out puzzles that have six steps (tiers) and each one is not only an obscure clue referring to some obscure arcane item of the past but then I have to figure out how to apply said answer to the game itself. Again, WTF.Crafting - most boring and mindless pointless craft system ever. I guess some people will be glad there's no harvesting but some of us like harvesting - its like gettig loot just for exploring! nope, no harvesting, just drops off of mobs. and its a total crap shoot what your drops will be.  Then the system is that  there are materials for each type of gear and only with glyphs can you amp them up at all beyond what drops. In fact crafted stuff often is exactly like drops. SO what's the appeal? Just something to do with all that trash you loot I guess. Glyphs is an okay upgrade system but its extremely limited. You choose one or two offense OR defense things to boost and that's it. That's all you get. I make a lot of glyphs for my friends (especially since we found you could put any level glyph on your gear) and mostly its hit/crit for them, heal for me. Woo hoo. I feel so crafty.The environment is awesome - truly creepy and extra kudoes for the Amusement Park effects on Solomon Island. Oh that's another thing - ENOUGH with the fog on the island. Its atmospheric at first, then its annoying and by the third zone of nothing but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed fog everywhere I'm ready to choke a kitten for some freakin unclouded light.  The mobs are great, well rendered, some scary as heck and some just gross but not one seems campy or silly (well okay, every time we fight one of the giant lobster-creatures on of my groupmates says ""ME MONEY!"" and I crack up every time) The terrain is alright - unique and easy to navigate. I love the focus on the Native Americans, the cast is diverse and tastefully done. What will probably do it for a lot of people is that it has a lot of great horror references. The first two zones are essentially Lovecraft-land.Overall, its a fun game but the bad things get more and more annoying as they are essential to the game; I'd like to be able to TALK as a character once in a while or at least through text! Doesn't have to be voice you know? I'd also like that IF I have to do these extra-hard instances at the end of every mission, allow me to bring at least one person with me! OTherwise, scale them down for non-DPS/Tankers. I'd REALLY like to see more puzzles that are solvable in less than an hour. Its really starting to feel like the developers are trying to come up with puzzles that are literally impossible like you'd have to read their minds to know what the answer is. That's not fun, that's just obnoxious.			"
