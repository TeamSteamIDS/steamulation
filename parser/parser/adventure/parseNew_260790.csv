												There is probably some joke or pun to be made about the 1001 spikes but I'm coming up empty. So I'll just say that it looks like the spike maker counted up the order wrong and ...Ok I have nothing. Luckily Nicalis have something quite special in this platformer from the affectionately named ""♥♥♥♥ing troll♥♥♥♥♥game"" genre.The gameplay is simple enough (with one oddity, which I will get to). You enter a level, you avoid traps and make some jumps while also shooting knives at the occasional enemy. You find the key and perhaps the hidden mask object and make your way to the exit. You then repeat this process through longer and more difficult stages until you run out of things to do. Along the way expect plenty of water, fire, snakes, scorpions, crushing blocks, spikes and even more spikey spikes. There isn't anything particularly original here if you have played similar games in the past (stretching a long way back) but what is here has been proven to work.The controls are a little strange in that you have two jump buttons, one ""high"" and one ""low"". This saves you having to judge how hard to press a button (high enough to clear a spike, but low enough to avoid the fire above?) but it can get a bit fiddly at times. Personally I always found myself using the high jump unless a situation specifically seemed to call for it. In these cases, such as jumping on a block without triggering an arrow trap it was handy, but I'm still not sold on the concept. Still, everything works and you can aim your jumps properly and it doesn't feel floaty. If anything, jumping and shooting fails a bit more often than it should, when trying to line up a small object like an arrow (when you are standing shots line up perfectly). This isn't a big deal though, so in this regard the controls get a solid pass.To complement the tight controls, the level design is all important in a game like this and 1001 Spikes doesn't let you down. The levels all seem lengthy but not ""too long"" and there is a good variety in the challenges. For example, one level will have you carefully negotiating spiked passages, waiting for just the right moment to advance forward. The next level will require you to make a series of fast paced jumps as everything falls down around you. Levels feel unique, despite reusing a lot of assets and the effort required to pass them should make them memorable long after.That is, if you don't give up on it. The magic of ""♥♥♥♥ing troll♥♥♥♥♥game"" is in how much they troll you and how much of it you can take. Think you have finished the level? Well you forgot about that block, right at the end which will drop on your head without warning. This will kill you, forcing you to restart the level (no checkpoints here!) in an increasingly infuriating manner. So where does it sit on the troll meter? Above Super Meat Boy, some obstacles you just can't avoid. But it is also well below something like I want to Be The Boshy. Most traps give you a split second of warning, such as the tips of spikes showing before they impale you. Because of this, most deaths (but not all) feel like they are a result of you not paying close enough attention. The game does a good job of training you too. Chance are if you find a good place to rest while you evaluate the next section of a level? There are spikes on that block.So you'll die, but you'll learn and progress always feels achievable (or you can skip levels, so it isn't a big drama). Note that you do technically have a life limit (x1000) but 1ups are easily farmable by redoing short stages and finding the bonus pick up. So 1001 Spikes is tough but just fair enough (think 1-5 deaths on an easy stage, 20-30 on a hard one), which will hopefully not put off too many people.Having said that, one of the most difficult challenges the game offers is getting through the story parts without hitting ""skip"". They are long, stretching on forever and the text forwards far too slowly. I kind of enjoy the ironic tone to the writing, but little of importance is said and there doesn't seem to be any need for a story at all. Rest assured you can safely skip it and get back to the spikes.To round out the package, the game offers other arcade style modes which can be played in 4 player local coop (sorry online fans). These include challenges such as climbing a high tower and competitive modes like holding an urn the longest, which remind me strongly of old NES or even C64 titles and other treats like an extra difficult tribute to a past game. Rest assured too that the coins you collect in those modes are not completely going to waste. Now I'm not a big coop gamer (people who are will love playing through the main game with a friend), so these extras are not necessarily for me, but they do make an easy purchase decision even easier. Further the game provides a wide variety of unlockable characters, each with their own abilities (longer jumps, double jumps etc). This lets you tackles the levels again with different approaches and helps alleviate any concerns about the number of available levels (although there are enough anyway, without spoiling anything, probably a lot more than you think!).In terms of presentation, 1001 is more functional than impressive, but everything does the job. The music is suitably excellent and the sound effects inoffensive. If anything the menu systems and cutscenes could use an extra coat of polish, but as mentioned before they are best skipped anyway, so perhaps skimping on them was the best approach after all.I really like 1001 Spikes. I realise it will not be for everybody, given the brutal style. But it is just accessible enough that everybody should give it a go, just in case they get the right level of sadistic fun out of it.Just keep an eye out for that 1001'th spike. That'll be the one that gets you or ... yeah still nothing.			"

												1001 Spikes has the misfortune of coming at a time when we feel like we've had enough of its ilk. We've played Indiana Jones-themed platformers (La Mulana and Spelunky), short-level-many-lives platformers (Super Meat Boy, I Wanna Be The Guy), and technologically accurate retro homages (Shovel Knight). It's unfortunate because 1001 Spikes is all these things, but it's also something more.It tosses out the fiddly analog jumping of Super Meat Boy in favor of digital two-button jumping. You know where your jumps are going to take you, even if you play blindfolded. The challenge is picking the right place and time to jump. There are no leaps of faith. The limited pallet of hazards allows you to grow muscle memory. Far from being an exercise in trial and error, 1001 Spikes is a game you can get good at. My second playthrough took 10% as long as my first.Instead of the single-screen levels of Super Meat Boy, you have levels that you can't finish while holding your breath. There are parts where you really have to think hard about how you can pass an obstacle. There are shortcuts. If Super Meat Boy is a triceps dip, 1001 Spikes is a push-up.If you've played IWTBTG, you'll know that that game can kill you in ways that are funny. 1001 Spikes has jokes too, but they are funnier.1001 Spikes has a story, and a damn good one. It's told in Ninja Gaiden style cutscenes which are long but don't overstay their welcome. It's about a love-hate relationship. The protagonist goes on an adventure to prove something to himself -- when you play this game it will be to prove something to yourself. 1001 Spikes is a Japanese indie game, and when it comes to story it seems like Japanese indie developers can do something that Americans can't. They can set their games in worlds that seem real. They can be sentimental without being sappy.			"

												Easily one of my favorite platformers, I cannot recommend this game enough! It's full of difficult moments but it never feels unfair. All of the unlockable characters have an immense amount of detail added to them, each one that references another game respects the source material completely and totally. This is the instant-classic of 2014.			"

												This game is NOT I repeat NOT for those who pretain to the following:- unable to Maintain their cool / have a short fuse- Give up easily- Have had no experience with platforming prior to this game- Want a causal experience- Hate spikesNow then onto my opinion of the game. This game is by far one of my favorite platformers that I have played right next to super meat boy. This game is as tough as it can get and if you want to make it far you will need to have the psychologic idea of ""if it looks like it's able to kill you, it probably will"" Now I will admit this game's degree of difficulty at times goes down to out right troll level, with traps right at the finishing door which will kind of ruin the vibe of completeing the level. I will also say that Some of the golden skulls as well as levels I would of had no idea how to do unless I googled how to finish it or obtain the skull.Onto some positive notes I personally love the difficulty of this game! I view myself as a veteran; claimably a master when it comes to platforming and and it's nice to see games like this come and basically give you a slap in the face and say ""you think you're hot stuff huh? Try this on for size then"". It gives us gamers the reality check we need to see that we are not ""MLG"" or ""Greatest Platformer in NA"", we are just gamers with more fun to experience with this game and to overcome it through all the hard times and trials it provides. The major positive aside, I also adored how it seemed so retro as I feel it really fit with the style of game, as it was 3D or something, this game would end up looking much worse in my opinion. The music is also divine and the little details really add to the ruins and complete this game. If you are looking for a nice little challenge than please without hesitation pick up this fantastic game. And don't you worry about your extra lives, as you have 1001~			"

												Everybody knows that 1001 Spikes is a masterpiece of mechanics and the pinnacle of level design as an art form, but, for as much as I have relished every agonizing, brilliant moment, my favorite thing about it is the respite stages at the end of each area.  You simply move through the level, free from danger, and ironically these are the moments in which I truly feel like I am on an adventure.It's not that I use this time to reflect on the challenges that I've surmounted.  It's not that transition in which I am saying goodbye to one area with its distinctive tileset before moving on to another.  The romance of these stages is simpler than that: It's just a pleasure to move through an exotic space!  By suddenly stripping away all semblance of difficulty, 1001 Spikes startles you into noticing that one of the basic strengths of videogames is the experience of place.When all of the scorpions and dart-shooting busts and crushing effigies and flamethrowers fall away, there's just you and a decaying ruin, adorned by idols carved from bricks of gold and lit by columns of blue flame, housed within the red dirt of the jungle and deep purple caverns, overgrown with vines that sway as you brush by, curtained by waterfalls and the slowly flooding drip of leaking ceilings, and eroded by lakes of fire barely contained with thick stone dams.  Corridors narrow to a crawlspace and balloon outward into large pedestal chambers.  They wind from side to side, rising and falling, or provide a shambling staircase out of darkness.The fundamental lines of these spatial compositions are as beautiful as the pixel art with which they are drawn, and these little journeys are yet further characterized by situational events.  Rope bridges collapse behind you, imposing doors are opened with the depression of multiple switches or the assembly of several ritual keys, and gates crumble away with the terrain, dropping you into the abyss.  These surprises somehow manage to evoke a sense of mystery even though there are no puzzles to solve and a sense of adventure even though your path is a straight line.  I could play an entire game comprised of these completely safe yet intriguing and enchanting stages.Ukampa lies behind me in ruins, its golden skulls all safely ensconced within my loot sack, but I am not finished with 1001 Spikes.  Not by a long sight.  More adventures await.  Regardless, I am more than ready to say that I don't just enjoy this game; I love it.Update: After completing the game, I was so enamored with it that I felt compelled to make a critical video describing how deftly it uses space in its level design:

												1001 Spikes is a great platforming experience that takes problem solving, good reflexes, and patience.1001 Spikes is not on the easy side of platformers, but the learning curve is very fair. Your controls and goal are simple and the ""easy to learn, hard to master"" philosophy is in full effect here. 1001 Spikes avoids one of the big sins of platforming (lack of precision) very well. Your characters have a high and low jump, and some type of attack. The gameplay feels satisfying. With a little trial and error, you will find yourself knocking projectiles out of the sky, dodging pressure sensitive spikes and juggling between high and low jumps. It feels very inutitve traversing the levels and the range and weight of your characters actions begin to feel like second nature. The boss fights are also refreshing.The various characters you can unlock (most being cameos) are all very neat and have their own quirks, however you cannot enjoy them interchangeably. It was such a let down for me to unlock a new character after some hard runs only to find out that I have to restart from level 1 with that character rather than being able pick up where I left off. This can give you an opportunity to play around with all your characters and really get to know them, but the game is kind of forcing you to take character tryouts seriously by pushing you back to square one. With that complaint aside, I found trying out all the characters very enjoyable. Curly Braces from Cave Story is probably the easiest to play with her jet booster, but my favorite is President Thompson with his double jump and machine gun.The alternate modes (or hint hint, there is a whole separate campaign if you know where to look) are fun and add plenty of replay and longevity. The co-op modes were extremely enjoyable and I was actually able to beat some levels with people who were new or rusty to platformers. Still, I would say playing through one of the co-op campaigns of 1001 Spikes with a friend was one of my favorite serious, short, co-op experiences.I think some relative comparisons are in order to be more helpful.I enjoyed Super Meat Boy and Spelunky to an extent: I am not a fan of slippery or floaty characters in platformers (SMB) and I found it was way more fun to just kill all my friends in local co-op than actually try to work together and beat Spelunky (I also preferred the original art style). However, I definitely really like all 3 games, so here are some relevant details:SMB has a faster restart than 1001 and unlimited lives (though 1001 offers plenty of lives and you can always go back and earn more), 1001 Spikes has set levels you choose rather than randomized ones that string together like Spelunky, 1001 Spikes has significantly more unlocks than the other 2, 1001 Spikes has set aside co-op campaigns while Spelunky offers some competition and only the main campaign with enabled co-op, 1001 Spikes has some action in the form of shooting, while SMB has none and Spelunky has more depth with in game shop and variance of weapons, The boss levels in 1001 are a good mix of action and platforming, SMB was strictly speed based platforming, Spelunky feels more like a Mario boss fight.1001 Spikes has a lot of replay value, great controls, and satisfying gameplay. The co-op, large cast of characters, alternate modes and long campaign are equally challenging and fun.(I happened to play it without internet last summer, so please ignore the short amount of hours as it is definitely not accurate).

												1001 Spikes is a difficult platformer made by Nicalis (Cave Story+, The Binding of Isaac). Father of the protagonist is missing - only thing there's left by him is a map and a letter to seek Ukampa ruins in South America. Challenge accepted.Controls are made pretty tight, you won't have any problems regarding movement or jumping, which are required for hard platformers anyway. Jumping isn't depending on the intensity of your button pushing and is always same height, because you actually have two buttons to jump - you can do a small (1 block up) or a big (2 blocks up) jump. But that isn't something bad, you'll get used to it quickly. Level design is nice, all levels are made with emphasis on speedrunning, so they are not long - expect usually about 1 minute per level from start to finish. That doesn't mean you'd need only one minute to beat every level, you'll be dying a lot. There are many traps and passages that just asks for you to die so you know what to avoid next time.The game also requires some basic multitasking skills, as there are passages where you have to check spikes around you, and throw daggers at shooting traps meanwhile - you'll have to count the time of trap reset to throw at the right time. Do you still thing that 1001 lives for 1001 Spikes is enough for you?Controls, game menu and overall presentation of the game is polished and worth the price. That includes sweet pixelart graphics and great 8bit soundtrack that won't get old (well, it did, but you'll still like it).Conclusion:This game is a great buy for those who want a 2D platforming challenge. It's not easy, it requires proper training for every level, and is rewarding enough in the end, with the feel of success.			"

												A really hard platformer, and a homage/love letter to both old platformers and Spleunker. (As well as to the NIS platformer, Prinny, a Disgaea spin-off, due to the large amount of lives.) 1001 Spikes does a really good job at it's name, giving you a spike death for each of your 1001 lives! It has a ton of content, either local co-op or single player, and tons of stuff to unlock for fun, like extra characters.Each level has a collectable Golden Skull to find, usually hidden, at each threshold they have some extra content for those who dare to get collect them which come in the form of extra modes or characters. When you play as one of the unlockable characters, your level progress is seperate from the main hero and each other unlockable character, and the skulls replaced with coins which you can use to unlock even more stuff with in the shop. Each almost every character plays entirely different, even the cosplay ones for the main hero have entirely different playstyles and plenty of little details to them. (The Belmont cameo cosplay removes your ranged option of a throwing knife, to a shorter distanced whip, in an exchange for damage power, stuff like that.)It might seem a bit pricey at $15.00 USD, maybe even still at the $10.00 USD discount price, but it's worth it. With all that content, along with the option to try a hand at speedrunning the game with the timer aid, or getting a better time on a certain level, there is a lot to love and your dollar goes a long way.The bad side: There are a few bugs, some people are having a little trouble launching the game or getting music to play after death in a level and having to restart, but hopefully they will fix it soon. There are slight workarounds for each bug at the moment, and they aren't making the game cripplingly unplayable.Overall, if you like the idea of the game, and you are up for a tough challenge, it's worth picking up. One of my favorite platformers, for sure!			"

												1001 spike and is a classic 2D action platformer where you play as Aban Hawkins, basically indiana jones minus the whip, who sets out on an adventure to Ukampa to find not only his father but the treasure of the temple in order to prove he is better than him. The 1001 in the title is actually refering to the number of lives you start with. (Though it could mean the spikes because there is a damn lot of them). You have 1001 lives to best your way through all '30' levels of the Ukampa tomb but don't let that discourage you or make you think that's all the lives you have. At the end of each section, you'll find an artifact which gives you a large chunk of lives. Along with those, there is a skull collectible in each level (including the room that's just a straight walk to the artifact) which I highly recommend collecting. Not only does it grant you a life every time you pick it up (It has to be recollected every time you die) but it also lets you unlock new, fun characters.These unlockable characters really encourage replaying the game to see how much better you can do with them, the different ways they can clear the levels with their unique abilities (These characters are also characters from different games which helps to encourage unlocking them just to see who they are. See Super Meat Boy if you wonder what I mean by 'From different games') Lastly these characters also have a different collectible to the skull. In this case, a coin that gives you money from 100 to 1000 and beyond as you get to the later levels which allow you to buy even more lives.For the price you're buying, you're definitely getting your money's worth. Not only is there the main game 1001 spikes but there is also side stories that unlock which take Aban to new dangerous adventures and *Bit of a spoiler* After beating the 'boss', a whole new set of levels open up. It's definitely worth the buy.I can understand that the idea of a rage game can turn some people off when they think of games like ""I wanna be the guy"" or ""Eryi's action"" on steam but erase those from your mind. This game is definitely designed to lead to a rage at some point depending on your patience, of course but it's not one big trap feast. Like you won't walk through trees just for an apple to shoot down and kill you like in IWBTG. It's not that kind.You will stumble into some traps or do something wrong that requires you to kill yourself (Selecting retry in the menu takes a life) but as the game goes on, you will start to spot the signs like in Eryi's action where you can suspect which spots are trapped. Everything in 1001 spikes makes a distinct sound like the click of spikes to help you figure out the timing. I can definitely recommend this game. If this helps you decide to buy it, then I wish you luck.			"

												1001 Spikes is a hardcore platformer in every sense of the word. It will stop at nothing to impale you on spikes, crush you with a boulder, burn you alive, and then impale you on even more spikes. Some may even call this a rage game by how hard it gets, but stepping up to the challenge and completing each level is really satisfying.Here's a quick look video that goes over the postives and negatives of this game. But for those of you who just wanna read about it, continue below. (Info about other modes below since this only covers story, which is the meat of the game)


YouTube™ Video: 1001 Spikes Quick Look 

			Views: 704		

			Noble takes a quick look at 1001 Spikes, an action platformer with the ability to draw out your inner rage. Be impaled, roasted, squashed, and impaled once more over and over again!		

Let me begin my review with what this game is about. You're an adventurer exploring trap-infested dungeons, and the whole reason you're there is because you want to get the treasure to prove to your late father that you're a real man. Yeah, a guy with daddy issues. The reason this is called 1001 spikes is because you get that many lives to complete the game with, but you can get more by collecting artifacts and golden skulls. It's pretty straightforward, but the fun comes with the challenging maps.In every level, you need to collect a key, then go to the exit. But it's not as simple as that. Hidden spikes will pop up without warning, dart traps will suddenly fire when you go near, and platforms with fall without warning as soon as you step on them. Because of this, you will die many times and have to start over from the beginning. Yet each time you will become a little wiser and learn the patterns until you eventually reach the end. Very much a trial and error system, but a good one that keep things challenging, but not enough to feel too cheap and make me want to quit.Another good thing is the ability to drag your friends in for some local co-op or minigames. Things can get very hectic and fun as you try to complete levels together or kill each other. Every character plays a bit different too, such as playing Knight Arthur from Ghouls 'n Ghosts and having his armor get knocked off after a hit for a second life. There's even an interesting tower-climbing mode with boss battles if you collect golden skulls to unlock it, so don't forget to grab them as you play the story mode. The last mode you get is basically the same as the story, but the levels are hard right off the bat and you only get 100 lives.However, this game isn't without some faults. -There isn't any online multiplayer, nor is there any bots. So if you're all by your lonesome, half of the game's selling point doesn't apply to you. Sure you can play the levels by yourself, but it's kinda boring and the levels lose most of their dynamics since they cater to multiple people. -Some people may take issue with the pixel graphics and over-saturation of them in today's market. And while I personally don't mind the graphic style, lots of people avoid games simply for this reason alone.-Even though I do like the difficulty, sometimes I found myself frustrated with some of the trial and error gameplay. Can't tell you how many times I was so close to the end only to be sent back to the beginning from a hidden spike trap.-Honestly, I think this should be a $10 game. I was halfway through the campaign after only one and a half hours, so with it being so short on its single-player mode, it may turn a few people away. Though admittedly, the later levels are gonna take you much longer to complete since they start getting insane.To wrap this up, this game is for those who like a challenge. It even caters to those who are perfectionists and want every collectible and the best times. So if you have buds to play with, this is a good buy. But if you only want it for the single player, get it if you've been itching for a game that really pushes you to beat it. And if you're still on the fence, wait for a discount and this will definitely be worth it.			"

												I'm having a lot of fun with this game.The graphics and music draw a ton of inspiration from NES games, as does the incredibly hard and often trial-and-error style of gameplay. While the game is very challenging, and often unfair, it still feels incredibly rewarding because you get a little bit further with each attempt. It's twitchy platforming action with a lot of projectiles, and some cruel traps thrown in. That's probably not for everyone, but I like it.The graphics are beautiful, and I'm very excited to see each new area. It looks and feels like a NES game with some subtle modern touches that wouldn't be possible on a real NES. For example, background vines animate when you walk past them. There's tons of references to classic games like Mario or Ghosts n Goblins, and the cutscenes even have intentional spelling errors!There's tons of content and different game modes too. I've still not seen everything, 11 hours in. And then there's replay value on top of that.However, a lot of what makes 1001 Spikes great also hurts it. The difficulty does ramp up pretty damn high. At first I was playing this game together with my girlfriend, and that was awesome - the levels are well designed for multiple players. But eventually I had to dump her because we were progressing too slowly together. It's hard to concentrate with a group of people when playing such a difficult game.So I guess if I had to complain about something, I'd say more could have been done to make this game more accessible. Maybe an easy mode? Or maybe the whole game should have just been easier in general. I love it as it is, but I would have liked to play the whole thing with friends.			"

												Disclaimer: If you inherently can’t stand timing-based platforming and a certain level of trial-and-error/memorization, this game is not for you.Mario really changed platforming huh? I mean he pretty much created it with his appearance in Donkey Kong, but it was Super Mario Bros. that defined core platforming mechanics for years to come. Chief among these is the jumping itself: SMB added a momentum based system as well as variable jump lengths depending on how long you held down the button. Put these together and you had a game that just felt better than any other game at the time. Fast forward to today and we’re in a resurgence of the genre, with a new SMB, Super Meat Boy, taking its place as king with the most refined Mario controls to date. How does 1001 Spikes fit into this? Well…1001 Spikes scales back the jump mechanics to pre-Super Mario Bros.; there’s no momentum system or variable jump based on length of button press. Instead, there are just two jumps: a jump that clears 1 tile and a jump that clears 2 tiles. What does this mean? Well as far as negatives go it means that you never get the same sense of great game feel as you do in Super Meat Boy. That’s not to say the game feels bad though; you can change the direction of your jumps in mid-air, so it’s not clunky like Castlevania or Ghosts n’ Goblins. It also means that it’s more accessible; you have to worry less about mastering a complex physics system and more about your timing and reflexes. With more reliable jumps you can also have more daunting challenges, without a lot of the error in the trial-and-error.But the biggest thing it facilitates is puzzles. It’s not always advantageous to use the high jump, even with jump correction; the game makes you use both. You see, most of the game’s obstacles are traps, with slight visual clues of where they could be. This works synergistically with the jump system; you’ll have to constantly think on your feet about where traps could be located and how to handle them, but because of the rigid jumping you’ll also have to problem solve about what sequence of jumps and landings to use to get you to your goal. There are a lot of “puzzle platformers” out there but more often than not they’re puzzle games that just happen to be platformers. This game uses platforming as its puzzle mechanics; rarely do I see a game so multifaceted and yet so singular in its design. Even once you’ve carved out a path you’ll still have to think quickly to execute it; unlike platformers like Meat Boy there’s no clear break in between obstacles. Traps add an extra sense of cohesion to the levels as you have to keep moving and thinking on your feet with no time to catch your breath. It’s a really unique feeling for a platformer, and frankly it’s exhausting at first. But as you play more, you’ll get better at the game and at the quick thinking and memorization needed to complete each level. While the game doesn’t build in the sense of reward like Super Meat Boy does, it doesn’t really need it; by the time you beat each level, you’ll have gained the satisfaction of solving a puzzle and of executing tight platforming in one. This is all reinforced by a smart lives system where you have to actually learn how to play the game, and not just muscle through it like Meat Boy, so that you can preserve your lives and prevent yourself from starting over from the beginning. It – oh wait, you don’t have to start over? You just get three more lives? …Then what’s the point?This is the start of a few baffling decisions; why have a life system at all? Or a level skip option? Why is there a store anyway? I get that it creates a strong connection between the side modes and characters and the real gameplay as Aban but it ends up feeling grindy and “pay-to-win”.Speaking of side modes and characters, this game has a lot of content! There’s a single screen Mario Bros. style fighting game, a Kid Icarus style climbing game with scroll locking, and The Lost Levels, which actually is the game I expected except in short form, with a reduced number of levels and only 101 lives, but a Game Over if you lose them all. It doesn’t introduce any new mechanics but it does put them together in new ways, and to be honest a shortened form probably works better for that Game Over concept anyway.The best part of the game though is the level design. With rigid jumps and movement speeds there’s already a lot of potential for fine-tuned gauntlets to jump through, with a lot of pixel-perfect platforming that really matches the aesthetic and gives you the feeling that nothing about this experience should have been any different. But what’s great is how it layers it: every level has a teaching layer, a “get through the level the first time” layer, and a speedrunning multiple path layer, and everything in the game is created with these layers in mind, all without ever sacrificing internal logic. There are no scripted events here; everything is created using the tools given, and anticipation of how the player will tackle it. So let’s say there’s some spikes on a timer, and there seems to be a conveniently different colored block as a safe spot. Well that block is going to have logic to it; it’s not going to be just arbitrarily discolored, but discolored because, it has hidden spikes in it, or maybe it’s actually a cracked block and will break when you stand on it. When all of these layers and the logic within them come together it creates a world that feels like it existed before you and will continue to exist after you’re gone, rather than just a series of arbitrary obstacles. You create the timings yourself, there isn’t one set way you have to do it; a favorite mechanic of mine includes pushing a sliding ice block, that you can jump on and ride. Its velocity is set and firm, but it’s up to you to set it into motion, not the game. This is a damn fine platformer, and in my opinion, probably bests Super Meat Boy as my favorite to date.			"

												1001 Spikes is a game I feel like I've been waiting for. Simple mechanics (though the two different kinds of jump add a really strong depth to the limited actions available) coupled with exquisitely thoughtful, punishing level design. There is something exhilarating and magical about a game that gives you something that seems nearly impossible on your first few passes, but soon becomes a second-nature breeze after a few runs, and this game continually throws such moments at you. Put up against other (still worthy) contemporary games that operate from a more classical home console mode of game-making demonstrates just how sharp and vital retro aesthetics and ideas still can be.

												It's the most difficult indie game I have ever played. There's basically a death trap everywhere you step, so if you manage to pass a death trap, you'll die by another one. It's fun trying to run away from all the death traps, and complete the levels as fast as possible. The Skulls and unlockable characters make it even more fun, and they give a lot of replay value. And just when you though you're done with the game, now that you completed World 5, BOOM! Another 5 worlds (Antarctica) Gets unlocked, And they're x5 times more difficult than Ukampa! Everytime you die, you want to try again, and again and again. And everytime you die, you get better. You probably think this is a negative review, you're wrong. Doing all this stuff I listened makes the game a lot of fun, the levels are well-designed, and there are surprised everywhere. There's even Local Co-Op, and extra game modes, which are a lot of fun too! I'm giving this game a 5/5, of course, I completed the whole Story Mode. Making a review without experiencing everything is a little stupid in my opinion. Yesterday I spend 12 hours straight in this game. It's really addicting, and the graphics are beatiful. If you like Hard games, pick this up immediately, you even get a ""33% Off"" discount if you own Cave Story+ or NightSky, which makes the game cost only 6,66€ If you already bought this game, I'm just going to say one thing: Good Luck!

												1001 Spikes a.k.a. Aban Hawkins vs. Shootface McHateYou.This is not a game for the faint of heart or the buttery of fingers. It's a difficult puzzle platformer that requires more quick reflexes than analytical thinking, those there's plenty in this game to test both. This game is painfully fair as well. There's really only one stage in the game that feels like a crapshoot, and that comes near the end of the postgame. The rest, if you die, it's because you haven't figured out the level yet.There are plenty of different characters to check out once you've beaten the main game with the main character, as well as other game modes to explore. You definitely get your money's worth.If you enjoy difficult games, puzzle platformers or getting sniped repeatedly by wall statues, this game is for you.			"

												1001 Spikes take you back to the olden days of platforming, but with the modern ""Rage-Game"" difficulty. With pixel-perfect controls that are very comfortable, this game takes you through beautiful yet deadly maps, all flawlessly and cleverly designed. While most of the traps can be spotted if you look closely enough, unfortunately there's going to be times where the only way to progress through a certain jump is to die, learning what killed you, and how to get passed. Pros=========Rage-Game difficulty (For those who like the challenging platformers)Great level designRespawns are near instantVery crisp and comfortable controlsCons=========This game might be too hard for people who don't have much patienceSome of the traps are B.S. (But only the first time through)The bloody 3-pixel green zone for jumping on one of the later levels (GAHH!!!)The multiplayer feels tacked on (But the Lost Levels/Tower of Nannar are fun by yourself regardless)=====IN CONCLUSION=====All in all, this game was worth every cent I put in to it. I've 100% the game with every character, and had a blast doing it. If you're still unsure, I'm certain this will go on sale at some point, but don't wait too long! You're missing out on a good time.			"

												Summary:Not recommended for those who are frustrated by ""surprise"" deaths. You will die MANY times in a level simply because getting through it is a long sequence of ""trial and error"" attempts where you'll be killed by traps and hazards that provided no forewarning to their existence or nature, and so succeeding becomes a series of deaths that provide the experience you need to memorize where the dangers lie so that you can combine that with skilled platforming and attack shots in order to pass a level. Repeat for the next level, and so on. I'm not one to enjoy either trial and error experiences, or a memory game, so I don't recommend it.			"

												A rage game at its finest. It gives you the ever so wanted skip stage button. The traps are well placed and puzzles designed nicely, this game will make you feel frustrated when you keep missing the same jump again and again, but not so much that it becomes ""imnpossible"". Button mashing in this game may help in the first few levels, spamming buttons and screaming at your screen as traps activate below your feet. But in the later levels, you are required to execute with perfect precision, jumping and blocking traps at the same time.			"

												My expectations going in: persistence platformer, retro, loads of deaths, I'll grind through it in a few hours and be done.My impressions playing: 'Wow, this is actually well-designed. Doesn't feel cheap, but is challenging. Wait, there are arcade modes? More story levels? You can play as Commander Video?!'1001 Spikes has a boatload of content, far more than I'd anticipated. On top of the regular 30 story missions, you have another 20+ after you beat the main game...and the characters that you unlock aren't just reskins. They all play differently, and even have their own cutscenes for the story missions. There are, potentially, hundreds of levels to play if you enjoy going through with slightly varied mechanics. It's a good thing this game doesn't have leaderboards, otherwise I'd be enslaved for months.It's a persistence platformer, with all the swells and pitfalls that entails. You will die - a lot - and there's very little that you can do about it when you first run a level, unless you're preternaturally gifted and/or untrustworthy of any flat surface. Yet, it never feels outright unfair; every time you die, it's invariably due to your own errors rather than the game cheesing you, and you learn from every death. It's a fine line to tread, making a game like this. Too difficult, and people get turned off by cheap deaths; too easy, and the target demographic isn't getting the sense of trial and accomplishment that they're looking for. 1001 Spikes manages that particular high-wire act quite well, with the obligatory transition from simpler beginning stages to monstrous latter levels not being too stark. There's no I Wanna Be The Guy-esque horrors lurking within.The game has quite a quirky undertone to it conveyed via cutscenes, and the different costumes and characters certainly add to the fun. Although it's relatively barebones in terms of assets, the levels are designed very well and you can tell that plenty of love went into the game. Hats off to Nicalis for another game that's fun both in tone and gameplay. For example, the artifacts in the game give you tons of lives (which you'll need), but if you replay their levels and try to collect them again for farming purposes? Nope - it disintegrates, and it'll be a 1-down for you. It's those little details that help foster goodwill towards a game and dev team.The characters and costumes, as mentioned before, all play quite differently. Commander Video is floaty, some have a double jump, some can cling to ledges - even Aban's costume changes make him toss Hadokens around, or be able to tank a hit without dying. Controls are simple, but tight enough and I experienced very few BS deaths due to hit detection or glitches, which is a major plus in the genre. The OST is good too, albeit somewhat repetitive after you perish for the umpteenth time due to uprooting spikes of doom.1001 Spikes - not perfect, but a fine example of a game that packs a lot into a framework, doesn't overreach, and makes sure everything is designed and plays smoothly. If you have a hint of masochism about you and don't mind dying repeatedly while you inch incrementally forwards, this is a game you'll want to look at.			"

												1001 Spikes at first glance seems like an unforgiving, frustratingly difficult, sadistic game. But really it just comes down to:""Oh, I haven't done this level yet. Well let's expect to die a couple times to either spikes coming out of the ground or some boulder falling on my head because I'm trying to dodge the completely obvious traps first.""But that's where the fun comes from...First entering a stage and figuring out where the next spike-trap is that's gonna kill you and having a sense of pride come to you when you just barely jump to safety. Only to have your hopes and dreams shot down by a statue that fires a dart in your face, but don't worry you remember exactly where that spike-trap is and to throw a knife to block the statue's dart only to land and the floor falls from under you... Welcome to the wonderful life of Aban Hawkins.The level progression of the game is pretty good. They don't just throw everything at you from the get-go and expect you to be absolutely afraid of every step you take through Ukampa. Every 5 stages you get a nice little break in the action to just walk peacefully through the temple to get the key and progress to the next chapter.The controls are solid, there's no momentum in the game so you stop moving Aban and he instantly stops moving but the thing that might get you at first is there's two jump buttons. There were a few times where I'd franticly be jumping and throwing my knives, dodging traps and just suddenly find myself fall down a pit because instead of doing a high-jump, I had hit the normal-jump button.The game's decently long and along the way you can collect Golden Skulls (There's 30 of them, one in each stage) and once you get so many you start unlocking other modes to play (All the unlocked modes can be play with up to 4-players).-There's a tower mode where you pick your character, climb a tower to save a princess and collect treasure along the way.-There's Lost Levels mode where you pick a character again, and go through chapters which consist of 3 stages and each chapter is a tileset from the campaign mode and each stage has coins you can collect.-There's a mode that was meant for 4-players. You hit a golden chalice for coins to pop-out and try to see who can get the most coins before time runs out.You will also start to unlock other characters which have their own unique gameplay mechanics.It's one of those rare platformers that really makes you feel like you acomplished something great once you beat it. All that hardwork, all those tears, all those controllers you broke along the way and if that wasn't enough for some of you, you can also play through the entire thing again as a different character to unlock their own cutscenes.A fantastic game worth every penny!

												The main flaw with this game is the level design. The levels are fun once you figure out where all the hidden traps are, but in the end you are going to feel really cheated when you have to take 10+ cheap deaths guarenteed in the later levels on top of the several deaths it will take to get back to where you died last time. Spikes should not be completely invisible to the player until they step on them. Overall the game is really frustrating for all the wrong reasons. I love games that are really hard, like Super Meat Boy, but this levels are designed to be progressively more unfair rather than more genuinely difficult. Once I know how to beat a level I can beat it in about 5 tries. A game that would normally take about 50 tries and 30 minutes to complete is artificially lengthened by these cheap traps in literally every level to the point where some levels take upwards of 100 deaths the first time you play them.

												If you enjoy platformers and the high diffulty is what you see as a challenge, not discouragement, this is the right game for you. I call it 'a mild version of I Wanna Be The Guy'. Just like in legendary IWBTG, 1001 Spikes levels are designed to ♥♥♥♥ you over, but beating them is certainly possible, if you are smart, swift and patient. Because like in every hard platformer, patience is what you will need the most, to learn how to deal with different kinds of traps: arrows flying from level walls, falling rocks, lava, moving platforms, disappearing floor and of course, countless spikes. The game will provide you with few hours of entertainment for the main campaign only - and few other gamemodes plus local multiplayer are what you can play right after.To me, it is my third favorite platformer, right after Super Meat Boy and Electronic Super Joy.

												A great little game that deserves more attention.I can understand why, looking at the trailer and screenshots, 1001 Spikes might appear generic and uninteresting. Give it a try though, and you'll discover sublime and intuitive controls, and some of the tightest design I've ever seen in a precision platformer.Make no mistake, this game is difficult. But every level is a joy to experience (with one exception in the main game - the extras are weaker). It's hard to describe what good design feels like, but play through the first couple of worlds and, if you pay attention, you'll notice the perfect pacing, natural introduction of mechanics, and challenges that feel satisfying and fun rather than random and frustrating.I'm easily frustrated. I hate the stupid little whip in Spelunky and the rubbish jumping in so many games of this genre. But nothing in this game got to me. It's because this game doesn't cheat its way to difficulty. It gets there the hard way, and when you're done with it, you won't want to throw the controller away - you'll wish you could wind back the clock and do it all again.			"

												If you like Spelunky and I Wanna Be the Guy (Like I do) then this game was made for you my friend, this is the kind of platformer that is unfair not because of an objective gameplay problem or due to poor game design, but because IT WANTS to be unfair, you'll die a lot and that's the idea, but at the same time dying a lot it's not a problem because stages are short and quick so you never really feel like you lost your time/progress, if you like games that require trial and error, quick reflexes and good platforming skills, then you can't go wrong with this one.To end this review I'd like to make something very clear here, this is a good game, So why does it have ""mixed"" reviews then?? Why so many negative reviews?? you might ask, well that's just people blaming the game for being what it is, basically for doing nothing wrong since the game was always intended to be this way in the first place, which is stupid, like blaming a cat for having fur.Bottom line: If you like this kind of games then play it and you'll probably enjoy it, if you don't, why would you wanna play it then??

												This game reminds me so much of ""Rick Dangerous"" - the character, the graphics, the level design...Unfortunately, it also has all the bad elements of Rick Dangerous too. Namely, this is not a game of skill. This is a game of memory. It would be fair if elements in the game behaved in predictable ways, but they don't. So, you get platforms that drop away from under you with no warning, spikes that appear out of perfectly normal looking blocks, and enemies that don't behave in predictable ways.For example, I was stuck on level 2-5 for ages, because there was absolutely NO indication anywhere previously that the projectiles you shoot will nullify enemy fire. This wasn't mentioned at any point, and it was only from asking a friend I discovered that. Incidentally, he found out purely by accident.The game introduced the concept of checkpoints in one level, which I thought was a welcome idea....and then I never saw them again. Maybe they'll appear later on the game. Maybe they won't. Who knows?If you're a fan of trolling games like ""I Wanna Be The Guy"", I'm sure you'll love this. But for me, it's just pure frustration.

												Starts out fun, but quickly becomes annoying. The difficulty is punishing, but not in a rewarding or compelling way...most of your deaths feel cheap and hollow. The game is less about skill and creative play, and more about slogging through each stage until you discover every hidden trap and obstacle. This process is really repetitive and gets old fast. The game is also way overpriced for what it is. This might be someone's idea of a good time, but I couldn't get there. Can't recommend this one, even on sale.			"

												Really fun game! I have no issues with the game itself, as a matter of fact, I loved the seven hours I spent with it.However, the game has decided it'll start crashing on startup.I've tried all the ""fixes,"" and none of them work.Until this problem is fixed, I can't recommend this game, because you'll get over halfway through, only to find you can't play it anymore.

												Lives and spikes, spikes and lives…this game is often a hellish gauntlet of precision timing and rapid death that harkens back to the days of Nintendo and platformer-hell gaming.  Seriously, there’s a particular sub stage (I won’t ruin the cheap and fatal surprise for any that haven’t played this yet, so sorry…no specifics!) that attempts to kill you in the 1.5 seconds you need to allow for the exit to open once you reach the door with the key.  Yes, the developers certainly don’t hold back in this game and will attempt to kill you at every turn when possible, so spikes aside, be on the lookout for anything that could potentially kill you…and avoid it at all costs! But don’t let any of that hold you back.  The music is quite catchy and the pixelated graphics have that nostalgic feel that most people seem to love (or hate? – I guess for those that are getting sick of Steam being flooded by all these indie/retro games).  There are mult. game modes, additional characters to unlock (some with unique abilities that make it easier to complete stages, which is very cool), and even a store that allows you to purchase further unlockables with the right amount of coin (obtained in game of course, though some things are pretty expensive so if you really want them you’ll have to start saving, but even that shouldn’t take too long depending on what you want to get).Oh yeah, there’s even bad spelling/poor syntax that may vaguely remind one of the likes of the ‘All your bass are belong to us’ phenomenon of Zero Wing or the ‘Be garbage of cesspool’ comment from the dumbed-down-for-Nintendo version of Splatter House.  Sure, it wasn’t as bad as those, but it was still fun to see regardless.The game is fun, so get it, at least when it’s on sale.  But if you really like getting killed repeatedly by the most insidious environmental trap ever conceived of in a game – yeah, you guessed correctly if you thought spikes - then this game is most definitely for you.

												I can see why people like this game but personally, I don't think it's worth the $15 price tag. Normally, I'm good at these kind of games but the difficulty here is just WAY too high. It's difficult to the point of being more frustrating than fun. Overall, unless it's on sale for cheap, just pass this one unless you're into these types of games.			"

												There are a lot of good levels in single player and a large number of characters. Some of the characters are very similar, but there are enough unique ones that it doesn't really matter too much. The multiplayer modes are decent, but not as good as the singleplayer. The game has lots of traps, but once you die to one you can anticipate other similar traps later. I never found it to be too unfair, since it's pretty much impossible to run out of lives.			"

												This game is not a brutally difficult platformer in the vein of Super Meat Boy or a challenging platformer in the vein of Braid or a casual platformer in the vein of New Super Mario Bros. Wii. This is a trial-and-error platformer in the vein of Limbo, but without the visual aesthetic to go with it. This game has the precision platforming of Super Meat Boy, but it's coupled with cheap, un-telegraphed deaths that force you to play the same level several times, not only to time the jumps and attacks but to learn the environment. It's an artifical difficulty, not a fair one. If you're looking for another experience like Super Meat Boy or a challenging platformer, you are looking in the wrong place. "

												Can we talk about Aban Hawkins & the 1001 Spikes?We're gonna talk about Aban Hawkins & the 1001 Spikes.I'm gonna start with few statements that are all absolute facts:You truly feel being alive during this. This is like if Dark Souls was made for adults. You will never leave the ruins of Ukampa Temple alive. Did any of these made you feel scared, afraid or panicked? If so, get out.The rest of you, keep listening.I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. Ever been into Rick Dangerous, La-Mulana, Cave Story, Spelunky or Super Meat Boy? If so, good because this should be right down your alley then. This game looks, sounds and plays like 8-bit title from the mid to late 80's, but the level- and game design is all 2014, baby. And don't let the limited color palette or resolution startle you, this game is audiovisually gorgeous - at least if you can appreciate real games made for grownups.The controls are really sharp, responsive and overall snappy. One of the favourite things about this game is that you can only move, throw daggers and jump either a small jump or big jump - both controlled by separate buttons. There's none of the slick fluid like movement and variable running speed or jumping heights, instead you have super accurate controls, so controlling Aban to his death feels ever so good and precise!Speaking of death, there's plenty of that packed in this bundle of fun and joy! There's SO many ways you can die in this game, and guess what? It's all your fault! My favourite part about this game is that it gets gradually harder and harder, but never it becomes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to play. No matter how tricky construction of death and misery is in front of you, you can always tell them before hand: Subtle changes on the tiles, lack of foliages, bit of animation, maybe sound effect or bit of delay and effect before your inevitable death and decay. It might feel cheap, but each level can be eventually figured out and mastered, and you're gonna feel ♥♥♥♥ing great as you do so - even more if you happen to find one of the hidden golden skulls.I also wanna say right now that this game does not compare to I Wanna Be The Guy - because I Wanna Be The Guy is not a hard game for a good reason. IWBTG is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing game and prime example of how you should not design a game. Having completed that game, I have all the right to call it a ♥♥♥♥ing garbage it definetly is.Anyhow! Still interested? Good! The game actually does have a plot of some sort, that is delivered in the similar subtly animated still anime frames like in the NES Ninja Gaiden series. There's also a whole new continent to explore on a New Game+, variable multiplayer options and also ""lost levels"" during the development time that you can try out for your pleasure. There's plenty of unlockable character, each with their own special abilities, you can buy stuff to be unlocked in the game's store and it has also couple really, really well hidden super secrets I'm not gonna even spoil.As far as I know, I have no gripes with this game. Some people with third party controllers had some issues, but the game's been updated few times and the Steam Forums have workarounds for those issues in case you stumble into any.TL;DR This game is like if Dark Souls was made for adults in 8-bit glory. You will become a man after this game (even if you're a woman, there will be chesthair and beard everywhere). You will love and you will hate this game, and you're ♥♥♥♥ing glad that you didn't miss this one out.11/10, would spike again.			"

												Really nice game. It's really challenging but the controls are very good so you don't die because of them. The game can be pretty unfair with traps that you just can't avoid the first time but you progress quite quickly and finishing a level is really satisfaying.The music is nice (if you like retro sounds)You can unlock a lot of things like new characters or game mode (there isn't much but they're nice and original).And finally you can play with friends, I didn't try it yet but it sure looks like a lot of fun.

												I've played this previously in my time. This game is quite a throwback. Two different buttons for jumps can make paths and levels quite interesting. Some people get miffed because things pop out of nowhere, but if you understand why the controls are the way they are, you can also understand the game is the way it is.It's good old platforming fun, and for speedrunners, a good challenge. Extra modes are nice.Only downside is grinding a metric amount of coins to unlock things in the shop.A solid 8.5/10 in my book.			"

												oook let's see, the game consists in a campaign plus 3 coop local modes up to 4 people and I tell you some could be really funny to play in coop, however the campaign is long enough i'd say and there's a storyline too which is kinda funny, it can get frustratig from time to time, I noticed that in 2 levels where I had more then 100 deaths on. anyway after the hard part you can get some serious fun playing with the other chars u can unlock which have different playstyle, jumps, shots and so on. I give this game a 7/10, controls are ok 2 things I want to say tho, first I did fall from a moving platform 3 times(without moving ofc) and that really annoied me, and one last thing which is not a seroius complain, more like a tip for new eventual players, don't mess too miuch with the controller near the exit door, I did crash the game 3 times cause of that and it kinda sucks so whenever u reach the door just go there and don't spam buttons and directions speedrun style			"

												1001 Spikes is a game that seems like it should be frustrating, which makes it all the more impressive that it generally isn't. Between the well-cultivated atmosphere and the responsive, reliable controls, a death doesn't feel like you've been cheated, even when spikes suddenly skewer you from the platform you thought was safe - rather, it feels like you and the ruins are each constantly plotting to outwit the other.That's not to say that it's not difficult, just that the difficulty, speaking as someone who is just past the halfway point, seems fair. In general, even the most nefarious traps give just enough warning that in theory you could avoid them all the first time  you saw them - though, well, that's not too likely. While the game makes a point of being 'hardcore' with your life counter steadily ticking down from 1001 and autosave keeping you honest, it's more forgiving than it looks there as well - the relics you collect at the end of areas give you bonus lives and it's fairly reasonable to stay 'on pace'. There's also a nice variety of levels and challenges to face - some where you'll be carefully planning out each move, and some where you'll be madly dashing through corridors.In all, 1001 Spikes feels as though it turned out exactly as intended - simply put, it's a well-crafted game, and one worth experiencing.

												There are games that are difficult, yet fair. You slowly climb your way up to the victory by perfecting your muscle memory, remembering enemies patterns, learning game's mechanics, etc. But there are games that try too hard to be difficult. 1001 spikes is one of them.Starting from about 6 - 7 level the desing of the game starts to be horrendously assholish. Narrow corridors with traps shooting darts that you have to shoot down with your knives or whatever, million spikes coming out of every surface on a map, voids, scorpions, etc. You die, you start over, ♥♥♥♥ing infuriating :PDying in Spelunky, Super Meat Boy or LIMBO is fun. Dying in 1001 spikes is just painful. Like a spike in your scrotum. It's still a good game though, if you're a masochist.			"

												After buying this game on a whim after noticing it was developed by the cave story guys, I found myself fully enganged to the point of finishing the entire campaign (while collecting all the golden skulls), and unlocking nearly every character all in one sitting. I had NO IDEA I would get hooked so fast on such an impulse purchase.At first glance, this game seems like a simple platformer with retro graphics and unrelenting difficulty. But under the surface, there is SO much more to this game.While the game is hard, and by hard, I mean INFURIATINGLY hard, it isn't hard because of broken controls, bad mechanics, or unfair elements. It is hard, because it puts YOUR skills and YOUR reflexes to the test. The controls are extremely tight, leaving every single mistake jump, or accidental shot up to you to make. Did you just land on a spike trap and die? It was your fault. Did you just throw your knife in the wrong direction to block an arrow trap that you almost didn't notice until it shot at you? Sucks to be you.Every level is designed with traps, spikes, enemies, and lava for you to die from, and if you don't pay attention, you will miss something important. Observation is the key to survival. If you find a spot to take a breather, (which in the later levels is VERY rare I might add) you better use it to look around and plan your next move. It almost becomes a strategy-puzzle-platformer on certain levels due to the sheer depth of the mechanics.But even in the most hellish pit the game has to offer, (I'm looking at you 4 - 5) it never feels unfair, or like the odds are against you. You can do this, and you KNOW you can do this. and after you fail, you only get that much stronger. And there is no comparison to the satisfaction you get from finally beating that one level that gave you SO much hell. The relief from the adrenaline alone is worth it.In a nutshell, get this game. Just do it. Learn a thing or two about completing a game with true skill, and not because the developer gave you this pretty little path with rainbows to follow, and checkpoints around every corner, making sure that every failure feels as if it didn't even matter.10/10			"

												Did you think Super Meat Boy was hard?  Did They Bleed Pixels make you break out in hives?  Masocore platforming wonders though they be, both of these games prostrate themselves before the blood-splattered feet of Aban Hawkins and the 1001 Spikes.  It's hardcore!But it is far from unfair, and that is a big portion what makes the game so good.  Yes, 1001 Spikes demands some of the most nitpicky platforming precision in all of neoretro gaming, and it will frequently cheapshot you as you stand, exhaling pent-up breath, before the level exit --  but it can be mastered, and the controls are both sensitive and simple enough for you to smoothly handle any challenge it throws at you.  You never run out of chances to triumph, either; though the game pretends to give you 1001 lives, that is nothing more than an arbitrary counter to increase the feeling of tension as you watch it decrease by the hundreds.  You'll actually get a few extra automatically whenever you run out (not that this ever happened to me, I am proud to say).  Funny thing is, even knowing this, you still get nervous watching those lives dwindle.  I'm sure Philip Zimbardo could do a study on that . . . The levels are very short, but they have such marvelous flow to them they you'll play obsessively once you've started one, even if it takes you 150 faux lives to beat!  And since the game's many levels have an astonishing amount of variety (save those ubiquitous spikes), you won't stop saying ""just one more stage!"" until you drop from exhaustion.  One level you're almost playing Lode Runner, and the next you're jumping on Mega Man-style vanishing blocks and shooting metroids!  The visuals and sound hit that neoretro sweetspot!  Sprites are rendered charmingly, with just enough frames of animation to look smooth whilst remaining authentic.  The level graphics are NES-ideal:  detailed to the very limit of 8-bit, but without the visual muddiness which plagues even some of the best classic games.  The pixelated cinematics, through which the game's light (and very cute) narrative is delivered, are crunchy-gorgeous.  The sound effects are perfectly adequate, and the music is strong enough to stand apart from the game.This game is nearly perfect in every aspect!  If you like neoretro or hardcore platforming, you must purchase Aban Hawkins and the 1001 Spikes!  The game is brutally difficult, addictive, lovingly crafted . . .  and oddly sweet-natured.  Just get it, you'll see what I mean.			"

												Yes, this game's difficulty is not for everyone. Yes, this game will troll you several times. And yes, you'll die a lot — sometimes just a couple of steps away from clearing a level! If you can't stand any of that, then I'll get this out of the way for you right now: just give this one a miss, but at least strongly consider buying it. Otherwise, go right ahead and grab this game! It's pretty cheap and yet provides a fair amount of bang for your buck.The presentation is amazing, the 8-bit-style art looks great (both in-game and during cutscenes), and most notably the controls are tight, precise, and work like a dream. You have a button for each a low and a high jump (one and two tiles high, respectively), and you also have a shoot button to take out the occasional critter, stop projectiles that are coming at you, break blocks to unveil secret collectibles, and change the trajectory of spinning blade traps. Mastering these controls is key to survive the increasingly deadly gauntlets you'll come across along the way.Throughout the game, you'll be able to unlock guest characters from other indie games. Each character has their own gameplay gimmicks such as higher jump height, hovering, or rapid-fire shooting. There are also a few unlockable extra game modes but I personally didn't find them that interesting.If you're a fan of NES-styled, tough as nails titles, I can't recommend this one enough. The levels are tough but they never feel like they're impossible, although a few of them may have an RNG factor which could lead to some unfair, perhaps even unavoidable deaths. I will admit that I quit the game a few times because of stuff like that, but there was something about it that kept me coming back. It's fun, addicting, challenging, and very satisfying once you get the hang of it.(P.S.: The adorable Curly Brace from ""Cave Story"" is one of the guest characters in this game!)			"

												Great puzzles, tight controls, precise platforming... and music is quite good too. We also tried 3-player co-op and it's hilarious. There's that bitter-sweet feeling when you just beat a puzzle only to get welcomed by surprise trap on the next step. On some levels you'll be happy, on some other you'll be thankful it's finally over. If you liked Rick Dangerous or VVVVVV, this is a game for you. There are some minor bugs, like using controller in menus made me had to move two sticks at the same time to change the active menu item. And sometimes in co-op mode one of the characters changes to default (although we selected a different one in versus game and  it stuck for some time). But overall, it's one of the best games I played this year.			"

												I really tried to enjoy this game. I like a challenge in my games and i also dont mind restarting a stage hundreds and hundreds of times. But this game is just blatant unfair at some stages. The first World (The Golden Tempel) was really fun and challenging, the golden skulls were well hidden, sometimes a bit unfair, but oh well you can buy a Skull-Wallhack for some Coins in the Store.The real Pain begins in the Antarctic World, some Levels require so much luck.. its unbearable. And the Final Boss is a Joke. (The Snake one) You basically have to hit Crystals to destroy the Snake. It would be a fun Bossfight if there wouldnt be random Rocks falling down from the Sky killing you instantly without any warning. And the Fact that my Savegame broke and i had to do the Antarctic world twice to get the last achievement wasn't really fun either.I would love to recommend this game, but at some points it is just so frustrating and stupid that i cant. The only pros i can think of are the well-done ""cutscenes"" with nice artwork and good music. I also like the general Artstyle.			"

												I absolutely adore this game. Every sprite and tile (with a few exeptions) has three colours, just like the NES. The music (also retro), is outstanding. The story is great to follow along, and there's 18 playable characters, most of which have their own story, in addition to the story of the three extra arcade modes's stories. The difficulty is hard, in a fair way; If you mess up, it's your fault, not the game. I'd Give Aban Hawkings and the 1001 Spikes: The Temple of Dead Mourns the Living a 10/10. get it.PS: ALSO SIMULTANIOUS 4-PLAYER LOCAL MULTI-PLAYER FOR EVERY GAME MODE! WUHUAHUAWHAHAHHUUUAAAAA			"

												This game is difficult perfection.It's not IWBTG stupid where it's game of trial and error, yet it's not so easy you can breeze through every level. The pacing is perfection, making you rush through insane trials of never ending death traps, only to have a small spot where you can take a breather and let yourself catch up to speed. Whenever I am caught off guard by a trap, I feel like it is usually my fault for not taking a close look at the stage beforehand (they are usually denoted by different coloured blocks)The game is also massively replayable. I haven't even beaten the first campaign for the main story (I'm halfway through the fire place) and apparently there's more after it. There's also a bunch to buy from the store, hidden secrets to find in every level, and something like 16 characters to unlock. This game is definitely worth the price, and I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to have a good challenge.			"

It feels right. Until you are about at half of the water levels, at this point you stop using your skills to avoid traps only to start memorizing patterns over and over again until you get it right, and then to start memorizing the next pattern afterwards.

You do not have, like other platformers, options to react or anything.The fact that this games keeps putting you into checkmate positions at all time make it not worth your time.

												Abandoned by the developer?As of August 9th, 2015 this game no longer boots up at all.The community forums have 3-4 threads about how a lot of people are experiencing this problem, and to date (after spanning months between posted threads), the developer hasn't issued any kind of statement regarding a fix. Be warned, you might purchase a game you can't even play. I've tried all the fixes posted about on the forums, such as uninstalling and erasing saves, and it simply doesn't work anymore despite working in the past, even after reinstalling completely.It's a crying shame the developer has seemingly abandoned this for PC (or is taking a really long time fixing this critical issue). 1001 Spikes itself is amazing, challenging and refreshing as a game, and definitely worthy of a purchase if you enjoy hardcore platformers which will likely make you bald early in life.Until this is resolved though, consider reading the forums now and again to make sure a fix has been implemented and pass in the meantime.Very disappointing.

												I love challenging platformers, and someone recommended 1001 Spikes to me, so I was really hoping it would be interesting.Sadly, I very much did not like it. It's not even a challenging platformer, it's a troll platformer, as fans of this ""genre"" have so affectionately named it. Although it might be more appropriate it to call it a trial-and-error puzzler like Limbo, albeit with none of the charm and no checkpoints whatsoever.The basic idea of the game is that everything kills you instantly, fair enough. But you never know when or how. So you're forced to repeat a stage over and over again until you have memorized every single trap, hurdle enemy and surprise. There's basically little to no skill involved, as most of the jumps are fairly easy to do. There's not much in the way of puzzle solving or abstract thinking either. The only skill required is a good memory.If that sounds fun to you, you'll love this game. But if you're a fan of games like Super Meat Boy, La Mulana, Battleblock Theater, you'll probably hate this game, and I don't recommend checking it out.In its favor, the game has an interesting little story, decent pixel art, local multiplayer and catchy music. But I'll likely never experience those things, because the game itself is irritating instead of fun or engaging.Even though it's not quite the same genre, if you're thinking of picking up 1001 Spikes, pick up La Mulana instead. Very similar aesthetic, very similar attitude, but a much better game overall.			"

												Besides the cool references to old NES/Arcade games like Castlevania, Superpitfall, and Ghosts & Goblins, this game is not worth the asking price of 15$. 1001 Spikes isnt difficult, its beyond difficult, nearly impossible. The only reason you will die in this game is cheap death, after cheap death. The traps in the game have no pattern whatsoever. Spikes for example, will randomly appear on any block, at anytime. Spikes (you are lead to believe) will appear on only certain blocks, such as ones with a square pattern, only for you to find out that they can appear on any texture with no warning given. You can play a single level many times and will only finish the level if you memorize every part of it. Many times I have gotten to the end only for a random block to fall on me or spikes to come shooting out of the ground and stab me. [ Just to give you an example the game starts out and you have 1001 lives - and they go by very fast ]Some other cons:-No button configuration names for controllers (will just read as ""press button #11"")-have to unlock some multiplayer featuresFor me the game itself is purly based on trial and error such as dragon's lair, rather than skill.

												You know that frustrating feeling when a game puts an unskippable cutscene after a save so you have to pointlessly watch it over and over to proceed...  Thats how 1001 Spikes feels to play.The weird thing is that its not a hard game, its an incredibly simple platformer (can only jump to a certain height and moving speed is always the same) The only real difficulty is that the levels are full of hidden traps and every level has obstacles which require you to wait and do nothing until they move so it just becomes a monotonous grind of trial and error with a ton of waiting around doing nothing.No way would i pay £10 for this game if i didnt get it in a bundle.

Then when I went through and unassigned the default keys, I could no longer clear out other key bindings because that key had been set to 'None' and I also couldn't back out of the key bind menu because THAT key had been wiped out, too. So I had to Alt-Tab out and close the game via Windows' task bar.When I reopened the game, all the in-game help for which key to press was wrong. The little mice tell you ""push NONE to talk to my friends"" when I clearly have that assigned to the letter W for up.			"

Treading the Line between Tedium and FunLet me preface this by saying that I only played this game for what I would say is only a cursory amount. Perhaps, this has given me a biased view of 1001 Spikes, but in my defense I did watch videos of later levels to make sure I was not unfairly judging the game. With that out of the way, here are my thoughts on 1001 Spikes.In the recent years, there has been a resurgence in ""difficult"" games trying to emulate the games from the 80s and early 90s that tried to balance frustration and fun. 1001 Spikes defintely tries to fit  this mold, but unfortunately, what this game does is rely too much on trial and error. The game itself isn't particularly hard once you learn the trap locations of the level, and I guess I just don't have the energy to that anymore. If you are willing to inch forward on every map, you might enjoy this game. Otherwise, stay away.A few more notes: Props to the music guy. Soundtrack is pretty good. Same with the spritework. It really captures that retro aesthetic. Controls were slightly stiff, but didn't really affect gameplay that much imo. "

												1001 Spikes is challenging, that's true, the problem is that the game's challenge pretty much entirely comes from how unfair it is. You'll find yourself dying less because you mistimed jumps and more because a random floating block fell on you or a spike trap came up from a block you were standing on, despite that block being identical to the completely normal block you were standing on seconds ago.

												Quite clever and addictive hardcore platformer that takes cues from Spelunky as well as old-school games like Pitfall for Atari 2600 and Megaman for NES. The ""1001 lives"" gag is amusing, but trust me, you'll probably need every single one of them.Can be extremely frustrating, even somewhat rage-inducing, but the payoff when you successfully breeze through an otherwise difficult level is very satisfying. Overall a solid platformer with charming nods to the games of yesteryear, without falling into the ""nostalgia for nostalgia's sake"" shovelware bin (I'm looking at you, Retro City Rampage.)			"

												Discount Spelunky, albeit less challenging and still quite fun. Now keep in mind this is no Cave Story despite the same creator, but it's still quite a fun game. I got it in a bundle(HB.) for a $1 and not only does it have plenty of fun platformer levels to play through, it has multiplayer modes as well. If you want a kind of old school mario feel with a mix of Indiana jones 2D plaforming, then this is the game for you. Great singleplayer adventure for the $1 I spent for the bundle, great party game atmosphere, and a great deal for a $1. I would NOT recommend it for $15, but even if you miss the sale and are reading this, it's worth at least $5 in a sale. $15 is a bit much.TLDR: Platoformer. Spikes Kill you lots. Multiplayer is lots of lols fun mini-games and unique vs interaction.Note: The game likes to troll you a lot, so be careful. It's like. ""Hey bro, congrats. SPIKE to the face."" ""Hey I see you paused there for a second, let me throw a big projectile rolling towards you."" ""Hey, DART TO THE FACE. BWAHAHHAA."" kind of feel.			"

												If you enjoy difficult platformers, you'll enjoy 1001 Spikes. Old-school NES feel and difficulty, but nothing that can't be passed with a bit of practice. The game has great music, good level design and more than a few moments that made me yell when I got killed by a trap I didn't see coming. The game drew me in, never frustrating me so much that I quit, just making me want to try again to get a little bit farther. The controls are tight and the unlockable characters and game modes add plenty of replay value.			"

												I would not recommend this game because of the sure irritation of this game.I would rather recommend Spelunky if you are looking to play with a character that resembles Indiana Jones, because it is way more fun and less more frustrating.I don't mind doing a level over and over again, but it is starting to get really painfully.

There are a lot of good, and many more mediocre, platformers available on steam.  This isn’t one of them.This game has nothing going for it.  The graphics aren’t just “retro”-crappy, they are boring.  At least Mario was interesting to look at right?  At least super meat-boy gave you something to dread.  At least Fez gave you hope and wonder.  The game is capped at 60fps.  Hideous music will poke your ear drums like a q-tip gone too far.  Controller prompts will say “button 14”, button 1”, and etc…..this is indie trash.			"

												SOmewhat of a missed opportunity. I played many 8-bit platform games back in the day, and this game has the potential to recreate some of the best. The gameplay is simple, and easy to get the hang of. The look, feel, and sound are all top notch and recreate the 8-bit environemnt very believeably.Sadly, the game falls into the trap that most 8bit platformers avoided like the plague. Because traps are hidden, it is not possible to plan a route through any given level, or to use skill to beat the game. One learns the route through a level by dying, repeatedly. One has to then remember all the correct moves, and execute them at the correct time. Beating a level owes a lot less to skill than to being able to remember exactly when to do what and where the traps are.I gave it an hour, but put it down when I died for the 10th? 20th? time on a level after having got through all the traps I had spent ten minutes learning about, only to fall prey to yet another hidden trap. The level requires a series of jumps over blocks which melt under you, so timing is vital. But add to that the gun which shoots JUST as you are about to land on a vital brick and.. yeah. Sorry, but I got bored repeating the exact timing of jumps to get to that part of the level. I just don;t have the heart to do it another 10 times just so I can learn - little by little - the timing of the jumps needed to beat that last gun. The bullets travel too fast and there is no visible warning that the gun will fire: so it comes down to ""just knowing"" the exact, split-second timing of the jumps which are needed.That's not fun. Which is a shame. Because, as I said: this game could have been very awesome indeed.			"

												Another NES style game, only this one's purpose is to be challenging and only that. Nothing else in this game is incredibly noteworthy. The platforming feels great but not too great. unfortunately that's where the compliments stop. While graphically it's supposed to appeal to players who enjoy NES style games it also leaves it looking extremely simplistic. Not a horrible thing but for sure makes the platforming difficult and dodging traps on first tries almost impossible. Especially considering just a small difference in texture can mean an active dart trap vs a non active dart trap, etc. Overall I can't recommend this game for most. It's really just for people looking for a trial and error challenge because you will fail due to levels having artificial difficult. If you are someone who wants an unfair challenge and enjoys nes games then go for it.As for those who want  MORE  than a challenge with their games your money is better spent elsewhere.			"

												This game is bad. I mean, i like challenging platforms but this is not challenging, it is just unfair and the game is all about to learn the patterns of the traps and do the same level over and over until you have learned how a level is made and this does not require any ""gaming"" skill, just patience and luck even if you are good enough. I don't even understand why the developers made TWO buttons to jump, when every other single game requires only one button to jump and you can choose the height of it, i died many times for this. Some games punish you with death if you are not careful, but at least they give you enough time to react. This game is like ""you walk --> you are dead"", or at least this was my experience. A good game should be like ""you walk --> danger --> you are dead/alive"".			"

												1001 Spikes is punishing, difficult and downright unfair at times. And that's what makes it great. Right from the start of the game you are told to ""Always be on your guard"", which is then followed with an arrow being shot into your face.If you're not vigilant at all times, you will die. If you don't react fast enough to traps appearing or terrain falling, you will die. If you're unable to remember the path of the level, you will die. 1001 Spikes is a challenging game, so as the recent reviews show, it's not for everyone. But if you enjoyed Super Meat Boy or other similar games, you'll like this too. The environments are detailed even with the pixel graphics, the soundtrack is excellent and the platforming is perfect. There are two seperate jump buttons to make sure you always nail the height you need to, and the movement isn't floaty or slippery at all.Every level has its own Golden Skull to collect, an optional extra objective. Upon pickup it grants you an extra life, so as long as you get to the Skull each time you can try endlessly without fear of running down your lives. These unlock a multitude of extra characters, each with their own abilities and music, and a few other game modes, which again completely change how the game plays. The amount of variety is great.If you find the prospect of dying near the end of a level just because you didn't notice a different wall tile you may want to pass. But if you want a challenge and don't mind repeating levels several dozen times (or the entire game, if you lose all your lives!), give 1001 spikes a go.			"

												This game is a masterpiece in level design. In story mode you play through a series of increasingly difficult, and fantastically designed short levels (~30 secs long) with lots of spikes, falling bricks, darts. Many of the traps are concealed until they kill you. Luckily you have 1001 lives, and brilliantly it never feels like dying is a chore. The soundtrack and retro graphics are superb and certainly add to 1001 Spikes' charm. The controls are super responsive and they need to be to allow you to navigate the levels with careful precision and timing.I highly recommend 1001 Spikes!  10/10			"

												""We are going to die"" (Indiana Jones Temple of Doom) Yes, you are going to die in this game about every 10 to 20 secs upon entering a new level. The levels are not random but there are brutal none the less. This is a side scrolling 8 bit platform game which requires you to pretty much memorize the stages because the you will never know what to expect. The ceiling may come falling down or spikes may come out of a block you just never know what is going to happen. Trial and error is the name of the game here. If you like games like Spelunky, Super Meatboy, Braid ect. Then you are going to love this game i sure do. Not for the faint of heart just for the persistent hardcore. Highly recommmend!			"

												I dig the idea of a challenging platformer designed to hone your skills, and at first, 1001 Spikes lives up to this, but then two things happened:1. Levels began tossing obstacles from offscreen, leading to cheap deaths if I didn't scroll the screen properly or predict what was going to happen via audio cues.2. Somehow a game styled on 8-bit graphics began lagging for me on a system that damn well ought to be able to handle it. When you have to throw knives with precision to stop a dart lodging itself in your face, this is a fatal flaw.I lost interest in the middle of world 3 and who knows? Maybe there was more fun stuff. I know I really enjoyed the Tower of whatever hidden mode, but the main campaign wasn't pulling me in anymore.			"

												Basically this is a Dark Souls Archaeological Platformer. You will die a lot in order to memorize levels and trap patterns. It's not a plain platformer, this game is a game of chess based on dexterity. However this one sounds.Little disclaimer - I haven't played this one in a local co-op. There is such an option.Pros:- nice music- controller is working and its working fine- graphics are plain but clean- some traps are really clever- you can one-hit enemies and that's a good idea in a platformer- this game seems to have a lot of secrets - secret stages, additional characters with different attacks and their own stories and so onCons:- gameplay is tedious, repetitive, you die alot, one hit you're dead (you have 1000 lives). Some levels seem to require you to die few times in order to be completed. Alternatively you need to have lightning fast reflexes- story is so bland that I don't feel motivated to play this game to unravel itMixed feelings:- try to grab that golden skulls or whatever that is, that adds even more hardcore difficulty to the gameHard one to recommend this one or not. Let's break it down into pieces:- worth to buy for 10 euros? - NO- worth to play for some time - YES- is it fun? - YES- is it hard? - YES- is it repetitive? - YES- is it a good game? - technically YES- do I want to play it? - NOI don't recommend this one although you can grab it now for a dollar at HumbleBundle so give it a shot. ---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

												DISCLAIMER: This review is mostly a first impression after an hour or so of playing and looking at some footage of later sections online to see if much changes, but it seems that my opinion of the start of the game would hold true for the rest of the game.1001 Spikes is another addition in the trend of ""The harder the game is the better it is!"" that has captivated many players over the past couple of years. And I won't tell you that the game is hard, any other user review or critic can tell you and probably has told you that. If you just want a hard game then 1001 Spikes is totally for you and you should already know that. This user review however is for those out there who want to know the answer to the question ""What is 1001 Spikes, other than hard?""And the answer is almost nothing. Its a nostalgic hard game and seemingly nothing more. It seems to have no goal but kill you endlessly with surprise deathtraps that seem inspired by some strange and horrid idea that I Wanna Be The Guy should be viewed with anything but irony. The majority of my deaths playing this game so far have felt cheap and put there merely to make me replay the same content over and over. The game doesn't feel like a spicy challenge, but more of an unwanted chore.Even within its niche 1001 Spikes doesn't seem that good. Super Meat Boy had better controls, felt generally fair and had a stronger art direction. La Mulana which has quite similar elements although is part of a different subgenre of nostalgic hard platformers offers a great sense of exploration and mystery. 1001 Spikes offers a lot of spikes and warningless deathes.So to those out there who want more than just a hard game. Move on, 1001 Spikes seems to having nothing to offer you.			"

												I got this as soon as it came out, and honestly, its not really all that much fun. I mean all the elements are there - it has great retro graphics, excellent music, and hard-as-nails difficulty, but I just found myself not really wanting to play it. I think it comes down to the fact that its not *really* a fair difficulty. Yes you can learn to avoid certain pitfalls, but you never really feel like a boss doing it. Sorry, I would not recommend.

												While this game isn't terrible it just seems like a waste of $15.It seems like a retro game which wanted to be as hard as old NES games but what this game doesn't understand is that Bullsh*t traps don't make your game enjoyable or challenging in a fair way, instead it makes the player extremely frustrated to die to something they had no idea was there in the first place and unfortunatly bullsh*t traps are the main source of difficulty of this game. This isn't Super Meat Boy or Rogue Legacy hard, no... This is Bullsh*t hard like Ghost & Goblins and I Wanna be the Guy Gaiden! (Although I wanna be the guy gaiden can be excused since that game was deliberately made with the intent that it's bullsh*t where this game was not)The Multiplayer elements of this game aren't worth your time in the slightest, the levels are poorly designed with bullsh*t traps as a main source of difficulty and overall I just cannot reccomend this game in the slightest. Now there were parts of this game I did legitimately enjoy and the Tower of Nanar feels like the way they should've designed this game but the problem is that with all the horrible hidden traps and sooo much waiting for certain levels and stages which go on for over a minute I just cannot reccomend this game in the slightest even if you are a fan of this genre I just can't reccomend it.The only good thing I can really say about this game is the Spritework and the Music. The 8-Bit Spritework is very pleasent to look at and is animated pretty well and the soundtrack is just absoloutly wonderful with my favourite themes being the tower of Nanar Stage 5 and World 4 but if the best thing about your game is the graphics and music then why even bother spending your money on this?Overall this game just isn't worth your time or money and instead of being looked at and acknowledged we should probably just leave it alone and let time forget this.

												I've been playing this game and love how challenging it is - but this is rediculous. A game that punishes you at the very end of a level without warning, is terrible. A game that punishes you to not time every part of it exactly is not a game. This game stated out great, and even had parts when I thought I couldn't do it - only to fight on and complete it. The problem with this, is that the feeling of satisfaction of completing a difficult part goes away fairly quickly, and your morale and spirit are shattered either 4th lever or beyond. If you're looking for a game makes you want to throw your controller through the wall - by all means, get this game.Also, when you've thought you've beaten the game - you haven't.			"

												This game just isn't fun. It has all of the potential to be, but isn't. I know, I know, the spikes are in the title. Yes, I'm aware it's all about the spikes. But, they're also precisely what ruin the game. They're just not fun to avoid. The levels aren't fun to navigate. The entire game would be completely functional, and likely improved, if it removed the spikes from the game entirely. But until then, it's just a really good platformer with one game-destroying gimmick. You can make all the arguments you want about being ""hardcore"" and all that nonsense. None of that matters if it isn't fun.			"

												I've started a project with Dani where I'm going to try and work through my extensive Steam collection of games. I'm going to try to play all of them in alphabetical order for at least 15 minutes.I started last night with 1001 spikes.Verdict: PassThis was a simple hit-anything-and-die platformer. Controls were move, small jump, big jump, and throw a knife. I liked the Indiana Jones aesthetic and the controls were great, but I knew I'd never be playing this game again. The puzzles in this level were very ""gotcha,"" traps that attack you with little to no warning, requiring twitchy game play and memorization of all the levels after dying multiple times. The story was badly written (to the point of satire/parody). After the 15 minutes were up, I watched the ending on youtube and the writing never got any better.			"

												This game wants to be spelunky. Unfortunately its just as poorly designed if not more. Almost every death isn't your fault. Things fall on you super fast without warning. Spikes suddenly shoot up without warning, and spikes that come up on routine don't seem to be easy to anticipate as the amount of time seems to vary. Some face statues shoot darts at you that come out at 50 mph and you can't react to, but you never know which. Its just poorly designed to be artificially ""difficult"" so they can put that on the description of the game. But since its 1 hit deaths and you have to restart level each time I don't find it worth it. Didn't see any new upgrades or anything besides basic jump and shoot. There's skulls that supposedly do something but most of the time theyre impossible to get and force even more repetition. Game is ugly and uninteresting. 2.5/10.			"

												It's one of those games. You know the sort. Spikes pop up out of the ground and then spike shooters nail you when you jump over them and then you have to ride a moving platform that slides just enough that you can't counter the spike shooters with your own projectiles and then there's a big long segment of precise jumps where you have to jump JUST as the moving platforms disappear. But the level is really short so you just keep doing it over and over and over and over again until you get it all just right and then you're rewarded with another harder and yet still tedious level to attempt over and over and over and over until you beat it and shrug or are overcome by ennui and find something more rewarding to do with your time.It's a competent if unimpressive example of the genre, the sort that looks like an NES game but plays like absolutely none of them. Ditching Meat Boy's awful sliding physics, Aban has a two button jump that sounds weird but is just marvelous in execution, the high jump especially is noteworthy. While it does clear two blocks of height, it has all the natural arc of a graceful plumber soaring through the air rather than the sprongy up and down of some dismal C64 era protagonist. Mega Man wishes he handled this well. The music and graphics do the job without irritating (Unless you like 30 second loops, I recommend you avoid trying to pay extra for the soundtrack. Sample it first, at least.).Anyone who suggests that it transcends the genre is full of poppycock and balderdash. It's bog standard from top to bottom. You could do worse if you must have more, but I know you, reader; you're only here because you probably already have Meat Boy and likely six others in the genre. Have you truly beaten Meat Boy? Cleared every good Castlevania and Mega Man? Perhaps La Mulana if that's your thing. I'm fairly certain you have not beaten that one. If you like the repetition, I tend to find going for the 1cc in the shmups on Steam to be generally more rewarding... I mean, really, there's nothing here you have not seen before.But if it sounds like I am full of it and this is still exactly what you want in a game, then, by all means. It is definitely competent in execution by any standard, nailing the design and feel and there's a a decent bit of variety and a gradual difficulty curve. If you played Spelunky or Rogue Legacy before this, you'll have a whole new appreciation for REAL levels, DESIGNED levels (And then quickly a new hatred for them.) when you take Aban for a swing.But I must still attempt to warn you off into more satisfying endeavors.EDIT: By the way, that o in endeavors at the end? It was a spike trap. Sorry. You'll have to read the review again and take care to avoid that next time.EDIT Part Deux: I must return to mention this when I think of Aban's adventure. It's not entirely unexpected in the genre but the game does offer quite a few paths to facilitate speedrunning (Which, really, as a hobby is really a close cousin to  this ghastly genre.). Some of them are goofy secret paths to bypass a few traps here and there (Oh what a game where the reward for clever play is to play less of the game. Seems an apt enough reward.) but a few do turn out to be clever synergies in the game's various timing mechanics where, with rhythm toned to the beat, you can zoom through a segment you might have paused and considered carefully before. Discovering those tended to be far more rewarding to me than actually completing the levels I found them in.			"

												1,000...999...998... 1,001 Spikes is a game that feels like a love note to the original I Wanna Be The Guy. A platformer that is easy to learn, but tough to master. Just as you think you've finally figured things out, that one block above you might just crush your skull, or maybe that seemingly safe platform will run you through with spikes, but it's so enjoyable that you'll come back for more. As you progress through the game you will unlock characters from other indie games with special abilities that can change the way you play through some levels, maybe an air dash across that pit you couldn't get over before? Maybe hugging the walls to bide time so that you can drop down safe, some of these characters even come with their own stories as to why they're also in a death ridden temple from hell! 1,001 Spikes is a cruel friend who will punch you at the worst moments, but you'll have so much fun that you'll keep at it, waiting to see just what that next punch is going to be. 997...996...995...

												this game will make you cry. But thats a good thing. So many games claim to have the Metro-vania feel, but fail at doing so. This game I feel really takes you bake to the 8-bit hell that was the NES. The very diverse cast of characters does not put the game to shame either. Each charcater has a very unique ability, that can be OP or a weakness at certain times. Overall this game was a blast to play and was one of my overall favorites from 2014. "

												Take the roll of Aban Hawkins and prove your worth as an archaeologist!With a simple, yet unique, jumping mechanic of two buttons for different jump heights, this game is all about platforming. Don't let the pixel presentation fool you, because the visuals have definitely had some work and love put into it, accompanied by great classic-style cutscenes and a catchy soundtrack.The difficulty quickly spikes up and your skills will be put to the test, but even then, it has that old ""just-one-more-try"" attribute that will definitely keep you hooked to the end. You can also unlock several characters, including cameos from other games, each having a different playstyle, keeping the game fresh. And if you crave for more adventure, the game also has 3 arcade modes that you can either play solo or with 3 more friends.And when you think it's all over...  you only completed half of the game!

												Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island Gaiden: Aban Hawkins & the 1001 Spikes: The Temple of the Dead Mourns the Living is a slow-paced trap navigation game. The game does not require fast reflexes or platforming skill. If you stop, look, and plan out what you're going to do, you can theoretically avoid every trap in the game. The game never really throws anything truly unexpected at you, but it will still kill you hundreds of times. You will fall for the same traps over and over again and curse your own stupidity.You will navigate a really tricky part, see what looks like safe ground, stop there for a mere second to get your bearings, and get killed by spikes rising from the floor, even though you had more than enough time to see them coming and avoid them. You will see the exit, make a mad dash for it, and get blasted in the face by a dart shooter that was right there in plain sight. Both of these things will happen to you repeatedly, even after you've identified the pattern and made a mental note to look out for them.The music is really great too, and there's a rich amount of bonus content to enjoy, with the Towers of Nannar and the Lost Levels, and more than a dozen characters to play as.

												TL;DR: Buy this game if you like challenging platformers and don't mind dying often, as the mistake that caused your death will be your fault to begin with.You've probably already read another review of 1001 Spikes. You have initially 1001 lives to try to conquer the ruins of Ukampa, but fret not: they ARE plenty, and you can always buy more lives for a relatively easy to acquire in-game currency (and cheaply) that you get from playing the side missions (at no cost to your current stock of lives, too).Gameplay is simple: you are a man (or a woman, or a zombie, or a robot... unlockable character) that has an attack to deal with nasty scorpions and dart traps, and you can jump both high and low. Knowing when to jump how high is the key to the basic game, as is timing and learning trap patterns to safely avoid the very-much-so-avoidable untimely death.But, perhaps this isn't what you wanted to hear about 1001 Spikes, so let's talk difficulty. The game is quite simple, but it may take a while to master and is definitely not a walk in the park for those that aren't used to playing platformers nor have the patience to deal with repeatedly dying in a level. I consider myself a pretty good gamer in this type of games and I cleared the (basic first half of the) game with about 180 deaths in total for the span of Ukampa; having just unlocked the Antarctic I can already say that the challenges are just beggining for me.And, since some people aren't that great, you can at least visit all levels by skipping some. Just... don't get disheartened by seeing the difficulty increase as well; arguably, the different levels test different competences of yours to different degrees, so chances are that you can clear the levels past the ones you might skip.I mentioned the unlockable characters, and I'd like to add that they are significantly different from the default character, Aban Hawkins. From speed diferences to attack differences to air-jump actions, they are all unique in their strengths. If you simply care about reaching the end of the game, unlocking all of the characters will require you to clear most of the game with Aban while collecting golden skulls... but still very early on you can unlock cool characters like ""Master Chef"", the powersuit assault-rifle-toting badass, which will have an easier time with dart traps for instance. Oh, and just so you know, each unlockable has their own levels (i.e., they are the same, but to reach 3-2 you have to have cleared 3-1 with that specific character; you can't unlock a level on other characters to move forward).I didn't really want to get too deep with this review, but I feel I must also mention the local multiplayer. Basically, you can complete a set of levels with your friends to earn some of the ingame currency or even all by yourself in what I mentioned as ""side missions"" at the beggining. The Tower is a very interesting place to earn some coins, but if you're into the Lost Levels and are good at it you can rake the money in even faster. If you simply want to go head-to-head and out-coin your friends you can also play in mini arenas. I can't comment on how fun they are since I can't experience them in their full glory, as the friends I have wouldn't even touch a controller for the purpose of avoiding some spikes and collecting coins, but I imagine that if you have like-minded friends that wouldn't mind giving it a go this could be extremely hilarious on several places. Just remember: ONLY LOCAL multiplayer, NOT ONLINE.The music is good, the sound are great too. Visually you've already seen a trailer, so I can only say that in my opinion everything feels in place. There's also plenty of humour in the cutscenes and nifty references to older games, and 1001 Spikes is a good challenge for a world that refuses to churn out platformers in favour of whatever else gimmicky sandbox people seem to love, so it would get an instant recommendation from me just for that, but I can safely say that this game is plenty good from what I have already played...Also, don't disregard the game for its price. It may be almost 10€ without a discount, but owning some of Nicalis' previous games (i.e. the same publisher) it lowers automatically by 33% instantly, and it usually stacks with other discounts of 33% (for 66% off total price). And chances are that if you're reading this you may already have some of them, or at least Cave Story, on Steam.			"

But beware, you`re going to die a lot, a ****load actually!Sarting a level over and over again is not only very likely to happen (it`s a given actually) ,but is necessary in order to learn the locations of the traps. All in all, I`ld give it a solid 8.5/10pts.			"

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.Gameplay: 1001 Spikes is about as simple as it gets from a gameplay perspective. There are levels. You must jump through them and not die. One of the things that I'm glad they did from a control perspective is have two different buttons for different jump heights. Variable jump heights from holding the jump button always proved to be one of the biggest issues back when I was dumb and played SMW romhacks. Lives are infinite in some perspective, since you're given 1,001 of them to beat the game with (you also get more lives from the x-6 stages). I never came close to losing all my lives, since the lowest I ever dropped was to ~830, but I do know that you can get more lives from the shop.Levels in this game are a mix of very well-thought out and well executed platforming challenges and spikes that sometimes come out of the ground because they feel like it. Or blocks dropping on your head because they feel like it. Or arrow traps... okay, you get the point. Needless to say, not everything in this game is the most fair. In fact, there's more than a few moments in the game that you'll be thinking you've started playing an I Wanna Be the [Noun] game. I talked to a friend/game designer about this, and his general attitude toward it was that the levels are short enough so that it's not a big deal.I don't really feel the same way. As a video game player, I get much more enjoyment out of struggling with and beating an excellently crafted stage than I do where blocks/spikes just show up and kill you. Ultimately, I never felt like I was getting better and better at the game. Instead, I just felt like I was memorizing trap locations. This is further enunciated by the fact that when I went back and got the Key of Serpentis, I died as many times on that level the second time through as I did the first. This may just be my personal preference, but I really do wanna feel like I've surmounted an obstacle when I'm playing a hard game.Another thing that I found kinda annoying at times were the hitboxes. I know, I know; ""nub's complaining about hitboxes."" I don't think Aban's hitbox is all that bad, but there are a few instances in which I feel like hitboxes kinda screwed me over. The biggest issue with hitboxes I had was in 4-3 aka Dangerous Exit aka The Worst Level In the Game; specifically with the jumping totems. There were many times where I was certainly not underneath the totem, but the game sure thought so. Another issue I had with hitboxes were the arrows from the arrow traps, where I can be standing two blocks away from the launcher, be throwing knives and still be killed.Even despite the sometimes downright unfair level design and sometimes very questionable hitboxes, I still had a great bit of fun with the game. While I don't have an easy opportunity right now to bring friends over to enjoy the Tower of Nanaar (which looks crazy fun for multiple people), I will definitely check that out in the future. 7/10.Story: story plzActually, it'd be wrong of me not to talk about the story for this game. The core story of the game is Aban Hawkins, an archaeologist, and his journey to punch his dad in the head. Hard. Yeah, it's not Shakespeare, but what do you expect? A thing that I did  like, though, was that all of the unlockable characters get their own unique intro to the game once you beat the first world with them. While I only saw Commander Video's intro, I'm sure everyone else's cutscenes are equally as good. 7/10.Graphics: I can tell that the goal of this game was to make it look as much like an NES/Famicom game as much as possible. That's not just because it's an 8-bit styling; anyone can do that. Rather, this game really does capture that indescribable feel of an NES game. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if someone with considerable Assembly experience couldn't ""port"" this game to an NES cart. Regarding the technical aspects, it runs windowed by default at 720p, but it fullscreens to your native resolution without any issues. My biggest problem with the graphical side of things (and this ties into gameplay as well) is that there isn't a cohesive pattern of signaling for hazards. Blocks that look exactly the same can be two different traps entirely. I really feel like a lot of my issues with the game could've been fixed if they had just used some universal signaling throughout the game. Even though this is gameplay related, it's still worth talking about in the graphics section. 3/5.Sound: Well, the sounds are blips and the music is chippy. You don't need high-end equipment to make this stuff. The music is pretty good, and every world in ""the first half"" of the game has their own unique song, which is usually pretty good. I just wish ""the second half"" (yes, I'm being ambiguous) had world-specific music. It got REAL tiresome hearing the same song for 32 levels. Other than that, the music is enjoyable. I don't think I'd grab the OST, since I heard bloody enough of it during the game, but you may enjoy it more. 3/5.Overall scores are 7/7/3/3; cumulative score of 6.7/10. Unfortuately, a lot of the high points I had with this game were neutralized by the low points. I still did have fun, though; it's just after coming from a game like Volgarr, the sometimes (seemingly intentional) questionable level design left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.			"

												With the amount of games these days that are trying to jump on the ""I wanna be the guy"" bandwagon, 1001 Spikes may seem like a gimmick, but its well-polished retro charm is what makes it stand out from the rest. Though it was often frustrating, I had a lot of fun with 1001 Spikes. The difficulty level was pretty high, but the amount of lives the game gives you makes it seem like you're far from failure. I managed to beat the game with a net loss of only about 200 lives (the game stars you with 1001), although I'm pretty experienced with platformers, so results may very. However, no matter your skill level, this game constantly reinforces you to presevere by giving you lives at the end of each world, and allowing you to buy more lives in the shop with the in-game currency. Satisfying music and SFX, neat graphics, tons of content and good gameplay definitely make this game worth your money.			"

												Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island Gaiden: Aban Hawkins & the 1001 Spikes: The Temple of the Dead Mourns the Living is a slow-paced trap navigation game. The game does not require fast reflexes or platforming skill. If you stop, look, and plan out what you're going to do, you can theoretically avoid every trap in the game. The game never really throws anything truly unexpected at you, but it will still kill you hundreds of times. You will fall for the same traps over and over again and curse your own stupidity.You will navigate a really tricky part, see what looks like safe ground, stop there for a mere second to get your bearings, and get killed by spikes rising from the floor, even though you had more than enough time to see them coming and avoid them. You will see the exit, make a mad dash for it, and get blasted in the face by a dart shooter that was right there in plain sight. Both of these things will happen to you repeatedly, even after you've identified the pattern and made a mental note to look out for them.The music is really great too, and there's a rich amount of bonus content to enjoy, with the Towers of Nannar and the Lost Levels, and more than a dozen characters to play as.

												This game is incredibly difficult, but that's what makes it so tremendously rewarding. The controls are very tight, giving you a lot of precision to work with.Some people say the game feels too trial-and-error for them, which is sort of true, but that's part of the reason that I love the game. There are a lot of patterns that you'll start to learn that will help you to avoid obstacles, but sometimes you jump onto a platform that look safe and suddenly you're full of spikes. Sometimes you'll say ""that block DEFINITELY has spikes in it;"" you land on it, there aren't any spikes, but you're expecting them so you freak out and jump off in a panic only to fly face-first into a dart.Sometimes this lack of ""red blocks = spikes, yellow statues = darts"" means that you'll die to traps that you couldn't possibly predict; I can see how that could become frustrating quickly, but with 1,001 lives to burn through, I never thought ""wow this is 100% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t,"" it was just something to catalogue into ""sneaky traps on this level."" And honestly, I love that tense feeling of ""what could be in this next area that's going to kill me?"" It's not so random that you can't outwit some of the traps, but it isn't so formulaic that you can learn ""this means this so do this"" to breeze through levels.I think this game could have VERY easily gone in an entirely different direction if it wasn't for the level design and the soundtrack. All of the levels are built in a way that makes it possible to speedrun through them if you're willing to spend the time learning the traps and perfecting the technique. I've had hours of fun just playing one level with a friend, passing the controller back and forth while we try to perfectly time a jump, then a knife throw, then do a crazy high-jump wibble-wobble to fall underneath a dart with surgical precision. That was fun because the levels aren't overly long, some of the trips are hidden but not completely unknown (spikes flash for a second before they pop out, darts only come out of statue mouths, etc.). There are no invisible blocks that you're going to bump into. There are some tiles that fall out from under you or ceiling blocks that will fall onto your head, but these will usually (I can't say ""always"" with 100% certainty) be marked or have some sort of audible warning; you can escape them if your reflexes are fast enough. However, my reflexes are not usually fast enough and I have to learn some of these things by getting killed by them.The soundtrack is well-made and a real pleasure to listen to if you're into chip-tune music. It definitely has that 8-bit NES-era feel to it, but it's all layered and orchestrated in a way that makes it so much more complex than ""bleepity bloop background noises."" You typically won't get new background music until you progress to the next area of the map, which means you'll probably be hearing the same music for a long time. That might not be your bag, but I can say that personally I never got tired of the soundtrack, even when I spent 400 lives on the same level. I do still get a weird sense of anxiety whenever I hear the music from the fire maps, though...Overall, this game is really a blast to experience, especially since you can unlock new characters by finding the secret golden skulls on each map. The unlockable characters will only be able to grab coins from the main levels, but they all have their own little differing mechanics that makes them fun to play the extra modes with.If you're planning on playing this game solo, go in knowing that there's going to be a lot of repetition while you try to learn the levels. It's still a lot of fun, but I would recommend having a friend to share in the good-natured cornucopia of death that you're about to experience.In short, buy this game because it's great.			"

												A refreshing take on old school platforming, 1001 Spikes is a wonderful game to play to test your reflexes and observation skills through spike jumping, boulder dodging, and knife throwing. The game has a simple tutorial and eases the challenge up from one level to the next till you enter the ruins. While a good portion of the game may seem to be mostly trial and error, there are many subtle hints that can point out where traps can be. Even if you were to get trapped by something new and you didn't have enough time to react to it, the 1001 lives given to you mitigates the possible stress of a game over.Overall, it's pretty dang good. Seriously, you feel badass whenever you complete a level. Also Rushjet did an awesome job on the music. Love that dude's work.			"

												This game is wonderful. It's like they took super meat boy and gave it a lot more depth. That said, I'm not partial to this style of game. I like open worldy type stuff that you can get lost in. The only way you can get lost in this game is to get stuck at a particular puzzle or sequence because you die before you can figure out what you're looking at. 4/5, would recommend to friends and enemies for the same reason.

												Tough but mostly fair platformer. Intuitive level design teaches you the game as you play as opposed to relying on tutorials, which is a refreshing change in this modern day of games that often treat the player like an idiot. It has two main sets of levels, a fairly good difficulty curve, with some spikes (hah) in difficulty here and there. Also has a daunting old school lives system with game over at 0 lives, encouraging careful play and  effort to act upon mistakes and progress. However, progression is rewarded very generously. The boss battles are sequential and a bit random, but not unbearable. There are some extra game modes and features as well as an entire roster of characters to try, for the full experience. Overall a very fun and challenging game.			"

												Take the roll of Aban Hawkins and prove your worth as an archaeologist!With a simple, yet unique, jumping mechanic of two buttons for different jump heights, this game is all about platforming. Don't let the pixel presentation fool you, because the visuals have definitely had some work and love put into it, accompanied by great classic-style cutscenes and a catchy soundtrack.The difficulty quickly spikes up and your skills will be put to the test, but even then, it has that old ""just-one-more-try"" attribute that will definitely keep you hooked to the end. You can also unlock several characters, including cameos from other games, each having a different playstyle, keeping the game fresh. And if you crave for more adventure, the game also has 3 arcade modes that you can either play solo or with 3 more friends.And when you think it's all over...  you only completed half of the game!

The title if called ""1001 Spikes"", but really it means ""1001 Spikes You Will Die To"". Is this a challenge? Yes. It challenges your mind and reflexes to get through levels meant to kill you over and over again on the same obsitcal. It also challenges your sanity really, really, really hard.Would I reccomend it? If you enjoy these types of challenges, go for it! In my opinion the thing it's best for it giving it to a friend and hearing how many times they die on the same level.On a side note, to anyone who got this game or will get it; Good luck, seriously you'll need it.

												Mostly fun, recommended for fans of challenging platformers, not for impatient people.Pros:-Tight, precise controls-Good amount of levels, extra content-Simple mechanics - quick to learnCons:-Worst complaint is some levels being too long with crazy difficult stuff at the end that requires a ton of trial and error. I've beaten every level in the game exactly once, but I feel like I've beaten the first 80% of most levels like 30 times each, to the point where there is zero challenge and fun for that section because every jump becomes memorized up to the point where I'm having trouble. As someone who also beat every level in Super Meat Boy, I think SMB handles level length much better.-Many (perhaps most?) deaths are from trial and error. A major flaw of 1001 Spikes here is that there's no way to safely play a level the first time even if you're patient and alert like other platformers allow. Rushing through will kill you somewhere for sure, but equally often playing it safe after every jump will kill you because you're often standing on a spike trap or falling rock. Keeping one or the other type of death consistent throughout an entire level would be better design IMO.			"

												I wasn't sure how much I'd enjoy this game going in.  Any time I hear the words ""troll"" and ""platformer"" in the same sentence, I get worried.Turns out I needn't have worried.  Yes, the game is full of hidden spike traps.  Falling boulders.  Pits.  You name it, there's a way to die.  But it also turns out that giving the player 1001 lives to start, and more upon retreiving each relic at the end of each set of stages, makes things more palatable; even more so considering a good run through most stages takes under a minute.There's a lot of memorization there, so in a lot of ways, it's a speed-runner's dream game.  It takes a lot of attempts, but you'll start breezing through early traps to get to the trouble spots over and over, and eventually, you'll get the perfect run down.  You'll bask in the exultation of victory when you get through that doorway at the end of each stage.  In many ways, it's a very, very compressed version of the sorts of deaths something like Battletoads threw at you; deaths you won't see coming, but in stages that are far shorter, with a much more generous helping of lives.  In other words, tweaks that would have made a wildly creative game like Battletoads nearly perfect.It also certainly helps that the game controls wonderfully.  Controls are tight and responsive, with a unique dual-jump setup.  Not a double-jump, but two different ones: a single-block jump, and a higher double-height one.  You'll use both to make it to the end, and you might think the double-height one would be the way to go, but the single-block jump will keep you from impaling yourself in quite a few spaces, or bopping your head on a ceiling and plummeting to your doom.  It's quite efficient, and perhaps more precise than using a hold-the-button system for higher jumps.It's actually a very nice-looking game, too.  It's very pixelated, but the art design is very cohesive and strong in this one.  It's clearly a step above the usual 8-bit indie look.  Matt Kap, who also was responsible for Castle in the Darkness, headed up the graphical design.  The soundtrack is pretty limited, but you'll get pumped when that ""key obtained"" music starts playing.  RushJet1 did a lot of the work here, and hearing him put his NES music skills to use is a joy.If you've got any sort of patience for games like Electronic Super Joy or Super Meat Boy, you will likely enjoy this one as well.  I actually prefer it to either of those games, because I like the theme and the controls more than either of those games, but they're different variants on the same theme: short-but-brutal platforming.  Two thumbs up.			"

												Only at the lava world (world 4 of 7, I believe), but man, this game is lots of fun.It's a punishing platformer, a IWBTG-lite mixed with the level-progression of Super Meat Boy and the style of La Mulana. What's nice is that the game teaches you quickly how to anticipate kill-switches, so in the end it's rather fair when you die again and again (because, well, you should have seen it coming).

												If you like retro-style hardcore platformers that make you want to pull your hair out, then 1001 Spikes is for you. Seriously this game feels like it wants to screw with you at every moment. This game is the definition of a trial and error game; whereas you have to study each individual part of the level in order to beat it. Everything in this game is designed to be cheap, unfair and unforgiving. But don't worry, the game is completely aware of its brutal difficulty and it almost seems proud of it. This game is incredibly frustrating and will infuriate you just trying to complete the main story.Now with that rant out of the way...1001 Spikes is a 2D style action platformer. A very, VERY hard platformer. It’s also a sequel/remake of the game “Aban Hawkins and the 1000 Spikes.” Each world has its own theme and obstacles to overcome. These include falling blocks, bottomless pits, poisonous scorpions, and most of all, spikes. Lots and lots of spikes. So on top of being incredibly difficult, because this game loves to harken back to the days of old school retro video games, there are also lives in this game. How many? 1001. Now that is admittedly funny and you can more lives throughout the course of the main campaign, but in today's day and age lives are an archaic design choice the artificially extends the game's length. However even with the 1001 lives, you will die a lot in this game. First off, all it takes to kill you in this game is one hit. Whether that's getting crushed by a collapsing ceiling, getting stabbed by randomly appearing spikes, or getting shot by a dart, you will die. This game pulls no punches and will surprise you at every chance it gets.But with all that said, 1001 Spikes is a very well designed game. The graphics look very retro and look good for the game it's trying to be. The music is good and fits the stages very well. The sound effects are fitting and satisfying. There are also plenty of other game modes to keep you busy and frustrated once you finish the main story. The only thing that might be hard to adjust to is the fact that there are two jump buttons. A short jump button and a high jump button. You will need to get used to using both of them because there will be times in which you have to utilize both in order to beat some levels. So don't think you cheese your way through the game by abusing the high jump. The game will punish you for it.But anyways, if you want a hardcore, unfair, brutally difficult retro-style platform game, 1001 Spikes will satisfy your retro hunger. Just be prepared to die. "

												This game is incredibly difficult, but that's what makes it so tremendously rewarding. The controls are very tight, giving you a lot of precision to work with.Some people say the game feels too trial-and-error for them, which is sort of true, but that's part of the reason that I love the game. There are a lot of patterns that you'll start to learn that will help you to avoid obstacles, but sometimes you jump onto a platform that look safe and suddenly you're full of spikes. Sometimes you'll say ""that block DEFINITELY has spikes in it;"" you land on it, there aren't any spikes, but you're expecting them so you freak out and jump off in a panic only to fly face-first into a dart.Sometimes this lack of ""red blocks = spikes, yellow statues = darts"" means that you'll die to traps that you couldn't possibly predict; I can see how that could become frustrating quickly, but with 1,001 lives to burn through, I never thought ""wow this is 100% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t,"" it was just something to catalogue into ""sneaky traps on this level."" And honestly, I love that tense feeling of ""what could be in this next area that's going to kill me?"" It's not so random that you can't outwit some of the traps, but it isn't so formulaic that you can learn ""this means this so do this"" to breeze through levels.I think this game could have VERY easily gone in an entirely different direction if it wasn't for the level design and the soundtrack. All of the levels are built in a way that makes it possible to speedrun through them if you're willing to spend the time learning the traps and perfecting the technique. I've had hours of fun just playing one level with a friend, passing the controller back and forth while we try to perfectly time a jump, then a knife throw, then do a crazy high-jump wibble-wobble to fall underneath a dart with surgical precision. That was fun because the levels aren't overly long, some of the trips are hidden but not completely unknown (spikes flash for a second before they pop out, darts only come out of statue mouths, etc.). There are no invisible blocks that you're going to bump into. There are some tiles that fall out from under you or ceiling blocks that will fall onto your head, but these will usually (I can't say ""always"" with 100% certainty) be marked or have some sort of audible warning; you can escape them if your reflexes are fast enough. However, my reflexes are not usually fast enough and I have to learn some of these things by getting killed by them.The soundtrack is well-made and a real pleasure to listen to if you're into chip-tune music. It definitely has that 8-bit NES-era feel to it, but it's all layered and orchestrated in a way that makes it so much more complex than ""bleepity bloop background noises."" You typically won't get new background music until you progress to the next area of the map, which means you'll probably be hearing the same music for a long time. That might not be your bag, but I can say that personally I never got tired of the soundtrack, even when I spent 400 lives on the same level. I do still get a weird sense of anxiety whenever I hear the music from the fire maps, though...Overall, this game is really a blast to experience, especially since you can unlock new characters by finding the secret golden skulls on each map. The unlockable characters will only be able to grab coins from the main levels, but they all have their own little differing mechanics that makes them fun to play the extra modes with.If you're planning on playing this game solo, go in knowing that there's going to be a lot of repetition while you try to learn the levels. It's still a lot of fun, but I would recommend having a friend to share in the good-natured cornucopia of death that you're about to experience.In short, buy this game because it's great.			"

 Two thumbs up 1001 Spikes is a great game, but only for those who are experienced with platformers and don't get frustrated easily.Most significant upside: The game design is difficult, but forgiving enough that you remain engaged. Additionally, the level variety and the variation in challenges keeps the game fresh through 50-plus levels.Most significant downside: 1001 Spikes is very difficult. While some will find this rewarding it will turn off others in the audience very quickly. "

												It is exactly what it looks like - an extremely difficult 8-bit game where everything one-shots you.It's too hard for you, so you should probably just stick with Mario.			"

												Like the trial and error aspect of the game, and the simple controls mean that you can focus solely on the challenge of the level.			"

												If you're the type that likes ""rage platformers"", this is a very well-crafted specimen. Every detail of every level oozes polish and careful consideration on the author's part. And while the traps do surprise you sometimes, they ultimately are all beatable if you're good enough.That said, the unlockable characters feel extremely tacked on when compared to, say, Super Meat Boy. The ones that do more than look different are all straight upgrades to the main character, but you have to advance through every level separately for each one (no thanks) and they can't collect golden heads for you. Otherwise you can only use them in the game's extra modes; those which I've unlocked so far are comparatively short.Still, for the right person the core game is worth the admission price. And you probably already know if you're that person.			"

												Despite being an exceptionally brutal platformer, 1001 spikes never feels unfair-- indeed, its incredibly tight controls preclude it. Furthermore, since every level acts as a checkpoint, it forestalls most frustration.Each death, despite being inevitable, teaches the player valuable new information about the level, providing a constant feeling of progression. The effect is almost intoxicating; death is never truly discouraging, the game gently,  but firmly spurs you onward. It tells you that you can do better, and indeed, you know you can. So it implores you to have another go. Just one more try. 23rd time's the charm.The game also has significantly more content than you'd expect when you first boot it up. Though you start only with a linear path, three other modes can be unlocked, all of which feature optional local multiplayer. One mode is a sort of score attack, while the other two are fully fledged cooperative mini-campaigns.There are also a massive amount of characters to unlock, each with their own quirks of movement and special abilities. This, combined with the ingame timer, both for full runs and individual levels, provides a gargantuan amount of replayability.All in all, 1001 spikes is one of those rare indy darlings that you just can't pass up. I heartily recommend it.			"
