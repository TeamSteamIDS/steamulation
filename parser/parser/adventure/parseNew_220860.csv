												Imagine a puzzle game where logic is thrown out fo the window, and absurdity is rewarded - that's McPixel. McPixel, the 'hero', is faced with various different scenarios where he is tasked with saving the day, often from a bomb. There's only one way to save the day in each scenario, but it'll often take trial and error to discover it. It often won't make sense, but it will more often than not be absurd and strangely funny.The McPixel website describes it best ""You have 20 seconds to solve each riddle, regardless whether you lose or fail, you will be transported to next puzzle that you haven't solved yet.""While it might take several attempts (and in some cases a lot of click and hope) to discover the correct way to solve the puzzle, the game rewards you, and in some ways encourages you to find all the different endings to each scenario. If you find them all you unlock the an extra round of scenarios in each level. The game is entirely based around using the mouse, and clicking on the various objects within a scenario to trigger the outcome. There's little more to it than that, so in a stragne way it would make a great iOS game and I think I would have enjoyed it in a more casual pick up and play basis in 10 minute bursts. Having said that I did stomach it enough to sit through it all and finish the game within 2 hours, and then attempt the 'Free DLC'. There's plenty of pop culture references and humour to keep you engaged if you're something of a 'nerd' (I know I found them entertaining). However, the game becomes slightly derailed towards the end with just how unlogical and absurd the puzzles become. In some cases there's no real way of discovering how to save the world without a good old fashioned hopeless clicking everywhere on the screen frezy. I enjoyed it for the crazy nature of the game, however the soundtrack might just put some people off as there's only really one track that repeats throughout the game. In short, a crazy puzzle game that might not be for everyone depending on your absurdity threshold. I'll recommend it as I enjoyed it, but I can see why some people might not. Not for everyone. Probably best to check out the free demo available on the website: http://mcpixel.net/ or on Steam.			"

AUDIOLimitedVISUALSimplisticDIFFICULTYSilly, ModerateVIBEPixel ArtCRAVINGHumorON SALEOftenPROS: A parody of MacGyver where you are put into a time-crunched scenario that you need to quickly solve. The game is structured very creatively to keep you on your toes the whole way through. Lots of levels and easter eggs. Legitimately funny, laugh-out-loud humor that ranges from subtle to asinine.CONS: Disappointed by the lack of achievements, but that's a very small gripe in the grand scheme of things.WORTH: You can get about 5 hours or so of play out of it, which is pretty good for a game that you can get for the price of a candy bar.OVERALL: Gaming is riddled with failed attempts at comedy. I'm glad to see there is a game out there that can actually make me laugh very hard.SCORE:7/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												McPixel is.... well... where the heck do you start....McPixel is a medley of references and metajokes based around McPixel, a spin-off of MacGuyver, whose job is to defuse the bomb and save the day! Just HOW he does this is up to you.I completed all 4 of the main stories with 100% clearance in 2 hours, but the game also provides a copious amount of DLC for the delighted player to enjoy.Cheap, cheerful and wacky good fun to be had with this little Greenlit game.

												At best, McPixel may get a little chuckle out of you every now and then. The rest of the time, though, it's just a dull slog of clicking on everything to try and get every possible result out of every scenario. The majority of the humor falls flat or is too sophomoric to even be called humor, and when the entire point of the game is to find all the gags, the worst thing it can do is not be funny. Pass on McPixel.			"

												A light hearted wonderful game with a great sense of humour.McPixel is a fast paced indie game that stars “McPixel” a strange character that goes around saving the day from all things explosive!You are thrown into various different situations in various different settings and given 20 seconds to save the day, how that turns out is down to you and your fast thinking. It is not at all a serious game and it’s very likely that 95% of the time you will blow something up on your first try. But it’s still fun none the less and the level comes back around faster than you can even think about it. It has a somewhat crude but hilarious sense of humour, with very bizarre gags in each stage.There was quite a few times during my time playing that I just thought, “Who the hell would do that?” and had a little chuckle to myself.  But there you go, that is the magic and charm of McPixel.The music is extremely repetitive, but strangely enough it isn’t annoying. It’s more catchy then annoying.The main game is pretty short and there is a load of free DLC for you to play afterwards if you want to. (So there are a lot of days to save!)If you were to play this nonstop the whole thing would probably take you a few hours, and it’s probably a good idea to take breaks due to its fast paced nature.Generally I really enjoyed it; I thought it was pretty fun; there are a lot of references and things to have a laugh at in this game. So it’s something fun to throw on when you are bored.			"

												It's amusing and cheap, always a winning combination, but I'm far from impressed outside of a chuckle here and there. A parody of MacGyver and other unrealistic action heroes, the game has you defuse the danger in various scenarios by, well, clicking on everything on screen in hopes to find the order that works. And that's where McPixel falls short, there is no gameplay, per se. There is no internal logic to decipher, nothing to understand. Click a character or set piece. If nothing happens (that's good), click another one. If♥♥♥♥♥♥blows up, start over with a new order of clicking-on-things. It's basically a time consuming way to play out a bunch of jokes.			"

												MCPIXEL was shockingly enjoyable and entertaining. To break it down for you, its a point and click puzzle game set in brief different scenarios, such as in a falling elevator, you need to analyze how to save the day. You have  an emergency button, elevator buttons, an old man, a bell hop and an extinguisher. What do you do to save the day? These are wacky and weird situations, usually involving bombs or gasoline. None of which lasts no longer than 15 seconds. The game is broken up into 4 chapters, each chapter has 3 or so clusters of 6 scenarios / challenges. If you fail doing a challenge, you don't do it over and over until you get it right, you just go to the next uncompleted scenario.I completed the entire first chapter in about 15 minutes, which is 18 challenges? There is free DLC, which is a series of selectable clusters made by fans or whomever. There is a lot of content here, but the real catch is the challenges just don't last a long time. They're pretty easy to figure out.The cherry on top of this is that there are some laugh out loud results. Maybe the results are so LOL because they're so unexpectedly random. Again, I expected nothing from this game and got a lot of entertainment from it. I'll be returning to the game to see the other quirky scenarios with crude graphics.			"

												Playing McPixel is pretty much like being drunk. Everything seems like a good idea.The wild gameplay, that awards not only the correct solutions but also failed attempts, requires a great deal of creativity. Creativity - not just random clicking on every single pixel on your screeen, as many have pointed out in their reviews. After a time, the game begins to draw you towards its twisted logic. The bumpy run you had the first time playing McPixel, turns out to be very addictive, definately re-playable and captivating long ride.The humour used by the creators is a little bit foul, sure. You will feel it pays tribute to your inner 14-year-old. It fits, however, the randomness and roughness of the game, making you smirk at the most obscure gags. (And is still better than American Pie.) What is even more exciting, the game has been provided with themed levels, for example paying tribute to other famous video games.Also, lots of explosions.

												To understand this game, you need a decent sense of humor, because it is so random and so ""WTFy"" that it actually makes you laugh. Also, logic don't apply here, so it's just pure fun without unnecessary frustration - once you get to the (least logical and most unexpected) solution, most of the time you'll laugh because of how hilarious it was.

												Short, trial and error, point and click puzzles in an old-school pixelated style.  Reminds me of Wario Ware type games (although plays a bit different but same 20 second time frames).   Works well if you understand it seems made for some chuckles.   You will fail time and again (you actually have to fail to see all the possible results to open some bonus rounds) but not particularly frustrating as it is very quick paced but casual.    A game that I recommend for short intervals.  Lots of content expanded by user content as well.   I haven't finished the game, but overall I feel good recommending it.			"

												I have the faintest of suspicions that I may be ""getting old"".  The fact that this game is frankly too silly for even the immature likes of me seems to bear this out.  That, and the fact that while I was fine with all the post, and indeed post-post, and probably even post-post-post, and maybe, just maybe, even all the post-post-post-post-modernist humour that has emerged during my lifetime, all this post-post-post-post-post-modernist humour that seems all the rage these days is just a bit beyond me, I'm afraid.  Half the time, not only did I not find the ""gags"" of this game all that funny, but at least another quarter of the time I didn't even understand what had just transpired (though the insanely, even downright PERVERSELY pixelated nature of events may not have helped in these instances).  The other quarter of the time, okay, I got myself a cheap chuckle - my personal favourite was trying to work out who the virgin was to throw in the volcano, and ultimately (and successfully) deciding on MYSELF - but the laughs really are too few and far between to put up with the eye-bleedingly awful graphics and incredibly limited gameplay.  (Groovy music, though.)    Look, I will recommend it, but only just, and only to those who need a brief break from watching allegedly ""funny♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; all day, every day on ♥♥♥♥ing YOUTUBE.  Yes, it's at roughly THAT level, I'm afraid.  Enjoy your LOLs, kiddies... Verdict: 6/10.			"

												This is actually a trial and error game; click the right things in the right order to prevent an explosion. If you fail, you have to do the other levels in the chapter first. At the end of the chapter, the game lets you retry the failed levels, until you completed them all. Then you proceed to the next chapter. You have to memorize the things you have already tried, so you can try something different the next time you play that level. There are some silly and amusing jokes here and there but in the end I didn't really enjoy this game that much. I just got bored fast. At least on PC. I think this game is much more suitable for mobile platforms, to play in short bursts, to kill some time with. And guess what... McPixel is actually available on mobile platforms! You can buy the game for Android and iPhone. I wish Steam would offer an option to review a game with a sort of neutral verdict. Because as a mobile game, I would actually say yes. But this is Steam and we are reviewing Steam games here. As a PC game, it just doesn't work for me.			"

												Haven't laughed this hard in a while! McPixel plays with your expectations and makes it hardly ever possible to anticipate how an interaction will turn out: Will your character pick a thing up if you click it? Will he break it? Will he just kick it until it explodes? - Who knows, let's try! And while this may sound random and frustrating it's totally fine since the game expects you to fail and fail often. Your time is never wasted, transitions can be skipped at will, so it's always tempting and motivating to give it just one more try - and probably laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off. Highly recommended.			"

												Short, twenty-second puzzles in which you try to help McPixel save the world... or at least, the world he's in... with a couple of well-placed clicks.  If those clicks are anything but well-placed, well...  you get the picture.  Sometimes just the ensuing hilarity may be what you're after.The visuals may seem a little cheesy to some, but it doesn't need to be sophisticated in that category.  Heck, even the humor can be a bit lowbrow.  If anything, the cheesy visuals and sometimes-ribald humor are part of the overall charm.  Besides, ""McTexel"" just doesn't have quite the same ring to it.Now, go forth and save the world!  Or at least, the world McPixel's in.			"

												Initially, the game's backwards♥♥♥♥♥logic and nigh-luck-based difficulty will turn you off. Unless you're an absolute madman with the kind of problem solving that this crazy universe demands.But eventually, you get the hang of the incredibly deluded logic of the great McPixel, and the game becomes quite the adventure. The campaign is pretty short, but the DLC keeps it there. Soon, you'll become the master of whatever horrible terrorist organization keeps putting these ♥♥♥♥ing bombs everywhere (100% the game to find out who they are).			"

												This game reminds me of Wario Ware, the gameplay is frantic and mostly humor driven. It's not always clear what you are suppose to do but it usually gives you a reason to laugh. You probably found this game in your library and got it from a bundle or picked it up for cheap, either way, you can't really complain. It's good for a few minutes of entertainment.			"

												If you're a fan of seeing the same toilet joke over and over and ""haha, he kicked it"" then by all means this is the game for you. However if you're looking for humor that doesn't seem like it was aimed at a seven year old then I'd say you should skip this one altogether. I got this game pretty much for free and I still feel as if I've been swindled, it was like watching a child run around a room screaming ""I'm an indie game"". Buy yourself Bad Rats, you'll get a better laugh out of that than you will from this.			"

												Ok, so I'm recommending this, but honestly I'd suggest picking it up for less than 5 bucks if you can. Even though I did have a couple hours of fun with it it's kinda hard to imagine me actually forking over a fiver in real life for this.Very simplistic game. You are given a series of scenarios each with an adventure game style puzzle to solve in each one. You have a very short amount of time to solve each one, and the solution is usually the funniest option, not the most logical.This game can make you laugh, has fairly crude humor, and encourages you to ♥♥♥♥ up and try again which is nice.Whether that sounds like fun to you or not is entirely a personal preference but I enjoyed it, even if the experience is pretty short lived.

												''Your choice, your opinion, your say. You have 30 seconds to stop the bomb the McPixel way.'' My quote was actually quite nice to think of it. Also, it is recommended for people who loves puzzles and to solve mouse-clicking games. There are DLCs that are free and that is a good present. You get the story with 4 chapters and in each chapter, there is 3 levels to complete and also a hidden level. I hope this helps your advantage of getting this game, it's great.

												I got this game on sale for next to nothing. For what I got it for, I'd say it was worth it.It's a simple point and click adventure where the solution you're looking for is not always apparent.It has some interesting humor, and can be fun if you just wanna sit down, zone out, and play something for a couple minutes without getting to into it. It does what it does well, and should be commended for that.It has free DLC, and user created levels, you can even create a level yourself and share it with others! Aspects like this can keep the game interesting far after you have went through and beaten it, even after going through and getting everything that can happen in a scenario.While I got this dirt cheap, I'd definitly recommend you get this one on sale, or wait for it to go on sale. I don't quite think it's worth the initial asking price for what it is, since you can find games similar to it for free on various websites.Worth a buy if you can get it for next to nothing. Other then that, I wouldn't pick it up unless you REALLY wanna check it out that bad.			"

												Okay, it's got enough positive reviews already, but I'll just chip in these two cents: This game is batsh*t crazy! Mostly in a good way though, if with a few hints of really awkward/bizarre things. Essentially, your McPixel is put in a situation and has to decide quickly what, if anything, to do about it. Lots of dead-ends and such, but if you can think on either side of the box then you'll be able to get through.			"

												AAAAAAAAAH THE BOMB'S ABOUT TO GO OFF WHAT DO I DO KICK THE BABY OKAY I'M GONNA KICK THE BABY AHHHH IT JUST PEED ON ME- What? Review?Uh... okay. McPixel is... insane. It's utterly mad. The official levels are clever and frequently obtuse and hilarious, and I can honestly say that everyone should try it. The user-made levels tend to be simpler, but still worth a play through - even if they're not AS good, they're a good laugh. If there's a downside, it's that this game is NOT designed for long playthroughs. Five minutes at a time works for me.PROS: -BOMBS-KICKING THINGS-MINIMALIST GRAPHICS THAT WORK-EXPLOSIONS AND GAGSCONS:-BREAKS YOUR BRAIN OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME-I CAN NO LONGER STOP SHOUTINGOVERALL: 7.5/10 - PLAY IT PLAY IT PLAY IT!

												It's a pretty entertaining game if you are extremely bored and such, but all in all I guess I wasn't left TOO impressed after paying $5. It's a point and click puzzle game where in each scene you have to figure out how to deactivate the bomb to save the day/scene, which does have its funny/random moments - but there are also sections where it just feels tedious to progess because of the way the game is setup and/or the logic behind the combination that solves the puzzle is something that feels less anti-climactic that I would have hoped for in a game that seems to shout ""absurdity"" as its core feature.TL;DR Seems like a game I would play for free online on some flash website if I stubled upon it, but knowing what I know now I probably wouldn't have paid $5 for it. Even though it was mildly entertaining.			"

												Spoof 8 bit version of the 80's TV show ""McGuyver"" where you must stop a bomb exploding withing 20 seconds. It's fun in short bursts (the way it is meant to be played - it even says so on the loading screen) and it is incredible random. One screen clicking on a man might make him open his mouth, the next it might make him fall off a building, you never know, so it's basically trial and error to hit on the correct solution. However, if you get it wrong, you usually get a quick laugh along with the chance to replay the level again. Plus it comes with tons of bonus free DLC, so if you are looking for a quick palette cleanser to play between games, McPixel might do the trick.			"

												Did you ever watch the ""McGrubber"" sketch at Saturday Night Live? It's a parody of the '80s TV series ""McGyver"", which features a man who can basically disable any single bomb using the simpler things, like a rubber band or a paper clip.This game carries the parody even further, mixing scenarios of many pop culture TV series, books, movies and games, with the most absurd solutions.The game only needs you to click on something - up to three or four things, but mostly just one - to solve the scenario and save the day. If you clicked the correct thing then the bomb will be disabled; if not, then it will blow up and you'll lose the scenario. However, most of the scenarios have their own logic, and you have to think out of the hat to choose the correct answer.It's a fun game, but really short. Anyway it will make you laugh in more than one way.It's totally worth the $0.99 price tag that it has right now in the summer sale, so if you can spare a dollar you should consider this among your options.

												This is a silly, silly point-and-click game where you try to figure out how to stop a bomb from exploding through trial and error.  The graphics are intentionally (I think?) super crude, and the interactions between you (McPixel) and world objects are surreal and unpredictable, which gives the game its charm and character.  The game wisely advises you to play it in short sittings and take breaks.  Indeed, I found if I played more than one set of levels at a time the humor would kind of wear off, and since this game relies entirely on its humor, it stopped being fun very quickly.  But then when I played it the next day it'd be fresh again.  Some drawbacks: The music is repetitive; the graphics are overly crude, so much so that you can't always tell a clickable object exists; there's no achievements (I'm a little OCD so I like achievements).  I think it's a little pricey at $5, but I bought it on sale so I think it was definitely worth whatever it was I paid.  All in all, it's a quirky, silly game that  changes the entire genre  will put a smile on your face.			"

												McPixel reminds me of the poptarts commercials that end with the guy saying ""Craaazy good!"", which has almost nothing to do with this game.The whole point of the game is to click things in scenarios, sometimes in different combinations, to make different outcomes. They really make sure to include everything, there are plenty of different outcomes for each scene and the only way to 100% them is to produce every single scenario. Its a fun and easy enough game that I 100%ed all of the levels and had a good laugh. For $1, it was certainly worth the purchase! Very funny, and I think probably appropriate for all ages.Overall: 6/10 (I mean, it exceeded its purpose, for what it is!)			"

Short version: 77%An absurd and sometimes obscene puzzle game that focuses on short visual gags and the most illogical solutions one can find to a problem. The strangest thing is that it works quite well either as a good bad game or just as a clever indie puzzle– with an excellent length/price ratio thanks to the continuous release of free new levels.Long version:McPixel is the kind of game that you can hardly place anywhere. On one hand it’s obviously a joke title, full of obscene and sometimes downright retarded gags, completely illogical puzzles and an utterly insane basic idea: you have to defuse bombs at unusual places (including a lot of video game or movie themed levels) using the most absurd ways.Still, despite the complete absence of logic, it works surprisingly well as a puzzle game, and the incentives to find all possible solutions can open up a few clever visual gags that really show how great imagination the creator has. It may not be a new Portal in terms of advancing puzzle games to the next level, but it offers a quick fun, and thanks to the many levels– including the free DLCs and community-created ones– it can last quite long, if you choose to stick with it.

												One of the most random games, I have ever played.This game is a point and click ""puzzle"" game, where you play as McPixel, who disarms bombs for a living.The reson I write ""puzzle"" is becouse it`s a trile and error game, where you click stuff, in order to disarm the bombs on the level.The levels are short, and you quikly find out what to do, and move on to the next level. When you click something wrong, the game makes a lot of random and funny events, that can make you have a fun time while playing.There is really no storry in the game, and you have no charecters to really follow, other then of couse McPixel, but it`s not like the charecter in any way progress or learn something, it`s just disarm a bomb move on to the next level.Eventhough there is a lot of levels in the game, the game is rather short, and can be completed really really fast. To get a 100% in all levels, you have to activate every single event on a level, and therefore not disarm the bombs a lot of the time. The levels are random at times, but some of them are themed after moveis and game, and it is funny to see, how this game, makes events out of the situations from moveis and games. Like DLC quest, I don`t think you should buy this, unless you can get it very very cheap. It`s not becouse the game isn`t fun, but becouse it is as short as it is. Whit that said I give this game a thumps up. 4 out of 10			"

												If you accidentally buy this game when you are drunk, you will not regret it. It's low definition MacGyver. Save the day within 20 seconds or the level explodes. Some of the puzzle solutions make sense when you're sober. Most of them only make sense when you're drunk. Once you master McPixel, you will find all other point-and-click adventure games to be very easy by comparison.			"

												What happens when you combine MacGyver, point and click, and fast paced insane logic? Well, you get McPixel, a game that isn’t afraid to throw logic out the window and give some straightforward jokes.McPixel is a game that can be described as “WarioWare meets point and click adventure”. Each scene has a 20 second timer, with McPixel trying to save the day, often by disarming a bomb. Actions range from moving, picking up objects, and interacting with objects. Given the short time limit to solve the situation, players will tend to combine as many objects as possible. The game’s crazy logic behind the puzzles don’t tend to make sense and often the solutions are found by trial and error, though there are some more sane solutions that can be found. Solving each scene is simple, but the gameplay assists in something bigger, which is the game content itself.In this game, McPixel must save the day. How he does so depends on the scene and the criteria for doing so is often stretched. Throughout the game, various gags are presented, often with random and crazy ideas. Often some gross out humor is applied, so be aware of the random jokes and occasional bodily functions. Along with these kinds of gags, many pop culture references are in the game, especially with TV and video games. These references I feel tend to work better at giving a good laugh, though the various random occurrences that don’t reference anything also are worth a laugh. Anyway, the bulk of the game is in its humor, and McPixel has no shortage of comedy to toss around and make you laugh.On a short note, the game applies a retro style with its art and music. The game is pixelated like an old game, though McPixel does employ a consistent and certain character style. Scenery tends to be pixel art as well, or in some cases pixelated versions of photographs. Animations are crucial to delivering the game’s gags, and the crazy qualities of them work fine with the retro style. Music is the same way as well, using some chiptunes for some nice fat beats. There are not many songs and the tracks are quite short, but it does achieve the retro style with some neat chiptunes.McPixel is a game for those looking to laugh at the absurd and crazy situations and interactions. Gameplay is kept simple to focus on delivering comedy, though the game’s crazy logic can make some puzzles confusing and require trial and error. Still, with some retro styling with the art and music mimicking old video games, McPixel makes for a game to laugh at some silly things.			"

												The concept is simple: click on various things in the environment, chaining the actions together so your character can diffuse a bomb. However, it's completely random. There is no hint whatsoever as to what will give you success, and what will end with you just kicking an NPC in the nuts (which is about 40% of the time). It's occasionally funny, and the soundtrack is fun to listen to, but I truly feel like I'm wasting my time when I play this game. Most games allow you to make /something/, but McPixel is all about admiring what the devs have already done.			"

												In my 17 years of gaming, never have I come across a game that is so bad. It is basically a point and click game. The aim of the game is to locate and destroy/get rid of a bomb by clicking on objects on the screen. There are several stages which each has several levels.The good points are that you get lots of levels (100) which you can happily sink alot of time in.Now for the bad points. First off, although the game tries to be humorous by having you embarass or do terrible things to the characters in the game, some of the actions that the main character does may be offend/disturb people (e.g. peeing on an alien). Second is that when you start the game there is literally no tutorial which was somewhat frustrating trying to figure out what to do. Third issue is that when you fail to locate the bomb, you will proceed to the next level. The game then goes through all five levels of the stage untill you have disarmed the bomb in each stage. This forces you to remember exactly which items not to click on, but the main problem is that it is somewhat difficult to find which items can be interacted with. Fourth issue is that the game is extremely repetitive. Once you finished the first level, all the other levels are exactly the same except with new scenery. Fifth issue is that the music is really annoying as it plays 1 track for the ENTIRE game.If you like point and click games, avoid this game. If you like a fun and enjoyable games, avoid this game. It isn't even worth $1 let alone $5.			"

												Juvenile, ugly, gross, completely nonsensical reel of time constrained pointless clicking adventure game moon logic puzzles.You are put in imminent death threat situations and have to quickly discover way to avoid the disaster. Which consists purely of random clicking around the scene in hopes you click just the right thing, although most of the time you will click one of more numerous wrong things and only speed up the demise. For sh*t and giggles.Above all, this is just supposed to be funny, but it totally misses me as a target demographic. I just don't think kicking someone in the balls, urinating all over the place and such is funny.Maybe you can put on some hipster glasses and claim this is some sort of art piece, invoking nihilism, dadaism, surr-pixel-realism or whatever-ism, but to me it's utter pile of swine excrement.

												Incredibly stupid gameplay mixed with incredible stupid puzzle solutions - you've got the best puzzle game of 2013!McPixel is a fast paced humorous mini-puzzle game, where our main hero McPixel (an obvious reference to Macgyver) tries in 20 seconds to defuse a bomb and save the day. Everything is controlled with one mouse button and that's where it's charm lies. To use or pick up an item you just press it. And hope for the best. Sometimes pressing something (or someone) will pick that thing or even a person up to use with other items. In other cases, pressing will lead to McPixel kicking the said item or person. Usually that kick will result in everything blowing up.Sometimes the solution is to press on the fire to take your pants off and take a♥♥♥♥♥♥ saving everyone's life. Pressing the fire in the next puzzle will make McPixel jump to the fire, combusting himself. In the third puzzle, pressing the bomb will make McPixel kick it, destroying half the city. The solutions range from simply press the fire extinguisher to extinguish bomb to kick a fat naked guy in the showers, so that he would slip on the soap and land on a bomb, defusing it.Every single solutions is stupid, yet brilliant at the same time.It also offers FREE DLC, a thing that you wouldn't get in a 60$ ""realistic millitary shooter"". And for a such a minimal price, you'd be an idiot not to try this game out.RECOMMENDED TO BUY.			"

												You get to snowball a flasher Eskimo and use Batman as an assault weapon against people. This game is random and funny where you try to save the day in 20 seconds by finding the explosive device. It has DLC with user-submitted levels and a level editor where you can design your own. It's fun.			"

												I find this game to be rather, funny/weird at the same time. Most of the stuff you click tends to get confusing if you forget which item you clicked and where you clicked it. But of course 8/10 from me, great game all in all. If you enjoy clicking randomly along the screen and watching funny scenes come up from what you clicked.			"

												McPixel, the king of gag games. A parody, unto a parody of a parody in a parodying universe. Parodyception ladies and gentlemen.McPixel is a very simple premise, find a way to stop a bomb from blowing up in less than twenty seconds. Sometimes it's easy, requiring one or two steps, but sometimes you'll wrack your brain trying to figure out what the hell to do.The controls are point and click, no ifs ands or buts. I took this game down in little over two hours play-time on my tablet, and have since not touched it (with good reason). After beating all the levels, finding all the gags, and playing the bonus levels, there really isn't much to do, unless you're into custom player levels.All the gags are cheesy, including having McPixel kick people, or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on something, humping a PS3... you get the idea. Honestly, while I got a laugh out of a few of them, most of the gags made me want to gag.All in all, if you need to pass time, get this on Play Store, the App Store, or any mobile device, but not here. Play it though, at least once.			"

												Playing this game requires some alienware tech. I was lucky enough to have the right equipment to even enjoy three seconds of this game before my eyes began to gouge out due to it's intense 3000000p graphics. I'm going to say, it is absolutely beautiful. This beauty combines elements of a horror, casual, hardcore, stealth, and hack n slash which glorifies this intense game. Buckle your pants because McPixel is the greatest game in the world. I can bet my mom's credit card on that.			"

												McPixel is hard to review, but here's my attempt:McPixel is a point and click adventure, in which you are thrust into a random world and forced to defuse some random situation in less than 3 seconds.  If you make the wrong choice, you fail that scenario.  But don't worry, you will fail many scenarios, as the correct path is hardly ever the most obvious.  And that's the charm of the game.  You essentially try these situations over and over, and you'll finally realize that you aren't supposed to pick up the dynamite you're supposed to kick the guy in his genitals (duh!)This game reeks of potty humor, and slapstick comedy, and I find it hilarious!For the steam sale price, it's definitely worth picking up.

												McPixel is probably the closest thing to experiencing an actual mental break from reality, and that's fine because who likes boring old reality anyway? As random as the game seems, there's some sort of weird, reverse anti-backwards logic that keeps multiple levels of using guess and check on a bunch of random game elements fun and satisfying. It has the feeling of being what a point and click adventure game would be like if instead of saying ""I can't do that"" every time you rubbed two random, unrelated objects together, your character did whatever dumb thing came to mind first with them. With the ability to also create your own simplistic levels with some patience and frame by frame animating, you can pretty much make any of your gleeful childish jokes and obscure references a reality. Although McPixel isn't for everyone, give it a go if you still have the mindset to enjoy immature humor.			"

												McPixelThe oddest, weirdest take on Wario Ware I've seen in years. Retro chunk pixelly graphics, 8 bit soundtrack, and a series of vignettes where you're McPixel trying to stop an explosion. Again & again & again, in weirder & weirder sub 30 second gameplay sequences. Fail, and it's onto the next one in the sequence, looping back to failures after about 6 or so. It's a weird mix of Wario Ware meets a 2D point & click (there's an interaction puzzle to solve on each one) & a weird nasty Flash pixelly game.All with a heavy dose of Jackass humour.			"

(My experience is based on the Android version) McPixel is a very stupid minigame-fest, where you must save the day by preventing a bomb from exploding in a variety of 20 scenarios. The idea is a sort of comedy based, retro-style take on MacGuyver, where you improvise a way to stop a bomb from exploding. This includes stuffing bombs into people, causing somebody to accidentally kick the bomb out, or straight up urniating on the bomb. The comedy overtly crude and immature, and probably the reason for it's popularity of ""Let's Play"" videos with the younger audience. There are a few moments of laughs for me, especially the ""Insert Virigin"" mission.It's point and click adventure gameplay will unfairly throw people off - unlike most adventure games where you may find yourself stuck without a guide, this is the only adventure point and click I know of where there is a constant failure state built in either the 20 second time limit of each level or in your inability to find the right answer. Plus, the extreme simplicity of the controls where you can either click to interact or swipe/right click to skip removes unnecessary complexity from the genre. Yes, it's a tad annoying to fail, but it's over quickly and since you can only click on so few things, you will eventually find the answer. This alone makes this game worth playing or at least checking out to people with huge backlogs - the game is very short (3-5hrs) and it means you can play the game, even mindlessly and be able to finish without scratching your head very often (there are a couple head scratchers though). There are no sound effects in the entire game beyond the title screen. It's strange how a game about explosions only uses it in the title screen versus the rest of the game. It could have been a conscious decision to let the zany, silly chiptune style music make the situation seem crazy, lazy game design, or possibly both. The biggest legimate annoyance is the humor of the game♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes, dry humping, crotch kicks - it all sounds like something written by a pre-teen and it will definitely annoy some people. Another very annoying aspect is having to replay level to ""find all the gags"" in every level before you can reach the ending. This may offer some entertainment to players that enjoy this comedy, but for everybody else, it's an unnecessary grind, which is accentuated in the irritatingly boring, and unnecessary ""click everything and hope for the best"" last level. Still, I'd say the $5 price tag matches the value of the game, though I'm glad I got this in a bundle which made it really cheap - I could say I wasted my time with this game, but I played it on my phone while there was down time at work - wasting time was the whole point.By the way, I'd argue this game is better in short bursts on a mobile device than sitting down and playng on PC. The only reason why I have 10 hours logged was to farm trading cards - I wouldn't have installed it otherwise.			"

												Incredibly stupid gameplay mixed with incredible stupid puzzle solutions - you've got the best puzzle game of 2013!McPixel is a fast paced humorous mini-puzzle game, where our main hero McPixel (an obvious reference to Macgyver) tries in 20 seconds to defuse a bomb and save the day. Everything is controlled with one mouse button and that's where it's charm lies. To use or pick up an item you just press it. And hope for the best. Sometimes pressing something (or someone) will pick that thing or even a person up to use with other items. In other cases, pressing will lead to McPixel kicking the said item or person. Usually that kick will result in everything blowing up.Sometimes the solution is to press on the fire to take your pants off and take a♥♥♥♥♥♥ saving everyone's life. Pressing the fire in the next puzzle will make McPixel jump to the fire, combusting himself. In the third puzzle, pressing the bomb will make McPixel kick it, destroying half the city. The solutions range from simply press the fire extinguisher to extinguish bomb to kick a fat naked guy in the showers, so that he would slip on the soap and land on a bomb, defusing it.Every single solutions is stupid, yet brilliant at the same time.It also offers FREE DLC, a thing that you wouldn't get in a 60$ ""realistic millitary shooter"". And for a such a minimal price, you'd be an idiot not to try this game out.RECOMMENDED TO BUY.			"

Anyone with a sense of humor, and, an enjoyment for problem solving, needs to at least try this game. So hard to explain, and so much more fun than pictures and trailers can explain.

												McPixel is the epitomy of ""lol so randumb XD"" type humor. While each stage is short and simple enough to figure out fairly quickly, each situation makes pretty much no sense, and the solution even less so; old Sierra point-and-click adventure games were more coherent. I would say it's usable as a quick laugh, but even the gags and jokes throughout are generally juvenile and unfunny (""haha the L on the sign for Pool fell off so it says poo hahahaha""). While ""random"" humor has its place and can provide a good chuckle, it rapidly loses its potency when it's mercilessly pounded into your skull every 5 seconds.Pass.			"

												The game is short! On the other hand, had it been any longer, it wouldn't have suffered through it till I beat it, as everything about it is sub-par.- The Graphics: I'm all for old-school big pixels. But this game demonstrates that even such a crude style needs a competent artist to be good. In McPixel, many times, it was impossible to see what object a big blot of pixels was supposed to represent. On average, everything that appeared on screen was ugly. - The Audio: There are no sound effects and the music is repetitive and irritative. - Mechanisms: McPixel is a string of short adventure game-style sections in which you need to solve ""puzzles"" within 20 seconds. A solution typically requires one to three clicks on the various objects in the scene, and follows no logic whatsoever. I'm not talking alternative logic, Antichamber-style. I'm talking 100% random sequences of clicks. yuk Should you try any other sequence than the right one, you lose.- Timing: The scenes come in groups of 6. You try scene 1 once, then, no matter if you won or lost, you try scene 2... After scene 6 you go back to the first scene that you haven't won yet. The cycle goes on until all six scenes are won. The problem is that such short sequences are separated by transition segments that last several seconds. You can skip them with a right-click, but it's tedious any way.- Humor: Almost all combinations of clicks in a scene, no matter how ""right"" or ""wrong"" they are, cause a little animation that tries to be funny. I think in the whole game, two or three of them made me smile. The rest was just complete, random nonsense. Not the funny nonsense you'd find in a Monty Python comedy or the poetic nonsense of Lewis Caroll. Just whatever dull and/or gross stuff crossed the developer's mind.I won't give it the lowest score possible because it was short enough and make me grin for at least 20 seconds, but this is not a game I would recommend to any sober individual. There is zero chance I'll try any of the bonus stuff like hidden gags or ""free DLC"" or whatever.Rating: 3 out of 10			"

												First 15 min Impressions: McPixelVerdict: Pass if you're over 12 years oldImagine Warioware. Now imagine Warioware without the art, and replaced with really crappy pixel art. Now take that, and play it with a mouse and keyboard. Now take away the silly humor, and replace it with an endless sea of sodomy jokes. Now make it suck, and make it frustrating to play. Add a crappy 10 second audio clip that plays endlessly.You're left with something like McPixel.Gameplay proceeds in rounds, in which you are given 20 seconds to find/defuse a bomb. There are only a limited number of items on the screen you can click, and clicking on them in the wrong order makes the bomb explode. There doesn't seem to be any logic to how to diffuse the bombs, though you can usually get through by trying to make the crudest joke possible with the items you can click on. Solve 6 of these puzzles playing on endless repeat, and you can solve another 6 until you want to throw up.This is a game you would play on the library computer when your teacher wasn't looking in middle school, where you'd inevitably get busted anyway because you were laughing at the dumb and crude jokes. Outside any other context, there is no reason to ever play this game.			"

												Представьте: сотня комнат. В каждой бомба, которую нужно разминировать за 20 секунд. Ваш герой – красный прямоугольник с пузиком в джинсах ходит вокруг и пинает предметы. Если он не успеет ткнуть в нужные вещи в необходимой последовательности, комнату разорвет, а игра включит следующую. Потом еще одну, еще, еще, еще, еще, потом опять первую (из-за повторов McPixel немножко напоминает 8-ми битную версию фильма ""Исходный код"").Все упрощено до предела. Мир из гигантских пикселей. В каждой комнате всего три-четыре предмета. Например: змея, бомба, иллюминатор и дверь. Или: девственница, кость и корова. Большинство задач решается перебором и очень часто до того, как вы догадаетесь, что здесь происходит вообще. ""Клик, клик, клик"" – комната пройдена.Из-за графики часть предметов не различима. Серое пятно с дедушкой на мосту, зеленый квадратик на кладбище, я бы наверное улыбнулся, если бы знал, что кидаю в могилу. Почему мой герой только что нассал на пришельца? Игра не объясняет – “клик, клик, клик”.Все это можно пройти за 40 минут, хотя приестся быстрее. В самом начале здесь даже пишут ""Не играйте подолгу"".P.S.: Многое объясняет и то, что с самого начала McPixel сделали на iOS и Android. Тут и правда эталонный туалетный геймплей для сессий по пять минут.			"

												At first I found McPixel to be fairly amusing but soon enough the notion of randomly clicking on an object and observing the outcome became extremely repetitive. The order in which you have to perform each action is not always logical and is often a guessing game. I did enjoy some of the references that are made throughout the levels and I do admire the sheer amount of content that is available. There is no doubt that this game is good value for money but I felt that the gameplay is lacking.			"

												McPixel is a point and click adventure game in a WarioWare-like situation where your character is attempting to prevent a bomb (or other device) from blowing up. This is played out by interacting with various objects in the game which usually have completely unpredictable results.This is not a terribly fun game. Ultimately, while you ""control"" the outcome, there's no real way to determine ""right"" or ""wrong"" - it's all trial and error until you find the idea which the designer thought would be the funny actual solution. Half the time they're not all that funny in the first place. Additionally, the game is quite short - it takes longer to run the game to drop all the steam trading cards than it does to beat the game itself, literally.If I'm not mistaken, this game was originally a phone game and is far better suited to that format - clicking the screen, seeing stuff happen, and consuming in very, very bite sized increments. As a PC game where you're generally sitting down for somewhat longer play sessions, the novelty wears thin very rapidly and it becomes more tedious then entertaining.			"

												If there is any game I will never install again on Steam, it is McPixel. The main essence of the game is to explore a variety of ""jokes"" in a certain area and then defuse a bomb before it goes off. If you die, then you go to the next area, and so on and so on until all bombs are defused. It's a tedious process to go through. The levels themselves are boring, the jokes lame, and if you're looking for a game that requires you to not lose brain cells, there's even a warning of sorts telling you that you will lose your brain cells (Which is the only funny thing about the game because it's true). There's extra levels that follow the same concept, and while they're free they just aren't worth playing, just like the entire game in general. The graphics give a slightly retro effect to it but doesn't match with how you navigate the levels for my playing experience. If anyone really likes this game, I have three cards for sale that are three cents each, go ahead and take them off my hands (Offer now void) "

												The idea behind McPixel is that you get placed into a random situation wherein you have to stop a bomb from going off through point-and-click puzzling. The situations and their solutions are rather obtuse, so working through them is often trial-and-error. This would be fine if the game held up in other ways, but quite frankly the game's attempts at humor -- usually very crude violence or excrement jokes -- fall flat for me and the aesthetics are equally bland unless you're into the occasional pixelated parody. I bought this on sale expecting at least a few laughs, but I ended up just being frustrated. I suggest buying a sandwich or a candy bar instead -- those would bring more enjoyment than this.			"

												In this point-and-click adventure game, you play rounds consisting of multiple locations, each with a bomb you have to defuse. The logic of defusing the bomb rarely makes sense, but that was probably a part of the failed attempt at humor in this game. You die a lot as a result of this and also because most actions kill you instantly. This was extremely frustrating at first, but after discovering I could skip the tediously long cut scenes at the start and end of each location, the game was no longer tedious, boring, and frustrating, but only tedious and boring!  The fun of Kicking people in the groin or peeing on them wears off after the first level. I feel like it’s inappropriate to review a game you spent only an hour playing, but I just have no desire to return to the game right now.If you’re a fan of tedious shallow gameplay or lackluster humor, then you might enjoy this game.

												McPixel is a point and click game adventure game.  Although enjoying very few point-and-click games, I was willing to give a chance to.  In the end, I did not find myself having a fun experience.The game is meant to be a comedy of sorts, having both slapstick and crass humor.  Although some of the gags are good, the logic behind solving the puzzles is convoluted and confusing, sometimes having no logic at all.  This results in you usually having to just use trial and error over and over to figure out the right order of operations to solve a level.  This is made somewhat less annoying, however, as the load times between failed attempts is very quick.  In my opinion, the gameplay would better fit a more narrative driven game than a rapid-paced puzzle game.The other problem I had with the game was the music.  Throughout the entire game, only one very repetitive music track is used.  At least as far as I got, there is no sound effects, ambient noises, voice acting, etc.  This means the one looping music track is the only thing you will hear throughout the entire session.Although I did not find the game fun, players who enjoy ""rage games"" would probably get a few good laughs out of the game.  I would recommend waiting for a sale however, as there is not much gameplay for a $5.00, compared to other games on Steam for the same (or lower) price.			"

												So... I'm not sure what to think about this, actually. It's brilliantly animated, and sometimes witty... but sometimes not-so-witty, and can feel like you're just wasting your time. But more importantly, there's not much of a game to it. At all, really. So... no, I wouldn't really advise getting it. Not for €4.			"

												Absolutely awful, I get that it's a parody of a parody but that doesn't mean it has free reign to be a terrible flash game. It basically just distills down to you clicking on random items hoping that they will solve the level. So you pretty much fail over and over and over again while the game plays the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music on loop all the while you're wishing that God would just strike you down so you never have to recall the terrible humor in this game. Plus on top of all that the game gives you no hints at how to even play the game.			"

												Too dumb for words. It might be that I just don't get it, but I think it's more that the game is just stupid. A bit humorous, but mostly just dumb. No real ""gameplay"" that I can discern. You just click on objects and the world blows up. Sometimes you want the world to blow up and sometimes you don't. Sometimes it needs to happen in the right way. I think. I don't know because the game doesn't give you any feedback other than big explosion at the end of every level, regardless of whether you were ""successful"" or not.			"

												The gameplay is repetitive, and the music will soon start to haunt you as you realize how repetitive that is too, which isn't a great combination considering it sounds like a midi file. At first I found some merit in the point and click style of this game, but after a few levels I realized that there was no logic to it whatsoever, and that the solutions were completely unexpected. 100 levels is way too much to endure this game that is trying way too hard to be funny.

												I got this for a buck, and it was probably one of the WORST purchases I've ever made in regards of the usage of one dollar, I'm not kidding.Why?well here's why:The gameplay, is mediocre,- generally fustrating, and it gets old REAL damn fast. Sometimes,you don't know exactly what to do so you just get desperate (usually) and you click all around the screen hoping that it's somehow the solution to that specific puzzle you're on.That's just dull and irritating.The visuals. nothing special.Its pixels, what do you expect? And they're not even that detailed, they're like as if someone animated all this crap through mspaint and flash- well might as well be hm?The music, VERY repititive-I'd rather hear my music instead of bearing to listen to this games.The ""humor"" (dare I say it) is very unfunny,forced, and childish. It's not clever, it's not even really charming. It's just random and stupid. Yeha, there are references to some TVs/Game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttery but it really doesn't make up for how down right unhumorous this game is.I honestly tried to like this game, alas, it all fell flat on its face for me. If you see this, stay the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥away from it. Even if it's standing at one dollar, trust me- it won't pay itself back at the end of it all. I'ld literally chuck a buck just to get this out of my library. I only say go for it if you're into crummy casual obscure games- because that's basically what it is.			"

												McPixel resembles Nintendo's WarioWare really. It's a game filled with mini-games where you're basically given several seconds to complete these mini-games. Now, I can't give you any proper examples because the scenes are just ridiculous(ly absurd) and the same thing goes for the solutions to these 'puzzles'. But in the end it all comes down to stopping a bomb from blowing up. Playing a level will rotate 6 or so mini-games until you have solved them all. Then you move on to the next set if you want.It's a game that should be played in short sessions, and it might actually be more fun on a mobile device, and cheaper as well. Still, since there are no similar games like this for the PC, McPixel is a welcome addition nonetheless.[Rating: 65/100]			"

												Hello. My name is Gandalf and i tried out this game. And now im gonna write all about it. First off i have playid all the campaign+ DLC so i basically know what im talking about. The campaign was really really really fun and i enjoyed it very much. The DLC had some bad ones and olso had some good ones. The good ones were mostly userpacks and olso some other ones. But my nightmare was nerdpak what made me rage quit that piece of F**k 6 times. Olso i tried the fart along and even talked to another pixel guys and kicked they'r balls. Yep. This is a cool game but .. its kinda shot and only thing you can do after the campaign is do the endless mode. Thats it. I have all 100% and i really laughed at the ending clip.8/10 And i recommend this game. Ofcourse if you want a cheap game in your library. It doesnt last long so dont even bother with it ;) Good luck with the Nerdpak and have a nice day			"

												An insta-fail, counterintuitive, yet enjoyable pixelated point-and-click game. The task is simple: keep the bomb from exploding in various sets of maps and situations.There's not much more about it: every map contains a few characters and environmental elements (some hidden ones too) and you have a few clicks to get the right ones in the right order so your ethically-questionable hero McPixel can take action and throw the bomb away, or shield it, or defuse it and so on.The extremely simple gameplay is weirdly balanced by the major unpredictability of the solution, so you end up frenetically repeating the same set of maps (six every stage) over and over again until you finally get it done.There's also a bonus stage unlocked every time you get a streak of three wins together, but that happens so rarely (unless you're replaying it) that it can be considered a rare event.Of course it can be me: maybe there's actually a pattern by which you can solve all the maps without a doubt, but I couldn't last enough in the game to get it. One reason may be the fact that I couldn't bear gaming sessions longer than 5 or 10 minutes because of the confusion-to-rage inducing solutions and the constantly looping two seconds background 8-bit music (come on...)It's difficult to me to imagine actually completing the entire game, so I can't really figure how one could possibly find the motivation to replay it afterwards.To sum it up, for me it makes an ok game to play when you don't have much time (and something else to listen to), but nothing more.

												It's a novel  game, but not very long, and filled with puerile comedy (pelvic thrusts, boob flashes and scatological humour).  As such, I can't really recommend it.  I thought about giving it a weak recommend, because I don't really REGRET playing it, and most people won't mind the comedy.  But, it seems to me the review should reflect MY take, and the game wasn't quite novel enough (underneath the one try + loop conceit, it's just another point & click), or long enough (even with the ""DLC"") to merit a recommend.

												I don't get it. I just don't get it. The humor just doesn't get me. It's all weird, dumb slapstick that's, in my opinion, mediocre at best. The gameplay is barely even gameplay. The puzzles don't involve thought, they involve clicking everything on the screen. Bomb in a hotdog stand? Click the cow. One out of every fifteen or so puzzles actually has an answer that makes sense. This game tries so hard to be a ""charming indie game,"" but just comes off monotonous , boring, and quite frankly, dumb. When you're making a game, the actual gameplay should trump filling your game with bad humor and obscure references. If dumb humor is your thing, maybe give this one a shot. Otherwise, stay away. This thing is barely even a game.			"

												McPixel is a really stupid, and simple game. However, it can be quite a fun time waster. It's ""stupidness"" actually comes from the fact that it's quite a ridiculous game, an hilarious adventure of things blowing up. Great for a good laugh.Unfortunately, this game, being a puzzle game at all, suffers from the fact that once you complete the puzzles (and find all the gags) it can become quite boring. Since its story is quite simple (if there's a story at all!), just like the puzzles, it loses replayability.However, I recommend it for a boring afternoon.			"

												I don't get it. I just don't get it. The humor just doesn't get me. It's all weird, dumb slapstick that's, in my opinion, mediocre at best. The gameplay is barely even gameplay. The puzzles don't involve thought, they involve clicking everything on the screen. Bomb in a hotdog stand? Click the cow. One out of every fifteen or so puzzles actually has an answer that makes sense. This game tries so hard to be a ""charming indie game,"" but just comes off monotonous , boring, and quite frankly, dumb. When you're making a game, the actual gameplay should trump filling your game with bad humor and obscure references. If dumb humor is your thing, maybe give this one a shot. Otherwise, stay away. This thing is barely even a game.			"

												If you're looking for a couple of laughs with your friends indoors, then sure, this game is for you.However if you are expecting a game that will keep your attention for more than a few minutes, then this game is just going to turn into a donation.I will admit, there are a few laughs hidden throughout this game. But after 10 minutes of just random clicking, it starts to get frustratingly confusing. There is no real incentive to keep on playing - since after completing the various levels, you can go back and ""fully complete"" levels, by discovering all of the gags. Which really just gets tiresome.There is a ""social"" (I use that term loosely) aspect of the game, where a bunch of people under the name of the main character just talk to each other.I think the most entertaining part of this game was the ""Fart-A-Long"". Although even then, there isn't much variety for it as I have played the same 3 patterns (if I recall correctly) numerous times.Is this title worth $5? No. I recieved this game for free, and only played it to retrieve the trading cards from it.But hey, if you're feeling generous and want to have a handfull of amusing moments, then godspeed.2 out of 10 teardrops.TL;DRNo enticement towards replayability, ""Social"" part of game is just a less-populated version of Omegle, and humor dies out quickly.There are more worthwhile games out there with quite a good incentive for replayability (even under $5.00).

												This game isn't all that great.I bought it for $.99 as a cart-topper of sorts while it was on sale, on a mild whim, nothing more. The game is a point-and-click game mashed with Wario Ware quickness.You get about 5 or 6 seconds (give or take a second or two) to ""Save The Day"" and each level has 5 or 6 scenarios in which McPixel must save the day. It tries to be funny and random, but most often for me it just came off as rather, well, dumb. It's not inherently BAD for what it is, per se, but I wouldn't dare pay full price for this. It's just not really my cup of tea. I mean if you dig point-and-click asthetic and/or WarioWare-esque gameplay, then hell yeah, you'd probably like this. But me, personally, I really don't like it.

I can see why some people could find it funny. drug users, teenage boys, very bored people, maybeRandom scenarios of point n click bomb defusing are very random yes, funny meh....debatable. Five set of puzzles in each game lasting 20 seconds and if you dont get them right be prepared to keep playing the same ones till you do. Theres no logical explanation to completing them in fact probably the opposite. I think thats whats supposed to be humerous....maybe Maybe I'm just not intelligent enough, have no sense of humour or need series drugs2/10  "

Its basically a game where you get short and simple instructions and the faster you do them the better score you get. Every level there is some sort of bomb you gotta stop exploding almost everything you click does something. (well done programmers!) The music is repetitive and annoying as f*ck. An ok point'n'click game would be awesome for android or other mobile devices. Not my type of game but was fun going through the game and has alot of replay ability. Would not pay more than 1 Euro for this game.			"

												Funny at the first sight, but gets boring very fast. Not a real game just a good joke.Edit (to make it more helpful :)It is something like point and click adventure, where you solve one screen puzzles. illogical puzzles. so You will click on everything interactive to see what will happen. Usually it will finish with huge explosion.To make a progress (and see some new puzzles) you have to finish successfully some previous puzzles (well, I know its not a big surprise). So you will have to repeat puzzles and hunting for all interactive spots, what i found boring after few screens.I wanted to run through it like running though comic book at least, but it was not possible. i gave up.Some jokes are better some of them are worse. If you like jokes involving urinating or kicking someone's balls maybe you can find it funny. If you are considering buying it you might rather watch some gameplay on internet, or try demo, you will see everything. This application has nothing more to offer.			"

												This game... where do I even begin to describe how awesome, addictive, infuriating, intelligent, rage-inducing, beautiful this masterpiece of a game this is. I think having to find the way to save the world, then numeriously blow it up till there literally is no other way to screw up. One of the best things about this game is that once you start you don't stop. once you start a chapter (like 1-1, part 1) you have to finish it. there is no, get 3 right then quit. you have to get them all right to end, but even then it gets better if you start part 2 you have to screw up (about 6 or so times per level). When first playing I was so frustrated that I could barely save the world, but then, I realized that all my screw ups would amount to something, with which makes the game easier (and a heck of a lot more fun) becuase you get to be happy in being correct by punching someone in the face and letting the world blow up (I mean really, if the world was going to end anyways, you might as well punch a person in the face). Highly recommend this game			"

												  McPixel may seem stupid and pointless from a distance, but the game game is a BLAST to play (get it? hah!). With plenty of in-game levels and tons of free extra ""DLC"" to play, you can spend hours with this game. Many of the levels contain a lot of jokes and references to other games or movies, and most of the bonus levels (which you unlock by not only saving the day by defusing the bombs in every level of that chapter, but also going through and discovering all the gags that involve not saving the day) are straight up homages to those things. The video game one was my personal favorite, where you have to save Cloud and Sephiroth by becoming Jenova, and saving Chell from Portal by opening a portal into her body and tossing the bomb in it, etc. I found myself laughing audibly with some of the ridiculous scenes, such as McPixel choosing to dry hump various objects instead of defusing the bomb.   The game menu itself was a delight, each option you pick containing a humorous outcome. The music, though simple was actually quite addicting, and can easily get stuck in your head as it plays in the background of every level that you're trying desperately to defuse a random bomb in less than 20 seconds. Some of the levels were pretty easy, but I don't think the game itself was actually going for a difficulty factor as much as it was a gag factor, and sometimes when the outcome was easy, I actually found myself looking for the funny alternatives instead of defusing the bomb right away. The 8-bit artstylem though simple, actually was very good at depicting the various emotions of the characters, such as McPixel screaming at a soldier to remove the bomb after putting said soldier's own hat on.   I'd definitely recommend this game if you could find it on a sale. As great and amusing as it was, it still only contains about 2 hours of actual gameplay, the rest stemming from DLC both made by the actual developers, and by the community itself via the in-game World Creator. Though than again the game only markets itself as $5, so if you've got a fiver to spend, and have a twisted sense of humor, I think you'd enjoy this game.			"

												McPixel is adventure game logic at it's finest. I haven't played through it all on the computer, but beat it on my phone along time ago. As for playing it a second time some of the challange is gone as the levels are the same (except the extras and DLC are new) but with such a variety I was sure to make some of the same mistakes again. Seeing the mistakes are part of the fun of the game as they lead to unlocks. Recommended game as a time waster and humor, but beyond that it won't last long...not that it is meant to.			"

Most solutions to puzzles doesn't even make sense, so laughter becomes boredom after the first minutes of play.It does have, however, an immense amount of gags to fiddle with and enjoy.Doesn't do well as a competent game, but it is bound to entertain in other ways.

												So! Uhm... Yeah... Bombs, explosions, lots of rage and cow anuses. That was my experience with this game so far. While being hilarious, it still is a grind to get to the bonus levels, which are f-ing impossible. But I still really enjoyed it. Even more than shooting puppies! Forget that last part... Anyway! The complete randomness of this game will make you giggle the first time, but will make you rage very hard when you fail for the 100th time on a single level... It is still very enjoyable and perfectly suited for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and psychopaths (like me).			"

												Funny at the first sight, but gets boring very fast. Not a real game just a good joke.Edit (to make it more helpful :)It is something like point and click adventure, where you solve one screen puzzles. illogical puzzles. so You will click on everything interactive to see what will happen. Usually it will finish with huge explosion.To make a progress (and see some new puzzles) you have to finish successfully some previous puzzles (well, I know its not a big surprise). So you will have to repeat puzzles and hunting for all interactive spots, what i found boring after few screens.I wanted to run through it like running though comic book at least, but it was not possible. i gave up.Some jokes are better some of them are worse. If you like jokes involving urinating or kicking someone's balls maybe you can find it funny. If you are considering buying it you might rather watch some gameplay on internet, or try demo, you will see everything. This application has nothing more to offer.			"

												A very funny experience, but nothing more than that.Even though it's good for some good laughs and the references and cameos are really interesting, the gameplay based on trial and error makes this a game you can't take seriously. Most solutions to puzzles doesn't even make sense, so laughter becomes boredom after the first minutes of play.It does have, however, an immense amount of gags to fiddle with and enjoy.Doesn't do well as a competent game, but it is bound to entertain in other ways.

												McPixel's is an obnoxious (and proud of it!) point-and-click that tasks you with saving the day in exciting, and some not-so-exciting, situations. Yet another game with a retro aesthetic, and an ugly one at that, McPixel doesn't stand out from the crowd in terms of graphics and sound. The real treat is the gameplay: Defuse the bomb, or at least stop the explosive, but within the allotted time. Otherwise, kaboom! How much time? How's 20 seconds sound?Here's where McPixel really shines: There are tonnes of levels, the developer supports the game like crazy (kudos to Mikolaj ""Sos"" Kamiński), and the puzzle mechanics are fun. While the humour, as is normally the case, is subjective and can get grating after a while, McPixel works incredibly well in short bursts. Just quit when you feel yourself growing weary, and return when you need another dose of insanity between other games.			"

												What can be said about McPixel?............Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb.Story- Terrorist have threatend the world and it is up to CIA agent McPixel to... who am I kidding, this game has no story. You are McPixel and you must try to find the bomb and difuse it in humorous (if not nonsensical) ways. One word, wacky. D-Graphics- Quite ugly, even in the retro sense. But done well enough to understand what is going on and get a few laughs on the way. D-Sound- Just the rediculous musical loop that will drive you MAD!!!! D-Gameplay- 10 seconds to find and defuse a bomb. Just point and click, expirament and have fun. C+Overall- Is a fun diversion with plenty of fan generated content, but for the long haul, fails to keep intrest going. That is all I have to say on that so the overall grade, to keep with the random humor of the game. ;-@			"

												I played this on Android previously but this was my first time on PC. It probably says something about the design that I beat this point-and-click adventure game like a year ago and forgot literally every solution to every puzzle. If you can relax and embrace the game's odd sense of humor, along with the fact that none of the solutions make sense and will require blind trial-and-error to get through, it's an amusing way to kill some time. Recommended, if you're the type of person who can enjoy kicking nuclear bombs and shoving old men down elevator shafts.			"

												 To be honest, if you think I would suggest this one, you're RIGHT ON TARGET; because that's correct! It's a simple mini-game based point & click adventure game, where each of the levels has 6 scenes, where in each one, you have to figure out within at least 15 seconds, to figure out how to disarm the bomb. (And sometimes, figure out WHERE THE BOMB EVEN IS!) This game is a comedic game; nothing dirty, but rather AWKWARD; the main character is in fact, ""McPixel""; a parody of two characters, named MacGyver, and his other parody character, named MacGruber. Each episode is simple; YOU HAVE TO STOP THE BOMB! (Or whatever disaster will happen.) Note that the main hero is not a very smart fellow, so you play as him, (and if lucky) figutre out how to stop a disaster from happening. So, what makes this game so awesome?!? Dude; this game is so dang awkward, that it's funny! If you like a good laugh, and like good, simple ""point & click adventure"" style puzzle-based gameplay, (that will usually take at least a minute or two, just to solve the puzzles) this game is 100% guaranteed, for a good laugh! Among games that are categorized as ""SteamPlay"" games, all DLC for this game is FREE! Don't forget; ANYONE can even make their own levels, with the downloadable level editor, too; the official website has a tutorial page that will teach you how it works, because it doesn't require any professional programming knowledge; at least according to what it looks like, of course!

												This game... where do I even begin to describe how awesome, addictive, infuriating, intelligent, rage-inducing, beautiful this masterpiece of a game this is. I think having to find the way to save the world, then numeriously blow it up till there literally is no other way to screw up. One of the best things about this game is that once you start you don't stop. once you start a chapter (like 1-1, part 1) you have to finish it. there is no, get 3 right then quit. you have to get them all right to end, but even then it gets better if you start part 2 you have to screw up (about 6 or so times per level). When first playing I was so frustrated that I could barely save the world, but then, I realized that all my screw ups would amount to something, with which makes the game easier (and a heck of a lot more fun) becuase you get to be happy in being correct by punching someone in the face and letting the world blow up (I mean really, if the world was going to end anyways, you might as well punch a person in the face). Highly recommend this game			"

												  McPixel may seem stupid and pointless from a distance, but the game game is a BLAST to play (get it? hah!). With plenty of in-game levels and tons of free extra ""DLC"" to play, you can spend hours with this game. Many of the levels contain a lot of jokes and references to other games or movies, and most of the bonus levels (which you unlock by not only saving the day by defusing the bombs in every level of that chapter, but also going through and discovering all the gags that involve not saving the day) are straight up homages to those things. The video game one was my personal favorite, where you have to save Cloud and Sephiroth by becoming Jenova, and saving Chell from Portal by opening a portal into her body and tossing the bomb in it, etc. I found myself laughing audibly with some of the ridiculous scenes, such as McPixel choosing to dry hump various objects instead of defusing the bomb.   The game menu itself was a delight, each option you pick containing a humorous outcome. The music, though simple was actually quite addicting, and can easily get stuck in your head as it plays in the background of every level that you're trying desperately to defuse a random bomb in less than 20 seconds. Some of the levels were pretty easy, but I don't think the game itself was actually going for a difficulty factor as much as it was a gag factor, and sometimes when the outcome was easy, I actually found myself looking for the funny alternatives instead of defusing the bomb right away. The 8-bit artstylem though simple, actually was very good at depicting the various emotions of the characters, such as McPixel screaming at a soldier to remove the bomb after putting said soldier's own hat on.   I'd definitely recommend this game if you could find it on a sale. As great and amusing as it was, it still only contains about 2 hours of actual gameplay, the rest stemming from DLC both made by the actual developers, and by the community itself via the in-game World Creator. Though than again the game only markets itself as $5, so if you've got a fiver to spend, and have a twisted sense of humor, I think you'd enjoy this game.			"

												McPixel is adventure game logic at it's finest. I haven't played through it all on the computer, but beat it on my phone along time ago. As for playing it a second time some of the challange is gone as the levels are the same (except the extras and DLC are new) but with such a variety I was sure to make some of the same mistakes again. Seeing the mistakes are part of the fun of the game as they lead to unlocks. Recommended game as a time waster and humor, but beyond that it won't last long...not that it is meant to.			"

												McPixel's is an obnoxious (and proud of it!) point-and-click that tasks you with saving the day in exciting, and some not-so-exciting, situations. Yet another game with a retro aesthetic, and an ugly one at that, McPixel doesn't stand out from the crowd in terms of graphics and sound. The real treat is the gameplay: Defuse the bomb, or at least stop the explosive, but within the allotted time. Otherwise, kaboom! How much time? How's 20 seconds sound?Here's where McPixel really shines: There are tonnes of levels, the developer supports the game like crazy (kudos to Mikolaj ""Sos"" Kamiński), and the puzzle mechanics are fun. While the humour, as is normally the case, is subjective and can get grating after a while, McPixel works incredibly well in short bursts. Just quit when you feel yourself growing weary, and return when you need another dose of insanity between other games.			"

												What can be said about McPixel?............Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb.Story- Terrorist have threatend the world and it is up to CIA agent McPixel to... who am I kidding, this game has no story. You are McPixel and you must try to find the bomb and difuse it in humorous (if not nonsensical) ways. One word, wacky. D-Graphics- Quite ugly, even in the retro sense. But done well enough to understand what is going on and get a few laughs on the way. D-Sound- Just the rediculous musical loop that will drive you MAD!!!! D-Gameplay- 10 seconds to find and defuse a bomb. Just point and click, expirament and have fun. C+Overall- Is a fun diversion with plenty of fan generated content, but for the long haul, fails to keep intrest going. That is all I have to say on that so the overall grade, to keep with the random humor of the game. ;-@			"

												I played this on Android previously but this was my first time on PC. It probably says something about the design that I beat this point-and-click adventure game like a year ago and forgot literally every solution to every puzzle. If you can relax and embrace the game's odd sense of humor, along with the fact that none of the solutions make sense and will require blind trial-and-error to get through, it's an amusing way to kill some time. Recommended, if you're the type of person who can enjoy kicking nuclear bombs and shoving old men down elevator shafts.			"

												Ugh. From the moment this game launched I knew I was going to hate it. It screams McPixel! at you in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sounding audio file. The music then kicks in which is anoying to say the least.The menu navigation and tooltips are just crap. This is clearly designed for a mobile platform.The gameplay consists of a trial and error set of random sequences. Do not use logic on this game because you will fail. Just click on everything until it says you win.There is no humor. This game wouldnt even make a baby laugh. Its the 'Epic Movie' of video games.Stay far far away.			"

												I mildly recommend this game as it's pretty cheap to get and has some entertainment value.  Even though for $.99 you get what you paid for.  Has some decent challenging levels and has its fun moments.  That being said, does it really need to pop out the title every time you win or lose a level and that happens every 30 seconds.  Even someone with advanced alzehimers wouldn't forget which game he was playing.  McPixel!  I love pixelness but I am still wishing the pixelness was slightly clearer and that the music would vary more.  Also some of the level solutions are just SO dumb..like oh i have to pee in the ground first.  And for kicks, you can always kick someone in the balls.  There will be alot of kicking people in the balls and sexually pleasing animals. McPixel!			"

												Now i like funny games and consider myself to have a good sense of humour,but come on what the hell is this game all about.I know that graphics dont make a game but they could have helped with this one.You start the first level like every level not really knowing what the ""HELL"" is going on and what your supposed to do (OH SORRY STOP THE BOMB SILLY ME DUH),and thats the way every level plays out.Its not a question of working out what to do as it is blind luck,and dont do the level right and you get to play it again (OH NO THE PAIN) and then do it wrong again and you get to do it again (WHERES THE EXIT PLEASE),and then you realise that you are just wasting your time and that you know you will get it right eventually as there are not many options left.I didnt enjoy my time with this game (OH MY GOD I DID TRY TO THE POINT OF PURE FRUSTRATION) and i wouldent reccomend it to anyone in a sale or in a bundle.Do like McPixel and find a way to blow this game up (AND IF YOU DONT MANAGE TO KEEP AT IT UNTIL YOU DO) and please dear god dont let there be a sequel.

The content is ridiculous and completely absurd. Also, often really obnoxious.Having to click 5+ buttons in order to quit is also a mark of awful. The game cannot interest the player to keep playing by itself, so it complicated the quitting interface? Meh.The only good thing is that you get steam trading cards that you can sell (for about $0.35 - $0.40 right now), but even for those you have to keep game running for 4+ hours.			"

												A crappy version of warioware, its a series of mini games that are terrible.

												I very seldom down-vote a game, but there is no way I can recommend purchasing this.  You're not likely to enjoy this game for long.  I read the reviews ahead of time stating that it's more of a joke than a game.""That's okay!"" I thought. ""Jokes are worth paying for!""  But that's if the joke is good.  Or meatier.  This is one juvenile gag repeated ad nauseam.  Occasionally, the combinations of selecting/kicking result in a good laugh (usually just a chuckle).  The rest...?  Do I enjoy sophomoric humor?  Probably more than I should, but c'mon.  Is there ANYTHING else besides kicking people in the testes and having everything blow up?  The free DLC is all the same.Even if you buy it on sale, run it in the background to get card drops and sell all of them, you won't break even.In short, if you're really interested in this game, see if a friend has it already and play it for 10 minutes on their account.And maybe get really high before playing.  That might help.			"

All you do is click and remember where you clicked previously.

												The premise of this game is that you are placed into a random environment, and have 20 seconds to interact with things to prevent a bomb from going off.There's no rhyme or reason in the solutions.  It's really just like a bad adventure game puzzle, where you blindly guess what needs to interact with what.This is really the equivalent of a free flash game, and it's not worth anyone's money, nor time.

												I remember playing this as a Flash game long ago. The retail version is basically the same with more levels. It's a very Warioware-like game. Every stage you get around 30 seconds to save the day (often by stopping a bomb explosion). While the odds of beating a stage the first time are low, there's usually less than 10 permutations you can do on any given stage, so you'll figure it out quickly.Similar to Wizorb, perhaps its best feature is how inexpensive it is - under $1 on a sale. Even less than that if it's in a bundle.If you decide to play and don't feel like reading instructions, just don't forget that SPACE lets you skip just about all animations/intros. It will make your gameplay experience a hundred times better.I finished most of the content, including seeing most of the gags, in about 3 hours. It was.. somewhat fun, I guess. Might have been better left as a Flash game. Still, I'll give it a 6.5 out of 10. Still recommended, but just barely, and only on a sale or in a bundle. Also, if it matters to you, this game has Steam cards.			"

												I would normally enjoy a random and funny game like this but McPixel goes too far, to the point where it's just stupid. Most of the levels don't require you to think, but more so require you to click randomly. Quite simply the worst 'game' I have ever played. Your time will be spent doing these three things in order of frequency (most often to least):1) Looking at McPixel logos between ""levels""2) Randomly touching things on the screen for a few seconds3) wondering where the last 50 seconds of your life wentDo NOT buy this! Even if it is on sale for 99cents!			"

												McPixel will probably take you no more than two hours to beat. Its gameplay is very simplistic and at times kinda annoying. The scenarios and outcomes are immature and sophomoric. As you can see, there are a lot of reasons to not be interested in the game. With all that being said, I still enjoyed it. Yeah, it's all childish, but that doesn't stop it from being funny. It's also never ""in your face"" with its comedy. The comedy is presented deadpan, as if there's nothing funny or really out of the ordinary going on, which is the type of humor I love. Whether or not you'll enjoy McPixel really boils down to whether or not you're comfortable paying $1-5 for what is inherently a Newgrounds flash game.			"

												I'm indifferent about this game... it's short for a $5 game. The game seems to be mainly focused around humor and little logic to the puzzles that you have to think random. Sadly the humor hardly got to me... I did find myself stuck on a few levels as well, the Mortal Kombat stage and one of those stages at the end that have 2 parts to it.I'd wait till there's a sale for it at $1 (which is either Winter or Summer sale) as that's how it feels like to me... $5 is a bit much for me. I do wish there just wasn't one music being played throughout all the levels though... gets annoying quickly and sorta hurt my ears too after awhile. Also meant for replayability, but the humor is, as I said, rather dry for me.It's still a good game and more for those that enjoy random moments that either make or don't make sense and get a kick out of it.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												The only paid game I uninstalled before playing through to the end.What this is, is just some random clicking on some 8-bit pixel graphics. I thought it would be fun because I like random stuff and sometimes random done well can be amusing and entertaining. This was not.I was ""playing"" (if you can even use this word - usually I reserve ""play"" for something that's actually fun) this the other day when my husband (a fellow gamer - we met 19 years ago, playing Virtua Fighter 3 in an arcade near our place) came into the room. He looked at my computer screen, roared with laughter, and said, ""You paid for this?!""Sadly, I nodded.Proof that, even as an adult, we still make mistakes.Well, at least this game made one of us laugh.

												There is always some level of arbitrariness in a point & click.  Logically there might be a dozen ways to make a guard leave his post or to interact with a pump, but only one will be correct because of the artificial nature of the game.  A good point and click will keep this under control with reasonable puzzle solutions, while rewarding the player for their time and effort with humor, good music, an interesting story or other unique charm.  McPixel does none of this.  The music is short, repetitive, and not at all pleasing to listen to.  The puzzle solutions are arbitrary enough that all you can really do is click whatever is in the level until you manage to click the correct objects in the correct order.  It lacks a cohesive narrative.  There is humor, but it is crass and juvenile; even compared to other crass, juvenile humor, McPixel is in the back of the pack.There is no reason to buy this game at any price.  There will always be something better to spend your money on.			"

												I beat this game in 2 hours. I had fun for 30 minutes. McPixel is a game that ultimately relies on you to understand the ""Moon Logic"" joke of older 90's point-and-click games, and turns that joke into its big running gag. I didn't have a problem with it. The game made me laugh quite a few times for the unusual, inappropriate things McPixel would do with specific objects.However, that's as far as the gameplay extends. Beyond the mission-by-mission sequence, there's really little else to the game. Click on stuff, find the gag, move on. It's little more than that. And it gets old once you've played these levels over and over, to the point where finding another nonsensical answer would release another groan I had inside me.If you find this sort of humor funny, more power to you. If you find this gameplay as not monotonous, more power to you as well. For me, there's just very little to say about McPixel. It's short and funny, but not a very memorable or ultimately pleasant experience.			"

												Ten minutes is really all you need to know if this is the game for you. You walk blind into a scenario in which you are to diffuse a stick of dynamite within 20 seconds. The problem is the solution is not based on logic or reason, but point-and-click-adventure-game puzzle rationale that make no sense whatsoever. This may be the ""humor"" of the game, but it stops being funny pretty fast, especially since you'll find yourself replaying the same 20 second levels over and over.			"

As it is I don't recommend buying it unless it comes with an amazing bundle such as the Humble Bundle (where I got my copy), because as a game in itself on Steam it simply doesn't satisfy.It's also written in AIR.

												McPixel can be quite funny and entertaining, but only for a short while. The outcomes and solutions to the puzzles are original and ""out of the box"", but that only goes so far. It gets repetetive extremely quickly, especially when you just can't seem to find the solution to a puzzle. What's even worse is that when you do finally find the solution, 9 out of 10 times it will hardly make any sense, leaving you wondering how you were supposed to expect that to happen.It's more luck than skill what goes into playing this game, and the correct outcome is more often than not hardly funny enough to counter the tediousness of finding it.

												McPixel is just a way to waste a couple of hours (two, in my case), nothing more.It's an humorous take on the Point & Click genre, but becomes boring very quickly once the surprise is gone. Its main problem is also its core mechanic : the solution to its puzzle makes no sense. This is what makes the game funny from time to time thanks to some absurd cutscenes, but this also means there is absolutely no reflexion required.In each of the 100 levels of the story mode (which doesn't have any scenario of course), you are asked to interact with all the items you can and combine them in all possible ways, until you find the ""right"" one (the one that doesn't make the stage explode). Discovering the intended combination doesn't feel particularly rewarding, because unlocking the ""gold medal"" in a stage (which unlocks bonus stages) requires to find ALL possible combinations. In the end, you will just find yourself clicking everywhere until the game congratulates you for completing the stage, and repeat the process until you reach the final cutscene.The only way I think this could be interesting is racing against a friend trying to get all levels done before the other. But in solo, McPixel is terribly empty.The game apparently comes with an editor to create your own stages and share them with the community. I must admit I didn't take the time to explore this mode, nor to test community-made stages, the game itself being so boring I doubt these stages can save it.To sum up, McPixel is a joke, as it was meant to be. But this jokes repeats itself a lot, making it feel terribly long (although the story mode takes two hours to complete), and five dollars seems to be too much for a spoof like this. This is typically the game you would expect to play for free in your browser to kill some time, this doesn't deserve a spot in your Steam library.			"

												For what is was trying to achieve it accomplished i guess. You'll be thoroughly confused as to whats happeneing the first 30 minutes of play. It's fast paced and the only gameplan is to randomly click everywhere, trial and error. No real fun in this game honestly, seemed like a waste of time. I picked it up for 29 cents so I'm not even dissappointed.			"

												McPixel is a save-the-day guy that you guide through 100 short challenges in an old-school point'n'click fashion. The goal in each challenge is to prevent stuff from blowing up using available tools! You have only 20 seconds to save the day! Think quick!			"

												WOW SO WHACKEY XDDDDDD :DDDDDInstead of any actual gameplay, the game decides to go the Panic! route and make it entirely a trial-and-error switch puzzle. While Panic! did have some pretty amusing visuals and charm, McPixel just feels like it's trying too hard to be SO RANDUM LOL!!!Sadly, being a stupid kid growing up in this generation at the time of it's release, I fell victim to it and gave the developers money.Let us never speak of this again.

												Nah, I'd pass on this one. For five bucks you get a wonky lil' indie title that is a giant clickfest, but I suppose you could do worse. It is chalk full of potty humor which is generally not my deal. My biggest complaint with it is that the solutions almost never make any sense, like 'oh yeah put the hot dog in the fire extinguisher and then kick the lady'.Watch a few LetsPlays and you will most likely get your fill.

												 There's something that I think I should tell you all. I'm not feeling very well. And I haven't been for a while. Something inside me has jumped the track. I'm confused. I'm not thinking right. I'm not sleeping right. And I- Just don't think I am complaining about this or asking for your help. Because there's nothing anyone can do about it. It's just happened and that's all there is to it. But I don't know what I'm going to say from one minute to the next. I really don't. I don't know what I'm going to say and I don't know what I'm going to do. Do you understand that? And I know this is coming at a bad time for everyone but there's nothing I can do about that. I'm tired and I'm- I don't see things the way that I used to. Everything, everything, everything is ♥♥♥♥ing strange and it's all completely out of control and I'm frightened. And maybe if you all could give me some real help, you know? That would be- And not your pity or generosity but some help; Take a look at me. I know that I am ruining everything but I can't- If I don't say this now I may never say it. Everything is going very fast. It's going very, very fast. It's completely out of control. And if I don't say it today, tomorrow may be too late. I may be too crazy to even know how crazy I am. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. Something has happened to me and I'm very lost. And it doesn't stop. It's not getting better. I don't get better. I'm not getting better. It's just going on and it's going on. And there's nothing that I can do about it. It's not stopping. It's not stopping.

UI is confusing a balls, playing on a 42"" TV like 2 feet away, not good, music is worse than MARIO BROS, Unless you're easily entertained and have absolutely nothing better to do, like mow the yard, do the dishes, wash your car (if you have one) play fetch with your dog, chase the neighbors cat, spook the grandparents, go eat a bagle, make some popcorn, watch a movie, take a bath, go to the store, clean up your PC, check your phone, pawnder what else to type in here, continue reading this, ask yourself why you're reading this, ask yourself why you're asking yourself why you're reading this, continue to read this, want the minute or so back of your life that you've wasted on this, I already forgot where I was going with this, but it was still more entertaining than playing the game. hrm... I liked.... I liked.... seeing that it popped up in my game list for free? Until I realized that I couldn't get rid of it! lol. I disliked...that... hrm....

												Sorry, I didn't really care for this game. I didn't really get the humor, and that is definately what drives this game. Your goal is to stop a bomb hidden on the stage, so click on something and something will happen...maybe you'll win? I get the 80's TV trope of having mere seconds to stop a bomb being played out (and the name seems to be a ""Macguyver"" reference if I'm guessing right) but the humor fell flat for me. The game definately relies on a love of the absurd, and I could see it being a blast for some. If it's on sale or in a Humble Bundle, maybe give it a try if you are bored?			"

												What a piece of really boring game. Most of the gameplay is just clicking on things in random order, because trying to make sense of the situation to solve is hopeless. I cannot imagine someone who will find this enjoyable.			"

												How do you explain McPixel? Its a throw back game with clunky graphics and a repeating theme song that reminds me of Mario. Game play is simple point and click with limited choices.So how is it so AWESOME! Might be my favorite game from the sale. The game is even better played with friends. Its not multiplayer. Have some friends gather around a pc or laptop, take turns guessing the actions, and then laugh out loud at each other. This game will be a cult classic. Sooner or later some college kids will turn it into a drinking game and it will take off. I expected to not like the game, wanted to lurk for cards, and ended up LOVING IT!! It is not your typical game. I take it as a tongue in cheek game that does weird things. If you ever watched Perferct Hair Forever, and liked that show, you can love McPixel.Buy it. Expect nothing from it, Play it with other people. Prepare to laugh, groan, argue, and laugh more.  "

												7/10It's quite similar to Wario Ware (every level has a short time limit) except it's a little vulgar here and there.The humor and unexpected results are silly if not even ridiculous, but this game isn't supposed to be taken seriously anyway.Jump into a fire, get drunk and♥♥♥♥♥♥on an alien, kick the crap out of Pinocchio, get yourself caught in a Pokéball, anger Batman or focus on the main objective:DEFUSE THE DAMN BOMB! WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT SNOWBALL? WHY ARE YOU- oh, you threw it on the fuse, okay, well done, you saved the day.Also, failing IS an option, you still get to play through all levels.The ""campaign"" mode is pretty short and you'll finish it in 2 hours max, but there is some extra content that adds about the same amount of playtime.And of course you can replay your favorite chapters whenever you want.There even is a level editor (if you're one of those creative guys).

												First I want to start off with this. I didn't buy this game, my fiancé bought it for me after hearing what I said when I saw the trailer which was;""I don't get it.""So with that in mind... McPixel is annoying. Repetitive music and puzzles that truly don't make any sense. Dint try and use logic, it doesn't work. Sometimes the answer to the whole puzzle is to click on a small group of pixels that are utterly indistinguishable from any of the others.Keep your sanity, don't buy it.			"

												Right off the bat, McPixel is a giant vat of What the Hell, with its distorted and random sense of humor and rapid-fire pacing. If anything, it's what happens when Adult Swim makes a point-and-click version of WarioWare for the NES.Your goal is to prevent a bomb from exploding by clicking stuff. There are a ton of levels and a ton of ways to interact with things, but there is only one solution; the rest trigger failure. Levels are split into chunks of about 5-7 scenarios, and the game loops through them, moving onto the next one if you fail. There's never a sense of punishment for failing to stop the bomb, as trial and error are part of the experience.The game has a mix of low-brow humor and non-sequiteur humor, and while it only made me laugh a few times, in general it was all endearing and tolerable. Adding to the mix is that the game in general is pretty short; one hour tops to beat it and another hour tops to 100-percent it. On top of that you've got additional level packs and the ability to create your own levels. It's a steal at lower prices, and the short length means it never overstays its welcome.McPixel isn't exactly replayable, but it's enough for a very good one-off and its features, while few, are well-designed.

												MCPIXEL!!! *Does a little jig*This game is the perfect 5 minute bash of randomness everyone needs in their life, just as you think you've seen everything McPixel has to offer it is bound to surprise you. The game is based around short 20 second point and click puzzles which make almost no sense at all. For example there may be a bomb in a shop, how do you dispose of it? Yep, just as you thought you feed it to an old man and watch his stomach contain the explosion... On top of all this randomness the art style is great and the music is just top notch! For the cheap entry prize I can't recommend this enough, especially if you have some friends over who are looking for a laugh!			"

												Alot of the game is just randomness. But, if that's the kind of stuff you like then I HIGHLY recommend this game. However, if you already saw Pewdiepie or someone else play it, then there's really nothing here to spend you're money on because you'll get the same thing everytme you play it. The game would be more interesting to play if the right choices were logical and they made you think, but because this game is so random it's just a bunch of trial and error and eventually that stops being fun.

												McPixel is the kind of game that will cause you to just stare at the screen with only one thought in your head: ""What the ♥♥♥♥?""Ridicolously random, in every level you will need to save the world by defusing a deadly bomb. How, you ask? Well, you could stick up a cow's♥♥♥♥♥ hit an old guy in the balls so he picks it up and flies away with it, pee on aliens, hit batman with a frying pan, and... well, you get the idea.There is no pattern or logic behind the levels, neither any explaination. You just click on whatever's clickable and see if it's the right thing. Right? You saved the world! Wrong? You blew everything up. It's that simple.McPixel is not a bad game, but it is quite pointless. It is good for about an hour of giggling and randomness, but nothing more than that. It's obviously not meant to be serious, and I definately understand the humor behind it, but... it's just not good as a game. You just click stuff and see if things blow up or not, that's it.And with a price of $5... not really sure if it's worth.			"

												This game is not for the easly offended. I also would say that it's humor can be adult and crude at times. That being said, I still would recommend this games to older players. The point of the game is to find and disarm a bomb/explosion from going off. It's fast paced, only allowing 20 seconds per each 'stage'. A set of 5 stages per level in each chapter (chapter being made up of multiple levels). There are multiple endings per each stage, but only one true ending that ends with the explosion being disarmed. I won't spoil much more of the game, but if you like pixel art and enjoy adult humor then this game is for you. It's easy to pick up, but hard to put down.			"

												That bomb is about to go off! Quick, you have 20 seconds to... oops. Too late. No time to wait, on to the next disaster! That's McPixel, a strange, strange game that mixes point and click puzzling with WarioWare-styled miniature scenarios. With no time to think and only a handful of clicks, you need to figure out how to disarm the situation before it goes up in smoke. I found it to be a fun, if simple title that had me falling over laughing at the gags and secrets scattered about. It's not that complicated, and at times it's absolutely childish, but it manages to ooze personality. For only a couple of bucks, you can't really go wrong.			"

												Think of it as an indie version of the WarioWare series: Short and quirky, but worth the price and pretty funny. Each level has only one solution and many ways to interact with the level, so it may or may not take some time to find the solution. Whether or not you find the solution, you're bound to find some mishap going on in the environment, which may cause for some good laughs. If you want to access the bonus levels, you actually have to find every single gag in each level. Some have a couple, while some have a lot. But with the ""one click to conclusion"" mechanic in the game, it shouldn't take long to find every single gag. I completed this game in a little over three hours, which isn't so bad for $5. If you wanna continue playing, there's an Endless Mode, a level editor, and ""Free DLC,"" which is essentially user-made levels. If you don't wanna shell out for the full price, wait until a sale or a bundle comes along. But if you don't care, I say it's worth whatever price it's going for.			"

												Be forewarned, I am only through the first level of this game, but I am already hooked. This game is gloriously stupid, patently ridiculous, an absolutely hilarious. It's good enough to need three adverbs.You play as McPixel, I think, who is a MacGuyver/MacGruber type protagonist who only has thirty seconds to stop things from exploding. The gameplay is very simple point and click adventure style, the graphics are old school pixel art, and the music is something you expect from an Atari 2600 title, but all of it works perfectly together.The puzzles are simple, yet clever. It's worth getting them wrong just for the hilarity of the consequences. I've been slapped by Buddah, had a cow fall in love with me, fed a hot dog to a pot-smoking alien, and made a man poop dynamite in the span of five minutes. This game is absolutely worth $1.99. I haven't played long enough to know if it's worth the full price, but considering I've already laughed more at this than I would at most modern comedy movies in a theater, I'm going to tentatively say that yes. Yes it is. The developer has been really great about getting the word out about this game by giving out at least a couple hundred copies, and I really hope it pays off. I would definitely play more of his/her stuff.For a simple, funny, pick-up-an-go game, McPixel delivers. And then explodes. Often. I really can't overstate how many explosions you'll see in this game.			"

												Imagine WarioWare if it was point and click game from like, the 80s. You control the titular mcpixel in what appears to be the climax of every action movie imaginable. Well, every action movie that involves a ticking bomb anyway. To ""save the day"" as this little game puts it, you interact with the world around you until you simultaneously locate and neutralize the explosives. If you screw up, you're dropped in, pants or not, another puzzle, barely given enough time to register what went wrong, kinda like college. Succed and you're rewarded with a shiny square, also just like college. Screw up on the same task in every way possible and you'll get an even shinier gold square, just like politics.What makes this game stand out from the ""minigame army"" genre is that McPixel is so completely insane, marvel wants to give him a healing factor. You could make the most innocuous maneuver and McP could start pummeling a child with a toilet or something. No, that in particular does not happen, surprisingly. What does happen is frenching the President, kicking basically everyone in the groin and convincing an American soldier you're his superior by stealing his hatThe five bucks this game costs is about what you'd pay for a dirty joke book or something like that and that's essentially the sort of entertainment you'll get out of this game. Crude, tasteless but you can't help but laugh every so often.			"

												If you cross a point and click adventure with Warioware you would probably end up with this. A fun little game that ends up killing way more time then it should for me. Its quirky and hilarious.  However I find the 5 dollar price tag a bit high for what essentailly ends up being a collection of short minigames.  If you can get it on sale I recommend it.			"

												Basically Warioware as a point-and-click adventure game where you need to stop something from exploding, and it's not always obvious WHAT is going to explode. It's wacky, zany nonsense-filled comedy gameplay, which means it's best not to play too much at one time. High-octane comedy has a habit of getting old if you don't take breaks.Two big issues I have with it: first, there's a handful of rules that aren't really explained. Once you pick up an item, there's no way to put it down, and you can't hold more then one item. If you click on something that causes you to do something - ANYTHING other than pick an item up - the stage ends, whether or not the effect did anything about the bomb of the level.The other issue: your reward for 100% completion is a really crappy final bonus level. Everything else was really fun, but this one level left a very bad taste in my mouth afterwards.I'd recommend picking up this game, but as you can see, I beat everything in 9 hours, and I think 2 of those hours were just me loitering in the ""chatroom"" waiting for someone else to show up. Hard to say if $5 is worth that, but then, how bad can you really waste $5?			"

I honestly can't stop doing the actions that involves harming the ladies though as it's funny as hell xD ((Wow that sounded alot worse then I meant for it...))Anyway, the music is actually pretty good, very catchy.

												McPixel is best described as a trial and error based point and click adventure. The humor isn't very sophisticated and centers mostly around kicking, humping and blowing things up. It's just the right thing to air out the brain for 5 minutes and enter a state of braindeadedded bliss. There isn't much else to say, the story mode doesn't really feature a story, you go around clicking through screens till you've found all possible endings - that's it. As a bonus there are some ""free DLCs"" which are hit-or-miss, a endless mode, which basically repeates the screens of the story mode and a ""fart along"" feature, which is amusing for a minute, but not particularly noteworth. It is amusing if you can enjoy crude, simple humor. It only costs 4€ and at that price I'd would buy it again. I loved it.			"

												Basically Warioware as a point-and-click adventure game where you need to stop something from exploding, and it's not always obvious WHAT is going to explode. It's wacky, zany nonsense-filled comedy gameplay, which means it's best not to play too much at one time. High-octane comedy has a habit of getting old if you don't take breaks.Two big issues I have with it: first, there's a handful of rules that aren't really explained. Once you pick up an item, there's no way to put it down, and you can't hold more then one item. If you click on something that causes you to do something - ANYTHING other than pick an item up - the stage ends, whether or not the effect did anything about the bomb of the level.The other issue: your reward for 100% completion is a really crappy final bonus level. Everything else was really fun, but this one level left a very bad taste in my mouth afterwards.I'd recommend picking up this game, but as you can see, I beat everything in 9 hours, and I think 2 of those hours were just me loitering in the ""chatroom"" waiting for someone else to show up. Hard to say if $5 is worth that, but then, how bad can you really waste $5?			"

												""The WarioWare of point-and-click adventure games"" pretty much sums it up. It has a silly, juvenile sense of humor, and you never know or can be prepared for what's coming next, and it'll often take a few tries to even figure out what's going on so you can solve a level, but it rotates through half a dozen at a time so you can keep them fresh in your memory while also not bashing your head against the same one repeatedly. It's amusing enough to go through the base game, which is only an hour and a half, but I didn't bother with the dozens (hundreds?) of bonus levels or DLC or other extras. That was enough for me.			"

												McPixel is a hilarious game in every sense of the word. While the actual gameplay may come off as ""randomly pick the right choice,"" The real eye catcher with McPixel is just seeing how many wacky and unexpected scenarios that can unfold when you interact with items and characters. The graphics are depicted as sort of a crude 8-bit design, but that actually works to the game's comedic and random standpoint. And of course the ever present free DLC adds even more comedy and chaos to what is already an outrageous game.You'll come in for the seemingly impossible challenges, but you'll stay for the laughs and hijynx.

												This is a weird ""game"". Most of the puzzles make no sense at all, so the only option is to try everything until the level succeeds. The point of the game is that every interaction is completely unexpected and funny.There are usually from 3 to 5 objects in one level and about one of them can be picked up and used for interacting with the rest of the objects. One or two interactions can take place on each level until you either win or lose it. A typical puzzle goes like this: you are in a plane with a nuclear bomb, a snake and a shovel. If you click the bomb, the snake tries to eat it but cannot, because it's too big. If you click the snake, it bites you and the bomb explodes meanwhile. The solution is to pick up the shovel and then click the bomb, at which point McPixel uses the shovel to shove the bomb down the snake's throat (if snakes can be said to have throats), and then the bomb safely explodes in the snake's belly.

Its a very dirty game, lots of toilet humor. The graphics are pretty good, sometimes the colors are weird and you aren't able to see things because of extremely subtle shading.

												It is embarrassing to see this game rated 76/100. It is not worth more than 1h of gameplay...there is not even a gameplay and you have to random click around and see what happens. Even with the 75% discount (with wich i bought it) I DON'T reccomend it.Look around for better games than this one			"

												Right off the bat, McPixel is a giant vat of What the Hell, with its distorted and random sense of humor and rapid-fire pacing. If anything, it's what happens when Adult Swim makes a point-and-click version of WarioWare for the NES.Your goal is to prevent a bomb from exploding by clicking stuff. There are a ton of levels and a ton of ways to interact with things, but there is only one solution; the rest trigger failure. Levels are split into chunks of about 5-7 scenarios, and the game loops through them, moving onto the next one if you fail. There's never a sense of punishment for failing to stop the bomb, as trial and error are part of the experience.The game has a mix of low-brow humor and non-sequiteur humor, and while it only made me laugh a few times, in general it was all endearing and tolerable. Adding to the mix is that the game in general is pretty short; one hour tops to beat it and another hour tops to 100-percent it. On top of that you've got additional level packs and the ability to create your own levels. It's a steal at lower prices, and the short length means it never overstays its welcome.McPixel isn't exactly replayable, but it's enough for a very good one-off and its features, while few, are well-designed.

												McPixel is a spoof to the games of the 80's with a touch of adult humor. The plot is as simple as it seems, you trek through various levels to stop explosions from occuring. The cycle of traveling through the games repeat itself until you successfully beaten the challenge at stake. The parodies used in the levels are funny and the music is very catchy. If you like to play a game paying tribute to the games of 8 bit era, then give this one a shot.			"

												Alot of the game is just randomness. But, if that's the kind of stuff you like then I HIGHLY recommend this game. However, if you already saw Pewdiepie or someone else play it, then there's really nothing here to spend you're money on because you'll get the same thing everytme you play it. The game would be more interesting to play if the right choices were logical and they made you think, but because this game is so random it's just a bunch of trial and error and eventually that stops being fun.

The puzzels are awesome, the free DLCs are good to keep the lenght of the game and the main story is... well, I don't even have to say it. Graphics are fine, old school, etc.I truly recommend this for anyone who wants a unique experience and anyone who wants to be a cooler McGyver (and a more realistic one, for that matter!)			"

												McPixel was the best 3 hours I've spent playing a video game in a real long time.Note the time there, 3 hours. To do everything. 100% of the things. So bear that in mind before spending your money on it.Buy it on sale, you won't regret it.Also I can totally play the songs on the soundtrack on bass, it's pretty great. The soundtrack is one of the best things about this game, even if it is literally just 3 songs over and over again.The guy saying Mc-Pix-El at the start is the best part of the game.			"

												McPixel is pretty short but quite funny if you enjoy raunchy nonsense.Definitely not everyone's sense of humour but I can't imagine anyone being that upset about the price tag. That is, if it were on sale. I believe the regular price on this game is $5 at the moment  and if you want to support the developer that's your prerogative. My advice would be to spend less than that on it though.Each level is a different scenario that puts the responsibility of preventing an explosive from detonating (or equivalent disaster). A mouse only game, you click on one of the various items in the scenario, McPixel interacts with it, and you hope for the best. The humour usually lies in what happens if McPixel DOESN'T prevent the disaster.There are several levels to play through and in each one two endings to aim for, either a win or specifically funny outcome. The whole game can be completed in a relatively short sitting, maybe 3 hours of straight play. I wouldn't recommend this though since the quickly moving and sometimes flashing backgrounds can be hard on the eyes. The music can also become grating since it repeats mostly the same one track. A saving grace may be that the first time you hear that track you will probably like it.In summation it is a fun experience and I would recommend this to a friend who isn't offended by the idea of a man pleasuring a giraffe to completion. Still, the $5 price tag may cause buyers remorse especially if you don't smile at the idea of manual giraffe gratification. Buy it for less. "

												Mcpixel is one of those games that has no other place in existence for any other reason but for the sake of entertainment. You'll never find yourself frustrated if you can't beat a level, just amused at the weird things this character thinks will difuse a bomb. If nothing else, Mcpixel does a lot of things no other game does. Doubt me? Find one other video game in the world where you can intervene in the fight between Luke and Vader, fight sub-zero, blow up Earth, stop the sinking of the Titanic, and meet the devil.			"

I felt like I also had to force-click through some levels, there's no cleverness or such, most of it is just bizarree. I guess it's providing a point that some point & click can be like this, but they did provide more fun than going through it on this one.I guess it's well worth under quid but that's it. it's not bad bad game by any means, just I was expecting something humourous and I don't think it's for me.

Each puzzle has several gag endings (in addition to the ""correct"" one), finding them all unlocks new levels. (There's only a few things to click on so it doesn't take that long.)

												LOL, ROFL. This game is a point and click adventure with a great sense of humor. If this game refunded every person that didn't laugh at least once through a play through they would nearly never have to issue a refund. The game is based more on luck than logic; though, the cut scenes that debunk your logical decisions are much of the premise of the humor.The game takes roughly 1-2 hours to 100% the story (depending on how many cut scenes you skip) and about an hour to 100% the 10 free dlc courses (more should be coming soon). Additionally, if you feel at any point that this game is too easy to 100% go play Nerdpack in the dlc and try to 100% it :P. The game doesn't have much replay value after the initial play through, but between endless mode and new dlc there is still the potential. For the price of this game it is a great deal. "

												MCPIXEL!!! *Does a little jig*This game is the perfect 5 minute bash of randomness everyone needs in their life, just as you think you've seen everything McPixel has to offer it is bound to surprise you. The game is based around short 20 second point and click puzzles which make almost no sense at all. For example there may be a bomb in a shop, how do you dispose of it? Yep, just as you thought you feed it to an old man and watch his stomach contain the explosion... On top of all this randomness the art style is great and the music is just top notch! For the cheap entry prize I can't recommend this enough, especially if you have some friends over who are looking for a laugh!			"

												This Game Is Hilarious with many references to anime and other videogames. The Game has 4 chapters each with 4 levels. The game also comes with an endless mode which has every single level endlessly repeating. The bonus modes are hilarious and the game has a free DLC mode in which people can upload their own levels made with the level creator in which you get from getting gold in every scenario  in chapter 1. The game is essentially endless for $5.00 and one of my favourite steam games.			"

												McPixel was the best 3 hours I've spent playing a video game in a real long time.Note the time there, 3 hours. To do everything. 100% of the things. So bear that in mind before spending your money on it.Buy it on sale, you won't regret it.Also I can totally play the songs on the soundtrack on bass, it's pretty great. The soundtrack is one of the best things about this game, even if it is literally just 3 songs over and over again.The guy saying Mc-Pix-El at the start is the best part of the game.			"

												If you've ever played one of the  Wario Ware or Four Second Frenzy flash games, imagine that in a point-and-click adventure framework with a sense of humor like Spongebob without an age rating limitation. Add explosions every few seconds, and BOOM you get McPixel. It's pretty fun as something of a series of mini-cartoons your first time through levels, and it's good as a microgames style challenge if you challenge Endless Mode.There's free DLC (both user-made and official), a level editor, and a number of unlockables as you go. Definitely worth playing if you like a healthy dose of silly. (And there is an official free version that's not on Steam if you go looking for it and just want to try the game.)			"

												Humor is a bit crude, but it always catches you off guard and rarely gets old (except when trying for gold solutions).

												McPixel is funny in the way that fart jokes and poop are. You'll be surprised at what the game does, as it gleefully has you pee, vomit, and crap your way through puzzles. The Warioware-styled ""minigames"" are extremely varied and creative, although at times you'll wonder what you actually did that solved the problem. Somewhere along the way, you'll find yourself amused by the antics of this red-shirted public urinator, and McPixel really is a fairly clever game underneath its bawdy exterior.			"

												McPixel is funny, random, and usually nonsensical fun times in game form.McPixel is also incredibly short, has almost no replay value, and is ultimately forgetable for $5 (compared to the $3 it goes for on the iOS).You can literally get the full experience by watching it on Youtube. The extra features you get by finding every possible ending to a level don't really add anything to the game. There is a level editor though so take that as you will.McPixel just feels better off as a free flash game than a full length (ha) purchase. And that's why I have trouble justifying purchasing it.

												I'm assuming McPixel is some sort of parody of MacGyver. It's point and click, and the goal of the game is to figure out how to prevent a bomb from blowing up the level. It's not a real puzzle game because the game has no logic. The whole game is just stupid and silly and full of toilet humor. The only way to win is through trial and error. It's more or less just a joke game of seemingly endless parodies and nonsensical solutions. If dumb is your style, you can't get much dumber than McPixel.			"

												This is just another insane game I own, and it was well worth the money. It feels like a throw back for me to the old C64 games (Yes, I had a C128 that played C64 games), which makes it highly enjoyable for me. The game is VERY challenging and things you think will work to disarm the bomb do not always work. You may find yourself wanting to rage quit at parts, but then you get ove rit and laugh at how stupid the answer to disarming the bomb was. To me, McPixel was worth every penny! Plus the free DLC in the game is a riot!			"

												The dumbest game ever made... In the best way imaginable.There are four chapters. each broken up into 3 rounds, and each round containing a handful of levels. In each level there's a bomb and you have thirty seconds to defuse it. This is harder then it seems though, because the world of McPixel makes no sense whatsoever. Depending on the level, diffusing the bomb can be accomplished by peeing on it, feeding it to a stoned alien, or sacrificing yourself to a volcano god. The only way to know what to do on any given level is trial and error, but that's the name of the game: exploration! It's always hilarious to see what happens next. A great game for someone with a super off-beat sense of humor with ten minutes to kill here and there.			"

												Oh, Mcpixel, Mcpixel, Mcpixel, why are you so weird? This is honestly the 2nd weirdest game I have ever played (the 1st being the WarioWare games)! Mcpixel is an obscure, weird-♥♥♥ little Indie game where the goal is to neutralize a hidden bomb within 20 seconds, but also to f**k around and see all the weird options you can choose between peeing on a bomb, face-palming yourself with a hot-dog, standing over a fire with a ukulele to make a rain dance, inserting a light-saber into your mouth and then hover (don't you dare make a joke about that), to mutating Mario, to noticing the Space Core from Portal 2 in the background, to making PewDiePie rage after he stares at a barrel, to lip-locking Obama...........Did I mention this game is weird? But hey, that's what makes this such an awesome game: It's weird! There's even a mini game where the goal is to literally fart to the tune....EAT YOUR HEART OUT, GUITAR HERO!!!!! Trust me, it's easier to see what I mean when you actually play it rather than just hear me talk about it. So go! Play it! It's awesome! Stop reading this and go play it!.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................YOU GUYS ARE STILL HERE?!?!?!?!?!?!?

I'm not entirely sure there's one puzzle that actually makes sense, which is what I like about it. It's a great game to just unwind to. Just click and watch the stupidity fill up the screen.The only problem I find with the game is the music can get irritating after awhile.

												This is probably the strangest game I have played in a long time. It's not BAD, but it doesn't really have a story, your goal is the same for every level.  I would recommend this game as something to kill time, but if you want more substance to the game, this may not be what you're looking for.			"

												McPixel is the kind of game that will cause you to just stare at the screen with only one thought in your head: ""What the ♥♥♥♥?""Ridicolously random, in every level you will need to save the world by defusing a deadly bomb. How, you ask? Well, you could stick up a cow's♥♥♥♥♥ hit an old guy in the balls so he picks it up and flies away with it, pee on aliens, hit batman with a frying pan, and... well, you get the idea.There is no pattern or logic behind the levels, neither any explaination. You just click on whatever's clickable and see if it's the right thing. Right? You saved the world! Wrong? You blew everything up. It's that simple.McPixel is not a bad game, but it is quite pointless. It is good for about an hour of giggling and randomness, but nothing more than that. It's obviously not meant to be serious, and I definately understand the humor behind it, but... it's just not good as a game. You just click stuff and see if things blow up or not, that's it.And with a price of $5... not really sure if it's worth.			"

I don't get it, but if you like nonsensical puzzles, this could be your thing.The pop-culture references are alright (lots of games, movies, TV shows), the graphics and music have their own retro charm, but I just couldn't get into it. It is generally pretty easy to make me laugh, and I like some pretty stupid humor, but MCPixel didn't get as much as a chuckle from me. Lots of shoving stuff up butts, beating peope with random objects, dry humping random objects. That sort of stuff.I played enough to get 100% on all four parts of all four chapters. Not sure why, but I did. Didn't play many of the user packs, but there are plenty to choose from.			"

Etched into the side is ""INSERT VIRGIN"" You are faced with a bone, a cow, and a woman. You have 20 seconds to save the day.Option 1: I click the bone, then the cow: McPixel inserts the bone into the cow. The cow emits hearts. The volcano blows up.Option 2: I click the bone, then the woman: McPixel shakes the bone at the woman like she is a dog, then turns and throws the bone into the volcano. The woman leaps after the bone into the lava. The volcano blows up.Option 3: I click on the volcano. McPixel throws himself into the lava. The day is saved.If that didn't make you want to buy this game, then nothing will.			"

												A perfect sorbet to cleanse the palate between mind-wrenchers, McPixel is the ultimate in un-puzzle games. Straddling the fine line between Zen and Beavis-and-Butthead-grade toilet humor, McPixel throws you into a high-speed gauntlet of idiotic scenarios, almost all of which involve some manner of high explosive about to go off. Using every resource available (examples of which include dynamite, cows, balloons, vodka, firearms, more dynamite, and an endless supply of kicks to the groin), you must disarm the danger within 20 seconds and save the day. Or, failing that, die in a hilarious and moronic way.Separating it from the usual Wario Ware clone, there's little logic to any of the game's many stages; more often than not you'll muddle your way through by clicking random things and getting lucky. When an actual sense of challenge DOES arise, it's usually due to the necessary key object being barely visible. What saves McPixel from being a completely unjustified waste of time is the fact that it's one of the funniest casual titles you're going to find anywhere. Admittedly, it's extremely low-brow, but my first time playing it basically amounted to 3 hours of near-brainless clicking broken up by a constant stream of disgusted, wonderful laughter. Somehow, the combination of Gary Larson-style cows and humans rendered in 8-bit graphics with 4th grade toilet humor works amazingly well, and after clearing each level correctly I had no problem going back and trying to find every idiotic failure cutscene in order to achieve a 100% completion. It's not the sort of game you'll want to discuss with coworkers around the (likely to explode) water cooler, but sometimes you just need to shut your brain off and laugh as some jerk kicks Batman in the nards a few dozen times, y'know?

												A very silly and simple game, the entire objective of each level is to find the bomb hidden within 5-10 seconds in order to prevent it from going off. Unfortunately this means this game is entirely trial and error, you have to click on various things in the background and hope that it somehow relates to the bomb being disposed of, and sometimes the solution is incredibly unclear. Some of the jokes are hit and miss and definitely aren't for everyone, but if you are looking for a silly game, McPixel is certainly worth the asking price, especially with the free DLC added.			"

												Be forewarned, I am only through the first level of this game, but I am already hooked. This game is gloriously stupid, patently ridiculous, an absolutely hilarious. It's good enough to need three adverbs.You play as McPixel, I think, who is a MacGuyver/MacGruber type protagonist who only has thirty seconds to stop things from exploding. The gameplay is very simple point and click adventure style, the graphics are old school pixel art, and the music is something you expect from an Atari 2600 title, but all of it works perfectly together.The puzzles are simple, yet clever. It's worth getting them wrong just for the hilarity of the consequences. I've been slapped by Buddah, had a cow fall in love with me, fed a hot dog to a pot-smoking alien, and made a man poop dynamite in the span of five minutes. This game is absolutely worth $1.99. I haven't played long enough to know if it's worth the full price, but considering I've already laughed more at this than I would at most modern comedy movies in a theater, I'm going to tentatively say that yes. Yes it is. The developer has been really great about getting the word out about this game by giving out at least a couple hundred copies, and I really hope it pays off. I would definitely play more of his/her stuff.For a simple, funny, pick-up-an-go game, McPixel delivers. And then explodes. Often. I really can't overstate how many explosions you'll see in this game.			"

												Have you ever played a game where nothing made sense? That is exactly what McPixel is all about! This point-and-click adventure has one objective in every stage: Save the Day! Stop disaster's from happening by interacting with the world with the help of McPixel, a wacky character who's thought process is about as logical as 3+3=kick-the-bomb! Sometimes to save the day, you need to do crazy things that make no sense, but this game will keep you laughing all day! For a very small price, this game delivers more than enough laughs to keep you coming back (especially since the game has a menu for getting free DLC). PS. I learned the hard way, do NOT play this in a quiet setting (library or classroom).			"

												Basically Warioware as a point-and-click adventure game where you need to stop something from exploding, and it's not always obvious WHAT is going to explode. It's wacky, zany nonsense-filled comedy gameplay, which means it's best not to play too much at one time. High-octane comedy has a habit of getting old if you don't take breaks.Two big issues I have with it: first, there's a handful of rules that aren't really explained. Once you pick up an item, there's no way to put it down, and you can't hold more then one item. If you click on something that causes you to do something - ANYTHING other than pick an item up - the stage ends, whether or not the effect did anything about the bomb of the level.The other issue: your reward for 100% completion is a really crappy final bonus level. Everything else was really fun, but this one level left a very bad taste in my mouth afterwards.I'd recommend picking up this game, but as you can see, I beat everything in 9 hours, and I think 2 of those hours were just me loitering in the ""chatroom"" waiting for someone else to show up. Hard to say if $5 is worth that, but then, how bad can you really waste $5?			"

												McPixel is a point-and-click adventure game. Sort of. The basic premise is that you have 20 seconds to defuse a bomb in each scenario, with various things you can click on to get various outcomes. However, there are some real problems with it:1) There is no logic to the solution. It's really annoying as it's just trial and error until you get the right solution, which gets really dull really fast. 2) One of points of the game is it's humour. Except it's really not very funny. It's just ""gags"" most of which involve McPixel hitting or grabbing something and then dying 'comically'. It's just stupid, and not even in a ridiculous cartoon humour way. I played most of the 1st chapter and in that whole time there was one joke that I found remotely amusing.Admittedly, I gave up on the game relatively early on, so it may get better later on, but I really don't think that's much of a selling point. I guess the best thing I can say about it is that it's really cheap, but there are far better free games out there, so again, that hardly works in the game's favour. Even at the low price, it's hard to recommend it. I paid about 50p for it in a sale, and even at that price, I feel like it's only just worth it. Overall, give this a miss, and spend your money on something better.			"

												This game is not for the easly offended. I also would say that it's humor can be adult and crude at times. That being said, I still would recommend this games to older players. The point of the game is to find and disarm a bomb/explosion from going off. It's fast paced, only allowing 20 seconds per each 'stage'. A set of 5 stages per level in each chapter (chapter being made up of multiple levels). There are multiple endings per each stage, but only one true ending that ends with the explosion being disarmed. I won't spoil much more of the game, but if you like pixel art and enjoy adult humor then this game is for you. It's easy to pick up, but hard to put down.			"

												On the surface it seems like the most stupidest game in the world.  Logic be damned, the solutions to saving the day vary to pure luck the first time you try each scenario.  But it's the lack of logic and comic reactions that blow your mind and makes you laugh.  Aside from the first four sets, it has plenty of player-made content to get your money's worth (and if it goes on sale at 80% off or in another Humble Bundle, even better!)  It's worth a playthrough in short little doses to lighten up your mood.			"

												Nonsensical WarioWare wannabe on crack for the PC?Juvenile and pointed deconstruction of the point and click adventure genre?Maybe both?Maybe just nonsense for the sake of nonsense? Me and my significant other burned through McPixel's Story Mode, most of the hidden stages unlocked by finding all the gags, and all available free DLC in about two hours in one night, and odds are you will too. There isn't a lot to McPixel's design other than finding absurd solutions to each 20-second stage and watching the solutions or failures play out. One or two clicks will be enough to know if you've succeeded or failed, and there's really not a lot of logic to what you'll be doing and interactions are rarely ever what you'd expect. The humor may be a bit to juvenile for some and the overall premise far too simplistic to warrant a full-price purchase, but I've honestly spent two hours entertaining myself with much worse than than the otherwordly silliness this pixelated and crude mess has to offer.

												I am both satisfied and disappointed by McPixel.I watched few gameplays some time ago and thought it is a pretty dumb game. But I eventually ended up buying it in a sale and decided to play it, since I didn´t remember any of the solutions.What suprised me and what I really appreciate is humor in the game. I actually laughed hard about some of the gags and the end got me completely. It might seem like if it had stupid humor for wierd people, but the fact that it´s so straightforward and unbridled makes it very enjoyable experience for those with at least some sense of humor.What kills the fun, unfortunately, is poor design of some of the levels. Chapters 1-3 are generally good, but Chapter 4 feels sometimes too random, with solutions making no sense as well as gags with no inspiration. DLC is where true fun completely disappears, where the gameplay becomes just a random click-fest and gags are mostly recycled from the story mode (but it´s a free DLC, so one can´t complain too much about that).McPixel also contains some extras - tried them - didn´t like them. What´s nice is that you can create your own levels, with customized backgrounds, items and gags. Sadly, you can´t share them whenever you want. Steam workshop could be really nice here, but I suppose there is some reason devs don´t want players to publish levels without control.Endless mode is just a revisitation of story mode levels and that means McPixel lacks replayability for most of the playerbase.I´m unsure if I can recommend the game. For me, it was more enjoyable then disappointing afterall, but not everyone will enjoy it. If you are interested, check few minutes of some gameplay and if you are still not decided after that, leave it or wait for some decent discount.***** 6/10***** 60% "

												A very silly and simple game, the entire objective of each level is to find the bomb hidden within 5-10 seconds in order to prevent it from going off. Unfortunately this means this game is entirely trial and error, you have to click on various things in the background and hope that it somehow relates to the bomb being disposed of, and sometimes the solution is incredibly unclear. Some of the jokes are hit and miss and definitely aren't for everyone, but if you are looking for a silly game, McPixel is certainly worth the asking price, especially with the free DLC added.			"

Each puzzle has several gag endings (in addition to the ""correct"" one), finding them all unlocks new levels. (There's only a few things to click on so it doesn't take that long.)

												It's silly, it's fast, it's highly and overtly referential, while also somehow (mostly) making pixel hunting sort of entertaining. If you're interested in an absurd, light point and click adventure game, you can't exactly go wrong here. Simply go in expecting to have to retry puzzles several times as you try to click everything to figure out the bizarre logic of the game, but absolutely don't expect any sort of cohesive, profound stories here. This is a silly absurd romp for those times when you want to see ridiculous things unfold without having to bear through loads of story setup or progression, and in that it's sort of wonderful. It's also somewhat replayable with a few hidden things in each area, as I recall, but these never struck me as worth going after.			"

												TL/DR - On it's own terms, I'd give it a 8/10 with a 6/10 overall.  NTL/R:Gather round, children, and I'll tell you a tell of gaming in the year of our lord nineteen hundred and eigthy four.  You see, back then, games HAD to rely on uniqueness to stand out.  Some where unique by having great graphics, others through innovative game play, while still others by challenge and re-playability.  In this age there came a game, on an ancient machine known only as a C64, a game called ""Cliff Hanger"".  It had the audacity to stand out by having something of a sense of humour and somewhat hazy rules that you had to suss out through exploration.   Comprised of a ""scene"", each level had to be explored and the rules and ways of beating it had to be discovered.  Failure simply meant that you watched fail animation that kind of made you smile.  And then this idea was lost to time, not quite enough to become legend, not too little to be utterly forgotten by those who were there.Lost, that is, until now.McPixel is a game about failure.  It's a game about exploration, and, ultimately, a game that you will step away from glad that you bought it.  The humour is on point, the presentation is solid, the music is engaging, and game play in interesting; it is worth the money the dev is charging.  It's not going to affect you, or change how you see gaming or narriative, or any of this, it's just solid, fun, silly game play.Pros----- The graphical style is great retro-inspired chunky pixels- It's pretty comical, with surprising outcomes for various actions- Simple, stupid, funCons------ Once you've beaten it, you're probably not going back- It's definitely not for everyone.  Hardcores will probably not enjoy it at all.There's really not much more to be said about it.  On it's own terms, I'd give it a 8/10.			"

												I'm about to describe a solution to a level, but I feel it is the only way to really appreciate the humor, weirdness and wonderful options you have in this game.You are standing on the edge of a volcano. Etched into the side is ""INSERT VIRGIN"" You are faced with a bone, a cow, and a woman. You have 20 seconds to save the day.Option 1: I click the bone, then the cow: McPixel inserts the bone into the cow. The cow emits hearts. The volcano blows up.Option 2: I click the bone, then the woman: McPixel shakes the bone at the woman like she is a dog, then turns and throws the bone into the volcano. The woman leaps after the bone into the lava. The volcano blows up.Option 3: I click on the volcano. McPixel throws himself into the lava. The day is saved.If that didn't make you want to buy this game, then nothing will.			"

												Very short game that, as a game, fails rather gloriously since it relies on little more than trial & error as you merely click on objects to interact with them. Most of the time it is simply impossible to foresee what might come from clicking on any given object, but this is also where the frun comes from.Most outcomes are plain absurd and while some gags are rather puerile, they are thrown at you at such a high pace you won't be able to resist smiling.Despite a high death count the game also manages to never be frustrating as dieing means nothing more than losing maybe five seconds and is rewarded with another silly death animation.McPixel is a unique experience I'd recommend to anyone to at least try for themselves.

												This is a weird ""game"". Most of the puzzles make no sense at all, so the only option is to try everything until the level succeeds. The point of the game is that every interaction is completely unexpected and funny.There are usually from 3 to 5 objects in one level and about one of them can be picked up and used for interacting with the rest of the objects. One or two interactions can take place on each level until you either win or lose it. A typical puzzle goes like this: you are in a plane with a nuclear bomb, a snake and a shovel. If you click the bomb, the snake tries to eat it but cannot, because it's too big. If you click the snake, it bites you and the bomb explodes meanwhile. The solution is to pick up the shovel and then click the bomb, at which point McPixel uses the shovel to shove the bomb down the snake's throat (if snakes can be said to have throats), and then the bomb safely explodes in the snake's belly.

												It's silly, it's fast, it's highly and overtly referential, while also somehow (mostly) making pixel hunting sort of entertaining. If you're interested in an absurd, light point and click adventure game, you can't exactly go wrong here. Simply go in expecting to have to retry puzzles several times as you try to click everything to figure out the bizarre logic of the game, but absolutely don't expect any sort of cohesive, profound stories here. This is a silly absurd romp for those times when you want to see ridiculous things unfold without having to bear through loads of story setup or progression, and in that it's sort of wonderful. It's also somewhat replayable with a few hidden things in each area, as I recall, but these never struck me as worth going after.			"

There are no lives, you just keep playing until you figure it out. Rather entertaining. No depth... but bevis and butthead was a damn good show....Nuff' said.			"

												In a nutshell, it's WarioWare meets MacGyver, and it's just as amazing and wacky as it sounds. The game strives on its nonsensical humor and absurd puzzles, which encourage trying multiple solutions. It's somewhat short, but every bit of it is enjoyable, and chances are you'll want to replay levels once you've beaten them. Also worth mentioning that it has free DLC and a level creator, as well as trading cards!			"
