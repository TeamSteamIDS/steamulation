												Take one part Faerie Solitaire and two parts Puzzle Quest and mix in a little Poker or Yahtzee for good measure and you will get something like Runespell: Overture. You're a changeling of some sort and you fight monsters and take quests in exchange for coin and buffs (which come in the form of power-up cards). There's a story but it's not the strongest element in the game. Like the Puzzle Quest games, your battles are determined by playing a mini-game. Instead of match-3 though, the game is a card game similar to poker in which making certain combinations of cards (pairs, 5 of a kind, full house, flush, straight) will do a certain amount of damage to your opponent, who is trying to do the same to you.  The ability to steal some cards from your opponent, plus the limited number of moves you get per turn to move cards or play power-ups adds just enough strategy to the game to keep it interesting.Admittedly, the game can get a bit repetitive after a while and I found the dialogue options to be a bit tedious but fortunately the game allows you to skip them if you want. It's an easy game to learn, and it's an entertaining casual game to play. It seems to be pretty short and the achievements don't seem too difficult to collect if that's your thing.  Finding little gems like this is the reason I buy bundles.			"

												Runespell: Overture is a decent and enjoyable game. The story plays out as a fantasy adventure, your character being oblivious to his past and must do battles with numerous foes to advance, making allies and doing quests along the way. The game play is somewhat unique, using a combination of battle and magic cards to attack your foe. One earns points by creating sets of 5 traditional cards (ace-king: hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs), using rules akin to poker, ie (pairs, 3 or 4 of a kind, straights, flushes, full house etc.). Better hands are worth more attack points (eg. full house > 2 pair). Cards are laid out in columns of which the top card can be taken to make a set, including your opponent's. Meaning strategy is important in order to create the best possible hands while trying to prevent the opponent from doing the same.The game is simple to play once you know the rules, and can be a good way to spend half an hour or so. Battles can be hard at times but with perseverance the game is not too difficult to beat, I finished it with about 9 hours of game play. I would enjoy a sequel to continue the story as it did seem unfinished at the conclusion. At a discount price the game is worth a shot, if you like card and/or poker-like games. 6.5/10			"

												Why don't they make more games like this?!Simple card playing mechanic that's fun and addicting. Then you have a vaguely interesting storyline that your character has to make his way through.If you like Puzzle Quest (1st one), you'll love this game! Seriously, they need more games like this!

												Runespell: Overture melds together classic RPG components with Windows Live's player-vs-player solitaire with poker.  I obtained Runespell for free in a pile of coal during the Steam Holiday Sale 2011 event.  Receiving the game for free, I simply assumed that Runespell was merely a terrible, no-name title that was not worth playing.  It was not until the Summer 2013 that I truly realized what I had come across.Runespell sports a great soundtrack with honestly a decent storyline.  Often times, card games that try to incorporate RPG elements (or just a storyline) end up drowning out the added components with the basic mechanics the card game - Runespell does not do this.  If you are a cards-only enthusiast, this may stray a little too far from those roots; if you are an RPG-only enthusaist, this may feel more like a card game.  However, if you are willing try a game that can have both, Runespell: Overture is for you.Verdict: While Runespell: Overture is far from a lump of coal turned into a diamond, but it is definitely a gem.  Simply put, Runespell is a fun, player-vs-computer, RPG, solitaire, poker game - and it is done very well.  The game is so enjoyable that I honestly look forward to a remake or sequel that would incorporated online cooperative and competitive gameplay features.  While it is definitely not worth $10, the current sale of $2 at the time of this review is definitely worth looking into.  Here you will find a game that successfully feels like an RPG, while feeling like a card game.			"

												Runespell Overture (Card/Poker/RPG/Strategy Hybrid)For options we have Graphics Quality (Fastest, Fast, Simple, Good, Beautiful, and Fantastic), Windowed or Fullscreen, Drag and Drop or Click and Click (when moving cards around), and Sounds (Music and SFX).  You can also choose a screen resolution anywhere from 640x480 to 1920x1080.The tutorial is very well-done, teaching you the ropes without being annoying.So what kind of game is this?  It looks like an RPG that you play with cards, but that's not it at all.  The primary thrust is actually a solitaire game...  It's battle-solitaire-poker with RPG elements! *evil grin*  Whee~!How does that work?  Looking at the screenshots will help a bit.  As you can see, we and our opponent are each dealt a set of cards, solitaire-style.  Ours is on top, theirs is on the bottom.  We need to create poker hands by grouping cards in sets of five.  If you don't know the poker hands, no worries -- the game will show you what groupings are ""legal"" to play.  Each ""hand"" will deliver a certain amount of damage, depending on the cards you've chosen.  For instance, a pair of cards (the other three cards in the group would be non-related) will deliver less damage than a flush. In each round, you have three moves, and then your opponent gets three moves. But wait, there's more! You can steal your opponent's cards, and vice versa!  If you grab a card from his area (or the other way around,) the card underneath does NOT flip over until it becomes his turn, but whenever you clear a pile on your side, you can immediately have access to whatever card is next in the pile (assuming that it's still your turn.)  You CAN'T grab more than a single card from each others' piles -- if something is stacked on the other side (grouped,) it's off-limits to you.  You can of course move multiple, grouped cards around on your own side.Here's an example of how it might work: You already have three Kings grouped, and take a fourth King to add to the pile, then grab a King from your enemy's cards to make five-of-a-kind (yes, unlike real poker, you can have five of the same card.)  You use your third turn to select the five kings and deal damage.This is where the strategy comes in.  Now that it's too late and you've used all of your turns, you see your adversary grab that Jack of Hearts from your cards to complete a Royal Flush!  EEEK~!!Here's what you could have done to prevent it and still get your five Kings: Forget about your three Kings for right now, grab his king, and place it on your single King, making a pair.  Grab the Jack of Hearts and put it on top of another card -- ANY other card!  It's better if you can do something with it, of course, but the point is to keep that card AWAY from your opponent.  Now you can do one of two things:  Do something beneficial (like moving a card to help yourself and/or hurt his progress) or you can move the pair of Kings on top of the three-of-a-kind, and make your attack in an upcoming round.But wait, there's more! Along the way we earn (via battles) and find special-use cards that can do anything from give you extra moves before your turn is over to poisoning to shielding yourself, to adding to your hit points, and more! You can only have a certain number of cards with you at the time of each battle, and (most of) the cards have finite-uses.  When they run out uses, you can use the money you earn to recharge the cards.Be sure to SAVE before each battle!  You can abandon your progress if you wish -- it's an option to exit or go back to the main menu without saving.There a bit more to it than that, including a storyline, but I'll let you discover that for yourself. ;)This game was a huge surprise to me -- I never expected it to be so fun and addictive!  A definite thumbs-up from me!			"

												The core concept of this game is essentially solitare poker againt the AI.  Matching varying combinations of cards will inflict damage against the AI (and AI to you).  The damage will increase the better the combiation, from two of a kind to a royal flush.    The game mixes things up by adding in spell cards which can be used to inflict status effects, heal, do elemental damage, etc.  The additions of the spell cards keeps the battle fresh as certain enemies require specific cards to counter their abilities.  Overall, this game is average to above-average.  I recommend a purchase of this game during a sale.			"

												Runespell Overture is a card game with kind of original mechanic, blending the combinations from poker with tactical moves from Arcomage - where you collecting some points to use them on some spell, which will either attack your opponent or defend yourself better.Point one is that it is NOT a Role-Play Game, it is only a card game with ""health points"" on you and your enemies, and some grades of combinations to win the hand.Point two is that Arcomage - and many games alike - are still Much Better by the terms of gameplay.As a Pro point, I like the visual stylistics of the Runespell, the way it's presenting itself - it has a good facade, so to say. Game mechanic and scenario combined creating good impression, which follows you in first third, maybe first half of the whole game. But then... then you notice, that the challenge is not anything intense, and just proceeding using quite the same basic combinations - basically doing all the same over and over... and at that point, you'll be not so happy.The story is okay for that type of game... but nothing fancy or really rewarding for your struggle to beat dozens of almost similar enemies - and even bosses are not much different! To finish the impression, Runespell: Overture is maybe short (about 5-10 hours of gameplay), but holds one bugged achievement, which I can't complete even after 30+ hours... do I need to tell you how I love such things?Oh, well, I'll just mark it with 5.5/10, and leave it be. Do not recommend, as there are enough of better card games, even in the F2P ghetto.			"

												As a fan of poker and Rpgs i thought this would be a pretty interersting and fun game....i was half rightIt seems well enough when you begin. You try to get a combintaion of 5 cards, the attack power being determined on how well it corrosponds to to the poker hierarchy and try to wittle down you're opponents hp. simple enough.You are introduced to spells shortly after, assuming this is where the tactics come in.....well not really.The main problem with this game is that it is barely like poker at all and barely an RPG. The attack points could be determined by...pretty much anything else..infact it might benifit from this as what happens 90% is you and even the A.I end up making as many pairs and then full house's as you can with usually lower damage if you try anything else in addition to being harder to achieve. There almost no point in making a higher hand than you're opponent as all it does is take off slightly more hp...i mean♥♥♥♥♥♥i some what assumed that it might nullify one of his hands....or something..you know kinda like POKER.The spells offer SOME varity and tactics but not much, the cost vs reward of most spells make them mostly interchangeable.....its kinda amazing actually how there could be so much varity and yet so little.Overall the only people i can recommend this game to is to someone who wants a simple card game that has some odd and fairly unique mechanics..........but mostly it is a dissapointment and wasted potiental.

												Make sure you like the core poker-styled game mechanic before you buy because that (and the nice presentation) carry the game. If you like the gameplay, this would be a good game for you. If you're unsure or not especially enthused, there are other games that might suit you better.Took me a couple of tries to finish the game; I stopped playing and restarted a couple times because I got bored with the game mechanic or early grinding for silver.Not a very long game once you learn how to properly win games. The story is really like a prelude to the 'real story' which is never revealed. The ending is pretty lackluster. As far as I can tell, there is no reason to Continue+ (for achievements, it's better to just not do the last stage so don't have to unlock all the map again).Almost all allies are either impractical or unnecessary. Hrodbrokk is a pretty good source of damage for the RP/AP it takes; Brin is usually a waste of a turn because you should be better off moving cards around for bigger damage and using the RP elsewhere.

												Think Puzzle Quest, but instead of match 3 you play poker solitaire to fight your enemies.It's fun if you're into this kind of thing. The story is cliched but well-written: I appreciate characters with a sense of cynicism. The art and sound are nice. Tutorials can be skipped when you replay the game.Downsides: Mystic Box appears to fallen off the face of the earth. Technical settings do not save when you quit the game; I constantly have to hit Alt+Enter to resize my window and re-pick ""click and click"" (dragging is a pain) when the game starts upOverall, I enjoy this game. I use this game to kill time or relax: it's not as mindless as a match 3 and it's a fun twist on the premise. I don't expect it to do much more than that.			"

												Runespell is a combination of RPG, Solitaire and Poker, similar in nature to Puzzle Quest. You stack cards like in solitaire to form 5 card poker combos to attack your foes and cast spells. It's fairly simple to play an so is the presentation. The story is based on Norse Mythology and while it's somewhat thin it does has its twists and turns. I found the gameplay enjoyable for the most part and the game doesn't overstay its welcome. Unfortunately, as the Overture in the title says it feels like a first part of something bigger, a second game that may never come out. That didn't upset me but can frustrate some people who got more invested in the story.			"

												This game is not bad. It does not anger me, disappoint me, or rub me the wrong way. It's just kinda there. The game plays like a cross between poker and solitaire. You see your stacks of cards (top card only per stack, like in solitaire), and you see the same for your opponent. You move cards around like in solitaire, stacking them on other cards, except you're trying to make combinations of five cards, which can be poker combos like flushes, straights, etc. You then use those to attack your enemy, and vice versa. You have bonus card thingies on the side of your screen that you can use to attack when you build up enough rage.It's an okay premise, but it doesn't really seem to change and the story is just okay. It's one of the least compelling games I've played. I have nothing against this game, which is really saying something. I typically love or hate a game, but this one is just kinda meh. I wouldn't recomment paying more than a Steam sale price, by any means, but I'd recommend you play the demo if you're interested. The gameplay you experience in 20-30 minutes of that is pretty much the entirety of the gameplay from what I've seen thus far. It's not very exciting or interesting, and nothing draws me in to make me want to keep playing. It's an okay game, but that's it.			"

												This was a fun and reasonably easy game to master. The mythic poker system is more of a cross between solitaire and poker. The layout is solitaire, but the building of hands is very much poker. Royal Flush has the most value at 50 attack points. I like the way your runespells charge by both dealing  damage and receiving it from enemy attacks. The story was reasonably engaging for what it was, and they left room for DLC or a sequel. All in all, a good way to kill 8 or 10 hours. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 7 for fun, but an 8 or 9 as far as games you can play to kill time whne you are bored.Online play would be a natural evolution for this game. I hope they are considering the development of PvP matches.			"

												The recommendation is pretty weak because I didn't actually like the game.  I think it has the potential to be enjoyable and it is fairly unique, so that alone might be worth it to you.This game is essentially puzzle quest but with a solitaire combat system instead of matching gems.  It's not fast by any means.  Essentially you build poker hands to charge attacks, then launch the attacks at your opponent.  Essentially you spend the entire game moving stacks of cards on top of each other to make a combo of five, and the higher the combo on the damage scale, the more the attack will do.  You can also 'steal' cards from your enemies so long as they aren't stacked.The combat is cool once or twice, but after that it becomes so repetitive.  Nearly every fight is identical, save for the select few where you need to charge and use special attacks to win.Beyond the gameplay, the music, sound effects, story and graphics are all ok.  They're mediocre, they're fine, they're acceptable.  Without a doubt they are not great and won't sell the game, but they sustain it without detracting.All around, that describes the experience: alright, ok, passable.  It's not thrilling or revolutionary, but it is unique and if that's what you're looking for in a game then you'll find it here.			"

Among poker hands, you get to use spells, allies that have different powers and pet abilities. I love the tactic and mathematic side of winning the battles. Not having much time to play and having to get off the chair before my computer a lot, I'm happy that it's turn based and that you can save between every battle.

												I honestly think this is the first computer based card game I have ever played. I have always passed them up thinking I would never enjoy them. Boy was I wrong. This truly is a well developed adventure. You essentially create poker hands against opponents to cause damage. The battle animation sequences keep it interesting to watch plus there are a decent number of card options, including offensive, defensive, and special abilities. As long as you understand how poker hands are ranked, this game is masterfully intuitive. If not, they even have that covered as well with an easy to follow tutorial. It also has a decent story although it's all text based so there is a bit of reading involved (you can skip conversations if you prefer). Do yourself a favor and give this game a shot.			"

												Runespell: Overture is a near perfect marraige (or lovechild?) of Puzzle Quest and Poker (or Mythical Poker as the game calls it). It's a turned based RPG played with poker cards, where you must combine five cards in poker rules (pairs, royal flush, straights, etc) to attack. Performing attacks or getting attack builds rage points which are used for powercards that do damage, provide more turns, or cause personal buffs or enemy debuffs. It may sound confusing at first, but it's pretty simple after the game explains it to you, and it makes for a fun and interesting RPG, Single-player only, game+, 10-15hrs of gameplay (I finished in 12). I got it part of a bundle, but it's worth full price, especially if you like the Puzzle Quest series.			"

												Great game. It's like Puzzle Quest but with cards instead of gems. And I don't know a thing about playing cards. So you can imagine how fun it is for me.The graphics are simple but cool, and add to the atmosphere of the game. The sound  and music are pretty good also.But there is something I hope they'll fix in future updates. Because it starts off pretty easy (obviously), but the difficulty ramps up quite quickly (after about 10 fights). And it's not just based on skill but luck as well. So there are times when you have to refight enemies 5-6 times in a row. Only downside to an otherwise excellent game.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												Runespell: Overture combines some of the more bare-bones RPG elements (character upgrades, spells, quests) with a combat system that uses a weird blend of poker and solitaire to damage enemies. Sound odd? It is, but since I like cards and RPGs I enjoyed it. The overall gameplay, unfortunately, seemed a little too superficial for me to give it a higher recommendation; I didn't feel like I had much to do with building my character, and since the game is most definitively on-rails that was disappointing. If you dislike the levelling feature of traditional JRPGs this might be more up your alley.			"

												The core gameplay mechanic is original and fun, but I couldn't play enough of it for that to matter. For many people, the game crashes after reaching the first village. Just freezes and can't be unfrozen. Some people say they fix it by disabling ""Raptr,"" but I don't even know what that is, and it doesn't appear to be even installed on my computer. If I ever manage to solve this problem, I can give a better review, but for now, I have to say that a game with such a massive bug isn't worth gambling on. Furthermore, there is a lot of dialogue and ""story,"" but all of it is just horribly written. I mean really, really painful to read, and you have to go through it all. And if there is dialogue at the start of a fight (usually seems to be) and you die during that fight you have to click through it all again. I feel the game would be better if they either hired a proper writer for the story, or just gave it a bare bones plot and let the player enjoy the actual battles more, without having to suffer through the dialogues. Maybe add a ""skip"" button.Again, I've only played the tutorial, because I can't get it to work past that. It's possible it gets better, though writing that bad in a game doesn't tend to improve. I suppose my real hope would be that there would simply be less of it. If I ever get the game working, I will give it more of a chance, because the combat is quite interesting, and then I will update my review with a more informed experience.			"

												As a avid player of Match-3 games, and appreciator of the Puzzle Quest saga, I convinced myself to give Runespell: Overture a shot, intrigued by the fact you play with a standard deck of cards instead of coloured gems.The first battles were interesting, the poker-like combos felt novel. Diving more deeply into the game, it got more depth with the addition of magic cards and sidekicks.Unfortunately, it appeared that most of the magic cards are just copies of the same basic spell (unlike other games where fire, ice, lightning and poison have different tactical effects).From that point, the battles felt too much similar to sustain interest, and the constant sight of these clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades turned the fantasy background into the trivial one your regular Solitaire.These kind of games are supposed to be easy to develop on a reasonable budget, deliberately limiting fancy graphics to focus solely on gameplay depth. Sadly, this game is a living testimony of a team being too lazy or too tired to make a truly great game. Maybe they lost faith in this game at some point. No wonder this happened to me too.			"

												Eugh.  I played Runespell and I tried to like it, I really did.  It's based around Poker/Solitaire mechanics, where you select cards from Solitaire-like stacks and then stack them on to other cards, and if you complete a Poker hand you get to deal damage.  But this game has a fairly punishing difficulty for a game which revolves a lot around random chance, but even worse, the differences between e.g. a straight and a flush and three of a kind are fairly minimal, whereas the Straight Flush and Royal Straight Flush are absolutely crushing if you get them.  This can result in a fight being repeated over and over, trying to get the SF/RSF.  This means it doesn't feel like you ""won"" even when you do.Nevermind that the Runespell mechanics depend on dealing or receiving damage to charge up your Rage... and then you have to not be hit with Fear, which takes away your hard-won Rage.  And it takes precious actions to use Runespells, actions that could be spent sorting cards into hands and attacking, when the Runespells often cost a lot and are not all that advantageous.If you are wondering if it has a story... uh.  It doesn't, really.  You're yet another boring ""mysterious wanderer"" who remembers nothing and has no characterization except being Generic Reluctant Hero #8894691, and some special powers because you are also the Chosen One.  The other characters are relatively flat and enjoy very little characterization, and what they do get is fairly ham-handed... most characters only have about a dozen lines at best, going up to two or three dozen if they're a major villain or an early ally.  And no, it's not a huge cast, either.If you do play it, buy the Glory I runespell (only costs 10 Rage) at the first opportunity and use it before attacking, every time, preferably with multiple hands built up to attack from.  It's one of the very few Runespells worth your time.  Don't waste too much time on ""guard"" runespells, as the AI is intelligent enough to avoid attacking while those are up.Or, better, don't waste your money?			"

												Runespell: Overture  -  Solid 7/10TL:DR;Looks like a port from Mobile, but plays well enough to let you enjoy it. Good graphics, bad sound, decent gameplay idea.Graphics: 8/10Game appears behaving like a typical mobile title, with big icons, colourful sprites, single click interface.This is rather small title, so not much can be expected - but it does not disapoint anywhere. Sound: 5/10Absolutelly atrocious music, unfit for a title, where you need to pause for a while and think about your choices. Sound effects are average to say at best, nothing that will make a lasting impact or increase immersion. Could be worse.Storyline: 7/10There is a story line, suprisingly, quite decent one. There seem to be no nonsense in story arcs, characters do all fit the setting.Unfortunatelly dialogues are absolutelly atrocious. You have a medieval world full of legends with dialogues using words from modern teenagers dictionary.Unpolished dialogue lines are possibly the greatest issue I had while playing that game (after I turned off the music).Gameplay: 7/10There are issues with a screen display and game settings not being saved correctly. This is quite visible, because the game is best played in 30m to 1h bursts rater than as single continuous experience. And the experience is sometimes uneven.This game features poker-like mechanism of matching cards in 5 sets of poker type hands to perform 'attacks' that damage health of your opponens. This is as fun as it sounds, but wait, there is more!You can steal cards from your opponent hand, you have runecards (effectively magic, limited use), companion cards (unlimited use), passive cards that increase your stats. This extra layer of cards is put separate from your regular playing cards that you match during a duel. This is as cool as it sounds, however the single duel can take a long time and its outcome is quite often random - as the card you get are randomized - which means that in 30m of gameplay you will have 3 to 5 duels (five being lucky) and some story line. Past that it is really repetitive and that is why playing this game in short sessions is recommended.Solid 7/10, recommend buy if a fan of a genre, wait for sale if not.			"

												The old iPhone game Sword & Poker 2 (NOT the awful freemium remake!) does everything right that Runespell does wrong.In S&P2, your spells directly affect the poker grid, which allows you to make better, deadlier poker hands. Which is fun.In Runespell, the spells do NOT let me affect the solitaire/poker game. They just let end it faster.In S&P2, you actually feel like you're playing (a weird variant of) poker.In Runespell, the game is much closer to Klondike solitaire. (Fairway Solitaire was fun, but this isn't.)In S&P2, the story is ""Go poker cute monsters to death to save the world... again""In Runespell, there's this ridiculous grimdark story because you fight everyone with solitaire and poker's UGLY child.In S&P2, you have incentive to not just defeat the enemy, but to do well - you only get a few healing potions per level, so the better you fight, the more health you'll have in the next battle.In Runespell, you heal fully between every fight so who cares as long as you win.

												Runespell: Overture is poker on steroids.  I find myself blowing five hours in one sitting playing this game.  The game is based on poker, but spiced with a dash of magic the gathering like elements.  You play a nameless stranger whom others refer to as a ""changeling,"" and the very first battle is a seamless tutorial on playing this game.  Basically, your goal is to reach a castle called ""skullgrim"" and discover the truth about yourself. Along the way, you will encounter allies and enemies, and pick up cards (""runespells"") that you will need to get through the battles.The first thing that struck me when I launched the software is the beautiful graphics and animation for the game.  The illustrations for people and characters are excellent, and the animations are fluid.  The game mechanics are easy to pick up, but the mental challenge rises noticeably as you move on to battle increasingly difficult enemies.  The game is based on poker, and requires five card combinations in order to deal damage.  The games are 1 on 1 between your Changeling and the opponent, and the object of the game is to reduce the opponent's health to zero.  However, Runespell offers two twists to this classic game.  First you are permitted to take cards from your opponent's side of the table during your turn, when you have three action points or make three moves.  And the opponent can do likewise during his turn.  The cards are all laid out on the table, and thus the game incorporates a metagame element, where you have to be aware of your opponent's hand at all times.  The card stealing could be utilized to strengthen your own hand, or block your opponent from making a combination.The second twist in Runespell is the use of Runespell cards, which could deal direct damage to your opponent, and add a protection to your character.  The game allows the use of these cards through accumulation of ""Rage"" points, which you receive when you either deal damage or receive it.  The rage points are also utilized to call allies for assistance.  However, the game limits the abuse of runespells by adding restrictions.  First, you need to unlock them either by obtaining them from defeated enemies, chests, or purchasing from a merchant.  Second, the quantity is limited; in other words you have a limited supply of them for the ENTIRE GAME.  The quantity restriction does not apply to non-player character allies, though.  Early in the game, your opponents will have little in the way of runespells.  But as the game progresses, the opponents will be formidible precisely because of these abilities.  So it becomes crucial for you to prepare counters to these attacks before you engage these enemies.  However, there is no penalty for dying in this game, and you could even flee at any time if the battle goes poorly.For players who are not familiar with poker, the game has an icon for ""poker help"" on the lower right corner of the screen.  This pulls up a helpful guide on the combinations available, plus the amount of damage that each combination metes out.  This guide is helpful even for experienced poker players, as you decide which combo to aim for or just attack to clear out the table for new cards.Runespell: Overture may be repetitive, but the game is challenging and poker fans will definitely find this game delightful and fun to play.

												Runespell Overture is essentially and turn-based RPG with a poker-hand-based combat system.  You create combinations with cards that you draw to deal damage or heal.  The graphics are good for an independant title, but the game has a lackluster plot and is extremely short (only 3 or 4 hours of gameplay).  If you enjoy playing poker, have a love for turn-based combat or have small children who like card games, then you may find this title entertaining for a few hours.  Wait for a deep price discount, otherwise you may feel you overpaid for this title.			"

												I have tried repeatedly to get into this game and I just can't. I find it dreadfully boring and I usually like games that do the puzzle quest thing.

												I really liked this game.  It had a nice rpg feel about it, as well as having a very well thought out card game system that kept the game entertaining and challenging.  My only real negative about the game is that the game didn't really feel like it had a proper ending.  You get a cutscene which shows you going to the place you have been hearing about during the quests, but then the credits roll.  I could understand if there was a dlc or another game to follow on from this one, but sadly there isn't.  It feels unfinished as a result.Still, don't that put you off buying it, especially if it is on sale, as it is a good game and kept me entertained for over 12 hours.			"

												Usually hate card games as they try to be too complicated for their own good, with a bunch of numbers and too many random modifiers that just turn me off. But this game ramps up the complexity slowly and the RPG mixure is done very well as the story, characters, and dialoge are well done without wearing out their welcome ( i.e. you will actually spend more time playing the game instead of reading ). But if you like super complex card games like Magic the gathering you might find this game too simple and on the easy side, so maybe this game isnt for the hardcore. But if you are looking for a game where you play with one hand on mouse the other on a beverage or texting on your phone, this game is great, just relax after work  or whatever and enjoy.

												Puzzle Quest with Poker hands. Not much more complicated than that. A somewhat slick idea unforunately burns out quickly, leaving nothing but an oily, tarry slog. The 'runespells' add little to the game, the mechanics never change, and everything except the core poker hands is pretty much irrelevant (you'll use the same spells over and over again, except when you have to use specific ones to win a fight).Kind of a pity... the production values are otherwise very high, the story has some potential for intrigue (although it never develops), and... well, there's a game in here somewhere, it just hasn't been fleshed out. You're looking at the emaciated skeleton of a game with a few pieces of rotting silk dangling from its hollow shell of bones. That's it.Perhaps the sequel, if one comes, will be worth sinking time into. For now, stick to Puzzle Quest or better yet, Marvel Puzzle Quest: Dark Reign if you don't mind F2P. Even better, play the superlative 10,000,000. That's a match-3/RPG done exceptionally right.And hey, I suppose that at least it's still better than the atrocious Puzzle Quest 2, or the clueless Puzzle Quest: Galactrix. So there's always that.

												Solitaire mixed with Poker. Instead of building suits, you're building poker hands and using these hands to beat enemy AI to death. A better hand does more damage, and the more damage you deal (or take), the more spells you can cast with your building rage.This system has some nice subtleties, but the rest of the game lets it down. The AI refuses to use any high power hands at all, and instead resorts to using easily buildable hands and spamming abilities to win. This results in a final boss which has a use 5 rage -> do 30 or so dmg loop which it is not bright enough to use.As for the story dragging you through the adventure, it is lacklustre at best, and is not helped by being left on a cliffhanger at the end to allow for sequels and the ""Overture"" in the title.The art style is quite good though.In all, a good idea that becomes tedious because of uninteresting AI, and eventually leads to power-gaming to find no end at the end.

												One of the things I like about indie games is that they try out unique concepts that more mainstream developers would either never think of or be too scared to try. Runespell: Overture is a Norse themed RPG but is set apart from other RPGs by its unique battle system. You and your oppenent are given a deck of playing cards laid out solitaire-style and the idea is to build poker hands using the face up cards of you and your opponent. The better the hand, the harder it hits! Attacking and taking hits also builds up your rage meter which is used for activating spell cards similar those found in collectible card games to further give you an edge. Over the course of the game you will meet new allies, complete new quests, find new cards and further the story. If the idea of an RPG with poker-style battling and CCG elements appeals to you, get this game! You won't regret it.			"

												5/10Runespell: Overture is a single-player turn-based RPG that uses poker rules and the game takes between 8-10 hours to complete.Combat involves setting up poker combinations (flushes, full houses etc.) with different combinations dealing different amounts of damage. You can use your own cards or even steal individual visible cards from your opponents.Dealing and receiving damage builds 'rage points' (essentially mana) that can be consumed to use spells (damage spells, defense spells, etc).I would recommend this game for someone who wants a throwaway game to occupy a bit of time.Pros:- Easy-to-grasp gameplay concept- Novelty poker rules are interesting in the RPG genreCons:- Forgettable 'plot' - weak story- Can be frustrating at times due to the RNG nature of cards			"

												Pretty cool solitaire with RPG elements. The story isn't the most outstanding fantasy, but it did remind me of reading a Forgotten Realms book, a bit. It doesn't help that the story ends halfway through its overall telling, implying that there's a sequel which remains to be seen, though supposedly the studio is working on a new poker-rpg title for release this year. Whether or not that's a sequel to Overture, I do not know.			"

												Good game, although about poker, none poker skill require.

												Somewhat different card based game with a fantasy setting. I really liked it, though it gets pretty difficult after the inital fast progress. I'm more a casual kind of player of such games, and found it requiring a little bit to much tactical thought for my taste. Otherwise, a wholehearted recommendation for this game, especially if you like this type of game, and enjoy a little bit of tactical challenge in a fundamentally poker-based card game.			"

												Runespell: Overture was fun. It reminds me a lot of PuzzleQuest, except matching blocks was replaced with competitive solitaire. Build those those trips, quads, and boats to attack the enemy. There's also spells and other typical RPG trappings. Good stuff. It's the first chapter of a larger story. It wasn't that long and the game abruptly ends.			"

												Solitaire mixed with Poker. Instead of building suits, you're building poker hands and using these hands to beat enemy AI to death. A better hand does more damage, and the more damage you deal (or take), the more spells you can cast with your building rage.This system has some nice subtleties, but the rest of the game lets it down. The AI refuses to use any high power hands at all, and instead resorts to using easily buildable hands and spamming abilities to win. This results in a final boss which has a use 5 rage -> do 30 or so dmg loop which it is not bright enough to use.As for the story dragging you through the adventure, it is lacklustre at best, and is not helped by being left on a cliffhanger at the end to allow for sequels and the ""Overture"" in the title.The art style is quite good though.In all, a good idea that becomes tedious because of uninteresting AI, and eventually leads to power-gaming to find no end at the end.

												Fun game. However, needs a few things to be really enjoyable.1. Autosaving. This game has NO autosaving. I found this out when I closed the game and reloaded, only to find I had no save data available. There were three hours of work.2. When I stack together a straight flush or a royal flush and hit my opponent, the game really ought to have some cool super attack special or something. I felt miffed when I got royal flushes time and again, hitting for a whopping 50 damage, and it was the same piddly animation as always.That being said, it's a fun Solitaire+Poker+RPG, and I rate it a solid 9/10.
