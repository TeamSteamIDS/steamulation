												Summary: The game is quite good, but it's not perfect. There are minor hints at mobile heritage, but nothing that would stop anyone who might like a computerized card game from having plenty of fun.Progress Disclosure: I finished the game and have every achievement. I didn't collect every card. That took about 14 hours. It could probably be done in 8-10 hours by someone hurrying.Updates: It's over 2 months later, and this game is still getting free content additions.The mechanics have clearly received attention and tuning; the basics work nicely on their own, and as more abilities are introduced they interact in interesting but not convoluted ways. The interface in general is good; however, it is full of tiny delays for animations and pointless confirmations of non-permanent actions. Combat animations can be set to anywhere between 100% and 200% speed in the options, at least.The tutorial was good, even having heard and read nothing about the game except the store description before playing. The difficulty hasn't sharply spiked or stayed tutorial easy since; the AI can be observed getting steadily more competent in addition to having better cards. Most games are semi-close wins, and the occasional enemy provokes a new deck style. I have a win ratio around 5, and I doubt that's exceptional.Deck size is allowed to vary between 25-40 and failing to draw causes damage, so milling is a somewhat viable strategy with the right cards.There's an deterministic, seemingly associative 2-input alchemy system. The vast majority of combinations are disallowed, and this is indicated by dimming incompatible cards; there's still a pretty large space of recipes, though. A little experimentation produced some deck-worthy but not ridiculous cards. As an example, two Pancakes gives a pretty good milling card. I didn't find a guide, so I'll warn that in my experience combining a alchemy-created card and one of the ingredients used to craft it is allowed but just gets the created back, effectively throwing a card away.There are 6 icon-identified deck slots; a card can be used in multiple decks. The deck building interface is passable if imperfect; it lacks bulk management options, and the sorting options are deficient. It could use a tweak to show more cards on a PC screen. Cards used in decks are hidden on store and alchemy menus (for good reason).The art style is pleasant. The dialogue is mildly humorous overall and better in parts; the optional dialogues are pretty extensive, as well.The achievements look to be quite doable, so it would probably be good for 100%ers. The non-trivial ones (10+ attack and 9 combo) are easy enough to manage once you have a 6+ arrow card and deliberately try.As described, there are no hidden in-game currency, card, or booster purchases.Accessibility: The game is fully turn-based with no time pressure ever. The interface doesn't require great precision, but it does require dragging. The interface is fully mouse-driven, except optionally entering your name. There are no vital sound-only cues. No lines are voiced; all dialogue is presented in text. Nothing relies purely on color for identification. As a non-expert, I see no problems.			"

												Initial impression:Being a player of Magic the gathering I though that this game was going to be boring, however, due the low price and the Scot Piligrim art style I gave it a shot. TL;DR:My thoughts were wrong, It's actually a pretty neat and nice gameGameplay***********The gameplay it's really simple, the objective is to kill your opponent, you do it by placing and connecting cards that have different types in a 3x3 space.Types of cards:Attack: Hit the oponent or kill a Card in your opponent's board.Defense: Give you life.Resurrect: Resurrect a dead card.Neutral: They don't do nothing, but these cards have multiple connection arrows allowing you to easly connect gaps.in order to achieve different effects.When 2 or 3 cards connect (Depending of the ammount of symbols of Attack, def, etc) they do the effect and dissappear. You have to place a card mandatory each turn, so if you cannot place anymore you lose (Same for your opponent).At first the game it's really easy since your opponents don't have combos and kill themself because they fill the grid, but after a while it becomes more challening.Regarding progression, it seems that there are a lot of cards (Common, uncommon, rare and legendaries), you win booster packs by defeating other characters.Art:****The art of the cards it's really cool, most of them are weird stuff (There's an avatar that's a Carrot with a hat). As stated before, the art style really looks like Scot Piligrim. "

												I haven't played too much of it, but that doesn't mean I can't still give you my opinion! I really like it so far, and plan on putting a good bit more time into it. I'm gonna try to give you a good idea of the game becuase not too much is explained here or anywhere online so bear with me.  It's a very simple little card game wrapped in a Yu-Gi-Oh-esque adventure shell. You go through different locations battling people, getting more cards, getting new decks, all in an effort to get the 8 legendary cards and become super cool and powerful and make mad bank at a tournament. The gameplay itself is simple. There's a world map that you click locations on to go there and interact with or battle people (also, click around the environment to find hidden coins!).  The card game puts a heavy emphasis on positioning. All the cards have arrows on them, and you want to put your cards together so their arrows point at eachother. Connect (usually) 3 arrows and you can make a combo to either do damage, increase your defense(HP) or other effects. That's it. You win when your opponent has no defense or can't play another card.  After you win, you generally get a pack of cards to build your deck with, and some money to buy more packs.  Your deck must be at least 25 cards, but they can be bigger. I really like the story, well what little of it I've seen so far. It's basic, you know, get the best cards and be the best. That's good enough for me though, and it should satisfy anyone who grew up watcing shows about kids playing card games.  So far, it's bee pretty light-hearted, it's silly and kinda funny which I dig. The art style is childlike and well drawn in a good way, it fits the theme of the game very well. Now we move to the music, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ do I love it. Seriously, I hope I can get the soundtrack, because it's probably my favorite part. The last thing to mention is the price. It's 2 bucks right now. Yes, it's clearly a port of a tablet game. No, it doesn't have visual/sound options aside from a resolution changer and a window/fullscreen button. No, it does not have multiplayer. Let me bring this up again. IT'S 2 BUCKS. Even when it goes to full price at 4 bucks, it's still totally worth it. If you like card games, you should buy it. Even if you don't like card games, but cheap and charming games, buy it. Anyone can get into this, and you should get into it.			"

												Let me start off by saying that this game is underpriced. $3.99 for this gem of a game? Unheard of in this day and age! I enjoyed this game from beginning to end. The unique artwork and character dialog fits the tone of the entire game. There are a lot of unique characters with crazy and varied personalities. The way they battle during matches also happens to be in sync with their character. Each fight is more like a puzzle piece and the same strategy can't be used for every battle in the game. For those who are looking for true randomness in each battle in reference to the opponent's card might have to look elsewhere. The story is your typical I need to win the card battle tournament at the end but how it's presented is what makes this title unique. Of course there are the usual twists and turns during the whole event. The music is also amazing and is a mix of both melodious and upbeat jazz styled tunes.Do yourself a favor and purchase the soundtrack. You'll have the manually search for it on Steam since it does not show up under the game's main page as DLC. Get it here I've played my fair share of card battle games in my day. Everything from Magic the Gathering to Yugioh to Pokemon to SNK vs Capcom Card Fighters and more! This game's mechanics is totally different from them all thanks to the grid like interface which quite frankly was refreshing to me. Get this game! The only feature it lacks is multiplayer. It would be amazing if this could be added in a future update or even as part of a sequel. Despite all of that this game is an absolute steal for the price! Buy it!			"

												I loved Card City Nights from start to the, ehmmmm almost end. Why? Well first of all, in general i have a lot of fun with card games and i like when they present some different mechanics, get bit inovative and CCN provide this to me (at least i didnt encounter with this type of gameplay). Also i was huge fan of artistic side of game. Music was cool and visuals was colorful, lovely to look at. I didn´t care much about story or characters, but this game wasn´t about it. My problem with CCN appear after few hours of playing. AI was really, really dumb. There was practically no challenge, and when you master some tactic and technique you simply can´t be beaten by them. This was drastically changed by final boss. I can´t tell if it was caused by my s**** decks, or it was caused by something else from my play, but i couldn´t defeat him (and i envy to all smart people, who pass this without trouble). After several hours of trying, i simply rage quit, discourage and beaten. Dont get me wrong, i like challenges but when you suddenly raise bar from nothing to something this big, it raise question: ""Why other matches couldn´t be harder?""I will eventually come back to this game and claim what is rightfully mine.Grade: B "

												Card city night makes me reminisce about one of my favorite gameboy color games: Pokemon Trading Card game. You're basically fighting eight gyms, getting booster packs along the way in a story that's utterly forgettable but at least is a decent nod towards other video game greats.But the story doesn't really matter (In fact the game basically says this multiple times), what really got me hooked was the puzzle-esque card battling system. At first you think it's really clear cut, and just go straight for your opponents life points. But then the game throws opponents at you for which this strategy is basically impossible, and it makes you realize that there are a LOT of ways to play this game. The art is fantastic, each card is humorous in it's own regard, and the entire aesthetic of the game is just awesome to look at. It's almost a trying hard to look like you're not trying hard sort of art style. The music though leaves something to be desired, it's basically the same tune for each area that you're in, which means it keeps looping and looping and looping. But hey, for $4 you really can't go wrong with this. Ten solid hours that will make you reminisce about the good old days of 8-bit monster card fighting.			"

												I'm impressed with the card game. It's charming, with very simple rules, while still requiring thoughtful tactics. It's not a hardcore trading card game, but it's not casual either. It's more of a distillation. You have to ""link"" cards in a 3x3 grid to activate them, but specific cards can only link in certain directions (there are arrows on the cards... check out the screenshots). This mechanic allows the game to have very simply cards (there aren't really stats on cards) and still require thought.It ticks nearly all the checkboxes, deck building, booster packs, good art direction and music. It's set in a neat universe with some irreverently quirky characters. As rich as the universe is though, the story's a bit thin. You have to collect legendary cards from various ""bosses"" to enter an ultimate tournament and win a million coins. It's little more than a reason to be playing cards with every person you see... which isn't a bad thing at all.			"

												If you enjoy an easy-going yet skill-based game, or if you enjoy the elements of both puzzles and trading card battles, I highly recommend 'Card City Nights.'In 'Card City Nights', you fast travel through an island city with a chill, evening atmosphere, talking to comical NPCs, and battling them in a TCG for booster packs. In the card game proper, each player has a 3x3 card grid, and seven Defense Points. The goal is either to fill up your opponent's grid with occupied space, or decrease their Defense Points to zero.Cards have three main categories: ATTACK, which can disable opponent cards, or damage your opponent's Defense Points; DEFENSE, which can increase your own Defense Points; and REVIVE, which can bring your disabled cards back into play.The challenge of the game is that cards must be played in combos. Each card has a specific set of arrows which tell you where on the grid it can be placed for maximum efficiency, and cards in a combo must point to each other in order to be played. While some cards have multiple arrows, others only have one (some trick cards have none). They can also have additional effects such as rotation, teleportation, or extra damage, making gameplay interesting, unpredictable, and especially fun.The game works in an almost Rock-Paper-Scissors type of balance, where a specific strategy you use for your deck to counter that of your opponent's will expose you to another vulnerability. Having the freedom to make your own deck allows you to explore and create your own combos. Each NPC uses a consistent strategy, making training accessible, but not simple-minded, since the variability of play is kept intact by the limited number of cards you're allowed to use at once. This could actually be printed as a physical card game, and I would invest in it without hesitation.Personally, this game meets all my standards for a perfect single player game: completely replayable, expansive but not overwhelming, customizable, encouraging of practice, and a smooth, approachable mood shown through the art style, music and NPCs (I once spent a quarter hour just reading the funny lines of the gossiper at the city mall).An online multiplayer mode would send my love for this game over the top, like a rocket that shoots through the sky and explodes, scattering its awesome rocket parts over the world. Seriously, game designers, if you're reading this: give 'Card City Nights' an online multiplayer mode, or the aforementioned physical card game.			"

												A somewhat underpriced casual card game. 3.99e normal price is quite low for a game this good. You get a lot of value for that money with this game. Best played in short bursts when you got some extra time on hand or while doing something else on the side. Does not take itself as seriously as the MtG games do and you can play this with your kids. Difficulty is generally quite low until you start to against the legendary card holders for real. they will challenge you and force you to go gather better cards to be able to beat their strategy. Deck building is also a must but the default deck gets you quite far.			"

												One of my favourite games <3This is game is easy to understand at the beginning you start of about a guy who just play with some people get some booster packs to get new cards and sometimes you get rare cards and you will go crazy (lel) anyway when you challenge a guy it's kinda, Just kinda hard because every chracter has it's own cards, strategys and gameplay so you really have to understand that versus guy or you will lose easily you can also buy cards from the market (I Mean the market on the game) Some more way to get this card every time you swap a card so you have to think what you should buy or you will be just a little guy who dont know how to do anything even though some chracters have cards more than you for example: You chase a guy and you just only have 20 cards and this guy have 25 cards so that's kinda hard, About the soundtrack, The soundtrack is...just....wonderful wont say its bad doesn't need that word, A.I. is really needful on this game so here is my ratings.Gameplay 10/10Soundtrack 10/10A.I 9.5/10Arts on the game 10/10Idea of the game 10/10Multiplayer (No multiplayer at this game)Thats all i can say hope you guys buy this game its really wonderful makes you remember the old school days x]			"

												Fun singleplayer card game with a story to follow, small secrets and twists, humorous chat, and graphics that appeal even to me (and I'm not for cartoons). Oh, and of course interesting card mechanics.You are kind of on a quest to get one of each legendary card, and meet more and more opponents you can choose to battle for their booster packs (or money). You can also buy common and uncommon cards you already have at least one of, recylce cards into new booster packs, and even combine certain cards into other certain cards.And when you've won, you can still come back for more battles, with the usual opponents, as well as some prior one-time opponents, and 4 new ones!I like the variety, the card game, the story, the humour, the whole town. I want to spend more time there, doing stuff.			"

												Grrrrrrrrreat game! Finished the entire story (which includes post-game events) in roughly 15 hours. Story follows the courageous attempt of ""SpacePirate"", aiming to be the best card player in the city. Comparable to Pokemon games, in a way. Rather than collecting gym leader badges to reach the elite four, you're collecting legendary cards to battle the Card King.Game is fairly straight forward, though not as casual as it may seem. You travel from location to location in seek of information for legendary cards. Each victory earns you gold and a booster pack which may contain a common, special or rare card. There's a variety of different booster packs, which further adds to the gameplay and replay value if you intend on building your deck around a specific type or card. Legendary cards pack unique abilities, further adding to the variety of options available. You can also buy or merge cards to create your ideal deck - Whether that be an all out offensive deck (which is what I used), defensive, deck burner, healer, focused on a combination deck, or various other combinations. Storage space of 6 decks, with minimum 25 and maximum 40 cards.Gameplay is also fairly straight forward, though the battle phase is not like your average trading card game where each card has an attack and defence point, but rather connecting card arrows to form an attack, defence, heal, and so on. Victory is earned by either depleting the opponent defence points, burning their deck, or forcing them into filling up their playing board by stunning cards or hoping they can't match anything. Very formidable opponents late game, including some challenges early on when trying to understand the type of deck you want to build and the cards to include in this construction.Visuals are both charming and delightful. Several cards and characters, from my understanding, are characters from the Ludocity franchises - Including Ittle Dew. No complication in terms of settings and adjustment. The game in general is very accessible and user-friendly. Soundtrack is a mixture of beautiful jazz and hip-hop.Overall: A very charming and delightful card game topped off by a remarkable soundtrack. Definitely recommended, especially for that asking price! :]			"

												I've been addicted to this game for the last week. It is a mix of collectable card games like Yu Gi Oh or M:TG. However, unlike most CCGs, you do not have to BUY the booster packs either through in game currency or real money. You earn them through the gameplay which is a major bonus to me.The story is better than you would expect from a game of this genre as well. If you choose to, you can find that every person you come across has several (sometimes more than a dozen) different things they will say to you. And what they say will change depending on whether or not you have defeated them yet.The actual gameplay is quite balanced. As you get stronger, so does the opponents. And there are many different strategies you must use. Going all out offense will work sometimes, but some characters are built to counter with good defense and the ability to disable your best cards at just the right times. You must choose your deck wisely depending on your opponent. This depth is part of what makes this game so fun.The art style may turn some people off but I think it's very endearing and original. I don't know any of the indie games that this takes it's characters from but it's cartoonish and quirky and simple and it fits the overall mood of the game.The best part of the whole game however must be the music. Everything from the menu screen, to the various places you visit, to the battles have music that is perfect for the situation. It's soothing and it's energizing at the same time. This, along with the humor of the game, and the visual styling make this a game you will never want to put down.Although I have not beaten it yet, I know from reading around that the game has more things to accomplish even after you defeat the 'final boss'. So replay value is strong here too.			"

												Decent card mechanics framed in a comedy setting.If you like other TCG/CCGs this game might be too basic for you, but it still offers good entertainment for the low, affordable price :)However. There are more than one way to win in this game, it offers a few different strategies and how you play it out can change quickly, which makes it an interesting game!You get into the gameplay quite easily & quickly, the tutorial was short but covered everything I needed to know about the basics of the game.Eventually new cards are introduced with more ""advanced"" abilities, but the core mechanics/gameplay remains the same and doesn't change the game that much as a whole.The game features deck building with up to 6 custom decks, as in other TCG/CCGs you have a library of cards that you earn from battles or purchase from the in-game shop. You get to choose from these cards to form decks that you bring into battles later on.The lack of filters in the library is a bit annoying, but there's not too many cards so it's acceptable.Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be possible to purchase booster packs, depriving you of the suspension & kick that it is to rip open a new booster ;)It seems to be a mobile game that has been ported to PC (Unity3D) which is obvious in some of the UI choices, this is probably related to the input lag as well as UI lag that occurs frequently.

												This turned out to be a reeeeally fun game. It's a CCG set in a modern world small town with a cute story wrapped around it. You collect booster packs via duelling NPCs in the game, buy individual cards from the in-game store with gold coins that you get as you duel or explore, and form decks using one of a few varying strategies to finish the story and defeat all your opponents. I read other reviews that said defence decks were great, I used an offensive/disabler deck that worked well from start to end too. It's not grindy at all, you can easily play start to end without sitting around and grinding certain cards or something, though you can if you want to as well.But there are a number of strategies you can employ to build your deck around, which is a neat concept, though there's little advantage in not maxing out the size of your deck, and the AI can be spotty in places, though it's not entirely horrible. The card combining system I found to be a little wonky too, although I didn't play with it fully.Love the art, dig the character writing, and the music is fun and addictive and on both Spotify and Steam, apparently.It took me about 8-10h of casual playing to finish the game, the rest of the time it was just sitting idle behind some other games, which is why the gameplay time is a little inflated.

Card City Nights is a deck-building game somewhere between classic trading card games and Final Fantasy VIII's Triple Triad.While the basic rules are fairly simple, the combo system adds some depth and planning. Mechanics like rotation, combo procs and multiple winning conditions let you build varied decks with wildly different strategies. Tons of familiar card motifs and cameos are a bonus for fans of Ittle Dew, Iji, MURI and other Ludosity-related games.The AI is fairly bad at reacting to the player, but the story enemies' decks and basic strategies are good enough to pose a challenge.Multiplayer is on the way.

												This was pretty fun! The characters are awesome and the gameplay is smart, fast and simple enough. Deck building is interesting, but no deep strategy is actually needed, as the game is very easy, although it can be implemented,I wasn't stuck in any battles for too long, the last battle has an incredibly big difficulty spike but even then I only had to try like 4 times.It's a shame there's no multiplayer, a feel like that's a no-brainer.Overall I'd say definetely worth a try, if it's on sale. (But I got the impression there's a tablet version? If so, that one is probably better since touch controls would work perfectly.)			"

												Card City Nights is one of those games that show up and, despite their price tag, have a lot of value in them. You play as a new arrival in Card City, having won a house there. There's no description of this event but the game throws the hint right at the start if you know where to look. You get to pick your portrait and name and next thing you know you'll be battling your first few opponents. The story, because yes, there's a story, is barebones but this isn't a bad thing, quite the opposite. You want to win the Card City tournament because of reasons and get its prize but you need 8 legendary cards to even get to participate in it, so you must win those cards first. That's the whole story right there. It's nice to see a card game that doesn't take itself too serious and the story is a amusing distraction from the proceedings.The game is incredibly simple to pick up, the tutorial is short but effective in telling you the principal mechanic of the game. Essentially, the game plays out in two 3 by 3 grid, one for you and another for your opponent. The cards you use have arrows on them pointing in any of 8 different ways and one or more of 4 symbols attached to it (attack, defense, neutral, revive). You PLAY the cards by placing them on your grid but you USE them by matching arrows and symbols, making combos. You need at least 3 symbols linked by arrows to make a combo. Meanwhile, your opponent is trying to do the same. There's a little bit more nuance to this but that's THE game right there.You mix and match the cards in the deck(s) to your style of play, since there are no ""set"" decks. You edit them in any way you like on up to 6 different decks, using the cards you get via randomized booster packs that you win after defeating certain opponents. The total number of cards in the game is healthy enough to actually require some tough decisions as to what cards to actually put in the deck.The battles themselves can be won in few different ways. Two examples would be, you can attack your opponents defence, bring it to zero or disable his cards with those same attacks for a grid lock, where he has no legal move. Either way, you win (or your opponent does). However, there is definitely some concern about balance. For example, you can have 3 uncommon cards and 5 common ones in a 40 card deck. In reality, while playing, you'll find that 3 uncommon  cards that are straight-up upgrades from common ones (as in, they have the same everything the common card has but with one extra bit, like an extra arrow and/or special ability) are much more worth having. There's no real reason to keep common cards around because they will eventually just take up room from the more useful uncommon cards, unless you need A LOT of cards with arrows pointing the same way, which you won't, since it's counter-intuitive. And since uncommon become powerful on their own (like damaging the enemy just by placing them, for example), and booster packs are always available to be won, you can, with a little luck in the boosters while farming them, steamroll most opponents early on, if not for the entire duration. So this warants these two paragraphs.The A.I. isn't particularly challenging but with more card variety, the possible moves it makes also increases, so it keeps you guessing the first or even the second time you battle a particular opponent, which is nice. There's no multiplayer, for those more inclined to battle humans, so this feature lacking is going to put off some people, which is understandable but it's not a major gripe, in my opinion, obviously.In conclusion and to make a long story short, it's a casual card game that offers some solid gameplay with solid mechanics. It doesn't reinvent the wheel because it doesn't have to as far as card games are concerned but it stands out enough to warrant a look. And for it's price tag, it's a great steal. Buy it, play it, no real reason not to.			"

Glitches / bugsNone.SizeAbout 250 MoWorth priceThe game definitely deserves its full price!- Review below ----------------------------------------------------------------------Card City Nights is a Trading/Card game set in a Ittle Dew universe with cards from almost every universe of Ludosity if not all.You are a card gamer that wish to be the champion and to reach your goal you’ll need to obtain all 8 legendary cards to be able to compete in the biggest tournament/competition the city has never held in the past.The gameplay is easy to learn but you’ll need more than several attempts to have a perfect knowledge of the game. And you’ll mostly need to make different deck to counter or beat some tough opponents with a very specific deck.You begin each standard match with 10 HP and a number of cards set as well as your opponent. (unless you set a special name, refer to (*) at the end) Each player has their own 3X3 playing field. Each turn the player need to place a card on their field. The aim is to set your opponent health to 0 HP. To do so you need to connect cards together to make a combo. To connect 2 cards you need them to point toward each other with their arrows: like a card on the left will point toward a card on the right with its right arrow and the right card will point toward the left card with its left arrow. To make a combo you need to connect cards together to have 3 or more symbols of the same kind. There are 4 kinds of symbols: attack (red sword), defend (blue shield), revive (plus shape) and support. (yellow coin) And each card can have one or two symbols on it. The support reduces the number of symbols you need to connect. So if you place a 2-support-symbol card you only need to connect it with another symbol you wish. (attack, defend, revive or even support) If you connect 3 defend symbols you’ll get 3 shield points. If you connect 3 attack symbols, you’ll need to choose if you wish to attack your opponent or your opponent’s cards. If you attack your opponent, you’ll decrease his/hers shield or health points. But if you attack one of his/her cards, this card will be disabled and will stay in the field forever. Unless your opponent revives it by combining 3 or so revive symbols.So you can win a match by:-	attacking your opponent until he hasn’t any health point left-	disabling cards of your opponent to make his/her field full so he lost by forfeit.-	Drawing your opponent until he has no card left. He will take an increased damage every turn.When you defeat an opponent (a match can be done in 1, 2 or 3 sets) you earn gold and/or a specific booster pack. You can also earn gold coins by clicking in the scenery. Gold are the currency of the game: with it you can buy extra cards you already own or a skin for your field or fusion cards to make a new one.And two more main things. Each card has their own rarity and depending of it you can only have a limited number of the same card. You can have 3 same common cards, 2 same rare cards, 1 epic card of each kind and only one legendary for the whole deck. Cards can also have a very specific power that triggers while placing it on the field or doing a combo.Finally when you talk with people or fight opponent you’ll sometimes learn where is/are the next legendary card(s). You can always see all the cards and skin fields your own, sort the cards and make new decks.(*): Thanks to the 1.1 Valentine’s update Gamers and Hardcore-gamers can “enjoy” this game in their way.Gamer can play this game in a hard way by simply set his/her name to HardPlaya. He/she will begin each match with 4 HP and his/her opponent with 8 HP. Despite the difficulty there is no reward for beating this mode.Hardcore player can play this game in the very hard way by simply set his/her name as ReallyPlaya. He/she will begin each match with 1 HP and his/her opponent with 10 HP. Despite the tough difficulty there is no reward for beating this mode.			"

												A refreshing take on card games where the placement of cards deals damage, revives other cards, or heals you. Over 100 cards to collect, it basically has an entire booster ready to go.			"

												Don't do it - it's addictive, but hugely flawed as a game. With an offensive deck you have three ways of winning: reduce the enemy health (9% of the time), wear them down till they run out of cards (1%) or disable their cards until they run out of viable placements (90%). This last strategy is so effective that the game ceases to be fun - whatever cards the opponent has, they're not going to be able to use them. It's not an AI problem, the AI is fairly good - the problem is that there are too many ways of getting a 2-card attack while the computer opponent is lining up the normally required 3 cards. Usually if you can disable the card in the middle of their board they will end up not having any moves they can make, and you just win. It's a fundamental flaw with the game design. And the writing is full of that annoying ""zany"" American humour that also ruined Psychonauts for me. I thought I was enjoying this at the time, but having completed it, I regret it sadly.			"

												Reminiscent of older card-centric adventure games, Card City Nights carries you through a self-aware and contrived adventure to collect eight unique pieces from different bosses, and to challenge a final boss for a defined reward. The card game itself is fun and varied, and leaves many opportunities for customising one's own deck. While a direct and offensive tactic can be used to beat most opponents, each uses different strategies that can seriously complicate such an approach, making it optimal to research tactics and learn more about the individual card synergies.There is no penalty for losing and always a reward for winning, so it's very much so a gentle game for those who may be unfamiliar with battling card games in general, making it playable and appealing for new or veteran players alike.The music is enjoyable and adds flavour to the already living world, and the artwork is unforgettable and appealing, in that ""trying hard to look like it isn't trying hard"" way. The palette choices and composition are aesthetically pleasing and give the world a setting all its own, despite borrowing elements from many other games that the developers have made. The default gender for the player character and most npcs is female, with most characters being confident and punkish, breaking the common representation of female characters in video games as passive, mousey, and largely helpless.I loved this game every moment that I played it, and though it can be frustrating to find an opponent who is difficult to beat, that just requires more familiarity and effort with your deck. It's seriously a steal at its price.			"

												I like card games, but as I prefer single-player, don't want to spend money on extra cards, prefer simplicity, and like to take my time, there aren't too many games that fit the bill... but Card City Nights does!CCN's gameplay is straightforward, with cards having defensive, attack, or neutral effects, as well a number of arrows. You have 5 cards in your hand at one time, and take turns with your opponent to place a card done on a grid.  Create combos of 3 or more by connecting arrows between cards. Place them carefully, as when you run out of spaces you'll lose the round.  Since HP is capped at 10 and there are penalties for running out of cards, each round goes fairly fast and you won't get into stalemate situations.  It may not be as strategically deep as other card games where you have to manage resources etc., but it's easy to pick up, and fun.  In between card battles, you can organize your card decks, buy cards to augment your decks using virtual money (you can also get booster packs by battling, and there are no IAPs) and go around town to talk to other characters. The storyline is rather silly (but are you really playing a card game for the story?) and humourous.  The charmingly cartoony art fits the game well, as does the cheerful music.My only drawback is that the AI appears to be on the easy side so far, but as I've not gotten too far yet this may be something that fixes itself later on.Card City Nights may not be a super-challenging card game, but it's good for a breezy time of card-battling fun. For casual fans of the trading card genre, this could well hit the spot.EDIT: as I've progressed, the game has indeed become a little more tricky. The developers have also released a patch that should make the AI stronger, so consider me a happy camper :)			"

												card city nights is a concept that shouldn't work, i should totally hate it for being too frustrating and overcomplicating TCGs - which are already overcomplicatedbut i don't, it's actually really elegant in how it implements all its mechanics and i rarely feel as if i don't have a handle on how the game worksplus the music is great and the art is charming and the characters are all pretty fun; i was half-expecting this game to spew memes at me like a broken internet sewage-pipe but no gimmick or character outstayed their welcome and i never found myself getting annoyed by anyone i was made to deal with. it's punchy, it's self-aware without constantly having to remind the player of how self-aware it is, in short, it had enough personality where i didn't get bored but enough restraint to keep me from hating the presentationthis game really deserves online multiplayer, and i wish more people were into it so that the devs would have more of an impetus to make it sowhat i'm saying is that you should play this game			"

												An interesting and innovative collectible card game with a nice comic book aesthetic and solid story to progress through.There is the background exploration of the city and its characters and the various silliness going on, but the primary draw is the gameplay of the card game of course - and it plays pretty well, with it being fairly easy to pick up but there is a fair amount of strategic depth in both selecting your deck, and actual play of cards and reacting to what your opponent is doing. A key feature is that instead of being just another variant of existing card games with different stats used to basically do the same thing, the mechanics of how the game plays is completely different but reasonably easy to pick up. Then on top of that you get the standard variations to the rules added to the cards, but the triple aspects of the cards connections, the card type (attack, defense, etc.) and any special rules or bonuses makes for a lot of ways cards interact with each other, making deck building and gameplay pretty varied and tactical.Overall this is very easy to recommend for anyone that likes the genre as it combines a well thought out and innovative card game with a well polished wrapper around it.

Basic OverviewGameplay? 9/10, one of a kindStory? 6/10, straightforward, occasional funny dialogueReplayability? 5/10, depends on personThoughtsIt's a unique TCG game, I'd say it's a puzzle + TCG mix - it's not something that you would play absent-mindedly imo. You collect cards that have arrows on it and you line up the arrows to combo into different actions (attack/revive/defense). It sounds simple, but the game pulls it off really well and makes you consider if placing a certain card down into a certain position is the right thing to do. I'd say the level of difficulty really depends on the player, but I'd give it a medium difficulty. It's the uniqueness of this game that makes me recommend it, I can't think of any other TCG game currently that utilizes this style of gameplay. The storyline is average/straightforward, not particulary interesting but fun enough with humorous dialogue here and there. I wouldn't say this game is incredibly replayable - there aren't any ""random"" opponents to play that have really new strategies every single time, you'd be playing the same characters over and over again if you wanted to keep playing after defeating everyone. The AIs will stick to their playstyle - defensive, offensive, etc. I guess it really depends on if you *really* get sucked into the gameplay. For me, this is probably the only time I will be playing it through unless if new content was added. It was really compelling to finish the game and I found the experience thoroughly enjoyable; and here I am, writing a review days after buying the game and ""completing"" it - after completing it though, I just don't feel the urge to keep on playing and rebattling the revamped opponents (the game kicks up the difficulty a notch once you complete the storyline).It took me around ~15 hours to achieve 100% but I'd say 2-3 of those hours I spent idle/afk, also, I could probably get another hour or two of new gameplay in if I went ahead and challenged the ""revamped"" characters.Verdict? This game is well worth the money regardless if it's on sale or not. Give it a try.			"

												I bought this game when I only had a Netbook available to play games on. Had it on my wishlist since release and it's extremely cheap in comparison with some other games, so I just thought ""Why not?"" and bought it. After starting the game you choose a character and give yourself a name. You're new in town and how else could it be, the whole town is crazy for card battles. The main goal of the game is to collect all legendary cards by beating the owners of those cards and finally beat the Card King. On your way you get to see lots of crazy looking, humorous characters and get to hear some nice chilling-jazzy tunes.What I really like about this game is, that it's extremely fast and easy to learn, yet fun to manage your deck and finally use it in a card battle. To explain it very roughly, most Cards have arrows on them or some special effects and you just have to connect them on a 3x3 board to create combos using Cards that sum up to at least 3 Icons. Cards have one of four Icons on them, Attack, Defense, Revive and Neutral. Using attack Cards you can either attack your opponent and he'll loose ""defense"" (just like Health Points) or disable one of your opponent cards, so he can't use 'em until he revives them using Revive Cards. Using Defense Cards will fill up your defense until you reach the maximum of 10 defense. Neutral Cards can come in handy when connecting Cards. You win a game when your opponent can't place a card on his 3x3 Board or he runs out of defense. Most opponents give you a card booster as a reward and you can also buy or fuse cards. I haven't spent much time collecting Cards, I just went on with the Cards I owned and updated my deck now and then, mostly only changing the legendary Card or replacing one or two Cards from my deck with Cards I got from a Booster.While - at least in my opinion - you should never judge a game on how long it is (you don't pay 10 $ for a visit to the cinema and regret it because the movie was only 2 hours long, right?), Card City Nights entertained me for about 11 hours until I've beaten the whole game and got all the Achievements, which is quite long for a game that price. Instead a game should be judged by how fun it was to play and I really had fun playing it. I definitely recommend this game. It's fun, it's cheap, it has Steam Trading Cards and Steam Achievements. So: Why not?			"

												I picked this game up because I love trading card games. I've played a lot of YU-GI-OH back in the day and quite a lot of Magic the gathering and I'm familiar with a few other TCG's like Pokémon and Duelmonsters and this game is really cheap. I'll admit right away that I didn't really like the game because this card game is not my cup of tea but I can imagine there are a lot of TCG fans out there that will like it.The game pretty much is a card game, you battle opponents, gain boosterpacks to change your deck  and earn money to buy cards so you can take on stronger opponents. The game does have a storyline, all I know about it is that you have to collect the 8 legendary cards by defeating the holders of those cards so you can take on the champion of the game, but it's a card game so no need for a fancy story there anyway.Its kinda hard to explain how the card game works so it might be better looking up some gameplay videos but I'm gonna try anyway. Both players start with 7 shields (hp). You win the game if your opponent drops to 0 shields or if he can't play anymore cards. The playingfield consists of 3 by 3 spaces where you can play your cards, the goal is to create a combo of 3 cards and that will trigger a certain effect based on the types of the cards used in the combo which I'll explain later on. You must play one card a turn and you cannot remove any of the cards on the playingfield so if you donnot make combinations you'll run out of spaces and lose the game.There are 4 types of cards: defensive, offensive, revive and neutral. If you make a combination using 3 defensive cards you gain 3 shields, if you make a combination using 3 offensive cards you can deal 3 damage to the shields of your opponent or disable one of his cards on the playingfield, if a card is disabled it cannot be used for combinations and it just stays on the playingfield. Use a combination of 3 revive cards and you can re-enable a disabled card and neutral cards don't have any effect and are just used for making combinations. The way combinations are made is rather interesting. You can combine all 4 types of cards in the combinations, for example you can use 2 offensive cards and 1 defensive card in a combination, but ony one effect can happen based on the most cards of a single type within the combination so that means this combo does damage but does not give you additional shields and because there are only 2 offensive cards in the combo it only does 2 damage. The position of the cards on the playingfield also plays a role, the playingfield consists of 3 by 3 spaces and there are arrows on every card indicating in what directions they can make combo's, for example you place a card in the centre of the playingfield and it has 2 arrows, 1 pointing up and 1 pointing left. That means it can only make a combination with cards placed above or on the left of this card if however that card also has an arrow pointing towards it. I hope that kind of explained how the game works.The reason why I give the game a recomendation is because the card game is solid and I cannot deny that. Because it wasn't my cup of tea doesn't mean I cannot recomend it to others especially because it's cheap and solid. I won't give it a rating though because I would give it a low rating because there wasn't much fun to be had for me personally and I rate games based on the fun factor. If you like TCG's you should definitely try it because there is a fair chance you will like it and it's only 4 bucks (if not on sale). They're practicly giving it away.			"

												Absolutely fantastic little card game.  Everything just is really well polished and has great attention to detail.  The dialog is actually funny, the music is fantastic (even if a few tracks get a little repetitive), and the gameplay mechanics are original and work well.The only quibble I have with it is that most of it is a bit easy and the game is a bit short.  I'm a card vet of several different games, but still...I didn't even have to remake my deck for the second half of the game - once I got the legendary that worked with my deck style I was pretty much set (basic attack spam deck).  That same deck easily defeated all of the challengers, except for one or two where it was a little close.  Took me about 6 hours to go through the story mode, a bit longer to finish up all the crafts and beat the 'upgraded' bosses.Overall, I had a surprisingly fun time with it.  Really wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was.  Easily 9/10.  Just wish they'd make a follow-up.			"

												It's not the most balanced or in-depth CCG, but it oozes a charm that I've come to expect from a Ludosity game. PROs:-The cards have personality to them-The mechanics are fairly innovative. It's not a MTG, Yu-gi-oh, or hearthstone clone.-The art is stylized and fun-The dialogue is silly and each NPC feels unique.-It's only $4MIX:-Standard CCG RNG. Can be frustrating, but it's kind of inherent to the genre.-Most matches are fairly easyCONs:-The final opponent of the main story is unfair. Like, it's the point, but it's still annoying.-Some people might find the music repetitive-You're not going to be able to have endless new and interesting matches.Overall, I find this game to be incredibly enjoyable, not for the gameplay, which is fine, but for the heart and effort that went into character design and dialogue. I was motivated to get good at the game so I could see who the next character would be and what cute little jokes they would tell.			"

												Oh my god, where to start? This is one of my favorite games that I own, hence the 8/8 achievments.This is a virtual card game, It has a 3 by 3 grid where you connect 3 symbols (shown on the card) of any of the 4 types: attack, defense, revive, and neutral. You have all sorts of variation in cards, making it always interesting. You can get booster packs, which give you 5 cards, which you can either put in your deck of 40, recycle into new packs, sell, combine, etc. I love just marveling at my large collection of rare cards, and going to destroy some AI enemy I have already dominated 30 times because, even with the easiest enemies, it never gets old.There is no multiplayer, but frankly, it does not matter to me, the AI is fun enough.Final Verdict: Buy or I kill you.

The consistently charming dialogue, endearing art-style and the low-stakes nature of the plot will bring a smile to your face. The laid-back jazz and hip hop infused soundtrack is perfect for spending those lonely, quiet nights. The game is surprisingly meaty given its low cost. It took me about 10 hours to play my way through the main story, and there's some post-game content to clean up as well.			"

tl;dr -> Wanted a card game besides Hearthstone/Magic TCG to play, so I tried CCN. 11/10 made me nostalgic of Final Fantasy 8's Triple Triad minigame.I got this game from the Humble Bundle store when it was heavily discounted and was excited to play it because I've always loved card games. I was satisfied with my gameplay experience.The aesthetics are nice - the artstyle is cute and charming. There is a large variety of cards to collect and use, each with its own unique picture and text flavor. The sounds and music are decent, however, I quickly muted the latter in favor of my own. You can buy different game boards to place your cards on during matches, and your opponents will often have their own boards that are distinct from the default one. The story is highly reminiscent of a hybrid between Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh - you must obtain 8 legendary cards to qualify for a hefty gold prize, playing against an assortment of different characters along the way. Controls are super simple and consist of mouse clicks. There is a helpful tutorial in the beginning that will show you most of the things you need to know, however, I found that some aspects of the game have to be discovered through play. For example, many possible strategies will be more salient to you when you've encountered them in a match - like using mainly defence cards to outlast/fatigue your opponent. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with trading card games. You may have to do a bit of grinding at times to farm enough cards/money to build better decks. A big thing I didn't like about this game is how you cannot just scrap decks (you can have 6 built at a time) to start from scratch - you have to manually click and drag 25 cards from your ""deck list"" to your ""total cards list"" one-at-a-time. Gameplay consists of placing a single card from your hand of 5 onto a gameboard every turn - the board can hold a maximum of 9 cards, and filling it will cause you to lose the following turn. You will also start to take increasing damage every turn if you run out of cards. Cards have a certain number of differently-oriented arrows along the border. You must chain combos by matching up arrows between cards. Each card has an icon on it (a shield, sword, circle, or healing cross). Once you have matched at least 3 icons together (usually meaning 3 cards; they cannot all be circle icons), you will trigger an action. Shields provide you with +1 health/defence per icon, swords do +1 damage per defence icon, circles are neutral icons, and healing crosses will reactivate cards. When you chain together an attack action, you can either attack your opponent's health, or one of his/her cards. Attacking a card (regardless of damage) will cause it to be deactivated, preventing it from being used to chain arrows. They will stay on the board, and accumulating too many disabled cards may result in you filling up your board with 9 cards, resulting a loss on your next turn. To revive cards, you must chain together healing icons. These cards are also useful because it will immediately remove all cards that are linked to it (possibly saving you from filling up your board with useless cards). Since cards with healing icons always have at least 2 icons, this means you can usually revive a card using only 2 cards (versus your usual 3 card set). Later, as you unlock more cards, you will encounter cards that may have 2 shield, sword, or circle icons. Many cards will have an extra effect - for example, ""placement"" effect cards will trigger something (deal 1 damage to your opponent, gain +1 HP, or lose 1 card from your deck) once they are placed on the board. Other cards may rotate 180 degrees or move horizontally every turn, allowing you to pull off creative strategies and synergies. An effect you will frequently see is attack/defence/revive combos, which are effects triggered when using certain actions with that card. For example, a card may have an attack combo that removes a target card - using that card in an attack action will allow you to remove any card that has been played. Note, however, that chaining this card with different icon types (ex: shield) and using it to perform a different action (ex: increasing your HP) will not trigger the attack combo effect. Rarer cards will have multiple effects, and many cards with significant effects (ex: deal an extra +1 damage) will have a trade-off to balance things (card starts off deactivated, or it deals 1 damage to the owner whenever it is disabled). Matches may be a best of 1, 3, or 5. At the end of every match, you will usually be given a booster pack with 5 cards of random rarity and/or some gold. You can sell cards at the mall for gold, and also purchase new ones. You may sometimes have to beat opponents before unlocking more difficult ones (including bosses that will give you a legendary card for beating them). Overall, the game plays fairly well and is a nice time-filler for anyone interested in the trading card genre. The arrow-connect style of play is also a nice change from your typical Magic TCG/Yu-Gi-Oh style of placing monsters/characters to down to fight each other. Matches are usually very quick - easily one of the quickest trading card game I've encountered. If you enjoy playing with cards, then you should definitely give this a try.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue ReviewsMy Website[theroguereviews.com] "

												I haven't played through much of the adventure yet but definitely intend to. The story is fun, quirky and well written.The mechanics around the card battles are clever and building up skill and effective strategy will take some time - I often place a card and immediately kick myself for making silly mistakes!The music fits the atmosphere well but can get a little repetitive if you make a conscious effort to notice.The developers engage with the community well and the first patch was released just the next day, paying attention to bugs that had been reported.Myself and others have expressed some disappointment that you cannot restart the game from scratch and again, the developers have responded saying that it will be included in the next patch.I found another bug without knowing it whilst doing my First Look video on YouTube (below) and the developers have responded directly to my video and will be fixing that too!So the game is not perfect but is a lot of fun and it is clear that a lot of time and effort has gone into the balance of mechanics that is definitely required in a game like this.What would I change? The lack of multiplayer. A multiplayer mode would compliment this game perfectly.I intend to play the game to completion and will be posting my first episode of a series later this evening.Oh, I almost forgot to mention the price - more than reasonable. Currently on sale @ 50% off but I would have bought this game without a doubt at the 100% price. A very affordable quality indie game for the price of a burger - a definite win!My first look at this very cool game:

												I don't normally like card games much, and probably wouldn't have looked at this title twice under normal circumstances. But I had a coupon for 90% off, it looked nice, had mostly positive reviews and promised to be something different from the usual card game. So I purchased this game anyway. And I must say it's one of the better decisions I have ever made, as this game is quite fun to play.The gameplay is somewhat different from any card game I have ever played before, with each player placing cards on a 3x3 board. Most cards have arrows indicating which directions they can be linked to other cards, and an icon which designates which effect the card will have (attack, defence, revive and coin). The aim is to reduce your opponents defence to zero while preventing them from doing the same to you by chaining cards with a total value of 3 or more icons. Although it's game over when one of the players has filled up their board and cannot place a card at the start of their turn.Difficulty starts out quite easy, with your opponents mostly killing themselves by filling up their boards before you even have a chance to finish them off properly. But after the first couple of locations are dealt with the AI quickly steps up its game. All the opponents seem to have different strategies, as well as different cards in their decks, so what was a winning strategy for one opponent may fail completely with the next. The game easily allows for different strategies to be employed by giving the user a total of six different card decks, so you could for example have one deck which is primarily an attack deck, another wich focuses on defense, another which quickly discards cards from an opponents deck (I forgot to mention, when a deck reaches zero the player takes 1 point of damage each turn, even if they have a shild activated. And dies when they have no cards left to play.) and another which... well, you get the idea. Although I could find no way to completely remove a deck once created.The game is beautifully presented in all aspects. The cartoon graphics are first class, the music is pretty good and provides a nice ambiance, and the plot is mildly amusing if perhaps a little ridiculous.One feature I would have really liked to see in this game, and I feel is a bit of a glaring omission is some kind of online two player mode. I'd really like to test my Card City Nights skills against human opponents, as beating the AI can be a bit too easy once you know what you're up against.Overall I'd give this game 8.8/10. While it was really quite fun to play there is little to make me want to come back to it after completing the game, 100%-ing the achivements and beaten every opponent at least once. That and a lack of any kind of two-player mode prevents this game from breaking the 9 point barrier.			"

												Wasn't expecting much after receiving this game (as well a DRM-free copy and print and play pdf version) along with other stuff on recent Humble Bundle sale. But it captured my attention. A cute little card game with a unique twist and simple gameplay, but still having some brain crunching in deck building. At first it was a bit awkward to get used to this spacial placement of cards in a grid and connections between them. Especially when trying to figure out which cards with how many connections and what directions do you need while building a deck. Btw, don't make too many decks as you will have 25 cards wasted per deck, if you don't really want some of them anymore. No way to delete a deck and get back those 25 cards. I needed just one to complete the game and it stayed 70% unaltered for second half of the game. Either i'm so good at deck building or i was lucky to strike the attack/defence/trick balance early. Only in the end i faced an intended roadblock and was forced to switch to a secondary all attack deck and then wiped that last foe easily. You might need a second deck to complete some achievements. I wasn't so lucky (if possible at all) to receive a card with 8 connections, so doing 9 cards combo and 10 attack combo would be easy. But i had fun completing them with just a 5 connections card. That was tough, luck involved, but satisfying after all.Now i'm sitting and looking at print and play pdf and thinking that i would rather pay for published game. But maybe i will print it to play with my friends.			"

												A nice little puzzle game. The card game itself is fun and interesting. A fair amount of strategy & thought is required when playing, especially if you haven't tailored your deck for your opponent. The cards have a good variety of different and interesting effects.The art is good, but the story is kind of basic.If you play well, no grinding will be required, but it does take a *lot* of grinding to complete your card collection. You aren't particularly pushed toward completing your collection, though -- there isn't even an achievement for it.			"

												What a great little game!  The core card game is light but perfectly serviceable, and the surrounding game is set up perfectly.  It's fun to steadily make your deck better (and try new things) as you wander around fighting different enemies and meeting new people/sapient fish things.  The setting, graphics, music, and characters are all great.  The little touches like the card recycling system and the fusion thingee not only make the card ""economy"" smooth, they're super entertaining in their own right (what do you get when you combine ""Ice Wand"" with ""Old Man""? In retrospect it's obvious...).I wish there was more of this game, but I can't call that a complaint for a game so very cheap.  I do wish heavier games (eg. MtG) could get a game like this.  You should buy this game.  It may take a little play for it to sort of ""click"", but once it does this is just a really great gaming experience.			"

												I picked up Card City Nights when it was on sale for $2.00, and after having played it I am happy to say that it is easily worth its full price of $4.00 if not more. Card City Nights is a lot of fun and combines the elements of card collecting and battling. Pros:The three things that I would say set this game apart from other card games would be the card battle system, the graphics and the fact that earning a new booster pack is as simple as defeating an opponent (no cash shop). The battle system is similar to card battling in Final Fantasy VIII but with various factors that allow you to create decks with different win conditions (Attack, Defense, Board Control. The graphics are skillfully done and keep the game feeling fun.Cons:The main con for me was that the game is somewhat short. At casual playspeed it took me 8 hours to beat the game. I had so much fun that I was sad to beat it. If there was more content to this game I could see people easily spending $20+ for it. As far as other cons, the only thing that comes to are some minor UI problems that the developers have been quickly fixing.Overall this game is a hidden treasure and I highly recommend it to any strategy/card game lovers.

												A perfect game for very casual play, such as while watching tv, during commercials and such-like. (So I'm confessing that most of the hours that I've logged here are not actually playing hours, but mostly watching tv with the game sitting idle hours.) In this game you play to win booster packs against AI opponents with increasingly good decks and strategies. You can also get booster packs by turning in excess duplicate cards (recycling) and by merging cards in certain combinations (alchemy). You might need a certain amount of OCD or hoarder mentality to really appreciate this game, but if you like collecting stuff, this game may well suit you as well as it suits me. The achievements for this game are truly notable achievements. You may well have to get near endgame and then take your uberdeck back to challenge one of the very early—and easy—opponents to get most of them.			"

												A charming Card Game. The basics are ""Combine this card with another card so the arrows line up on each other"". And that's all you basically do. I wasn't drawn into this game really, since it's pretty much a farming Card Game.Let me explain: You fight against someone and you can get a Booster Pack. That is the ONLY way to get a booster pack as far as I've seen it. The game gives you coins from which you can buy new Boards (cosmetic) or cards. Cards you already own to be exact. So you have to beat one guy over and over to have a chance of a new card. Why can't I buy booster packs with higher rarities with my money I earned?Personally, I can not recommend it, since it feels too farm-intensive to be truly enjoyable. The graphics and the music are quite nice to be honest.			"

Even though it's only Single-Player it would be great to see a nice future feature with online play and possible additional cards that you can get via dlc or even better a workshop feature where you can make your own custom card for the game and win it through winning or playing against other people to earn it.Overall the game is great even though it lacks some small stuff but even with those small issues it's still a great game to have especially at it's special promotion (get it now for $1.99)			"

Posted: February 18, 2014
												(Need a tl;dr? Just go buy the freaking game.)I would like to start out by saying that I have a lot of experience with TCG's. I played Magic: The Gathering for a while, and I liked it but I was never in love with it. The game that I really fell in love with was Yugioh- which, from about 2010 to early 2012, was the best card game of all time, no holds barred, perfect pacing, for most of those formats well balanced, all playstyles were represented, and most importantly a deep, deep, deep, DEEP card pool that constantly rewarded me for scrolling through lists of cards, pointing at a random one with weird subtext and saying ""I'm gonna make a deck around that one!"" But eventually, konami ruined everything, the game sped up until it was too fast, the power crept up until I couldn't build a creative deck and survive against anyone competent for more than a turn or two, and the community got even worse. The state that it was in was much akin to the happy accidents of ""Super Smash Bros. Melee"" or ""Marvel vs. Capcom 2"" in that they probably didn't actually think about how the things they added affected the meta game, but eventually it somehow turned out fantastic. I'm saying all of this because Card City Nights reminds me of this era of yugioh. Very different gameplay, yes, but I'm not talking about the gameplay. There are two very important things that this game gets very right and other digital tcg's get very very wrong: card collection and deck building.When you play hearthstone, and even scrolls (despite mojang having no motive to do so since it already costs 20 bucks), you might notice that you get like, 1-2 packs a day. Even if you get really good at drafting in hearthstone, you get a good pack or two every hour- if you're really, really good and really, really lucky. Card city nights, on the other hand, gives you a pack like every 5 minutes. And then gives you the option to use your extra cards to get more packs. And then gives you a fusion system to get more cards. And gives you a large singles shop. Seriously, collecting all the cards available to you in their maximum usable quantities seems so doable in this game, whereas every other online tcg asks me to grind for weeks or months just to finish my damn deck!Perhaps the best part of the fact that Card City Nights gives you so many cards, is that the deck building involves a lot of creativity and strategy and is just overall fantastic. Deckbuilding in other games seems very one-dimensional compared to Card City Nights... Cards fit together in unique ways, and not only do you have to think about your strategy and what each card is contributing to your strategy and the synergies between them and all of that stuff, but you have to think about the synergy between their arrows, think about the combos you could make with this deck... it adds a lot of depth to deck building. I'm not entirely sure if it was intentional or a byproduct of the gameplay, but either way I love it. Other than that, for a game I spent $2 on, the card pool is impressive (with an implication of more cards coming at the end) and the cards are designed well, giving some good strategies and combinations to build decks around without enforcing them as cards that need to be used together.So all this should come together to be a great card game, right? Well, this review unfortunately ends in tragedy, as Card City Nights lacks a key component to this equation- multiplayer. It practically ruins everything I've just said. I can build all these great decks and collect all these cards and it won't mean anything in the end, because there's no ultimate test of my deck against another and there's no one who cares about my innovation when it's all within a relatively easy single player game. However, it's not a stretch to say that, in the event that online is patched in, and more cards are released, and the game is balanced a bit for competitive play, this could become the best tcg on the market.It has a good base and a fun singleplayer, even if it lacks some fundamental elements necessary for it to become really great. It's worth the price of admission, and it could eventually be worth 100 times that if the game's potential is explored. In the end I still had a great time with it, even if it never becomes more than it is.			"

Gameplay OverviewThis game can be reviewed pretty straight forward.Its a card game. There are attack cards,defend,revive cards, and cards that have special effects.Thit not a fantasy styled card game,but keeps the strategy of card games to heart.There are different varieties of cards :Legendary (8 only),Rare,Uncommon, and Common. There are various ways you can get cards in the game which from trying them all are relatively pain free. You can grind battle and win packs,buy cards from the mall,take your unwanted cards and trade them in for a random deck, and even take two cards and turn them into a different one. Combining cards is not random they have specific combinations they can have. The battle is pretty simple, you have best out 1,3, and 5 as far as victory conditions. Each player has  7 life points and each card can do anywhere from 1-4 attack points depending on if they have a bonus.Default max for attack,revive,defend is 2.From my playing the  Boss A.I. seem to be sorta cheaters but I am not fully sure.Each boss I card battled against more often then the regular fights could counter at least 80% of my strategies.This becomes far more shown when you are 1-3 attacks away from winning. Aside from that, the game is simple but fun, kept me playing til the very end. If you want to kill 5min just doing some card battles this game is simple enough to get into and have fun with.			"

												A fun little game, if a bit unbalanced. It starts quite difficult when you have to face opponents with well-built decks following established strategies, while your deck is made of whatever trash cards you could get. But when you can customize your deck, it gets easier and easier, and once you get the legendary card ""Ittle Dew DX"" you've pretty much finished the game.The balance isn't that deep. I started with a balanced attack/defense game, but it's much more effective to go all-out attack (fun) or defense to stall until the opponent doesn't have any cards left (lame and tedious). Not much replayability, but I had 5 fun hours and they were worth the price.			"

												CCN is a deck-building card game. I am a fan of easy going time wasters like Faerie Solitaire rather than more complex trading card games like Magic. The video, good player reviews and the great price (2 Euros) made it quite a no-brainer for me and I wasn’t a disappointment. The basic rules are really simple, and even though there are lots of special cards/rules, it isn’t exactly mind-bending (and I mean that in a good way) the gameplay is still fast and fluent. I haven’t completed the game yet (about 80%) but definitely will. The NPC players have different playing styles what makes the deck-building worthwhile (as it should be in a single-player game). The overall difficulty progression feels good to me. Replay value is most likely not that big, at least at my current point of view. Nevertheless, thumbs up for an entertaining for a nice game. "

												Card City Nights, aptly named is a CCG that oozes style.          Will you be fond of said style?  [Idk bro, check the Screenshots.]   C.C.N is a comforting collectable card game or ""CCCG"" for short, filled with eccentric characters and set to a Jazz/Hip Hop inspired soundtrack.   The Gameplay is a hybrid of match three and tradtional card game fare set on a 3X3 Board.  A blasé story and quirky cast build a comforting yet interesting atmosphere.   If you are a fan of the genre and are looking for a one off, a new take or something casual then I would highly reccomend C.C.N.TLDR: Cute, Comfy, Casual & Fun!  [] Single Player  [] Short Length [] Collectable Card Game  [] Great Art and Sound (IMO).			"

												A quite interesting casual card game. This is very different from any other card games that I've ever played. It has fun and original gameplay mechanic. The graphics, story, and characters are weird in a good way. The soundtracks are good and they fit the graphics well. However, this game lacks of multiplayer feature. I think it'd be fun to play against real player.About the enemies, you'll find them easy to beat in early stage of the game because they only play standard cards. I can make sure you will make a good deck quickly enough because it's easy to get the gold to buy the cards you want/need. You can also get booster packs by defeating certain enemies. At later game, the bosses have ridiculously strong cards in their decks. It's kinda a puzzle on how to create a specific deck to beat a certain boss which I think that's the most challenging part of the game. But of course, luck is always involved in every card games.

												8/10A great concept for a CCG, executed pretty well.Absolutely fantastic music (get the soundtrack, man, it's so cheap on Steam).Great references and subtle statements about the corporate life ;)Game's basically a CCG Pokemon.The game's got great card synergy potential, but of course, has its OP cards. Although, the nature of the game allows almost any card to be countered pretty easily. The moment I played through the first fight, I knew I'd be going for a full Attack deck 'cause it's basically a fast tempo deck; Quick damage to the enemy.The enemies past the first two areas finally start to challenge you, but the initial battles felt way too easy. The AI basically plopped cards randomly onto the board. It really gave me a sense of, ""this is gonna be bad."" But eeeh, it turned out great.The music is so freakin' good, it's definitely got to be one of the reasons I couldn't let the game go in my most recent, 9 hour session.. Instrumental hip hop beauty, like nectar to the ears :PThe developers really liked to give their stance on the corporate life. So subtle, so Business Casual. It didn't take away from the game all that much, but the issue goes back to the intial battles.... Making battles far too easy to make the enemy player seem incompetent. It kind of ruins the flow of difficulty.Either way, great game, very much a throwback to Pokemon as far as story, goals, and battles come into play. The two points lost were due to the integral loss of difficulty and certain card combinations _somewhat_ breaking the game. Would play again in the future, most definitely.			"

												I bought Card City Nights in May of 2014 for 99 cents and almost two years to the date, finally started and finished the game after around 13 hours.  I only used my mouse and didn't try the other control methods, or was even aware there were any.  True to its name, Card City Nights is a collectible card game with a strong focus on combat.  As a new arrival to the island, you quickly learn about the game and how everyone is positively bonkers about it.  The plot is fairly basic--find the eight Legendary cards and face the Card King in combat for the million-coin prize.  The protagonist resists at first, but they have a free deck of cards and there are plenty of people to face, so why not?  The tutorial gave a pretty easy overview of the rules.  You and your opponent each have a 3x3 board, a coin is flipped to determine who goes first, and you both draw five cards to form your hand.  Then it's a matter of linking your cards' arrows together in order to attack, defend, and recover.  You lose if your life hits zero, if you fill your board and can't place a card, or if you completely run out of cards to play.  Matches are played in best of 1/3/5 format, and there didn't seem to be a penalty for losing other than having to start that fight over from the beginning.  Several cards have a variety of effects, such as one reviving a random downed card and then disappearing off board, or moving to an open space every time you start your turn, or having an additional effect depending on what kind of combo it's a part of.  And like most other card games, most of the game takes place outside of battle where you try to put together a deck that can't be beat.  You have to build a deck of 25 to 40 cards, and you're allowed five dupes of common cards, three of uncommon, only one rare, and only one total Legendary per deck, so there's a lot of options.  My interest in the game kinda waned until I woke up and just made a deck from scratch, paying attention to arrows and effects I wanted.  Everyone in the game uses a different deck though they only stick to one, so you could honestly tailor a deck around destroying specifically everyone as you play.  In battle, you're at the mercy of RNG on your draws as well as what the opponent feels like using on you, but outside of perceived biases, the game felt fair about random targets.  Kinda hard to say that when victory is snatched from you with a convenient draw for your opponent, though.  I was kinda surprised at how much dialog there is.  You can talk with several people at each location and everyone has quite a few things to say, especially if you can fight them since they'll have different things then.  Of course this is entirely optional, but it's kinda neat.  Characters have things to say about other people, or you, or other things.  One NPC in the mall had what felt like 100 things to say, though thankfully that wasn't the norm.  That all of the characters come from prior Ludosity/Daniel Remar games might be a treat to some, seeing familiar faces in different roles (and on the cards), but this was my first so I'll be facing retroactive recognition whenever I go back for Ittle Dew and pick up some of the others.  As for things I didn't like...I initially didn't like that you couldn't outright buy new cards.  When the shop unlocks early in the story, you're only able to buy extra copies of the non-Legendary cards you have already.  To get new cards, you have to fight certain NPCs for their boosters (or trade them in later on), so you're at the mercy of RNG for what cards you receive, but each booster NPC provides only one specific pack and each card is tied to a specific booster.  You can keep fighting them to eventually get the cards you want, but my only other complaint is that there's no card catalog to fill out.  It'd have been especially helpful to at least see what cards you have/have seen/haven't seen so as to know how to get that amazing card you saw your opponent use and to scratch that completionist's itch, but I guess the guides on Steam have you covered there if you want to do some cross-referencing.  Overall, I liked CCN and I think it's definitely worth the buck I gave for it.  If you're into card collecting or deck building or whatnot, you'd probably like it too.  Difficulty is kinda hard to pin down since each person has their own deck setup, so you can go from being stonewalled to being locked down to being blitzed to being drained of cards.  You'll probably have to lose your first fights with everyone so you can learn their decks and how to counter them, so that might turn some people off.  But as someone who seems to have interest in card games but rarely plays them, this was not a waste of time at all.			"

Posted: February 21, 2014
												Having grown up with such single player card games as the Pokemon TCG and Yu-Gi-Oh: The Sacred Cards, I was instantly drawn to this game. And I enjoyed it. That isn't to say the game is perfect. It has a number of flaws, some inherent to being a single player card game, and others that are the problem with the game itself. I'll list the pros, cons, and things that are more up to a person's taste.Pros:-Unique gameplay. Unlike a regular card game like MTG, this game is played on a 3x3 board and the cards have arrows on them. You must connect cards using the arrows and then use them for attack or defense (depending on the card symbols). I can't really think of a game that has utilized this style of gameplay, and the fresh take on the rather traditional style of card games is a nice break from the games that are more in the style of MTG. -References galore. If you played any of this dev's previous games, you'll probably get a heap of enjoyment out of all the references made. -Deck progression. I guess that's a good term for this. Traditional card games you usually end up just buying a number of cards, and you have a solid deck right off the bat. I enjoy the progression of a single player card game, replacing worse cards for better cards as you continue to play the game. -Cost. I purchased this for $2. Regular price is $4. You'll probably see it going on sale during the Summer/Winter sale for $1. I'm basing this review off the $2 price point. You won't be getting a full card game for $2 (not unless you're insanely good at Hearthstone's Arena). I bought it with money I made selling Steam Trading Cards. Cons:-Very Easy. I didn't lose a single best of three or best of five. Even the final boss I beat with three wins in a row. They very much need to ramp up the AI. They make some very silly plays that have the put a card in a location where they are unable to connect to anything. -Weak story. To be fair, who expected a good story from a card game? Still, it's a con. -No multiplayer. For a $4 indie title, this isn't much of a surprise. I personally don't care, as I was looking for more of a single player experience, but plenty of people will definitely find this to be a black mark against the title.-Lack of variety. The card effects basically boil down to: attack, defense, disable, revive, rotate, remove, move. While the connect three mechanic helps make up for this overall, it does prevent the game from being more enjoyable. I like me some crazy card effects.Up to Personal Taste:-Art style. I'm neutral to the art style. That's generally how I am for most games. Look at the screenshots and decide for yourself if the art style is going to throw you off.-Humor. The game seems to be trying to go for some humor. I chuckled once, and that was it. However, I didn't find the humor to be intrusive to the experience. Btw, game took me 11 hours to beat. In my opinion, that's a solid amount of time for $2.Anybody who enjoyed the old Pokemon TCG game or the Yu-gi-oh Single-Player games, I'd very much recommend getting this. To people who enjoy card games, I'd suggest giving this a shot. The price is low enough that it really won't hurt to give it a try. I had fun with it, which is why I'm giving it the good old thumbs up. Hope this helps with your purchasing decision! :D			"

												Well, this game was certainly a lot of fun. I for one love card games and in Card City Nights, I have to say, I was quite entertained and throughly enjoyed it. Initially, it was a bit uninspiring with the first few battles and trying to build my own deck.  However, that quickly subsided as I progressed throughout the game and was presented with specific goals and opponents. The game itself is cheerful, and funny with a nice simple yet colorful design and aesthetic. The soundtrack is amazing as well, probably one of the best, if you like jazzy tunes. This is well worth the amount you'll pay for it (discount or not). Great casual card game to relax with.			"

												This game has cards that are strictly better than other cards. At some point in the game, you get into a situation where you need to grind for better cards by continuously re-battling opponents. If the card game felt super-awesomely fun, this would be perfectly acceptable, but it tends to feel more frustrating and anti-fun than I'd expect in a game. Some battles are best of three or even best of five, which is normal for how card games work, but just feels like kind of a repetitive slog. This would be more fun as a mobile game (and it IS available on mobile platforms) where you're not sitting down and expecting a game to provide you with an evening of entertainment. As a desktop game, it's kind of lacking in the entertainment department when you look at all the other games you could be playing on PC that you can't play on a mobile device.I'm not a big fan of most turn-based games for the PC, though (but I prefer it for mobile games). Usually, it's because they lack the level of excitement that you get from time constraints and developing reflexes and hand-eye coordination. This game certainly doesn't go the extra mile to buck that trend and provide a sense of excitement and engagement.I like the art style, writing, and music. I just don't much care for sitting at my computer playing what feels like a mobile game. Also, I find the mechanics of the card game  and the game in general to be frustrating, especially with cards that have random abilities, cards being strictly better than other cards, and having to grind to get better cards.

												I unfortunatley feel that I should give this a negative recommendation, simply because I didn't enjoy playing this game. That said, I don't think that's because it's badly made or anything. But it completely failed to inspire me in ways I expect from customised deck construction games.I appreciate that the game is self contained. In fact, I was hopeful I would like this simply for that fact alone. I've largely given up on most deck construction games (digital and print) simply because of that lack of self containment. Those few that I do still play are either LCGs that I stopped buying when there's enough cards to build a decent range of decks, or long out of print games that aren't ever going to get bigger than they already are. But I'd also like something electronic that I could play like that same vein. Card City Nights clearly isn't going to be that for me.The biggest problem for me is that I just didn't care about the cards. Without that inspiration, I looked at the deck design screen and felt zero motivation to refine my deck and eke out those tiny optimisations that I like to obsess over in this genre of game. I think this comes down to the interdependency between all the cards. Almost all the cards are only conditionally useful. It just ends up feeling to my CCG-addled brain that this is a card game made up solely of suboptimal cards. From an objective mechanical standpoint, that's fine. But to me personsally, it just feels like I don't get what I actually want from a CCG-like game. Those moments where I draw exactly the right card or discover an unorthodox combo to turn the game around feel completely absent.			"

												A highly addictive card game that brings a different approach to a CCG. The game involves connecting cards on a 3x3 grid with arrows to make combinations to attack the opponent. The graphics are colourful and the game doesn't take itself too seriously with a whitty dialogue. The music whilst battling is absolutely amazing, a chilled hip-hop instrumental really adds a relaxing vibe while you plan your strategy. The game has much replayability as you you will be given random card packs after beating an opposition so you can always go back and try to collect them all. For such a cheap price it's an easy recommendation, especially for the soundtrack.			"

												Card City Nights is a fun and challenging single player grid base card game. In the game you play as a kid who just found out about a new card game that has become real popular. By playing with some kids you find out about 8 Legendary cards that if all collected let you face the card king. The gameplay is a 3-3 grid per player where you place cards with arrows any try to connect them for combo effects. There are 4 different types of cards Attack (damage/disable), Defense (heal), Revive (recover disable) and Neutral (any). Comboing cards and using special effects makes the game a blast. You can build your deck however you want and there are a lot of ways to beak opponents such as milling, (removing cards from deck) or board crowding (filling up opponents board). Every deck has its weakness and even the best player is vulnerable. The cards themselves are past games the developer has done and its adds nice style and character to the game. The price for the game itself is a steal at 4 dollars due to the game lasting 12+ hours. Overall if you have any interest in card games or want to see a new version of Triple Triad pick up this game now!			"

												This game is a lot of fun if you like casual card battle games.  I think people who are complaining of a lack of depth did not play long enough.  After you defeat the first few bosses, the enemy tactics change from just a straight-up attack or defense strategy to really making use of 'special power' cards that you have to account for if you are going to survive.  It probably does lack the complexity of of some other card games, but the entry barrier is also a lot lower which makes it more fun than work.  My only complaint is that I find the interface outside of the card game a bit clunky, but during the card game it is fine.  It would be nice to have a better way to manage and sort cards for deck building.  For the price, it's worth a try!			"

												This a very innovative card game, definitely worth playing. Doesn't matter if you're new to card games, the game starts of fairly easy.In this game you must connect at least 3 cards (the cards have arrows on them) in order to attack, defend or revive (enable previously disabled cards). Opponents & you can also rotate and disable cards.I think the price for this game is reasonable, but you can also grab it when it's on sale.You know what to do when this game gets on sale ;) "

												Wow.A really unique and interesting card system, fully fleshed out single player, and a charming art style that uses a lot of somewhat obscure indie game characters.  All I can really say is I hope this game does well enough that it can get a proper sequel with multiplayer.  Only real downside is it's singleplayer only, and you will likely finish everything after 5 hours or so.   Still, for only $4 (even cheaper on sale) it's definitely worth it for anyone who likes card games.			"

												This was a very surprising game! Albeit quite short. ~8 hours, which I had done in one sitting.It's different from most card games; original in execution. Interesting mechanics. The music! So good! Relaxing and engrossing. Made the duels less redundant. Memorable characters, seeing that most of them are turnips, some weird floating gems, or other such surprises. O.oAt $2 (sale) I'd say it was worth the experience.			"

												A remarkably fun card game that simply oozes character. The card game itself is fun and quite varied if you explore the different cards and their uses. Perhaps the final battle is a tiny bit too ramped up in difficulty, but otherwise a nice diversion if you're looking for something laid back and charming.			"

												(7/10)Cute little card game.  The basic dynamics are pretty simple and fairly easy.  It actually reminds me quite a bit of the card game from Final Fantasy 8.  There is some strategy though  a fairly equal portion of luck in the actual play.  I would honestly really have enjoyed the whole thing if not for a quite spectacularly unfair 'final' boss fight that took a bit of the shine off the whole experience. "

												Card City Nights might be the best adventure game about playing a card game since Pokemon Trading Card Game for the Gameboy Color.I play a lot of games and most of them I don't play for very long. I am a casual player and don't have the patience for anything ""hardcore"" or otherwise overly time consuming. So I usually play fairly shallow ""casual"" games and then figure out what the mechanics are and get bored, or I try deeper games and then the difficult ramps up too high for casual play.So far this has been a game which I keep going back to because the difficulty ramps up gradually, introducing interesting variations on the core mechanic. For instance, I built an attack-heavy deck and was coasting through most battles until I got to an opponent that had a better attack-oriented deck than mine. I was at an impasse, but then one of the characters recommended that I try going for disabling cards instead of dealing direct damage. Great suggestion! Now I'm thinking future opponents will try this strategy on me and I'm considering adding more revival-type cards to my deck. What I appreciate about this game is that it's got me thinking about strategies without going into hardcore deck building territory. However, it's not a shallow game like you find with, for instance, most mobile games. There's a story, characters, and a progression of mechanics so you're not just playing the same board over and over. It's the perfect mix of narrative and strategic depth with casual play.I got this game on sale on a whim and now I wish there was a Kickstarter because I'd like to give them 10x what I paid so that they will make more games like this. I guess I will just go buy all their other games too! Good job you guys, you've made a fan. "

												A highly addictive card game that brings a different approach to a CCG. The game involves connecting cards on a 3x3 grid with arrows to make combinations to attack the opponent. The graphics are colourful and the game doesn't take itself too seriously with a whitty dialogue. The music whilst battling is absolutely amazing, a chilled hip-hop instrumental really adds a relaxing vibe while you plan your strategy. The game has much replayability as you you will be given random card packs after beating an opposition so you can always go back and try to collect them all. For such a cheap price it's an easy recommendation, especially for the soundtrack.			"

												Card City Nights is a Cardplaying Adventure. You play as a new citizen of a city located on a little island. The interesting part is that everybody on this little island is into this wierd card game. So you also begin to play it. So you soon find out that there are the so-called legendary-cards and now your task is to get all this cards before your rival does. Sounds like POKEMON ? Yeah actually it's the exact same thing but with cards. So how does this card game work? Every player has a 3x3 square board.Every turn you can place a card in one of this nine squares. If you can connect 3 cards with eachother(like tic tac toe) the will do a certain action. There are  3 actions you can do: -Attack: Attack the opponents HP or disable an opponents card-Defend: Increase your HP-Heal: Enable a disabled card.So that are the basic rules of the card game. You will battle tons of people and every enemy has an other deck of cards and stratagy. You get new cards in form of booster decks  by defeating other players. And that's the whole geme in a nutshell.The only complaint I have is that there is no online multiplayer but the single player is long and entertaining enough.Oh and I forgot that the game has an awesome OST. So if you buy the game buy the OST to^^A great cardgame with an awesome soundtrack.9/10 "

												This game has a delightful sense of irreverency to it, speaking as someone who's played a fair amount of trading card games and a fair amount of TCG video game adaptations. Rather than going for a complicated ruleset, the base rules are straightforward, but there's just enough variety in the cards available to allow for a number of strategic options in deckbuilding, and the excellent soundtrack helps the game's upbeat feeling. The difficulty curve is just about perfect if you hate getting ""stuck"" in games, as well... only in one or two places did I ever feel I wasn't quite ""getting it.""There's also some fanservice here, as the characters/cards are mostly from the company's other games, but it's unobtrusive enough that those unfamiliar won't find it distracting. (Of course, if you're me, you will squeal in astonished joy the first time you see an Iji or General Kor card.) Those seeking a great story should look elsewhere; although the characters feel well fleshed out and the writing is clever, more emphasis is put on gameplay than worldbuilding or plot, which I feel serves the game well. The card game mechanics form a solid core, and nearly everything present here is in service of that.In conclusion, this game is a definite recommendation from me. It won't change your life, it won't suck away weeks of your time, and it won't provide anything truly revolutionary that you'll measure other games up against for years to come... but what it will do is provide a solid, fun experience for relatively little money. There's some great value here. Give the game a try; it's fun stuff.			"

												This game was developed by the dev behind Ittle Dew (well, there are more than enough hints in the card game about this... ;) )I really like Card City Nights.If you like card games in the tradition of Pazaak (KotoR card game) or Tera from FF9, mixed with the hunt for collectibles and some Magic: the Gathering elements, this game is for you. The game seems simple at first, but becomes really tactical later.The game offers a simple, but colourful comic art, a nice, an undistracting soundtrack and a lot of content. The games also comes at a great introductory price. There are lots of cards to collect, secret coins to find (just click on the correct and  suspicious places), the humour is really fun and the card game seriously addicting. Build your decks as you want, beat enemies, win coins or card boosters and enjoy the tournament story.At this price, you can't go wrong with it.Card City Nights also has no IAPs or stuff, you pay once and can get everything in the game as you progress.Recommended for all Pazaak / Tera fans or comic fans with a faible for card games.

												I saw this game on steam while it was on sale for 1 euro or something like this. Pretty cheap indeed and while i read some reviews , i wasn't so sure of wether i'll like it or not and what to expect. However after playing it for half an hour i found my self impressed about what the game was about to give me. Having finished the game after 10 hours and having battled so many guys in this game, i am here to say that this game was worth every penny i spent on it (in fact 1 euro isn't much but still). This game has some pretty nice characters, very nice sense of humor and a card game that's pretty unique, fun, and challenging (although some strategies will wreck your opponents). I liked seeing its weird characters from different game series of the game's developer, i loved opening packs and wishing for me to get the rares, i enjoyed listen to the beatiful music it had during the battles and during the dialogues and of course i was happy after i completed all the achievements for this game (1st game to do so). To conclude, the 10 hours i spent on it were well worth it. I hope Lodusity in the future to create on more card game like this.TL;DR : Buy it.			"

												Card City Nights is another fun game like Ittle Dew, but it suffers from the same problem, it is too short. And while there are all sorts of cards to collect, I feel it doesnt have the replay value of Ittle Dew. But on the other hand this game is still fun and its gives you some more after you beat Ittle Dew and you get all the cards and beat all the dungeons. My final verdict is pick this game up if you have the money, but a little advice from me is pick this up with Ittle Dew, and then it won't seem like too short of an experience.			"

												I'm not quite finished with the game, but the game seems fun so far.This is a single-player card game where you build a deck and battle against other people to get booster packs or money for individual cards. The goal of duels is to either reduce your opponent to 0 health or to fill up your opponent's board. Combos are done by connecting at least three symbols through the arrows on the cards, and the highest type of symbol except for the empty symbol determines what kind of action you take from the combo, which is either attacking, gaining health back, or restoring one of your disabled cards. You can interact with your opponent's board mainly through disabling, which can be done by attacking the individual card, and rotating and removing their cards, which happens through specific card effects.There are strictly better cards, but since there are varying card limits (5 of a common, 3 of a uncommon, 1 of a rare, and 1 legendary out of all legendaries), the inferior cards are sometimes still used to get the arrows needed to carry out combos. There's also a way to recycle excess cards.AI starts out dumb, but their decks and intelligence increases as you play. So far I haven't lost yet (though I have had plenty of challenging matches), but the decks may become much harder.My one nitpick is that attack symbols are very strong because they do two things: lowering your opponent's health and disabling their cards. Defense symbols only gain you life, which alone won't let you win the game, and the restoration symbols which are very situational when your opponent actually disables one of your cards. The cards with attack symbols aren't much worse than other cards, so they will tend to dominate your deck. I wonder if combining the defense symbol and the restoration symbol would have helped the depth of deck building.Also, the settings menu can only be access through the world map, which is strange. You also need to double click on some icons.A lot of the game resides in the deckbuilding and making sure the cards work with each other. The interactions are complex due to the directions for comboing on each card, as well as balancing the effects you need to survive against opponents. The dueling is fun and feels like a puzzle game in way.Overall, if card games and puzzle games seem interesting to you, I recommend trying it out. The cost of the game won't set you back much either.			"

												A fun card game. A large number of cards, many of them have humorous descriptions, or humorous images. Also, many of the Cards are themed and show characters from various well known indie games, like Iji. The card battles themselves kinda remind me of Final Fantasy VIII's card game, along with various others whose names I can't remember. That's not to saw it's not unique on it's own. I find it very fun and it's keeping my attention despite not being a Grand Strategy or RPG game, which isn't easy. I definitely recommend it to any fan of card games, especially if you prefer them to be humorous.			"

												I initially played this game before checking out the earlier works of Ludosity, and I loved it. After having played Ittle Dew, I love this game much more! Card City Nights seems to have been inspired in part by Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales in the sense that the cards interact with each other based on the positions of the symbols on the edges; however, it is a very unique card game as it uses arrows on the edges and corners of the cards to form combos within a grid. The game has the same quirky drawing style and sense of humour as their previous title Ittle Dew, and many of the characters from Ittle Dew have become usable cards in Card City Nights. This is an easy recommendation for fans of Ittle Dew, lovers of card games, and casual gamers in general.			"

												Everyone not affiliated with Ludosity,If you like card games of any sort, if you like puzzle games of any sort, if you like small and cheap indie games that have a surprising amount of depth, or if you can't help buying games on Steam that seem cheap and pique your interest, then I am fairly certain you'll enjoy Card City Nights.Ludosity,Longtime off and on Magic the Gathering family here.Thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you!My wife, my 14, 7, and 6 year old children and I have been playing Card City Nights for a couple of weeks now.  Your game was unreasonably low priced, so I picked up 5 copies.The kids picked up on it really quickly and loved it.  I knew it was a special game when I saw the card and interface design not get in the way of the superb play mechanic.  Its simplicity 3x3 grid and card interaction leads to a surprising amount of strategy.  We're talking enjoyable strategy...you know...the feeling of KNOWING I should have put that other card in the deck or KNOWING that I should have played those 3 cards in a different order.  When I lost games against the AI, it made sense.  When I won, there was absolutely always a reason for it and a reward to follow - a new booster pack or some money (used to buy cards to round off your pool of cards).There is quite a bit of quality humor in the game from dialogue with AI opponents to flavor card text.  I couldn't stop playing.  Do I have the best card(s) - not yet.  Do I have enough of that card or that type of booster - not yet.The game doesn't get old or feel played out, much like MTG, but at a MUCH cheaper price point. Not as hard to learn and held our interest at least as well.  There are no microtransaction here.  None.My family and I appreciate you and your efforts on this one Ludosity.  I am in the process of checking out your other games.  Good luck in your future endeavors and let me know if there's anything we can do for you to return the favor!			"

												For the price this game packs quite a bit of entertainment. Its really charming and the card game itself is really fun. In the beginning of the game the foes you will face are dumb as rocks, but thats on purpose and the game even jokes about that fact. Your ""rival"", Little Dude, is probably the first somewhat challenging opponent. The game is a lot of fun and is almost a hybrid puzzle/card game. Its a simple game to learn though and after my first match I felt I had a solid idea of how to play the game effectively. The tutorial is very good at explaining how the game works.I think every win earns you a booster pack of 5 cards. The cards vary quite a bit and have lots of different effects. You can also have up to 6 custom decks. So far I've gotten a little over 2 hours of enjoyment out of this game and I plan to play it to completion, which I hear is around 14 hours based on someone elses review. For $4 (or $2 if you bought it in the first week like I did) this game is an excellent deal and well worth the money.			"

Card City Nights is a remarkable new take on the traditional ""connect-three"" genre, which has been brilliantly combined with trading card gameplay. While it's stylized aesthetic really sets it apart in terms of graphics, how well does it stack up against other trading cards games, and does it really utilise the ""connect-three"" mechanic all too well?Hope this is of some use to some of you. :)			"

Sadly, I cannot recommend this game simply because it is now broken and the developers have no intention to fix it. After the latest update, the game no longer is able to open on a Mac OS. The developers have said that since this is one of their older games, fixing this issue is not a high priority. If they do fix it, I would happily recommend the game.			"

												A really nicely done card game that I picked up during the Humble Bundle. The initial mechanics sorta remind me of Final Fantasy 8's side card game, but there's a lot of strategy and detail under the surface here. Going after your opponents health versus going after your opponents field is a key factor into this: each strategy is viable and you may have to change it depending on the opponent. Each opponent feels unique enough, and it does feel like a real mind game against them. Those who love strategy will love this game.For more first impressions and gameplay footage:

												Wow, such a great card game! I simply cannot say enough about it. if you don't own this game yet, you need to immedietly! It is more fun than MTG for alot less cost. Boosters are earned in game and you make your own deck unlike that plainswalkers  garbage which dangles the ability to make your own deck just outside of your reach. This game is still single player only atm, and still beats MTG. Can't wait for them to add a MP capability. Best new card game, Best overall card game I've played in a digital format both here on steam or anywhere else. Card games are my favorite genre and I seek them out and try them all. This game is more than worthy of it's title as my new favorite Card Game!			"

												This review has been edited twice, and I have flipped from a ""Do Not Recommend"" to a ""Recommend"" based on a bug being fixed.As far as the game play - the mechanics are pretty cool and easy to learn.  There is a surprising amount of depth for what at first seems like a really simple game.  That being said - I have been using the same basic deck for the whole game with little challenge.  The game actually gets easier as you go (at least through the turnip factory/bar) - I had the most trouble with the first boss mainly because I was learning the game.  Each opponent brings a different feeling deck to the table, but some of the decks only work in theory.  The AI is very basic - I would love to play this multiplayer.  The legendary cards that I have encountered so far are pretty weak.  Out of the 3 or 4 I have gotten I am only using 1 and I could easily take it out with no effect to my deck.When I first wrote this review, there was a game breaking bug.  It was fixed in under a day. This tells me that the developers care about this game and are willing to put in the effort to create a good product.			"

												This game is so much fun. For first I ignored this game due it looks something like Triple Triad but let me tell you, this game is way more complex than that.You have attack, defense, neutral and other various cards you can use to beat your opponent by either taking their shield to zero, filling their board entirely so they can't place card thus they lose or win by fatigue after enemy's deck is empty.Art is also surprisingly charming but that is probably since it reminds me of anime style.

												I just got this game. So far its ok I have only played about one hour. The whole game is to make 3 cards touch arrows to either do damage or defense. The rules are a slightly more complicated but thats about the gist of the game not including the strange cards that turn some cards upside down and other strange cards. The artwork is nice however the game features no animation in any of the boss battles or the people you meet or fight against. A little animation would have been nice, maybe moving a arm or having one of them wink something right now it feels like a comic book.  The music is very nice and relaxing and does fit the play style of the game. You can also talk to certain people in this game however its a very short conversation mostly just lets fight or tips on how to play so far.The card battles are ok.  Bascially you have a deck of cards in your library and they shuffle them up and give you 5 of them and you have to be able to play at least one or you lose. The game does have potential however a few things hold it back for me. The game feels lifeless to me the people you meet are boring/lifeless and the card game while fun is kind of the same. The game is just dull over all. Examples the smashing sound when you hit an opponent  should be a Boom! instead you get pew pew the you win sign should be booming instead you get a sign saying win with little fanfare. I do like the art style of the cards. I really dont hate this game however like I have stated I find it kind of boring overall. I think a small part of it has to do with little to no animation in the game. The cards  are static, people are static the only ""action"" you do see on screen is the hits and a rotating circle sometimes. Again lifeless comes to mind for me a lot. I can find no fault but I dont find anything compelling about it as well .. A game should hook me and want me to play further and so far there just isnt a big enough hook. 5/10 is what I would rate this right now. I may change my mind later after more playing.			"

												If you played the handheld Yu-gi-oh titles on GBA or DS, you man find this game entertaining in the same vein with much less complexity, less difficulty, and less grinding.The formula for this game is as follows: Fight one of a few opponents, unlock new area with new opponents, repeat until you reach the end of the game.  Some opponents give you a booster pack upon winning, most give you money to buy single cards of.  Some areas you unlock let you recycle or combine cards for new cards.  Some areas make you battle in sequence without changing your deck, and some battles are best of 3 or 5.  Similar to Yu-Gi-Oh handhelds, but with a lot less blockading your progression than in those games and no grinding a fight 10-20 times to unlock a pack.Game mechanics are fairly simple and fluid, but you may find yourself a little disappointed if you are used to MTG or Yu-gi-oh.  There aren't too many special tricks the player can do without a bit of grinding, meaning most times you will have a fairly rounded generic deck against themed decks.  This means a lot of fights will go to deck-outs since you will be even against other mixed decks, unable to break your opponent's defensive decks, and you don't encounter a truly difficult aggressive deck until midway through the game.  Taking this, I somewhat luckily found a card-mix recipe early that produced a strong milling card (Business Casual Man).  I made two of them a and sailed through most of the game easily with a mixed-mill deck, only adjusting my deck for 3 fights to be more defensive.  Only the mid-point aggressive boss and last boss required multiple tries to beat.  I ended the main game with a 56 W / 9 L score, and only battled a few optional fight-for-booster opponents multiple times.  I'm not new to card games and so making a strong deck wasn't too difficult, and I ended with just under 10 hours playtime.  Because of my milling strategy its hard to say how difficult some of these fights would have been and how that may have elongated the game.  There is optional postgame content against some difficult opponents, and you can complete a full collection if you are so inclined.There is unfortunately no multiplayer, but I imagine the difficulty there lies in the problem of deck archetypes.  A strong burn / aggro deck is incredibly difficult to fight unless you have a defensive or disruptive deck, defensive-mill decks destroy any delay or mixed, etc.  It would come entirely down to archetype advantages determining who would win.All in all, for $4 retail I'd say its not at all a bad game.  I got this game in a bundle, and I think its on iOS for $2.  If you see it at 50% off and want a casual game that's well-designed enough to appeal to gamers, then I'd say go for it.(Business Casual Man recipe :  Itan Carver + Jenny Bun)			"

												(I only played the iPad version, but this is almost identical) You go around town defeating card masters, improving your deck as you go. The card game is fun, but it's too easy to just nuke most opponents with a very aggressive deck, especially with the cards that instantly do damage. There were only TWO times that I had to make a special deck to defeat someone, and that counter-deck-making is usually half the fun in this sort of game. The cards are all based on characters from Ludosity's earlier games, but you don't need to be familiar with them (I wasn't). I guess that being familiar with them would make it easier to guess what cards to combine to get new ones, but there's a guide for that here on Steam. The game's writing is very entertaining (I didn't expect to see a ROT13 reference in 2014!) to the point where I went out of my way to milk every bit of dialog from the characters. (Make sure to lose to each player once before crushing him with your aggro deck!)			"

												I guess card games kind of trigger an obsessive thing within me, plus this game is just fairly cute in general. It's the only game I've played to 100% completion thus far (All achievements, etc.) - Everyone loves card games, I suppose. The developers definitely put time into making this game playable without making it too easy, and there's some parts where you'll get frustrated. I can't believe how much time I've put into this game. The visuals are extremely nice, the art style is that Western inspired-by-anime type thing. I wish I had a lot more to say about this game, but there's not much too it other than what you can see. You should pick it up, I'm definitely happy I did and I'll be checking out the developer's other games. I always put on some other music while playing the game, because the soundtrack is pretty plain, but it serves its purpose. Giving this an 8/10 for lots of reasons - the fun factor being a significant chunk of those points. Pick it up!			"

												There is not much to this one. Card City Nights is an indie trading card game from Ludosity. Let’s get rocking.The GoodOnce you figure out that the strategy of crippling the cards your opponent has on the board is the only viable strategy, you’ve found your golden ticket to finishing the game.The store system was easy to use and it’s always nice to be able to supplement your deck with better cards sans a booster pack. (The booster packs were usually alright though).To it’s credit, there are no in game transactions for real money in CCN, a problem that plagues games of this nature nowadays.The BadAt first, CCN seemed like it would be pretty fun. I was swiftly proved wrong by how incredibly repetitive the game got. You’re going to get bored, I guarantee it.The MehThere wasn’t really much of a story, the characters are largely forgettable, and you’ll finally realize this is time out of your life that you’re not getting back which, unavoidably, leads to a mild feeling of depression.Verdict: NayMaybe if you see it on sale for super cheap and you’re really curious about whether or not CCN is as bad as I think it is, you could get it. Or, you could be wise and spend your money on a better game. As always, thanks for reading and apologies for the short review. This was just all there was to it.			"

Won't play it again.PS: Game completed achievement might be buggy. I beat the Card King and his ""apprentice"" afterwards , there are no fights left (except the ones that earn you booster packages), still I didn't get the achievement. -> No complaint.. just for your information.

												Overall not worth it. From a pure design perspective the system seemed pretty broken, the majority of the cards do not work well with each other, so you spend more turns not doing anything, or placing cards out of the way hoping to draw into ones that will line up. I won every battle but the AI either ran out of cards or in the cases I was able to put together and offense they did nothing and then lost due to not being able to place another card. A better system would give the player multiple choices for a variety of actions to occur as opposed to wedging yourself in a corner and going with what was left. Also the layout of the UI gave no explanation of what was what, you just have to click things to find out what they do.			"

												My friends, have you been searching for a game where the starter deck is equally as good as any booster pack? Where you never need to waste time doing silly things like updating your deck? Where the thrill of finding a rare card is tempered against its only-slightly-above-average effects? Where gameplay is shallow and fails to evolve at any point? Then, my friends, step into the night - the night of Card City: a barely populated metropolis of mediocre AI; lifeless, static screens; half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥hidden objects; redundant, paper-thin stories; a city where the toll booth demanded a mere $1 for my entry, and even that was too much.

												It's hard not to recommend this game at a $4 retail price, however I still have to.This game does have it's own unique system of presenting a card game, using a 9 grid board with cards that can have one or more of the 8 direction arrows. You then place cards on the board and match these direction arrows up to make ""combos"". A potentially fun concept but it really struggles in its execution. A lot of different arrow combinations means you are going to struggle early in the game when you don't have a good number of cards to draw from. This is a problem because that moment when you place the cards perfect and get a nice combo together, you get that warm fuzzy feeling and it is the primary draw of a game like this. Those moments however, will be few and far between in the early going. This leaves the user with a sense of confusion and lack of will to keep trying to better their decks. I may perhaps have a higher standard of TCGs, as I'm a long time player of games like Magic, 7th Sea, and others. You may find some enjoyment here that I could not, especially if you are willing to tough it out in the early going.  If not however, you will be very disappointed in the games fun factor.			"

												I was REALLY enjoying this game up until I met the Rock Enthusiast, at which point the difficulty is ramped up considerably and the game is just impossible to finish. I am pretty damn sure that the AI cheats at this moment as everything just happens to fall into place and work for your computer opponent. It spoiled an otherwise lovely game. The artwork is cute, the interface, humor, and atmosphere all work in its favor and I'd honestly like to see more games set in this world, but the sudden spike in difficulty just ruined it for me and I hate to give it a thumbs down.

												AI characters are overpowered and have cards that I can only dream of (and I cannot get them, because I can't win, hence I cannot level up). Winning with AI is almost impossible. Also, navigating throgh the level map is annoying and counter-intuitive. I lost my patience with this game.			"

												A poor game, with a simple and uninteresting game mechanic as its only claim to fame. I found there to be no motivation to progress through the game. Rather than sucking you in and making you want to find better cards like most *free* online card games, this game lost me in less than an hour.			"

												This game was on my wishlist for a long while, but it should have just stayed there. I can't recommend it. The gameplay is unique and the art is somewhat charming, but I just didn't enjoy playing it. I can't quite pin it down, but the resulting game seemed rather half-baked. For the sale price, it's worth a try if you like CCGs, but it didn't do it for me.			"

												whilst the card comat system is novel the actual gameplay is pretty boring and honestly it rarely matters how well you play as the computer beats itself most of the time even when its bosses. the first few matches i just went hardcore attack and than realised it was quicker to just join 1 attack to two random cards and disable an enemy card till they can't make combos (normally 3 cards) than just wait for them to run out of space.but yeh other than a novel combat system the game doesn't really have anything and i wouldn't recommend buying it.

												I got part way through the tutorial and had to exit the game. When I restarted the game I wanted to create a new character and start over, this doesn't seem to be possible (why).Using my existing character, I am taken to a map screen. The interface on the screen completely baffles me. Sometimes when I click on an icon such as the icon that looks like a pawn, I am taken to another screen. After having done nothing and going back to the map screen, the pawn icon is no longer active. It's not just this icon, I get inconsistent behaviour on all the icons on the map screen. This doesn't create a very good first impression of the game. What little I saw of the game looked very unimpressive.			"

												A competent but very flawed CCG that takes too many missteps for me to recommend it.The core mechanic of stringing together combos is undercut by several cards like bombs, potions, and barriers that, in a single turn, can invalidate three or more turns' worth of effort. These broken cards are pointed out in a Community Guide.As a result, few strategies appear to be meaningfully better than simply spamming disables to your opponent's cards and filling their board, so that they can't play a card. Because the game is single-player, there's no ""meta"" as such, and this strategy works for >95% of the game's opponents.The lack of real strategy involved makes for a game that is occasionally amusing or satisfying, but largely dull.

												Summary: A very simplisitc game that seems to be targeted towards casuals, and even they may have trouble enjoying the game.The basic gameplay is this: The two players play on separate 3x3 boards. Each draws cards from their decks and place them on the board, one per turn. The cards have arrows pointing in anywhere from 0 to 6 directions. Linking 3 or more to make a combo is your primary method of attack and defense. You can do damage to the player or disable their cards on the board. The advantage of disabling cards is they can no longer link together, though they can be healed. You win if you can drop their life to zero or their field fills up and they can no longer place cards. If a player runs out of cards, they don't immediately lose, but damage is dealt to them each turn by the board. There's very little strategy involved. You fill your deck with cards that will link together easily. Beating enemies is mostly luck based, since they tend to have weird and unpredictable cards, like ones that randomly rotate or move cards. The winning strategy is often just to disable as many cards as possible without regard to health.Overall, veteran gamers will find this simplistic and boring, while casual players with not be especially enthralled.

												Okay, so I got this game thinking it could be fun for a while. I would assume that assumption was correct since I sat through the entire game with a smile on my face. This is by far one of the most relaxing and casual experiences I've had in a while, and I mean it. The game is filled with humor, great gameplay and a soundtrack that makes you happy no matter how you felt before hearing it.Sure, it's not that long but I see it having great replayability and you will probably keep going even after you beat the game to get more cards and have some fun with different types of decks.I saw in other reviews that people encountered a gamebreaking bug removing all of their cards but I personally didn't encounter it.So if you're thinking about getting this game, my advice is that you do it. It has such a low price that I'd argue I'm stealing from the nice people at Ludosity, and that'd make me sad. Allthough I wouldn't stay sad for long since, let's face it, I'm playing Card City Nights, how can you not be happy?			"

												What we have here is a card game adventure packed with charm and humour in a quirky setting with quirky characters. If you're curious about the mechanics, I suggest having a look at people playing on YouTube. It's very simple to learn how to play. Slightly less simple is the deck building, which will require a little trial and error if, like me, you're not accustomed to games that require building your own decks. And once you get in the swing of things, the card game is legitimately fun.Everything else around said card game is just window dressing, but at least it's nice window dressing. The characters make fun of various archetypes, both in real life and in fiction, and have lovely hand-drawn avatars to match. Their dialogue is frequently amusing, if not actually funny, and generally well-conceived. These characters are certainly not going to be your reason for playing the game, but they are a welcome addition.That being said, the card game's fun and the window dressing's charm eventually run dry, and the game (which is surprisingly lengthy) somewhat overstays its welcome. But, for $4, you won't feel cheated, as there are several hours of solid fun to be had.			"

												Firstly, I picked up this game for a dollar. For that price, I highly recommend this game. I'm not sure if it's worth it at full price. It's a simple concept-based card game, where you go around searching for legendary cards. The story is rather lame, and the art style is not up to par. However, this game gave me a good time, especially with its relaxing soundtrack. That being said, the soundtrack does get boring and the gameplay repetitive.

												I want to like this more than I do like it. It seems inspired by a bunch of card/collection-focused games, from Triple Triad (some gameplay mechanics) to Pokemon (mainly story progression and characters), and it all works pretty well together. The presentation/art is pretty good too, simple but very likable, although it does have some tablety crap going on here and there in the UI, like possibly the worst scrollbars I have ever seen in my life.The gameplay is fairly straightforward, matching arrows on the sides of cards to chain them together and make combos to attack/defend/cause other effects. The basics were very easy to pick up, and the addition of extra effects on new cards you get as you progress adds more depth to it. Unfortunately getting new cards that do interesting things feels kinda slow to me, and I think I'm losing interest in the early part of the game faster than it's giving me stuff from the later part of the game. I don't see myself finishing it, but it's so absurdly cheap that it could be worth checking out if you're into that sort of thing.Edit: A better card game (not on Steam) that I've been trying to think of the name of all day since playing this one is The Trouble With Robots.

												I just bought this game yesterday, and already I've played it for 7 hours so far! So yes, I have to recommend this game for those who like casual puzzle games, solitaire games, or trading card games. I've never played ""Magic: The Gathering"" or similar collectible card game, but ""Card City Nights"" has a unique card-linking mechanic that appears to set this game apart from the other games. The game has very pleasant cartoon-style imagery and pleasant-enough music and sound. The interface is easy to come to grips with, and the tutorial mode is reasonably effective in teaching you the basic gameplay mechanics. The story is pleasant and involving enough, providing the motivation to keep playing further.If you’ve noticed, the key word I’m using to describe “Card City Nights” is “pleasant.”  The basic card-game mechanic is challenging and fun, and I’m motivated to keep playing until I beat the game. If you like “casual” games like “Bejewelled” or “Solitaire” or other such games, I think you’ll like this one, although it’s a bit more complicated due to the “card collecting” motif. “Card City Nights” is certainly a worthy game for anyone who likes casual games or “collectible card” games.

												Card City Nights is a card collecting and battling game where you build a deck to defeat enemies, collect randomized card boosters, and improve your deck to take on tougher enemies. This genre of game is one of my favorites, as were Magic: the Gathering: Shandalar and Pokemon Trading Card Game for Game Boy Color. So few of these games are made nowadays that really, I'll take whatever I can get, so when I saw this game on sale for $2, I jumped on it.In the card game, you place cards on a 3x3 grid. Link arrows on the cards to make combos, which can lock down your opponents cards, release your own, boost your life total, or hurt your opponent. You win by reducing your opponent to 0 or by making them unable to play by filling up their grid or depleting their deck. The nice thing is that the game is fairly elegant, and most of the game's strategies involve using relatively simple cards. The strategy in deck building comes from putting together a good theme and making sure you can get the arrows to line up properly. There are a lot of card with powerful abilities that are rendered near useless because they only have one arrow.As for the rest of the game, it's clear that this game was meant to celebrate this developer's previous titles. The only one of those games I had played (or heard of) previously was the fairly good Zelda clone, Ittle Dew, so I got a few of the self-referential jokes. Even if you're not in on the references, though, and I doubt you will be, this game has a lot of goofy humor, between the bizarre characters and funny backgrounds. I thought the music in this game was fine, with the exception of one or two tracks thay annoyed me. The art style is very cartoony and drawn in very thick lines, and I think the graphics work well enough. I would have liked a few more choices for your avatar, though.Overall, Card City Nights is a pretty solid card game and an amazing bargain at $4. If you enjoy collectible card games, then this is definitely worth picking up and playing for a few hours. "

												Single player, relatively simple card game with not a whole lot to offer.----+ ...Cheap?+ ...Turnip people?+/- Soundtrack is alright I suppose but repeats on a short loop and grows old fast.- Everything outside of the card game itself is boring.- The mechanics involved in the card game itself are kind of boring.- The cards themselves are boring.----There's not really a lot I can say about this game. The card game itself is reminiscent of triple triad from the final fantasy series, and playing the card game is interspersed with talking to characters it's hard to care about and moving around a map that doesn't mean anything.You earn boosters in game by grinding games against the same opponent over and over.The cards themselves aren't terribly interesting and the way cards interact is more frustrating than fulfilling.Maybe I just don't get it. If this was a physical card game I would have more fun playing 52 pick-up with it.			"

												Firstly, I picked up this game for a dollar. For that price, I highly recommend this game. I'm not sure if it's worth it at full price. It's a simple concept-based card game, where you go around searching for legendary cards. The story is rather lame, and the art style is not up to par. However, this game gave me a good time, especially with its relaxing soundtrack. That being said, the soundtrack does get boring and the gameplay repetitive. Something not for long hours, but to play in short bursts.			"

												While it's more charming than funny, the card game that lies at the heart of this game is solid and enjoyable.  By the end I was left somehow wanting just a bit more (and then the game gave me more.)The only real negative is that early on you'll be struggling to make your deck work, only having access to the crappiest cards.  I found that more frustrating than challenging, but once you open enough booster packs and get a couple of legendaries, you'll have a lot of fun experimenting with different strategies.  7/10			"

												You may think this game could be a reference to FF8's ""Triple Triad"".  It isn't exactly that since both you and an opponent use separate boards and the cards themselvs have an effect.  You can attack a card or them directly, boost your defense or restore your own disabled cards.It's fun.  However, it can get a bit grindy when you are looking for the right cards you want for your deck.  For the price of this game I'd say it is worth it.  Even more so when it is on sale.			"

												I've played Magic the Gathering, SolForge and Hearthstone to mention a few so when I spotted this cheap little indie game I got curious and had to check it out.The story in short is that you're a card player and are out to gether the 8 Legendary cards in order to face the Card King. It's simple but charming and along the way you run into a nice cast of fun characters to battle against and earn cards, gold and sometimes even new boards from.I found the rules really easy to understand and the discovery of new cards very enjoyable. An autosave function after every match or change of environment means that you can quit and continue later at any point in the game.There are also other functions where you can combine some cards into new ones as well as trading in cards you don't need for boosters.The graphics were quite charming and some of the illustrations made me laugh a few times.On the downside I'd say that the game was a bit easy and I wouldn't mind a filter option in the alchemy lab.All in all, with lots of cards to collect and being able to continue even after finishing the game I say that this is a really good casual card game that I had a lot of fun playing. In addition to that it's also very cheap!I believe the game deserves a 4 ^^1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game but not my taste4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played			"

												I'll make this short.The game was a lot of fun, far more than I would have expected from a single-player card game. I think others have made a similar comparison, it reminded me greatly of the old Pokemon Card Game on the Game Boy that I played years ago. Though I do not have much experience with Card Games, being limited entirely to the afformentioned Game Boy Game and Hearthstone, it was very easy for me to learn the mechanics of this game and it was fun to get into.For the price, I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who is even the slightest bit interested in a casual, fun, and very charming card game.(Although, keep in mind it is also on mobile. If that would interest you more, it's the same game in every way.)			"

												I didn't think much of it when I started but man, after playing for just 1 hour I was hooked. There's so much strategy, much more so than in a normal TCG. And unlike your run of the mill card games this one, although is still somewhat based on the luck of the draw, if you balance your deck well you may still be able to win even with a bad hand.That's what's so good about this game, there's barely any grind and winning is not based on how good your cards are but how you play them. It's also different in that as you progress, you don't simply get better cards to play with and have a easier time winning. Even in the final battle you'll find yourself using some of the starter cards. In short, if you want a brilliant combination of a 2D puzzle, strategy and a card game that is unlike any other card game I've played, I highly recommend this. (Plus it's pretty cheap)			"

												I bought this game expecting a basic card game with a small story to keep people playing. It turns out there's more to the card game mechanics than it would seem at first glance. Card City Nights gives you a 3x3 grid to play cards on, and asks you to make combos by joining groups of two or three cards together to perform certain actions. Cards connect to each other only in certain ways, so making sure you've got the right cards in your deck and knowing when to deploy them is crucial. Later you'll discover different ways to interact with cards, including rotating, moving and disabling cards, lending additional depth to the game.Beating the game itself is relatively straightforward, though certain opponents will exploit weaknesses in your strategy, forcing you to take a second look at your deck. The real fun parts lie in trying to get the achievements, which really get you to closely examine the cards available to you and think about how you can combine them to achieve goals that seemed impossible at the start of the game.Outside the basic gameplay, the art style's pretty neat (though it's an acquired taste) and the music is pretty addictive. The story is really just there to lend some structure to the card battles, but the recurring cast of characters are at least endearing and goofy. Overall, I was surprised by how much I liked this game. Definitely worth the four bucks.			"

You play as a young woman named ""Cardplaya"" who has moved to an island where the biggest form of sport is trading card tournaments. Cardplaya will go on a quest to meet and challenge various opponents and obtain both new cards and prize money for purchases of new decks. The game is very addicting as at first the card battles seem complex, but it urges you to keep playing until you master the grounds of the game. After that the game is very simple and at time challenging depending on what type of cards you use against certain opponents.  The locations are very stylish and the characters are fun and adstract to check out. This game is a must have for trading card tournament lovers.			"

Although once you created specialized decks, most enemies are just a walk in the park.Audio Great.

												There's a lot of good stuff here. The card game itself is fun and resonably well developed and balanced. The graphics are okay. The writing grew on me after making a mediocre first impression. The characters are fun. The soundtrack is top tier, that music is just wonderful.So I was massively enjoying myself, breezing through the game and then I got to the final boss. And all the good stuff mentioned in the previous paragraph became meaningless in an instant. Though ""instant"" is just a figure of speech here - more precisely over several grueling hours, well into the night. Overpowered bosses are one of my favorite things to carefully, methodically hate on. Overpowered bosses are one of my major pet peeves and you just triggered my trap card. Eventually I managed to defeat the final boss, finish the game, get all the achievements. Normally this would make me happy and all would be forgiven, but not this time. It's like the amount of accumulated frustration has left a permanent negative imprint on my perception of the game. Perhaps I was just unlucky with the kind of decks and strategies I had been using at first, but allowing such a situation to occur at all is a design failure.""Do you recommend this game?"" I struggled massively with this, and in the end CCN gets a thumbs up from me, but one I am thoroughly disgusted with. Other, more rational people will probably enjoy this, but I would not play it had I known about that boss. On principle.			"

												Do you like to watch videos, read books or do other things when you play games?  Then this is for you.  Doesn't take too much time to put together a theme deck and when you play you only have to pay the minimum amount of attention.  But if you want to put some extra effort together for something neat with your cards, you can do that.The aesthetics are nice, the number of decks and characters are acceptable, and the plot is simple and digestible.

												This game is one of my favorites. If you're a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon you might find this game a level higher than addicting. Even if you don't play the game I highly reccomend you listen to the soundtrack, there where times mid-music where I couldn't help but click along with the beat. The gameplay is near perfect while the cards that you use arn't broken and fairly balanced for the most part.  There where some parts toward the end of the game where you had to really think about what kind of decks you where using, but I still enjoyed it through and through. The cards do get buffed/nerfed every few months and this is also a plus. You can also tell the developers of this game have a very clear perspective of what consumers want. Definetly one to buy when you've got a spare few bucks.			"

												While it's more charming than funny, the card game that lies at the heart of this game is solid and enjoyable.  By the end I was left somehow wanting just a bit more (and then the game gave me more.)The only real negative is that early on you'll be struggling to make your deck work, only having access to the crappiest cards.  I found that more frustrating than challenging, but once you open enough booster packs and get a couple of legendaries, you'll have a lot of fun experimenting with different strategies.  7/10			"

												A cool little card game. Unlike most games of it's genre, this one focuses on creating combos by putting the cards strategically through the 3x3 board. It has 190 cards, 3 types of combos, and different types of decks. You can try various strategies, but in the end you'll stick to the most effective. It has a good cast of NPC's, and the gameplay is kinda solid. Not great, but good. There's also some replay value, trying to collect all cards. It's a good game for it's asking price.			"

												Quite a lot of fun for its price. I got it in the initial sale, and it's one of the more satisfying $3 I've ever spent on a game.The card game itself could probably use some more balancing, but since you only play against AIs which are not always the smartest about how they play (and seem to all cheat a bit about what is in their hands), it's hard to say how things would work out between humans. As it stands, it seems like pure attack decks (with only a small amount of defence/revival in the form of cards with special properties) are unreasonably good compared to practically anything else. Part of that is that players only have 7 life and that maxes out at 10, beyond which more defence won't help, and the attacking player will also have the option to disable the defensive player's cards about as quickly as they can attempt to form combos. With a decent attack deck, you can easily deal a consistent 4-6 damage every 3 turns, with an occasional burst that's even higher if you get a nice hand. (It's possible to win on turn 3 before your opponent has a chance to even do anything.)I think it would be reasonable to increase the starting defence and to increase or remove the cap.I beat the game the first time through with an infinite win/loss ratio using essentially the same strategy the whole way, augmenting my deck with cards as I obtained them. But despite the fact that it's on the easy side in absolute terms it's still a lot of fun to play. It could use a New Game Plus sort of option, and it would also be nice if after you won the game, the bosses and other characters would all play cards, rather than just the few characters which offer booster packs.

												I've played Magic the Gathering, SolForge and Hearthstone to mention a few so when I spotted this cheap little indie game I got curious and had to check it out.The story in short is that you're a card player and are out to gether the 8 Legendary cards in order to face the Card King. It's simple but charming and along the way you run into a nice cast of fun characters to battle against and earn cards, gold and sometimes even new boards from.I found the rules really easy to understand and the discovery of new cards very enjoyable. An autosave function after every match or change of environment means that you can quit and continue later at any point in the game.There are also other functions where you can combine some cards into new ones as well as trading in cards you don't need for boosters.The graphics were quite charming and some of the illustrations made me laugh a few times.On the downside I'd say that the game was a bit easy and I wouldn't mind a filter option in the alchemy lab.All in all, with lots of cards to collect and being able to continue even after finishing the game I say that this is a really good casual card game that I had a lot of fun playing. In addition to that it's also very cheap!I believe the game deserves a 4 ^^1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game but not my taste4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played			"

I think others have made a similar comparison, it reminded me greatly of the old Pokemon Card Game on the Game Boy that I played years ago. Though I do not have much experience with Card Games, being limited entirely to the afformentioned Game Boy Game and Hearthstone, it was very easy for me to learn the mechanics of this game and it was fun to get into.For the price, I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who is even the slightest bit interested in a casual, fun, and very charming card game.(Although, keep in mind it is also on mobile. If that would interest you more, it's the same game in every way.)			"

												I got this game in the Humble Card Game Bundle and thought I would never play it. But I was looking through my library the other day, and thought ""ah what the heck, I'll give it a try."" Immediately I was taken in by its undeniable charm. The cards are whimsical and have an Adventure Time-esque kind of zanyness. At first I was worried that the cardgame mechanics were too simple as they were introduced, but as I saw more of the cards I became convinced there is a lot of depth to this unique system. I have only played 2 hours and found 3/8 of the Legendary Cards but so far, so good! It inspires me as an indie developer to see something like this succeed.			"

It's fun to grind out new card packs and I'm enjoying working my way through the silly story with bizarre characters.The card game itself is very simple, but the cards themselves and deckbuilding make the play much more diverse and interesting than the mechanics would lead one to believe. There's a lot of complexity, choice, and expression in building your own deck.I'm going to be printing a copy of this game out for my personal use and potentially recruiting friends into purchasing/playing this game with me.

												If you've ever enjoyed anything like Magic: The Gathering or any other CCGs, then you may want to give this title a look.  It has a ruleset that is fresh and different from other card games I have played.  It is very simple and easy to grasp, but after you start in a little bit you will see there is a ton of viable strategies for deck building and you can come up with some really interesting combos.  As you play different people in the game you will be rewarded with booster packs with random cards in it that allow you to expand your library and tinker around with your strategy.  Different opponents give you packs from different sets and I found it really fun to see what else I might get with repeated battles. The AI  starts off really horribly stupid, but this is fine since you start with a limited starter deck, and the difficulty slowly increases as it gives you time to build a library and contruct different decks for different situations.  The story is super silly and light-hearted.The only downfall is that there is no multiplayer.  I would love to play my decks I've built against a friend online.  I'm half tempted to find a way to make these cards in real life to play as I think it would be a fun game with friends.Even without multiplayer I think that Card City Nights is worth the purchase.  At only $4 it certainly was worth it for me.			"

												If you're looking for a good fun card collecting game, but either don't want Multiplayer, or don't mind Singleplayer;this may be the game for you.There's something just enjoyable about managing your decks, of which in this game you can have 7 decks, and can even choose the image (from an in-game selection) for the deck holder.Since you have a max card limit for your deck, you're always trying to find 'better' cards for it, but also cardsthat synergize with your other cards.. which has to do with the 'grid building gameplay.'Basically every card can line up with other cards, only in certain ways, depicted by arrows on the cards.You want to build a deck where it's more possible to draw cards that can link together.(when linked cards provide bonuses, such as attack, defense, and heal)Though linear, this game isn't quite as linear as I first thought it would be.There is freedom in choosing the locations you travel to and who you choose to dual against.And as you dual better opponents, more locations and opponents become available,essentially having you work your way up the 'chain.'Many opponents you can re-fight pretty much as often as you like, but the booster packs you win off them usuallybecome 'stale.' Meaning you keep getting the same cards so there's no way to build a better deck by vs-ing the sameold opponents.This isn't a negative, I'm just stating it.One thing I did find strange though, is there's no penalty for losing, at least from what I recall.(it's been about a month since I've played and I've just started getting into the game from scratch again.)Would be nice for some sort of 'Hardcore' mode where you lose something from losing, cards or something.There's a nice degree of humour in the game.. I've never played the developers other games such as The Little Dew.But from what I can tell it isn't necessary to have experience in that lore.Humour such as; early on you'll be dualing with cards titled 'Stick' which is a weapon that's just a stick.There is a decent variety of decks, as you progress.With the early decks being comprised of 'sticks' and 'old men.'Some other decks are futuristic decks, monster decks, and a few others I can't recall off the top of my head.Well enough of my blabbering on.If you ever get an itch for a Singleplayer CCG, give this game a whirl, it should suck you in nicely.

												I wasn't sure what to think about this game when I picked it up, but for the price of $3.99, I figured at the worst, I wouldn't be out anything much more than my pride...  I've been an avid player of CCGs for a number of years and I've seen some great ones and some terrible ones, both in physical and in digital formats.  This is one of the better ones.  I wouldn't say it's a great CCG, but it's definitely not the worst, nor is it even close to being so.  It's quite good.The game's mechanic of connecting points at the sides and corners of the cards took me a little getting used to as it's different to what I'm used to as far as making attacks, but once I figured out how to effectively build a deck, it's fun.Speaking of deck building, one awesome feature of this game is that it's a one-time purchase.  You buy it and you get access to all of the cards in the game via gameplay (either by winning them, getting them in booster packs, or buying them with in-game currency).  None of that ""buy the game for $20 and then pay $1 for boosters"" crap.  This game knows that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and it deosn't play that way.  It loves you and understands that your money is valuable to you.The artwork is a little ""meh"", but it's whimsical at teh same time.  I've never played the game that it's based on, Ittle Dew, but maybe that's part of the charm that I don't get because of that.  The humor in the game is clean and chuckleworthy.  The game has in-game strategy help via talking to the characters in the game.  Unfortunately, the in-game characters are the only ones that you'll meet as there is no multiplayer support.  My only real complaint here is this, but, it's a BIG one.  This game is fun but after you beat it (which takes all of about 8-12 hours, from what I hear).  My only other complaint is that there's no cloud saves.  If this could happen, I might buy the mobile version to play on the go.  Fix both these issues, and you've got a classic...From what I've played so far, this game is quickly becoming a new favorite of mine.  If you like CCGs, whimsy, and good clean fun, try this one on for size.     7/10			"

												This trading card battle game is the perfect game for me. It emphasizes positioning with the various card abilities. The cards are on a 9x9 grid (like tic tac toe), and you can win by full out assault, by making your opponent run out of spots to place cards, or by making your opponent discard to zero cards. The AI is terrible in the beginning, letting you experiment with different strategies. By the time the game increases in difficulty, you will have some legendary and rare cards to deal with it. The downsides are that the game only has a story mode (no multiplayer). The art style may turn people off too, but I like the charm of the characters and cartoon nature of it. The company that makes this game makes apps too, but I've never played any of them, so I don't recognize any of the characters.This charming, strategic card game is $4, and you will easily get your monies worth. I highly recommend this game.			"

												I got this game in a Humble Bundle. Wasn't expecting much, and I must say the graphic style and silly nature made me overlook at first what turned out to be a complex and interesting game. It is sort of a combination between a TCG and a board game in which you try to make combos so that you dont run out of space by filling the board with cards. The combos are made by matching 3 or more cards with the arrows they have on them. It's pretty simple. Reminds me a bit of the board game ""Illuminati""...Anyway I would totally recommend it to TCG fans, or board game fans. Its silly, and sort of casual, so don't expect too much depth, but it is lots of fun.			"

(and if you don't it's still only the price of a booster pack) Now i'm not saying that you will only like this game if you like TCGs, in fact, I would reccomend this game to anyone. Young or Old, Big or Small, Card City Nights is for all! (wow, that sounded a lot more corny than I thought it would) Additionally, this game will at some point have online multiplayer. So that, along with an about 10 hour story mode and constant bug fixes and updates, its easily worth the measly $3.99 they are asking for.			"

												I saw a 'first impression' video of it by Totalbiscuit in youtube and decided to try this game. I never played a card game before but wanted to give one a try. Heard good things about the game and at such a low price, it was a no-brainer. Very happy I got this. I am also pleasantly surprised to see regular updates/patches and new content coming out for this.			"

												After seeing TB's review of this game, I immidiatly bought it, and it did not dissipoint...untill I beat it due to being a short game, but hey, Better it be a short game leaving me wanting for more, rather than a long and boring game.(UPDATE 2/26/14: They just added end-game content.)The game is a TCG where you collect cards from booster packs you get each time you beat an opponent, and Your Goal is to collect all 8 Legendary cards in the series in order to fight the Card King for A Million Coins.One thing thats sets this game apart from conventinal TCGs is that each gard has arrows on then that point to other cards on a 3 x 3 grid. and in order to make moves agains your opponent, you need to match the right cards (and there are many cards in the game, and the matches can be a miriad of combinations, so this is a lot easier then you think) in order to Attack opponents HP, increace you own HP, Disable your opponents cards to render them useless, or ""revive"" your disabled cards.The game world is small with a point-and-click navigation. there are no animations in this game (save for a water effect around the island) But that dosent contract from the game at all. Personally I really like the island and the world of this game. It reminds me alot of Mazipan City from ""Chowder"" in that the people look weird and bizarre, but they all have fun personallities and, for what its worth, play off each other nicely.The only thing I think would have made this game better would be to add in Multiplayer, if just to se everyone raging out when the opponets play all the OP cards...On the other hand, this game has supprisingly deep mechanics, so It would be cool to see if a Meta game could have formed online.All in all, at $4 max, this game is actually a little bit underpriced in my opinion, witch is all the more reason to buy it. it is a fun detraction from conventional TCGs and especially worth it if you like Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, or Hearthstone.

												I want to like this more than I do like it. It seems inspired by a bunch of card/collection-focused games, from Triple Triad (some gameplay mechanics) to Pokemon (mainly story progression and characters), and it all works pretty well together. The presentation/art is pretty good too, simple but very likable, although it does have some tablety crap going on here and there in the UI, like possibly the worst scrollbars I have ever seen in my life.The gameplay is fairly straightforward, matching arrows on the sides of cards to chain them together and make combos to attack/defend/cause other effects. The basics were very easy to pick up, and the addition of extra effects on new cards you get as you progress adds more depth to it. Unfortunately getting new cards that do interesting things feels kinda slow to me, and I think I'm losing interest in the early part of the game faster than it's giving me stuff from the later part of the game. I don't see myself finishing it, but it's so absurdly cheap that it could be worth checking out if you're into that sort of thing.Edit: A better card game (not on Steam) that I've been trying to think of the name of all day since playing this one is The Trouble With Robots. Go check it out. For reals. Even Richard Garfield says you should. http://www.digitalchestnut.com/trouble/ "

The card game is enjooyable and kind of makes me wish that they had actual cards of this so I could play with my friends. The story is decent, but for the price I belive that it is totally worth it. Replayability is decent (as where you could experiment with other decks if you like).			"

												A very innovative card game. I've seen nothing like it. 99% of the trading card games out there all share the same mechanics like the play area, card costs, attacks phases, etc. Card City Nights is unique in this respect in that its mechanics require a lot of thought into dueling and deck building, even when using the most basic of cards. Synergy is the only key in this game. A deck full of powerful cards that don't synergize is pretty much unplayable.Absolutely worth it for its price.			"

												Card City Nights has a interesting concept on a card game, making the placement of the cards on the board as important as the card itself. I really enjoyed playing the game but I did find it a little too easy, I didn't have to build too many decks and only had to readjust my deck against 2 characters. Neither one was the final boss.Recommended if you want an interesting card game to play, but don't expect it to be a challenging experience. I was able to build a really aggressive beat down deck to clear out the end game. It was a little disappointing that they weren't as big of a challenge as a few of the in game characters.			"

												I had a lot of fun with card city nights. It was all the fun of a good yu-gi-oh game but more streamlined with simpler rules.The artstyle and colour choices are pleasing to the eye and there are some very interesting character designs. This bizarre world you play in seems to operate on its own rules and give you the feeling that you're just in a part of a crazy city that is obsessed with this card game. Purple people and sentient turnips are great to play against, strangely enough.The music is surprisingly catchy. At first I didn't think much of it, but after a couple hours the tunes started to grow on me. There were times where I would catch my foot tapping to the beat. Good music helps me think as well, so it was very welcome in a strategy/card game.There were enough cards to make you want build your collection, but not enough that having a goal of getting them all would be too annoying. The strategies that you can come up with vary quite a bit and everyone who plays this game will have a different strategy. Multiplayer would be a cool feature to add if there are enough people interested. I would love to try out my hyper snake deck on real people since the AI in this game is a bit easy.			"

												Indie Tetra Master game that has cute images and simple game mechanics.Getting a hang of the game is super easy, however I found that there were some holes in understanding - like not noticing a UI element to enter deeper into the area.Apart from that short setback another qualm I had was the entire dependency on the RNG when opening boosters.Only after you've managed to accumulate a huge collection can you proceed with ease. I found collecting rare cards or even specific cards you didn't own (but wanted) was a huge pain in the butt... the RNG was terrible.The increase in AI difficulty was at a good pace... culminating with an extremely difficult (but good) ending.This game deserves a 8/10 as it did a good job of entertaining but did not contain the capability to *wow*.

												Good game ruined by the final boss. It's one of the most blatantly unfair encounters I've seen in a video game. It basically cheats (it even acknowledges it), by breaking the card limits of a deck, i.e. it has all legendary cards in it's deck, while you can only have one. You can only have one of each rare card in your deck, the boss can have multiple. It's a good game otherwise, a tad on the easy side though( excluding the final boss obviously)			"

												Quite a lot of fun for its price. I got it in the initial sale, and it's one of the more satisfying $3 I've ever spent on a game.The card game itself could probably use some more balancing, but since you only play against AIs which are not always the smartest about how they play (and seem to all cheat a bit about what is in their hands), it's hard to say how things would work out between humans. As it stands, it seems like pure attack decks (with only a small amount of defence/revival in the form of cards with special properties) are unreasonably good compared to practically anything else. Part of that is that players only have 7 life and that maxes out at 10, beyond which more defence won't help, and the attacking player will also have the option to disable the defensive player's cards about as quickly as they can attempt to form combos. With a decent attack deck, you can easily deal a consistent 4-6 damage every 3 turns, with an occasional burst that's even higher if you get a nice hand. (It's possible to win on turn 3 before your opponent has a chance to even do anything.)I think it would be reasonable to increase the starting defence and to increase or remove the cap.I beat the game the first time through with an infinite win/loss ratio using essentially the same strategy the whole way, augmenting my deck with cards as I obtained them. But despite the fact that it's on the easy side in absolute terms it's still a lot of fun to play. It could use a New Game Plus sort of option, and it would also be nice if after you won the game, the bosses and other characters would all play cards, rather than just the few characters which offer booster packs.

												I just bought this game yesterday, and already I've played it for 7 hours so far! So yes, I have to recommend this game for those who like casual puzzle games, solitaire games, or trading card games. I've never played ""Magic: The Gathering"" or similar collectible card game, but ""Card City Nights"" has a unique card-linking mechanic that appears to set this game apart from the other games. The game has very pleasant cartoon-style imagery and pleasant-enough music and sound. The interface is easy to come to grips with, and the tutorial mode is reasonably effective in teaching you the basic gameplay mechanics. The story is pleasant and involving enough, providing the motivation to keep playing further.If you’ve noticed, the key word I’m using to describe “Card City Nights” is “pleasant.”  The basic card-game mechanic is challenging and fun, and I’m motivated to keep playing until I beat the game. If you like “casual” games like “Bejewelled” or “Solitaire” or other such games, I think you’ll like this one, although it’s a bit more complicated due to the “card collecting” motif. “Card City Nights” is certainly a worthy game for anyone who likes casual games or “collectible card” games.

												Card City Nights gets a 9/10.This hilarious and brilliantly executed game tickled the pleasure centers in my brain like virtually nothing else that I've experienced. There are few things as fun as opening packs of cards, and this game throws enough your way as to make you positively addicted. The game's main flaw (it is rather short) is also its saving grace, as I'm sure I wouldn't have been able to tear myself away from the screen unless I had already accomplished everything within the first day!Pros:- Innovative, fun, and clever gameplay. It may appear simple at first, but there is surprising depth.- You get to open tons of booster packs and form a huge card collection. How sweet is that! Also, there's no in-game purchases or anything like that. My hat is off to you, Ludosity, for having some moral fiber, especially within a genre of game that seems to feature some of the most rampant abuse of ""pay-to-win.""- Super lighthearted and dumb characters, cards, and locations. The aesthetic quality of the art is great!- Really nice music. I'm a musician and producer, and I really enjoyed the tunes. Game music is often tired and boring, but not here.-Crafting and recycling system which allows you to get rid of excess cards that you don't want, and discover new cards!Cons:- Somewhat short game. I've played a total of 7 hours, and done all the fights and achievements. To be fair, I went through very quickly, playing a very fast ""RDW"" style burn-to-the-face deck. I'm fairly experienced with CCGs, so I was able to be pretty efficient. Also, this was before the balance patch, so that particular style of play is a bit harder now.- General card and deck management is kind of annoying. It can be a bit of a pain to constantly have to scroll through your collection, especially once you open a few hundred boosters. Additionally, when you're buying and selling cards, it's difficult to know how many of each you actually own, because cards that are currently in decks can't be sold.- Rehab expenses are pretty high if you want to stop playing Card City Nights for good.

Even if you don't play the game I highly reccomend you listen to the soundtrack, there where times mid-music where I couldn't help but click along with the beat. The gameplay is near perfect while the cards that you use arn't broken and fairly balanced for the most part.  There where some parts toward the end of the game where you had to really think about what kind of decks you where using, but I still enjoyed it through and through. The cards do get buffed/nerfed every few months and this is also a plus. You can also tell the developers of this game have a very clear perspective of what consumers want. Definetly one to buy when you've got a spare few bucks.			"

												Ludosity has created a pretty interesting card game in the similar styling of Trial Triad of Final Fantasy with a few twist that'll have you playing this game for a really long time. I haven't put as many hours into this game as I would have liked to due to situations out of one's control but it's a fun stress reliever with a pretty solid soundtrack that'll have you humming the music during other daily tasks among other things. Definite thumbs up for me on my end.			"

												I went into the game blind, frankly I didn't even really know what the game was about. I just saw the name, it was on sale, and I had some extra bucks floating around. If this game looks like a good time to you, its going to be a good time. If not you might just not want to buy this game. But if you have some extra dollars floating around, then check this game out. Steam gives refunds for a reason. If you don't like the game from the first hour, you're not going to like the rest. But if it hooks you in the first hour, it does not disappoint.			"

												I am incredibly surprised at how much I enjoyed this game. I'll try to keep this short, and to the point, first of all because I don't want to waste your time, but mostly because it is currently 6 AM, and I've been up all night finishing this game. Anyway, to get started:MUSIC: Let me tell you, this soundtrack is great. It's catchy, and I find the tunes stuck in my head after I close the game.GRAPHICS: Unique, cartoony, and easy on the eyes. The artwork on the cards is great, too, of course.STORY: Although others are saying that the story is forgettable, I'd have to disagree. Although not the best around, it's compelling, and is easy to get into. Essentially, you're the new guy/girl/vegetable in town, and as you explore the city, you meet zany characters, get yourself a rival, and play tons of cardgames. Your goal is essentially to defeat the 8 people who each have a legendary card. If you win, you get the cards, and if you collect all 8 of them, then you are allowed to fight against the Card King, the greatest card player in the city, and claim one million coins. There is also a little more content to explore after defeating the King, like fighting the former legendary card holders looking for a rematch, or facing off the Card Gods, who are four great card players, who use illegal cards.GAMEPLAY: The battling system is very unique, and lots of fun. To simply sum it up, each card has a different symbol (attack, shield, healing, neutral) which do different things. Attack does damage, shield heals your health (a maximum of 10, by the way), Healing can revive a knocked-out card (which get knocks out by taking damage), and neutral mixes with anything. The catch, however, is that each card has arrows, which you must use to connect the various cards to group together a total of 3 symbols. If one symbol is more dominant of the others, then your combo will go to that automatically, but if there is a tie, you get to choose what symbol you want to activate (Ex. Your card combo has 2 attack and 1 shield, then you will have to do damage to your opponent; Ex. Your card combo has 1 attack, 1 shield, and 1 neutral, then you get to choose to either attack for 1 damage, or heal yourself for 1).Others:+You get to play as a carrot, with a fedora. 10/10+Ludicrously low price. 11 hours of fun, for 4 bucks? That's what I call value.-One of the worst final bossfights ever. It's tough as hell, and not very rewarding, but the content that becomes available afterwards (the cards gods, and rematches) is a pretty good reason not to give up.Overall, this game is really great. Really a hidden gem. To be repetetive, I was really pleasantly surprised at this. Anyway, that's just my 2 cents. I think I'll go get some rest.			"

												Card City Nights is a charming little deck-building card game. The gameplay involves battling against AI opponents by slotting cards into a 3x3 grid to form combinations that translate into various actions. At first, a single, balanced deck suffices and your matchups are fairly easy, but as you follow the story (which, without feeling intrusive, guides you around town to increasingly challenging opponents) and meet foes with different kinds of decks and playstyles, you begin to realize that you have to adapt your own card choices and strategies accordingly.I think it was this subtle sense of progression and the variety that a change in deck could bring that kept me hooked on what at first seemed like a very simple (albeit fun) game. Your options for deck-building improve as you play, since each time you defeat a foe, you're rewarded with cards that are then added to your library. The characters you meet are quirky, offbeat, and humorous, and I appreciated how many times you could talk to them without their flavor-text dialogue repeating. Replayability is high: new opponents emerge and existing opponents improve after you finish the story; you can continue to earn cards and fine-tune your decks; and the story was always secondary anyway. The game settles into a nice balance where you think just enough that your victories feel satisfying, but it's never so hard as to be frustrating. I got Card City Nights dirt cheap as a part of a Humble Bundle, and I feel like I underpaid.			"

												It's a cute little Collectible Card Game (CCG) from the developers of Muri, Magicka: Wizards of the Square Tablet, and Ittle Dew. The game features characters and art styling from Ittle Dew, which may mean it is set in the same world. The goal is to defeat the opponent by either draining their defense to 0 through attacks or forced card draws (the opponent looses defense when they are out of cards and are given random cards) or forcing the opponent to fill their 9x9 card board with cards, leaving them with no way to complete combos. Card combos are made by linking three symbols from cards  in a almost tic-tac-toe fashion, where each card has an arrow pointing to where it can be connected. Combos include attack to damage defense or disable enemy cards, defense to restore your defense, revive to enable disabled cards and neutral to act as filler for other combos. Some cards have different effects, such as multiple symbols so it only needs a second card instead of a third, or rotating player or enemy cards.It's a cute little card game that's quite casual, and most importantly, inexpensive at full retail.  I found the character design and interactions to be rather charming and definitely a more laid back exprience than Magic or Hearthstone.  I don't feel like this is a must play by any means, but it is a good CCG that in the worst case scenario, won't hurt your wallet much.			"

												It's the Final Fantasy card games (Triple Triad, tetra Master) with its own unique spin. Instead of each card having a direct ATK/DEF on it, you pair cards together to do a combined ATK, Defend, Heal or special effect. It's  little more strategic and has a story to go with it. The atmosphere is a lot like the Costume Quest games. Similar art style and humor in them, so that is a plus to any Costume Quest fans.			"

												Okay, so I got this game thinking it could be fun for a while. I would assume that assumption was correct since I sat through the entire game with a smile on my face. This is by far one of the most relaxing and casual experiences I've had in a while, and I mean it. The game is filled with humor, great gameplay and a soundtrack that makes you happy no matter how you felt before hearing it.Sure, it's not that long but I see it having great replayability and you will probably keep going even after you beat the game to get more cards and have some fun with different types of decks.I saw in other reviews that people encountered a gamebreaking bug removing all of their cards but I personally didn't encounter it.So if you're thinking about getting this game, my advice is that you do it. It has such a low price that I'd argue I'm stealing from the nice people at Ludosity, and that'd make me sad. Allthough I wouldn't stay sad for long since, let's face it, I'm playing Card City Nights, how can you not be happy?			"

												This game is one of my favorites. If you're a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon you might find this game a level higher than addicting. Even if you don't play the game I highly reccomend you listen to the soundtrack, there where times mid-music where I couldn't help but click along with the beat. The gameplay is near perfect while the cards that you use arn't broken and fairly balanced for the most part.  There where some parts toward the end of the game where you had to really think about what kind of decks you where using, but I still enjoyed it through and through. The cards do get buffed/nerfed every few months and this is also a plus. You can also tell the developers of this game have a very clear perspective of what consumers want. Definetly one to buy when you've got a spare few bucks.			"

												Genre: Single-player collectible card-battling campaignCampaign length: 10 hoursGame length: < 10 minutesLength of campaign: ~ 100 gamesDifficulty level - normal (only difficulty)Complexity: Ages 10+Card City Nights is an altered version of the 9-square mini-game from Final Fantasy VIII, except that in Card City Nights, it's the entire core of the game.  Childish humor fills the game, as the main character goes on a quest to collect all 8 legendary cards from a variety of card masters.  Defeating associates and assistants to the card masters in best of 3 or best of 5 collectible card matches,  you collect enough cards by winning battles until you have an almost unbeatable deck.  Cash dropped by these thugs give you money to buy more cards and more 9-square boards, until you have enough rare cards to absolutely mow these people down.  The mechanics of this game design are well thought-out.  Excess cards can be recycled into card packs, preventing the player from collecting 10-20 of each common card in a never-ending quest to collect enough rares (cough Pokemon TCG for Nintendo's Gameboy cough.) In addition, there's a minor alchemy system to process cards that may not be affordable from the game's card store in the mall.  All an all, a moderate-speed economy system gets this game going.  The delightful humor prevents the game from getting dull, and this is a must-play for card genre fanatics or older children. 5/5 stars.			"

												Warning: Skip to the end for tl;dr. I talk about a lot of irrelevant♥♥♥♥♥♥This is a game I was interested in for a while. After looking at the description it reminded me of not only one of my favorite games as a kid, but one of my favorite games of all time, Pokemon Trading Card Game for the Gameboy Color. IMO PKMN TCG was better than 80% of all of the Pokemon games ever made. It had a really fun battle mechanic, fun characters, fun sidequests that you would expect to be in a JRPG (i.e. doing certain things or trading to get rare cards), it was actually challenging unlike the standard Pokemon games (hurrdurr rock beats paper, idiot) and it had a lot of depth for both a seemingly simplistic Gameboy game AND as a Pokemon game.First Impression: I could tell from the previews that this game had a fun and cartoony art style and characters, so I knew not to expect hyper realistic GRAFIX going in, and I didn't mind, the cartoony art style and the weird characters not only compliment each other, but the setting was appropriate for a ""TCRPG"" (Trading Card Role Playing Game). The setting wasn't overly dramatic and it wasn't some♥♥♥♥♥♥eating ""deep"" social commentary that hipster indie devs like to throw into their games for no reason.The gameplay is simple enough, point and click adventure-y stuff with trading card battles (which are also point and click). I played this on a Microsoft Surface Pro so it was pretty easy to play. If you're using a desktop and mouse, it might be slightly more annoying due to having to move the mouse all over and having to plant yourself in front of your computer. If you have a laptop that doesn't have a touch screen or you don't have a traditional mouse to use with it I'd really recommend looking into buying the Android port of this game, this is a game that really plays best with a touch screen and it's also more relaxing to play in bed or in your spare time as things can get dull just sitting in front of a computer since this game doesn't feature much variation in how it plays.The game was easy enough to control, but let's talk about the core of the game, the TCG. At first the TCG was kind of confusing, you place cards on a grid and they have to connect with arrows and all this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I pretty much won my first couple of games by luck because I really didn't understand the strategies well enough to do anything coherent. However, by the time you're ready to fight your first ""boss"" you should be able to have a general understanding of the main deck strategies and card types. The game does a pretty decent job of teaching you how to play and adapt to increasing opponent difficulty.Now to pick out the criticisms I had about the game. This section should be a little less macular degenerating. I'm just going to pick out some things that I personally disliked about the game, you might agree or disagree, I don't really care. Just remember that I have somewhat overly high standards.- Cards scale in strength and effectiveness.This isn't something that I personally think makes the game bad, but when it comes to TCGs, I really dislike this. Basically, you start off with both you and your opponents using a bunch of weak, stupid cards that can barely pull off any kind of high damage or chain combo. However, the more you progress into the game, the stronger the cards get. What this means is that as the game goes on, cards that you used before can go from being the bread and butter of your deck to being completely outclassed and obsolete. Now, going back to Pokemon, imagine that when you go to fight your first gym leader you have a team of 3 weak pokemon. Now, at the time, they might be able to beat the first boss, but if you were to go directly to the next gym leader without any kind of interim training, you would get completely rekt. Now, imagine instead of training your pokemon to get stronger, you just catch a bunch of stronger pokemon and just throw your old pokemon into the trash. Theoretically this is a viable strategy, but it takes away most of the fun of pokemon games, being able to train your pokemon from being a bunch of bowl-cut, glasses-wearing noobs into a team of Hulk Hogan American heroes. Back to CCN, as the game goes on both you and your opponents keep getting newer and stronger cards. The strategies you use might stay the same and similar enemy deck types might stay the same, but now your cards are just slightly stronger. Now, for something like Final Fantasy this is an acceptable formula, but the thing that makes TCGs fun is the degree of strategic complexity. Would you rather keep playing against new enemies with unique decks and strategies or would you rather just keep fighting the same guys over and over but each one being slightly stronger than the last? The ""Card Gods"" at the end of the game have some of the most clever and difficult strategies out of anyone in the entire game, but there's only 4 of them and that's after you wade through the huge river of regurgitated goons that serve as checkpoints throughout the game. IMO, a good TCG should have as many ""viable"" cards as possible. If we're talking about something on as large of a scale as YuGiOh then of course there are going to be old cards that can't even hold a candle to some of the newer, crazier cards, but CCN is a game that can be beat in <10 hours and probably has less than 200 cards. If they spent more time creating efficient cards instead of just making tiers of cards then I think the game could have been a lot more complex and fun.- The TCG system is too basic.I honestly think that you can beat the entire game using the starter deck and maybe a couple of early cards. I know I just spent like 2 years talking about cards becoming obsolete and useless, but the thing is that the actual base TCG features overly simple mechanics combined with simple enemy AI. There are 3 main strategies; pure damage (attacking an enemy directly), preventing them from placing cards (blocking up their board) and making them run out of cards. It might be harder to do with weak cards, but once you devise a strategy based on one of the above methods of winning then it's possible to just go through the enire game with the same cards and either rushing the enemy's HP or blocking up their board. I mean, this obviously wasn't designed to be a game with some huge, competitive meta game, but with the number of opponents you have to fight and the fact that you can beat them using the same strategy (there might be like 3 or 4 enemies that require a different approach), the game can feel pretty repetitive.-The game doesn't have a lot of contentIt's a short game, <10 hours, but the biggest problem is that the game is too formulaic. There's 8 bosses, each occupying a certain area and following the formula of wiping out their goons and then eventually fighting them. It was fun the first and even the 2nd time, but by the 4th (not to mention the 8th) time it got old really fast. The only thing that drives you forward is seeing both the new cards and new characters (and wanting to beat the game, obviously). I really loved the characters though, despite this being my first game from this dev and CCN featuring a lot of cameos of their other game characters. The only thing that even comes close to variation is the little hidden coins mini-game. Each area has coins hidden in the scenery which I thought was fun.Overall thoughts: In the end, I enjoyed the game a lot. I liked the characters, the setting, the gameplay (for the most part) and the ""style."" It was just enjoyable overall. I bought the game for $2 (regular price is like $4) and i think for that price it's a pretty good game, but with the lack of content and how easy most of the game is I'd say to go for the Android version (which is $2 and controls better with a touch screen). It's a good TCRPG, but not very complex, might be fun for kids or any fan of TCGs such as myself.			"

												Totally worth the asking price of $4.00. This game had much more depth than I expected it to. It slowly acclimated me to the various strategies available as I played through, starting out very easy and working it's way towards very hard, but giving me enough guidance so that I never felt overwhelmed. It's not short on content either, as even after I beat the main story more content opened up.That said, if you hate card games then this one probably isn't for you, but if you're in anyway on the fence about them then I'd recommend giving this one a try.

												Fun little card game that is worth every dollar you pay for it. A must have if it goes on sale. Card City Nights revisits the old days of Trading card games at its peak where virtually everyone is playing it. With the combination of a brilliant soundtrack and a refreshing art style that is easy on the eye, Card City Nights gets you excited and raring to go at the world within it. The card game mechanic is decent and works and as I played this since Day 1, the patches to the game have balanced some easy ways out making a varied playstyle more viable. (I have yet to play through the game again with the new patches but from the little I replayed so far, the game is still as fun as I left it the first time I completed it) Card City Nights is a good small game to enjoy with some decent fun being able to be had for simply 15 minutes of Gameplay. Get it Now!			"

												Quirky and fun game that fills a very specific itch.  If you like the card mini games from FF8 and FF9 you'll enjoy the gameplay here.  The animations and art work is smooth and the rediculous characters and card art/descriptions is amusing.  I really wish more developers would jump into the single player CCG genre!Definitely worth the price!			"

												This game is one of my favorites. If you're a fan of Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon you might find this game a level higher than addicting. Even if you don't play the game I highly reccomend you listen to the soundtrack, there where times mid-music where I couldn't help but click along with the beat. The gameplay is near perfect while the cards that you use arn't broken and fairly balanced for the most part.  There where some parts toward the end of the game where you had to really think about what kind of decks you where using, but I still enjoyed it through and through. The cards do get buffed/nerfed every few months and this is also a plus. You can also tell the developers of this game have a very clear perspective of what consumers want. Definetly one to buy when you've got a spare few bucks.			"

												Good game ruined by the final boss. It's one of the most blatantly unfair encounters I've seen in a video game. It basically cheats (it even acknowledges it), by breaking the card limits of a deck, i.e. it has all legendary cards in it's deck, while you can only have one. You can only have one of each rare card in your deck, the boss can have multiple. It's a good game otherwise, a tad on the easy side though( excluding the final boss obviously)			"

												Ludosity has probably one of the most unique if overlooked voices in the independent gaming community, and Card City Nights is a hallmark of their own brand of weird on a classic trope; trading cards. Be it combat with an executive turnip person or duelings with a ghost or three, there are few digital card games that outright wants to have fun, in both execution and style. It never had me laughing out loud but the cartoonish surrealism and genuinely well crafted card play brought me back again and again. The card play itself has more of a boardgame feel to it, with a 3x3 board both you and your opponent have free reign of placing down cards on. These opposing boards basically demand that you have preplanned combos in your deck, as the only person that really can determine if you're going to have the upper hand or not is you. While the decks are randomized, luck isn't really as much of a factor as it is a gameplan, which you'll probably have to change up often as you go into new battles with different variety of foes. ""Matching"" cards is done through connecting the arrows each card possesses. There are eight points of contact in all; the angles and the sides. The majority of cards you collect will only have two or three arrows each, where special silver, gold, or platinum cards can vary from all 8 to just 1. Having cards that line up with each other is crucial, and demands a certain kind of forethought that you will build over the course of the game. It's far more complex than it sounds, and a variety of special abilities and different ways you can win makes the game an utterly fascinating breakaway from the usual fare.Is there bull**** moves that even the computer abuses? Yes. Yes there are. Matches can go on forever, and when it follows a 2/3 game style, not knowing if your hardfought victory is going to happen twice is a horrible feeling, especially when what you fear comes true. While this does garuntee that even the easiest matches still demand some thought, the over all repetition can eat away at you near the end like it did me. I do love this game for what it is, but at the end the final couple fights feel downright unfair, and that's where the 2/3 deal often works at its worst. The experience as a whole was absolutely worth it, but who knows, you may grasp the rules better and stand a greater chance by the end of it.While I haven't checked out Little Dew yet, I'm probably going to have to make that as one of my next stops. For the insanely cheap asking price of two bucks, CCN is of such insane quality that anyone would be hard pressed not to pick this bad boy up. Also, the soundtrack is wonderfully funky and fits the game perfectly. Don't miss out on this one if you can, and if you ever see this on sale? You have no excuse. Absolutely worth the buy.			"

												A beautiful game. Starts of with the tutorial as usual. Everything is very well explained and there are various strategies to win. The fun comes from the system that uses chains of cards to build combos. It feels very balanced. I played it for 4 hours straight and it doesn't feel like i'm half way through the story yet. This has been a relatively short review but i'll break it down into the pros and conspros:- balanced gameplay- Amazing sound track- Fun (if not slightly boring/typical) characters.cons:- sometimes the first draw is bad and there's no sort of re-draw system- despite varying effects for people who enjoy games like magic the combat can seem rather too simple.- cards are inspired by characters/items from their previous games, which 99% of people won't get.over all it's a very enjoyable experience, varied music, interesting cards and some different techniques, I'd recommend it :)			"

												A very innovative card game. I've seen nothing like it. 99% of the trading card games out there all share the same mechanics like the play area, card costs, attacks phases, etc. Card City Nights is unique in this respect in that its mechanics require a lot of thought into dueling and deck building, even when using the most basic of cards. Synergy is the only key in this game. A deck full of powerful cards that don't synergize is pretty much unplayable.Absolutely worth it for its price.			"

												Honestly, this is one of my favorite games of the year right here (I just found out about it this year so that's why). As someone who loved Yu-Gi-Oh! and dabbled in Magic The Gathering, I thought I'd give this a shot since it was only $2. When you start the game, you're thrown into a tutorial and it teaches you the unique way to battle. The way this game is different in how you battle is that not only do the cards matter, but where you place them matters even more. Each card has its own unique layout of arrows that you have to connect with other arrows on other cards, as well as matching the different card types (Attack, Defense, and Neutral). Using this, you go through the town and battle different unique and quirky people and work your way to the top.The only thing I'm not that fond of in this game is there's really only one dominant strategy, and it's offense offense offense. I wish there were different ways to beat enemies, like milling or a defense-type thing. But even then, there is strategy in building your deck on how you should be offensive.But all in all, the battle system is unique and the characters are fun to talk to and battle. Seriously, buy this game. Buy it for full price, because it's worth it. And if it's on sale, that's even more reason to buy it!P.S. If you go on the ""Dollar per Hour of Gameplay"" motto, I got it for $2 and it took me 8 to beat the game once and an additional 2 to do some of the post-game stuff.			"

												I had a lot of fun with card city nights. It was all the fun of a good yu-gi-oh game but more streamlined with simpler rules.The artstyle and colour choices are pleasing to the eye and there are some very interesting character designs. This bizarre world you play in seems to operate on its own rules and give you the feeling that you're just in a part of a crazy city that is obsessed with this card game. Purple people and sentient turnips are great to play against, strangely enough.The music is surprisingly catchy. At first I didn't think much of it, but after a couple hours the tunes started to grow on me. There were times where I would catch my foot tapping to the beat. Good music helps me think as well, so it was very welcome in a strategy/card game.There were enough cards to make you want build your collection, but not enough that having a goal of getting them all would be too annoying. The strategies that you can come up with vary quite a bit and everyone who plays this game will have a different strategy. Multiplayer would be a cool feature to add if there are enough people interested. I would love to try out my hyper snake deck on real people since the AI in this game is a bit easy.			"

												Card City Nights plays like a CCG with very interesting rules that relate to chaining cards together on a table.  The game mechanics are fun but the problem with the game is in the card collection and deckbuilding.  My favorite part of trading card games is being able to put together fun and creative decks.  This game, especially as a single player game, takes far too long to start getting any interesting cards, and even then you usually only will get singles of cards.  Deck building is extremely limited because of this and essentially you will just toss together whatever cards you have at the time, rather than try to build a deck with any intentional strategy.  Overall I became bored with Card City Nights because of these limitations and lost the interest to keep playing.			"

												Card City Nights has a interesting concept on a card game, making the placement of the cards on the board as important as the card itself. I really enjoyed playing the game but I did find it a little too easy, I didn't have to build too many decks and only had to readjust my deck against 2 characters. Neither one was the final boss.Recommended if you want an interesting card game to play, but don't expect it to be a challenging experience. I was able to build a really aggressive beat down deck to clear out the end game. It was a little disappointing that they weren't as big of a challenge as a few of the in game characters.			"

												This game, for the short amount of time the story takes up, was hilariously awesome and worth every penny of it. I have nothing but good things and positive critisism to speak of it.Into card games? This game is exactly for you, and will scratch that itch your having. It's very easy to catch onto, and you'll learn the ropes quick. Not every opponent goes down from just brute force cards, sometimes you'll have to use your wits and think it through.The cards themselves are uniquely drawn, very child-like and vibrant, and a lot of which are references to other games. Some of those games you should even go try for yourself. My only critisism is the game does't have enough cards, and deserves so many more. As well as more locations and opponents to play against, sadly it looks like nothing else is being added to the game, but it's still amazing and deserves a moment of your time. :)*Edit*Apparently they did an update, holy crap. :D			"

												This is a simple, one-player videogame version of card games like Pokemon or MTG, with a little storyline thrown in to guide you through increasing levels of difficulty. I never really got into any physical card games, but I really enjoy Card City Nights! Pros and cons from my experience:Pros:- No significant learning curve: The rules are easy to pick up and you're playing in minutes.- A fun variety of cards to work with, allowing you to build (up to six) different decks to experiment with different strategies.- AI players use different style decks and strategies, requiring you to adjust your own style and decks to beat them.- Some of the battles are tough, but not so tough you get frustrated.- Suitable for kids or adults, and a good introduction to strategy card games of all types.Cons:- Some bugs in the Windows version, particularly an annoying 10-15 second lag that often occurs at the end of a match.- You earn coins from some matches which can be used for buying cards or backgrounds, but as far as I can tell there's no real reason to use them since you already get plenty of cards from boosters and the backgrounds are just the ones that the AI already uses.- A multiplayer option would have been nice.All in all a good buy at regular price and a steal on sale.

I will say that you can almost vary until the infinity and back... I think that the game is offering a lot of different ways of playing, also there is some small hideouts within the game as well as intresting NPCs. Upon that the art within the game is astonishing it really outside the box "

												WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE END! SKIP DOWN TO THE BOTTOM FOR THE TLDRplaying threw this game i had plenty of good things to say. the art style is nice, its funny, and the card game itself is fairy balanced (if not having some useless cards but every game does). but all these positive things i had to say were over shadowed a bit by the final match. long story short your final match is against some one who is useing every legenday card and has multiples of rares. the ai seems to have every card needed to counter any strategy at each time. its made to be unfair and along with that it takes away the fun. yes you can probably beat them eventually but its an exercise in tedium where you will eventually get mad, put the game down and move on to something else or just fight older opponets. however the game is still fun to play just not fun to beat. however for a 5$ price tag you do get enough fun out of it to justify the purchase and its certainly more entertaining than most phone games of the same price.TLDR: good visuals fun and occasionally challengeing gameplay marred by a overly difficult final fight. you could do much worse for the price. full price: you can easily get your moneys worth of this game just expect some frustration if you intent to beat it.sale: definaly! when this games on sale its like 2$ a must play for card game fans.

												Card City Nights is a great casual adventure that is worth several playthroughs. The soundtrack takes this game to a new level with a jazz/hiphop fusion that fits with the wacky and bizzare world your character inhabits. The gameplay takes some getting used to as instead of fighting with monsters and spells, you have cards with directional arrows on them that connect and have different effects based on said connections. However, once understood Card City Nights takes on a new life as you try and figure out the optimal strategies against each opponent and craft the best cards available to make grinding packs quick and easy. Hope Ludosity makes another one soon.			"

												The best computer card game I've ever encountered. It is a TCG, however it has a really deep, polished mechanic. Nothing like Magic or Hearthstone where after creating a deck you simply apply a prethought algorithm and brainlessly play card. Here you really need to interact all the time as there are endless various game states during the play. PLUS the game contains a very solid 20h campaign with great dialogues (Ludosity is known for their marvelous, non-harming and sense of humour) and, what's also important, many different opponents with veriaty of tactics. It all sums up to one of the best PC game of all time IMHO. Definetaly 10 out of 10! Yes, yes and yes!			"

												Edit: I decided to flip this to recommend.  It entertained me just enough for me to play through it, most games can't make that claim.  It does have some ""atmosphere"".  It's still kinda ""meh"" though.If I could rate this game as ""Neutral"" or ""Meh"", that would be the rating.  Since the question is, ""Can you recommend it?"", then the answer is ""no"".  If the question was, ""Can you reject this game?"", the answer would again be ""No.I have 15 hours of playtime, and the game is played out.  I don't feel like there is any replay value here.  Music is kind of nice and atmospheric, but not anything that screams ""I must download to MP3 player"".  Art is interesting, but not inspiring.  I was looking for a game like Shandalar, and I appreciate that this game isn't an online experience requiring card pack buys with real money.  But... the Shandalar experience isn't really here.  But, there are far worse ways to spend an evening or an evening and a half like I did to blow through this game.  This game is a solid *Shrug*.			"

												Bit repetitive after a while but nevertheless good time waster with slight bit of strategy needed in deck creation.			"

												I have poured ten hours into this game now, and I cannot get enough! The characters and gameplay are all so fresh and well made. There is plenty of room to play with your own style, and there are tons of cards to collect. All of the Ludosity characters are in this, including some of the more obscure ones such as Muri.The card game itself is awesome, and can get intense. Honestly I wish there were more people to fight (or even online?), because you learn how to beat each opponent. That's my only gripe. Other than that, well worth a look!			"

												Really nice and simple game card !May seem boring at first when you start with the standard (under powered) deck, but get very interesting soon when you start getting better cards !Strategy decks needed depending on your opponement deck.Now waiting for the 2nd Card City, which will be released in a few weeks :)			"
