												 I just finished 'Montague's Mount' with 2 hours and 10 minutes of in-game time, and I am absolutely blown away. It has been years since I was this disappointed in a video game and/or felt this mislead by the title's description and the feedback on the Steam store page. I paid less than $2.00 USD for 'Montague's Mount,' and it took me less than 3 hours to defeat it. Honestly, I'm so shocked and appaulled by this game that I want to ban myself from ever pursuing ANY additional PolyPusher Studios projects, and I am loathe to blacklist any developer. If you want ""puzzles"" that are difficult only due to horrible frame rate issues and intentionally obtuse clue placement, and the added bonus of spending 50% or more of your time back-tracking at a slow pace, by all means purchase this title. I was initially impressed with the music and the stormy seascape atmosphere, but I need a little more than that from a video game to call it worthwhile. The plot was lackluster, and by the ""climactic ending"" I was totally disinterested; even the creepy kid failed to impress me after the first few encounters. I also question the term ""psychological thriller,"" because this video game is barely suspenseful at best, and the completely predictable decline in the main character's mental process doesn't feel psychological, it just feels like lazy storytelling. When I made the decision to purchase this game, I ignored the awful 'Metascore' (per usual with Steam, especially with Indie games), and focused on the 100% positive reviews in the ""Most Helpful"" category. I cannot believe that not a single Negative review is visible on the store page, and that seems questionable in my book.			"

												Montague's Mount is a difficult game to review: It has so much potential, but falls short on certain aspects of gameplay, which makes it difficult sometimes to appreciate and has alienated many players. If there's anything to be taken away from this review, its that patience above all else, is the most important skill the player will have to possess.Like many others, I bought and played this game for two simple reasons: I absolutely enjoyed ""Dear Esther"", and I got given a 80% off coupon, making the game extremely cheap. To be honest, had it not been for the coupon magically landing in my steam account, I would not have heard of this game at all, which reflects rather poorly this game's advertising campaign.I find that many other reviewers have been quick to slate the game and brush it under the carpet as a failed project, but I can't shake the feeling that they have been overly harsh with their judgment: The game isn't as complete and polished as it ought to be, and to be honest, some of the points I will highlight later have proven to be extremely frustrating indeed, as they were deliberately implemented. However, you should find the patience to stick with it and try and scratch below the surface, you may find yourself to be pleasantly surprised.The Story & Setting:The story of Montague's Mount could be described as a melancholic journey where the player attempts to piece together the events that have transpired to himself, his family and the inhabitants of the small Irish community scattered across a small, wind and rain battered island in the Atlantic sea. The plot development closely follows the same mechanics of Dear Esther, by making the player interact with notes, objects and monologues from the main character.The pacing of the narrative is quite regular at the start, but feels rather rushed by the end, which slightly derails the flow of the story. Unlike Dear Esther, not much information about the island and its inhabitants is provided to the player. The same can be said in regards to the causes of the events which have unfolded prior to the protagonist’s joinery, which was slightly disappointing. I travelled around this island and was constantly under the impression that something ancient and potentially malevolent transpired there in ancient time (many ""sacred stone"" and pillars can be seen dotted around the island) and maybe a diary entry or two about these, would provide extra depth into the setting of the story.The translation of all objects in Gaelic is a very nice touch, and the small cultural references that can be found here and there add to the beautiful atmosphere to the game. Anyone which has lived extensively on the British Isles (particularly in small communities, highlands and moors) such as myself, will be quick to relate to how capricious the weather can get and this is very well depicted, as an unrelenting, atrocious weather system which constantly batters the island and the player. The music score is fantastic (a real credit to Andrea Baroni) and melds perfectly with the environment. The dreariness of the island and constant stress amplified by the incessant rain compounds a feeling of constant desperation. On the other hand, the extreme colour desaturation and ""grainy"" effect are overkill and more often than not, get in the way of gameplay (luckily, these can be easily disabled). The lighting and visuals are nowhere near as good as Dear Esther’s and many bugs and poor effects in regards to lighting and shadows become quickly apparent. These are also damaging to the player's immersion into the environment. I can only put this down to lack of experience in game design and I am sure it can be easily fixed. My only other complaint is that the story ends rather abruptly, leaving many questions unanswered. Ambiguous endings are acceptable; Dear Esther pulls it off extremely well, but here I felt like I was left hanging. Maybe they plan an expansion? It's unclear...Finally the horror aspect of the game could have easily been dropped. The atmosphere of the island gives enough of an impact without the ""Ghost boy"" moments, which I'm sorry to say, where rather appalling and failed completely to fit in to the environment.The Gameplay:The gameplay is divided into pacing around the island searching for clues, and puzzle solving activities. Pacing is very slow and the reasoning for this I assume, is that your character is injured/sick and can only hobble around (walking stick). This will most likely exasperate the impatient player, as walking around is pretty much all you do in this game, and I myself often grumbled at the idea of having to go backwards, because of the time and effort to get around... However, I can appreciate the reason why this has been put in place; it adds to the feeling of desperation and allowance for gentle pacing around the environment, giving you time (or possibly forcing you) to take in the sights and in this sense, I don't see it as an issue.The puzzles add an extra dimension to the game which Dear Esther lacked, but they have been the source of major complaints in many of the reviews - Many citing their difficulty and lack of logic.I fully disagree, and it once again boils down to a question of patience. I didn't find these puzzles particularly challenging, if one takes the time to think about them. On several occasions I found myself stuck, not because of the puzzle's logic but because of poor level design an visuals (such as the semaphore diagram being impossible to decipher due to VERY poor lighting and resolution). This does kill the gameplay...The Positives:- Great Atmosphere- More interactive than Dear Esther- Good Voice acting- Beautiful music- Constant sense of desperation The Negatives:- The aparenaces of ""Ghost Boy""- The MANY bugs (fell into the ocean at one point)- The abrupt ending- Lack of background information about the island- Poor visual effects: Lighting and desaturationSummary:For the price I bought this game for, I feel it was definitely worth it. Anyone who enjoyed Dear Eshter will enjoy this, and the story will compel you to get to the end, despite the game's bugs and shortcomings. My recommendation is that developers should correct the bugs, increase the plot, improve upon the ending and sort out the visual.Then... This game will be a true masterpiece. "

												I wish I could recommend this game, as it is obvious the developer really tried to give us something good. Unfortunately, the execution is very lacking. By default the game is an ugly dark grainy mess, which can only be slightly improved by turning off the film grain.Your character walks so slowly it becomes an annoyance to walk around, even after you find a certain upgrade.Then there are the puzzles. The good thing is they all make sense within this world, there is no ""get the hair from the cat to make a mustache"" or other such nonsense... but the puzzles you do get require items that are hardly visible on the terrain. The island is littered with garbage, and there is no indication what is useful and can be picked up and what isn't, so you have to click on each item to see if the mouse cursor changes.I can only recommend this to people who are a huge fan of both Myst and Dear Esther, and who want the puzzles of the former in the latter game.

												I was drawn to this from the Irish angle and didn't really know what to expect.The way in which the environment is being portrayed is quite frankly amazing (note though that you need a fast machine to see it in all its glory). The voice acting and music are also spot on. So is it all great?Well, no. It seems to be a game that's having a bit of trouble deciding what it should be. Is it a puzzle game? Is it a story game? Is it a walking around type affair? At times, I don't think it is really sure. What it is though is absolutely captivating. As the story comes out (told through snippets from a book that are left laying around) a picture is built up of a character that is trouble by many things.Yes, the pacing is slow, the writing fairly 'over the top', but I think these are somewhat intentional. This is a game that demands the players commitment to read between the lines. I would certainly recommend it to people who want something a bit more thought provoking and different.			"

												This is how I like my adventure games. Lots of walking and looking around for stuff. The settings of an Irish island are great, the surroundings (trees and cabins) are drawn good, but I don't know of my video card suited the game cause it all looked a bit weird. You can check my screenshots to see what I mean.At first I played without looking at gamma correction settings and missed some stuff because it was all so dark, after I set it to highest (1.5) I could find all missing stuff to unlock all my achievements.The story telling was very good, it was a lot like ""Dear Esther"" leading to a climax which I won't tell you.I recommend it for those long winter evenings.

												The reasons why i wouldnt recommend this game outweigh why i would recommend it unfortunately. Now, the game is a good concept, but there were so many problems with it i just couldnt wait to finish the game. I dont like to just stop playing something because of whatever is wrong with it, so i pushed through because i also wanted to know what the whole story was etc. and give it a chance. Pros: *decent story*atmosphere was ok, it wasn't scary but i still didn't feel ""safe""*nice art but hard to enjoy with a skitzo framerateCons:*gameplay was slow and laggy, choppy framerate. when i finished the game it seems to freeze at the main menu so it didnt register my progress or anything--had to restart my computer and try again, still freezed.*puzzles were extremely fustrating. i like a challenge but these were no fun whatsoever. However when i DID figure them out i felt like a freakin genius lol*with the bad framerate, the walking around, limping at the beginning was just as irritating. i tried fiddling with my settings but some of that didnt even work. *the music/sound affects were a bit annoying but no big deal. not as annoying as the lightning and rain*letters/notes whatever were oft times hard to read All in all, my biggest dislike is the puzzles because most of the time i had no idea how to work them, it didn't even seem to register when i did use them but i got through the game nonetheless thanks to the option to turn 1 puzzle in particular off. Anyway, i got this game during the 75% off sale if i remember correctly, so for 2 bucks, i cant complain. though if i got it for the original price -,- yeeeeaaa i'd likely bust my computer with a hammer and cry for the waste of money. So i'm in between recommending and not doing so...give it a try if you'd like but there's no proper guides for this game, and it is very long and complicated if you dont know what to do. "

												In the past few years there have been more and more titles released that push the boundaries of what defines a game. Games like Dear Esther, Gone Home and Journey, to name but a few, rest on the edge of the traditional formats with their sparse gameplay elements and continue to divide gamers on their relevance within the medium. Whether or not the arguments these games incite will ever be resolved, Montague’s Mount is certainly another name to add to that list.The first of this two-part psychological horror exploration game begins on the beach of an unnamed Irish isle. You awake to stormy rains beating down from the midnight sky with no recollection of who or where you are.Through old photographs, mementoes and much darker clues, you begin to piece together parts of your identity and the nature of this forsaken place. The narrative is as sparse as the island you explore, but engaging enough to keep you hooked.One of the unique aspects that will immediately strike you is the bilingual presentation; every item you examine is named “as Gaelige” with an English translation underneath.This isn’t the only Irish influence in the game, either: Celtic cross headstones of the seemingly significant Loughlin family dot the game world, as do collectable St. Brigid’s crosses. The landscape of the island is a truly accurate representation of some of more rural areas of Ireland, particularly of places along the west coast, which is by no coincidence as it is these areas that are among the last bastions of the dwindling population of fluent Irish speakers. The other unique element is a theme of mental health, which actually fits quite well with the Irish setting. Mental health issues have long been the subject of heated debate in Ireland, with rural isolation being one of the main focal points.The setting is beautifully accentuated by the weather conditions. Storms come and go at random, bringing torrential rain that obscures your vision and seems to wash the colour right out of the already bleak environment. This adds a very palpable sense of desperation.The actual gameplay elements are minimal, with puzzles and a rudimentary inventory being your only source of direct interaction. Some of these are quite challenging, but thankfully very logical. Movement speed is uncomfortably slow, and though it is due to injury sustained during the implied shipwreck, it can be infuriating at times. The game demands a certain amount of backtracking and the snail’s pace at which you travel makes it border on unbearable.Montague’s Mount isn’t perfect. The amnesia trope is getting tired at this stage and it’s a short journey even if it is only the first part. It falls down is in some technical areas too. But these imperfections can be partially forgiven as this is an indie title developed by one man, and they don’t detract from the experience that has been created here. Unique and emotional in so many ways, while tackling issues rarely before seen in videogames, it can be safely said without any hyperbole that this is one of the most important artistic creations ever to come out of Ireland.

												Sometimes when I write a non-joke review (which I've been doing too often lately, in my opinion), I present it in an ""If you like ______"" sort of way, because I acknowledge that while I may not enjoy a certain aspect of a game, other people might be looking for just that thing. But I'm not going to do that for Montague's Mount, because I don't believe that there is a person who would be looking for anything that this game has to offer. I don't believe that there is a person who would enjoy waddling at a turtle's pace through a poorly designed island that might as well be in grayscale because the only colors you'll ever see for most of the game are ""gray"", ""dark"", and ""darker"" in the middle of the night in a storm solving puzzles that are only even remotely difficult because it's impossible to see anything between the darkness, the rain, and the film grain filter. I don't believe that there is a person who would look for a game that only manages to barely scrape 3 hours of play time because of how much time was spent waiting for painfully slow bridges and gates to open and how much time was spent with the game minimized making webms of the bridges and gates to show my friends how comically slow they were (no seriously, look - http://puu.sh/iHXzX/6b2c99289e.webm http://puu.sh/iHZVm/712ce69151.webm I don't know how long these links are going to work for, so if it's 2027 and you're reading this, just take my word for it), with the other 2 and a half hours mostly spent wandering in the darkness looking for a stray candle I might've missed because I need it for a puzzle even though there's a house with at least 10 candles just sitting around that can't be picked up. And I certainly don't believe that there is a person who, after putting up with all of the garbage found within this game, would feel like they got their money's worth when they see that the ending is just a borderline cliffhanger, and this game is only half of a story. I can't recommend this game to anyone, and even if you got it in an indie bundle I'd be hard pressed to actually recommend installing it unless you just have nothing better to do.			"

												First thing to know:  the awkward, slow walking only lasts for a short time (you have to find something).  Don't be put off!Really liked this game-- solid effort from PolyPusher, IMO.  It looks like some of the criticism it got in some of the reviews was addressed by the patch.  I never played pre-patch, so I can't compare.  Overall I found the game enjoyable, introspective, psychological, and, well, fun.  Love the exploration element with just enough story (and an interesting one) to keep you going.  It's not a long game, but it's not ultra-short, either.  I think the duration is about right.  You might find a puzzle that annoys you for one reason or another, but overall the puzzles are good.  And don't be put off by the clutter of items in the opening area-- the whole game isn't like that.You'll like the game if you like exploration, pretty 3D graphics, immersion, and no timed elements (technically the one mini-game is ""timed"" but if it really bothers you, you can disable it).  It's a pastoral, not an epic.  It rewards taking your time and enjoying the scenery.  Some will find that boring, others will find it just what they want to relax with over a few evenings.You won't like the game if you want to be able to run fast from screen to screen, need action or cool cutscenes, bright colors, an amazing, gripping story, or super-easy or super-hard puzzles.For achievement-hunters, if you pay attention at all, you should have no problem getting 19/20 achievements with a little patience.  The last one (finding the crosses) I only got 19/22 from normal gameplay and had to go back and hunt for the other three, including consulting a guide.  And with one exception, the ones I missed were pretty much in front of my face.Give it a shot.  8.5/10			"

												This is one of the few games that has legitimatey managed to make me cry as I uncovered more details about the story (which is based on a true story). If you can get over the slow walking mechanic (and I do mean *slow*, really slow) and allow yourself to become immersed you will find a beautiful atmospheric exploration puzzle game waiting for you.Also, I nominate this game for rain on the year - that was awesome rain, especially in stereoscopic 3D :-)Speaking of which, I have released a fix for this game to render properly in stereoscopic 3D. It can be a bit tempramental requiring numerous alt+tabs to get both the driver profile and helix mod to engage simultaneously without flickering or haloing issues, but once it all comes together it is just gorgeous:http://helixmod.blogspot.com/2014/10/montagues-mount.htmlThanks go to Vatrena for gifting me this game!

												After playing through this game in about 8 hours, I have to say, that it was at last worth it. Although there were some difficulities which I personally could only leave behind me by looking at one of the good guides which gives away hints rather than the direct solution and which to some extend gave me new motivation to get into the game.I did record all of my sessions as a Let's Play, so I wanted to finish this game anyways, otherwise I wouldn't have started it as a project.To start with some pros, I liked the atmosphere in this game very much. The choice of sounds, music and voice actors was excellent considering this is some sort of Indie project.On the negative side, the puzzles in the game were too difficult to grasp, too many times. The description wasn't always as clear as you might think. Even when considering this is still an exploration and adventure game, the puzzles could have been made better. One example might be the navigation puzzle at O'Sullivan's Bay.Nonetheless, I do recommend this game to others, who like to explore a very dark, tragic and partially confusing story. It is very well written and does definitely fulfill it's point as a part of the game.Second downside for me is the relatively bad performance and optimisation (probably only on lower-end). I understand, that a big part of the whole Island is being rendered at the same time but this game could have been made more frame friendly with comparable or better graphics in e.g. the Source Engine (see Dear Esther). If you use an engine, know the details. Get the best out of it and don't just rely on the fact, that hardware is getting better everyday. But that is a debatable point.Conclusively I want to state, that I really enjoyed playing Montague's Mount, especially in the tense moments leading to the end. Getting to know the story one bit at a time, finally completing in the tragic story it tells and getting to know the person and character you are playing. Feeling empathy, or disgust? What went wrong, what went right? Decide by yourself.Greetings,Deathy			"

												The short version: Like Dear Esther but with puzzles.The long version: While it shares a few comparisons with Dear Esther in terms of plot and setting--male protagonist wandering alone on a dreary-but-hauntingly-beautiful island--I'd have to say that Montague's Mount is by far the more disturbing of the two. You are likely to figure out what's going on halfway through, but uncovering the manner in which those things occurred still manages to keep the final reveal from feeling anticlimactic.The inclusion of puzzles obviously sets it apart from DE, and while some of them stumped me for a little while (the Compass Puzzle comes to mind), they didn't inspire an urge to rage quit. I have to admit, I was a little put off by how slow the character was, especially when certain puzzles required retracing my steps. Still, the game establishes the need for limited movement from the very beginning; as a storyteller myself, I do appreciate that foundation even if the gamer in me occasionally kept pressing left shift in hopes the narrator would move that walking stick just a little bit faster!By far, the best part of this entire game is the voice acting. As an American, I'm in no position to comment on the quality of the accent, but he definitely managed to put genuine emotion where it was needed. I felt for him when he began to despair. I felt his frustrations with his marriage. The reading of the last letter also helped the ending from falling too flat. The music in this game was also very lovely and added to the mood of the game.(That said, I wasn't entirely keen on the occasional popping up of quotes, even if they were relevant to one of the game's main themes. It kind of interrupted the immersive atmosphere that otherwise existed.)Speaking of the ending... I was expecting to continue on to the eponymous Mount after that last narration, only to wind up at the title screen! Right now it feels too open-ended. Part of me does think it fits, considering what we learn of the character over the course of the game. Since I've only just finished it, I think I need more time to really turn it over to definitely decide whether or not I liked the ending.Overall: It's worth playing through for the plot and voice acting. The music is appropriate and helps set the mood, the puzzles are an appropriate level of challenging, and if you liked Dear Esther--or just point-and-click adventures in general--you'll probably like this as well.

												I wanted to like this game, and indeed, it has a nice atmosphere. But that's about it. Takes forever to wander around looking for items that you've missed. Some of the writing is impossible to read, even though you need to read it to accomplish certain things in teh game, just do to bad lighting and effects. If you need an item to complete a puzzle it just tells you that you are missing an item, and not what item you are specifically missing. When I walked all the way back and found an item that seemed appropriate, and then back to the place where I needed it, I was still apparently missing the item I actually needed. If the game didn't spend so much time getting in its own way, it would be pretty enjoyable. As it stands, it needs some serious work.			"

												Like many who have played it, I have ambivalent feelings about Montague's Mount.On the one hand, this game EXCELS in music, narration and overall atmosphere! I actually created a .flac of the main theme just so I could listen to it from time to time.  Professionally composed and played.  And I enjoyed the ambient loop that followed.  Very contemplative...But, unfortuantely, on the other, its gameplay is downright DREARY; slogging thru wet sand the whole time at half-normal walking speed?  A bit tedious...Explanation of controls is lacking, too.  For example, nowhere is it indicated that in order to get the compass to appear to solve the complex tri-compass puzzle, you have to press 'Q'.  Quite aggravating when you don't know what to do.  Definitely, a potentially 'rage-quitting' flaw...And the TRULY sad ending was heartbreaking. Was hoping for a ray of sunlight at the end, but it was not to be.... :(Nonetheless, I still felt it deserved a full achievement quest, which was not that much work...So, two thumbs for this one:  1 up and 1 down...

												This game is like Myst, except the weather's worse and the protagonist moves more slowly. I loved Myst.The puzzles are logical. The colors are psychotropic, i.e. most of the stuff is grey-ish, but important objects will be colored and bright. Don't expect to rush around, the protagonist has a leg injury and walks with a cane. If you explore your surroundings carefully, the puzzles are straightforward and require little back-and-forth. I'd say this is more a game of mystery, less one of horror.One bug: move all of the spinners at least once, even if the combination is already correct, or the game will think it's not.My system: Intel i3-2120 @ 3.3GHz Geforce GTX-550 TiWindows 7My game settings:* Video *Screen Resolution 1920x1080Anti-Aliasing OnFilm Grain Off  <-------importantSmall Objects Shadows OnSmall Objects Cast Shadows OnSmall Objects receive Shadows OnReal-Time Shadow Distance FAR <-------importantObject Clipping Distance FAR <-------importantTerrain Clipping Distance FAR <-------importantOverall Graphical Quality SUPERBGamma Level 1Field of View 75°* Game *[ Key Mappings ]Object Highlights On  <-------importantDisable Achievement Text OffInvert Mouse Off* Audio *Sound Effects OnMusic OnSubtitles OffI know I set the language to English someplace before I started.

												I think that how you feel about this game will largely depend upon what you expect or want from it before going in. The tags on the store page say ""Adventure"" and ""Horror"" and ""Walking Simulator"", but to be honest I really think you should downplay the adventure and horror aspects and temper your expectations instead towards the walking part... and add ""Exploration"" and ""Puzzle"" into the mix while you're at it. That's what you'll be doing for the two or three hours it'll take to finish this, slowly walking around a small island, searching for items and using them to complete puzzles whilst also trying to solve the mystery of who you are after a storm has washed you up on a beach and robbed you of your memory.I can't say I actually cared about the protagonist's story all that much as starting off a game by waking up some place with amnesia has been done so many times it's lost its intrigue and impact. And at this point, instead of proving vital to a unique story, it feels more like a device to drip feed the player the details of the past while still keeping them in the present, as well as not have the character know something that the player who's controlling him doesn't. It's probably something of a Catch 22 situation as it's difficult as a storyteller to walk that line of having the player be someone else whilst also not really knowing who they actually are and finding a way to convey that information. But either way, it just didn't grab me.What I found far more interesting, though, was the story of the island itself and how a fatal infection that spread across it affected the now dead people and drove them ever more to desperate measures. And, sure, while your own character is a part of that story, it didn't feel as interesting as the bigger picture. By the end it appears as though the personal story has mostly been answered, so if the intended second/final part of this game ever sees the light of day I really hope it focuses on that and wrapping up your character's story is much more secondary.Gameplay itself is more about having a keen eye and a sharp mind as you track down items and follow clues to figure out how to complete puzzles. But this is another kind of Catch 22 situation as the atmosphere and presentation of the game clashes with actually operating within the world. So much effort is spent on creating the perfect tone that it makes finding objects and clues awkward at times. The entire game takes place at night and many areas are cast in shadow, add to that a film grain effect and the fluctuating colour that regularly drains to make the world completely grey and sometimes figuring out what you're missing really can feel like looking for a needle in a haystack. But while some of these effects are optional, as much as you're making it harder on yourself to leave them on, without them I think it takes away from the greatest aspect of the game, its atmosphere.Moody really doesn't begin to describe it. Throw in some more words like ""brooding"" and ""desolate"" and ""isolated"" and you're getting closer. When I started playing this I decided to do it in the wee small hours of the morning, with no lights on and the windows open to let in the cold air and rustling wind. It genuinely helped immerse me in the world even more, but this only built on what was already perfectly crafted to begin with. As I progressed through the game I began mentally drowning out the presentation as I focused on some of the more irritating puzzle features, but just before I finished it I started backtracking across the island for the sake of an achievement to walk ten kilometres (yes, I'm one of those people. Sometimes I hate myself, too), and that's when it really struck me just how much care and attention went into building a truly incredible atmosphere.Without any objectives to distract me I was able to better notice the details, like the waves lapping at the shore, insects chirpings and lights buzzing, the random coughs of your weather-beaten character, the fact that the greying of the game seems to coincide with the periodic rainfall and accompanying thunderclaps (the intensity of the grey being proportional to how heavy the rain is), or noticing eerie noises seeming to come from different points all around me. Is it an owl hooting somewhere, or my ears playing tricks on me to make it sound like distant children playing among the death and decay of the island, or possibly hidden somewhere crying? It really brought to life a rare feeling for me in a game where I really was immersed completely in my surroundings and overcome with a genuine sense of almost alien solitude and curious wonder, intrigue to explore but apprehension of the unknown. This really is as fine an example as you're going to see of how to craft an environment to evoke real feelings in a player.The game did take a bit of a bashing upon initial release, but it seems to have gotten better with additional updates and tweaks based on user feedback. I really do hope the negativity won't discourage the developer from carrying on with the conclusion, and if anything will use it as constructive criticism to further improve upon what he's already made. And if we're really, lucky Derek Riddell will also return to lend his excellent voice-over talents once more. As flawed as it may be, I really do think this deserves to be experienced by every fan of the genre. Look up a guide if you have to, mess with some settings if need be, but give it a chance and I think you'll be glad you did.			"

												I kind of liked it. It had a good atmosphere but the story is not that memorable. The puzzels where strange in that why that it sems like they give you the puzzels and then immediately tells you how to solve it. What brings it down a bit is that you walk sooooo slow. That is okey until you miss somthing and must go back and look. Lastly the lighhouse puzzel... it was more badly explained than hard, which forced walking back and forth a few times and at that time the slow walkning killed me.			"

												""This f***ing island, this f***ing rain, this f***ing bleakness!!!"" (с) Protagonist.+ Great tense atmosphere, intriguing plot (for the first half of the gameplay at least), good puzzles (more for relax, not for brainstorming), highly artistic voice.- Complete darkness. A good old oil lantern would not hurt. Movement and speed. Imagine yourself crossing, for example, Tamriel from border to border on foot without ""run"" button. Bugs. I had an issue of losing a half of checkpoints right before the ending, so watched someone else's video of beating the game. Wholeness. The game is not finished, storyline brokes on a halfway (but developers prompt us about it in description).P.S. In spite of all weak points I enjoyed playing the game and would recommend buying it when on sale. In my case I got a foil card dropped while playing and it twice covered the costs :D			"

												The best element of the game is its atmosphere. I left my character standing near the sea, next to a lighthouse, in front of a wooden door banging on a wall because of the strong wind: and I felt that it was real, all of it. I liked the music very much, too bad no soundtrack music tracks came with the game. The puzzles are very few and they are mostly very simple, you won't be frustrated by them. The way the character develops has a nice evolution to it and his voice fits very well to the general atmosphere. The notes that you find every now and then would be boring and useless if the character's voice was not good. Instead, they are a nice part of the game thanks to the good voice-acting. There are some graphic bugs, which is no wonder since the game was essentialy created by one person. In my eyes, the whole game is a big achievement.			"

												tldr; you'll bang your own head against a wall, much like the protaginist does.I started this game off with a couple friends, one controlling movement with a controller, one managing inventory and looking around with a keyboard. We managed to find a walking stick, pick up a few little red glowy wooden tube things, open a gate (in a world record time of: several minutes!), get confused - not creeped out - by a boy sat on a tree stump, because it looked like my computer was struggling so hard to deal with his motion that we only saw him move towards us in three key frames. Maybe this is because this game has Oculus Rift support, so the devs thought you'd blink at the correct moment, to give a creative Dr. Who vibe to the game. We quickly swooped up a gold medal in the world championships for this game by placing a protractor on a sun dial, then quit before we went mad - to play Shovel Knight.I returned to this game weeks later, and despite having full keyboard control, I cannot for the life of me find out which key I have to press to put that protractor back on that sundial. I think I need to put a valve wheel on something, but I can't figure that out either. Even the controls in the main menu don't give me the glimmer of enlightenment that I so longingly wish for, pray for. Don't let my play time fool you, I went AFK whilst watching Game of Thrones to get at least some achievements in this game. I initially laughed when I saw an achievement for walking - just walking - but given the unchangable, excrutiatingly slow pace the protaginist has, I can say that walking a few kilometres in this game truly is an achievement.Perhaps an interesting game to spend a pound on to see what not to do when trying to create an immersive game, but on the whole I strongly suggest you keep that pound, add it to the jar then pick up a game you actually want later on. You probably have enough games to keep you occupied anyway. I know you do. Don't look down in shame, look back at this review. There's a quip or two coming.Due to the Oculus Rift support, and door lintels being at eye-height, I dub this game ""Headbang simulator 2014"".If you already bought this game, give it a go - and if you don't like it, go afk, get those silly achievements and thankfully, some steam trading cards - perhaps someone's way of saying ""I'm... I'm sorry for accepting your money"".			"

												This is simply wandering around in the role of a man with amnesia. Various locations trigger memories and there are also journal pages scattered about with snippets of info. Along the way you solve mechanical and cypher puzzles to reach goals. You are always alone except for the ghosts of lost memories. Enjoyable for one or even two playthroughs but then there are no more mysteries to solve. I still liked it for the discounted price though.			"

												The game has a sad story, there are many letters to find and read. The feeling of loneliness is incredible strong. The graphic is fine and detailed for a non A+++ game. Its chaos on a island and you dont know what happen, you know nearly nothing so you search areas for few items and try your best. The quests are not hard but easy to oversee. I enjoy this journey even if its a bit short and sometimes frustation that the game gives nearly no tips only what are on letters written or codes you need to find but thats fine if you stuck you get one of many guides for help or walktroughs. Sometimes its hard because you think you have something but you dont get with it to next checkpoint and must repick it because game saves only on this few checkpoints, a weakpoint but only a little one, the spead of this man is not so fast, but at the end you know why he dont run. Only the game length could be better but 2-4 hours of entertainment are good, if you hunt the achievements like the 22 crux, find all 5 graves or 5 postcards are nice little gimmicks/ extras. So i give this game personal 87 % and i hope you enjoy it. I dont know the price of the game at the moment, so lock a trailer and think about what you are the game worth. I only hope the developer get further the chance to make games. Thank you for reading.			"

												I'm going to put this in right now, even though I've only just begun the game, because I'm frankly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the developers for including such an asinine puzzle right at the beginning.  Basically, when you first start the game, your character has some kind of problem walking, and to simulate this, the entire game screen wobbles. It's bad enough while you're standing still, but when you start moving around, it's absolutely intolerable. I couldn't watch the game for more than one or two seconds at a time before I started feeling hot and nauseous. I had to eyeball my target, close my eyes, then hold down the W key and check my progress. There is an item you can find to fix this, but still, why torment the sizable portion of game players sensitive to this kind of thing? If the rest of the game is fantastic, I may change my review, but for the moment I'm not happy at all about the fact I feel like I need to puke even five minutes after I've passed the wobbly part.

												Montague's Mount is a game that falls firmly into the 'walking simulator' genre in that it has a few puzzles but mainly consists of exploring a 3D environment while listening to various narrations, reading letters, and interacting with various items and obstacles. It's 99% story and 1% gameplay. With that said, the story is very well done, the graphics are high quality, and the atmosphere and ambience of the game create a feeling of uncertainty and isolation.For a walking simulator though, it is on the boring side. The puzzles are very challenging and many players may need the assistance of a guide to complete the game. I'd recommend it but only for those who enjoy this as one of their favorite genres. For those interested in trying a 'walking simulator' for the first time I'd probably recommend Dear Esther. Montague's Mount is for the extremely devoted walking simulator player.			"

												A Myst-like with a psychological horror plot based on a true story sounds like a great idea, doesn't it?  Yes, yes it does.  This implementation of that idea, however, is... not so great.Devs will often start their games with something impressive or exciting, which is an effective strategy, because it hooks players in quickly and provides something to show off in demos and trailers.  PolyPusher opted for the alternate, questionable strategy of making the first few minutes of Montague's Mount so unbearably awful that the rest of the game seems excellent by comparison.  You begin the game walking very slowly around a rainy beach, and as you walk, the camera rocks wildly.  Even while standing still, the camera remains unsteady.  The graphics are not too bad for an indie game, but dark and heavily desaturated, and there's a film grain effect enabled by default.  Both of those effects individually make sense to set the mood, but the combined effect is over-the-top and very hard on the eyes.  But wait, it gets worse: under these conditions, you are given a tutorial and your first objective, in the form of a couple pinned notes.


Looks terrible 
A Screenshot of Montague's Mount
By: filip ✌




You can't inspect these notes or pick them up to get a clearer view; you have to get as close as you can to them, and then read them - despite the mediocre graphics with heavy desaturation, and the film grain, and the rain, and the rocking camera.  Within a few minutes, I had decided that if the point of this game was to make me feel queasy and illiterate, well, mission bloody accomplished.  A better plan would be to say ""screw that"" and look up a guide.  You'll probably do that more than once if you play this game.If you have the stomach to continue in the face of such adversity, once you disable the film grain and find a walking stick to steady the camera, you'll find that the rest of the game is playable at the very least.  The desaturated graphics with poor lighting remain a little hard on the eyes, but tolerable.  The walking speed isn't as excruciatingly slow as other reviewers make it out to be (but you'll find yourself wishing you could run occasionally).For the most part, the puzzles make sense, but one was fiddly and had a solution that was the opposite of what I thought it would be, and another would have you walking a fairly long distance back and forth between a Morse code message and the barely legible key for deciphering it (again, say ""screw that"" and look up a guide).  Video game logic and contrived puzzles are pervasive here, which works for some games, but in this one, the knowledge that it's based on a true story and should be realistic creates dissonance.  (Seriously, who builds crazy locking mechanisms like these in real life?  Why do I have to get a specific candle when it's clear that any candle will do and there are a dozen strewn about?  Why would someone write a note that says ""I should have written the code here"" and not write the code?  Who carefully arranged all these journal pages for me to find, and why?)  The inventory system adds another annoyance: you can only carry five items at a time.  Sure, if we're going for realism, a person can only carry so much, but a limit of five items, regardless of size and weight is just arbitrary, not realistic.  And from a gampelay perspective, limited capacity makes sense in RPG's and such, but not in adventure games like this, where you need to pick up everything you can in order to progress.  Worse, once you pick an item up, you're stuck with it until you can use it - there's no way to set something down.  If you're stuck and find a sixth item you know what to do with, too bad, you'll have to make some progress and then backtrack later.  Devs, please don't do this; there's no excuse for it.  Either let me manage my inventory or just don't limit what I can carry.The story is... well, it's not bad, and I like the idea of basing a game on a true story, but it's simplistic, and definitely not the psychological thriller it's described as being.  There's nothing thrilling about it; it's more accurately described as creating an atmosphere of despair.  I can sum it up in one short sentence: there was a plague, and a lot of people died.  I'm not even spoiling anything by saying that - it's clear from the first journal page you find, right after starting the game.  Also, your progress is occasionally interrupted by a quote about mental illness, or the appearance of a ghost boy, accompanied by motion blur and a racing heartbeat.  These are eventually sort of explained in the one real development the plot gets, but it's not especially satisfying, and I agree with certain other reviewers that the ghost was unnecessary.I appreciate what Montague's Mount was trying to be, but it didn't succeed, and given the poor artistic choices, gameplay annoyances, and shallow plot, I can't recommend it.

												This is a very slow, tedious, ultimately boring game.There is one movement speed.  Slow.  Movement isn't the only slow thing.  The result of many actions are slow.  Just solved the puzzle to unblock the path?  The animation for the path becoming unblocked takes longer than it took to solve the puzzle for it.  Puzzles can bug out and not work correctly.  One puzzle late in the game I had to exit and reload a check point 3 times before solving teh puzzle did what it was supposed to do.  Another part of a puzzle that had 2 parts had each part fail on me.  So bugs, yeah.There are a coupel of note sthat are hard to read because you can't get close enough to them.  In particular the one on the first beach near the start.  The narrative, as with most games, is told through finding journal entries along the way and some protagonist commentary.  The problem here is that by teh end of the game the entries seem somewhat unconnected, vague, and not very revealing.  Through certain ones and a typically boring cliche you should figure out the ""twist"" well before it happens, though once you do you're left with even more question because you discover this is more like an ""Episode 1"" than a full experience.Another aspect of the narrative is that despite the depressing soundtrack and the despondent vocalizations of the protagonist there really is nothing that sets up anykind of emotional atachment to any character in this game.   I feel no sorrow for this guy or his troubles even at the (poor) attempt at a shocking emotional twist (which I mentioned before you see coming a mile away).  The narative sets you up for a depresisng story but fails to deliver any kind of connection to deliver.The graphics are ok for small indie game but they won't blow you away.   Despite an above average gaming rig the performace was pretty poor, but you can tweak the visuals...film grain seem to be the biggest performance hit, but even at low setting frame rates aren't where the should be.  There are areas where the camera can get hun up and it will jitter sometimes but I never got stuck.There are only checkpoint saves, and that was problematic when I had to reload several times to finish the last puzzle as the last check point was well before then.  Manual saves to me are a must so this is a big failure to me.Controls are minimal and you can configure the keys to your liking.  The only key I saw necessary to change was the inventory key as it was the only key used that wasn't on the left side of the keyboard.  The game has ""partial"" controller support but it absolutely useless to use a controller so don't even try.The music was simple and repetitive and as I said, meant to set a depressing tone.  Audio quality is also minimal, but nothing bad.  All in all this is a novice attempt at somber adventure game.  While the bugs can be mostly overlooked sadly it fails in both pacing and narrative to be an experience I wouldn't recommend let alone return to.			"

												In the vein of pixel hunting adventure games, the only challenge to Montague's Mount's puzzles is finding all the pieces. The plot is vague and fails to pull you in, and doesn't make an effort to bond you with the characters before ineptly trying to evoke empathy. For some strange reason the game gives translations in gaelic, perhaps you need to be Irish to feel moved by it.While the graphics are nice for a low-budget title, the music is bland and the voice acting unconvincing - although maybe that is better attributed to the writing.

												If you're looking to ""have fun and laugh"" be careful; this might not be the game for you.  This is more of a how-to-handle-tragedy/depression/sickness/solitude-game... if that is helpful in any way.  It is a first-person, puzzle AND adventure game, with a touch of ""real-life"" drama and a small amount of terror.Wake up in a deserted island INJURED and not able to walk pretty much, and solve puzzles to ""get out"" if you can.  Simple enough?..  It's night-time... or at least you will never see the light of day, it's raining/pouring most of the time, the letters you find scattered in the island will be very clear about the horrible weather in the island.  I can't speak much more without giving too much away... but I will say this much, the ambient sounds are eerie.... there is NO way to play this game without imagining a creature of some sort jumping onto your path and dismembering you, (for example: the poison zombies from Half-Life 2 which I passed once on a friend's account).... the game is very succesful in making you feel horribly eerie while there is NOTHING that can actually happen to you... it is almost unbelievable that you will not ""die"" at some point.  Keeping me in that suspense was, fun!  I remember saying ""there is no way I will believe that someone or something wont hack me to pieces at any second!"" heheIt's that feeling you get when you're in the woods (vs. being in the city) thinking something out of the shadows will murder you.  Truth is, you're in more danger in the city (ironic lol).  You need to know city life to know the feeling lolThe only real issue I do have, is all the debris in the island, makes you wonder if the place got hit by a tornado... (it couldn't have, the rains are hard but not tornado-like).  Ah, YES forgot to mention; there is a morse-code puzzle!!  I love morse code!Anyway, do observe everything closely... specially the floor.  There are so many items you can miss.  Saving feature is not so great, but the game saves everytime you solve a puzzle (no dude, opening a gate is not a puzzle... at least not in the prologue) so it is fair.			"

												Montague's Mount is an atmospheric, story-based adventure game emphasizing on exploration and puzzle-solving, or a ""walking simulator"" as some people prefer to term games like this. Although I'm averse to labeling games as walking simulator, I have to admit that this game actually fits the category. From my own experience, most of the walking simulators get tons of negative reviews just because they are walking simulators. You walk a lot, you read a lot, you don't get much action and the freedom to choose what you do and where you go, and a fair amount of people hate it.If you are one of those who can't take a slow-pace experience or value gameplay more than story and atmosphere, please don't waste your time on this game because it may probably drive you crazy with its lengthy cutscenes and slow-mo animations. However, if you are one of those who find games like ""Dear Esther"" or ""Everybody's Gone to the Rapture"" charming, this game could be a nice treat for you. Since it's already mentioned above, I might as well talk some more about the ""slowness"" in this game. First of all, you can't sprint, instead, you walk at a speed similar to hiking in real life. Secondly, despite that the map in the game isn't huge, there's backtracking involved, and quite often actually. There's so much walking in this game that the devs even added in some achievements for walking, ""Walked xx kilometres"" basically. So, prepare yourself for the exciting 5-hour walking exercise (""W"" key holding exercise if you will). I do sometimes find the inability to sprint in these games frustrating, but I'm okay with this game because the story and the atmosphere make it worthwhile to endure the part that's kinda dull.The graphic in this game is quite impressive at first sight, but it gets old later due to the recurring assets and the roughness of the textures. The game begins with film grain effect by default, which seems cool for the first few minutes but it can really make your eyes fatigue faster (there's a thread in the discussion mentioning a few things to change in the settings before jumping into the game and it's very helpful in my opinion, so check it out if you decide to play this game). Grey is the dominant color and it sets a gloomy tone for the game. Littery beaches, abandoned villages, jagged ridge and grotesque rocks, shimmering lights emitted by the street lamps and the buoys from the coast, accompanied by the howling wind, pouring rain, the sounds of thunders and the trembling steam siren from far, all blended up into the terrific atmosphere. Being in the game for a short while, I already found myself deeply immersed, and I think the atmosphere is what this game does best.The game is based on a true story, supposedly (it seems that some of the locations actually exists, I'm not sure though). You'll play as an amnesiac man who wakes up on a beach alone and decides to find out the whereabout of his wife and children and the truth behind the mysterious disease which killed all the villagers. Notes and diary pages of the protagonist are scattered around the island, allowing you to slowly piece the story together. The ending is kind of a cliffhanger, implying the possibility of a sequel (there's news confirming that episode 2 is on its way). The voice acting of the protagonist is emotional enough to make the player sympathise with him.The puzzles in the game are not too hard to figure out as they usually have written hints nearby. Basically, you'll just need to hunt for the require items or visual clues lying around the map, which leads to my biggest complaint of the game: it's too easy to miss an item and ends up wasting plenty of time wandering through every places possible and pixel-hunting that one tiny object! For example, I was told to find four pieces of a jigsaw and the last one took me about half an hour to finally discover. It wasn't even hidden, but lying quietly on a beach in plain sight... It's just that there're too many irrelevant objects in the game and lots of the areas are too shady. The important items do glow a little bit but the environment makes it harder for you the see properly. To avoid this from happening you can adjust the brightness in the menu but extra attention is required anyway.The game rewards the player's effort in exploring and observing the surrounding as there're collectables and hidden areas to find in order to unlock achievements. There's not much replayability though, which is quite common for these types of games. Overall, it provides you an experience about 4~5 hours long.That's about all I have to comment on Montague's Mount, I do enjoyed this game very much and I recommend it to you if you like ""walking simulator"" with great atmosphere and touching story.

												Montagues Mount is a real story of an internal struggle to live with the authors own demons. A game using storytelling, puzzles, and a beautifully rendered yet dark simulation which the player explores, all the while unfolding tragedy after tragedy. A linear story yet wide open to interpretation, but be sure to tweak up the brightness a bit first. Montagues Mount is an admirable one-man effort. Like many games in the genre, it has unique mood elements and features like Oculus Rift support. One such clever immersion trick is the way all items in the game are labelled in Irish (with English translations of course.) All of which smooths over the horror and the harshness of isolation. Is Aine still alive?Getting to the top of the mount should take about an hour, 2 at most. If you like this short story, first try out Dear Esther and others like To the Moon, Trauma, Gone Home and The Novelist.			"

												I really liked the game. However, get it at a discount. It's short. The graphics are dated and there are some technical problems. I loved the sound. The music, the sound effects and the voice acting of the protagonist were suberb. That, the nice story and the fun puzzles are what kept me going to finish it in one sitting. Great job on the creator!			"

												""Based on a What Now?""First off, I'll admit. I wasn't a fan of Dear Esther. I did, however, like Gone Home, so I'm going to assume I'm not just biased and go from there.MM is a short horror/exploration game that follows a familiar trope. Your character has amnesia (why? Who knows.) and you must travel the island finding hints and clues about what happened there in hopes of finding out your own identity.It plays relatively well. I've seen a lot of people complain about the walking speed, but I didn't think it was too savagely slow, although the many, many to-ing and fro-ings required to solve some puzzles do make it frustrating. If memory serves, though, Esther and other games like it have been slower in the travelling.I can't say much about the graphics. I turned off the grainy quality because it made it impossible to read signs, and so I didn't see what the creator intended. But I found myself frequently wanting to turn the lighting up, and I missed a few puzzle pieces for a LONG time because they vanished in shadows.Honestly, the only thing that kept me going was the idea that this was based on a true story; I wanted to know what the disease was, if that was the true part, or if it was the man's family life and his apparent struggle with mental illness and all the things we find out happened with his life on the island. If that's the reason you want to play, I'm gonna say it right now - don't. You'll feel jipped when you find out that the 'based on a true story' really means that the creator moved to Ireland with his wife and had some cultural and language barriers to overcome. That's the parallel to the game. So if you're in this for the story, hoping it'll have more true-to-life and less hackneyed-cliche elements than others, then don't waste your time.The story is ... okay. You, obviously, don't get to know EVERYTHING, because they saved some for a sequel, but it's interesting enough that I kept going. If you've played more than one similar game, however, you'll have guessed the entire plot when you get ten minutes in. It doesn't overcome the difficulties in gameplaya nd visuals that make this game a slog to get through. (Maybe that's something we should guess from the fact that there's an achievement for playing it for three whole hours?)Basically, if you're mad into the genre and actually enjoy the plot elements and gameplay, and want some SERIOUSLY over-wrought puzzles, then you might just enjoy this. If you need a little more than that, then this is probably just going to disappoint.			"

												Well, I don't exactly know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. It was boring, had a story that was going nowhere, and it was oh so very slow. When I saw the game on Steam I thought it would be at least a bit suspenseful, but the devs wouldn't even give us that. Hell, there's no ending to the game. There's a cliffhanger for a sequel, but I highly doubt that one will see the light of day. Cons: you can't run, tedious puzzles, banal and predictable plot, everything is dark as ever living hell, and there's no ending. Also the story makes very little sense. Pros: it looks pretty and there's a dead kid.			"

												Nope. I really enjoyed games like Dear Esther and Gone Home but this title just had too many problems in the short amount of time I could stand to play it. I will make this short because I am not even on the fence about this one.Cons:1. Way too dark to enjoy any of the graphics (or was this to cover up issues?).2. UI is not intuitive at all. Like ""I need a piece for this machine..."" but no clues as to what that piece may be.3. Glowing notes left everywhere are barely readable at that distance. No zoom as far as we could tell.4. Storyline was pretentious and failed terribly at making me interested.Alright, well there it is. I got this in a bundle and still have buyer's remorse.			"

												If you can get the game for under 5 Bucks AND have nothing better to do, grab it, otherwise ignore it and move on...- The atmosphere and immersion are good ....  for about an hour. Then the game boils down to a boring ""Let's get it over with"".- Puzzle feel forced into the game, are often illogical and even now buged. (The last puzzle even had a game breaking bug, keeping me from finishing the game, had to watch the end on youtube...- Story would have been ok, but the presentation and structure is poor and story is only advanced through journal entries that are placed along the road like save game tokens... very unimmersive.- graphic is ok-ish...

												UPDATED: This review started out as ""Not Recommended"" because it was unplayable for me for quite awhile due to technical problems; I couldn't play the game for more than a few minutes before it crashed Then I figured out how to get my dual Radeon HD 6950s to work with it; I believe there was a patch also that probably fixed things for me. So after playing the game for awhile, I changed my review to 'Recommend"". It was my sort of game. I tend to gravitate toward these type of creepy walking simulator games and sometimes they end up being disappointing or utter trash (like ""All Is Dust""). Well, this game was drawing me in, but now that I have finished it, I have to say that the ending was disappointing. I am sick of all these games these days with ambiguous endings.Here's what I liked about the game:The atmosphere and the setup and the voice acting, music, and sound effects do a good job of setting the tone. Here's what I didn't like. The puzzles were either spelled out for you, or so incredibly obtuse. Sometimes the game would give you a big clue for the puzzle, but then when you try to do that, it's not what is necessary to solve the puzzle; the solution is much easier than what the clue tells you. ( I am thinking about the plinith puzzle).The save system is annoying with checkpoints that don't always remember what things you partially accomplished. Sometimes the items you need are in really dark areas amidst lots of debris and trash (Yes, I did turn on the option to make those items glow red when you mouse over them).The ending wasn't worth it to me all of the slow-walking around I did with the backtracking and the weird puzzles and odd ""rules"" like I can only carry 5 items at a time. Even when I got the game to run with my video cards, I still had technical problems that made playing annoying. My mouse cursor kept ""going out of the game"" to my Windows desktop on my other monitor and that was constantly breaking immersion.When I had switched my review from ""Not Recommend"" to ""Recommend"" I said I was gald that I gave the game a second chance and that I hoped the story's ending wouldn't disappoint. Well, it did disappoint, so here I am back at ""Not Recommend"". I really wanted to like this game a lot more, but it was a grind to get through it, even though it's such a relatively short game. Buyer beware.			"

												Got this game on at a lower price thanks to one of those discount slips you get based on what games you play. In my case, I got it for playing Dear Esther.The resemblance between the two games is readily apparent: both take place on a seemingly abandoned British island; both have a dark, sombre tone; both a walking simulators (though Montague's Mount features puzzles and an inventory, which Dear Esther lacked); both have rather similar musical scores; and both hint at themes of significant loss.Both also have some mildly scary psychological horror elements, but are perfectly harmless in such. Dear Esther only has scary sounds, while Montague's Mount features some sort of ghost (I think), with the only scary interaction is early on when he blinks to right in front of few from live 7 metres away. While this initial thing kept me from playing the game during dark (because I'm a real scaredy cat), it didn't detract from the experience, keeping me on my toes while never actually bothering me with cheap jump scares or any other nightmare fuel.After all, the focus of this game is on exploration, story and puzzles. The puzzles are great, requiring quite a bit of thinking and a few breaks inbetween play sessions (to refresh your perspective), but I never had to resort to any guides to figure one out. Objects are fairly easy to spot too, usually by their faint glow or highlight (which can be turned of, IIRC), though a fair for about one mission critical object hidden in a desk drawer. A problem with this game is that a lot of objects are non-interactable, and even on the generally interactable ones, only parts of them are. For example, you can only open one of the closet doors, but there are two drawers in the bottom that are quite easy to miss due to its small size, or to quickly dismiss as decorative if you don't. This issue kept me running about looking for that a certain piece of paper for over an hour.Still, the solutions I tried to come up with were quite inventive, as you start putting various numbers together into various combinations based on the little information you're given. I must admit that even though they didn't work, the process of elimination and trial and error was many times more enjoyable than solving the puzzle itself, which really goes to show the care taken into crafting a game that not only gives you an experience, but actively stimulates your creative and deductive abilities as well. Few games manage to affect me that way, and considering that this was made by a small-time producer, hat's off to them!Overall, I'd say this qualifies as a first-person adventure game more than merely a walking simulator, given the amount of puzzle solving and object collection it involves. Gameplay-wise, it's very minimalistic, with no HUD to speak of, and a very modest inventory (both spatially and visually), resembling Grim Fandango in that aspect. Its dark and dreary and particularly foreboding atmosphere, however, coupled with its story, revealed through Amnesia-style notes read in a wonderful Irish accent, combine with the mechanics seamlessly to make this a humble yet very enjoyable experience; and I can highly recommend it to anyone who liked adventure games, puzzle solving or story-driven games in general.

												It is way too much of a walking simulator to enjoy the actual game. You do have to solve puzzles but backtracking takes so long. God forbid you don't pick up the walking stick in the beginning. You go from a snail's pace to a turtle's. The story is okay at first glance, but if you look at it by itself, you realize it's extremely short and only seems to be filled with content because of how slow you're walking. As far as horror goes, nothing too scary, but the ambience is nice.Easy 100% if you can stand walking this slow4/10 Walking Sticks			"

												NOTE: I DID NOT FINISH THE GAME! It is possible the game got better as it progressed, but I can only rewiew the first hour or so of gameplay as I quit after this point. Going into Montague's Mount, I really, really, desperately wanted to like it. An Indie Horror Adventure game akin to walking simulators such as Dear Esther, this game had every reason for me to like it from the word ""go"". As I quickly discovered in the first few minutes of gameplay, however, the game became much less enjoyable upon being played. The walking controls were clunky and non-fluid (as if you were walking through a vat of pancake batter with one leg completely shattered), the graphics were nothing to write home about (even on maximum settings), the voice acting was quiet and non-impressive, and ultimately the game was far too repetitive to hold my interest. The game eased into a pattern of simply running back and forth from location to location collecting items to solve further puzzles with no real merit or value behind any of it. Even the puzzles themselves were often incoherent; not really connected in any particular way and often quite difficult to solve. As I said above I did not finish the game (despite the time it says on my activity I only played it for a little over an hour), and it is possible that the game becomes more enjoyable in the later stages, but from my experience I'd recommend passing this game up. Save up your money and time for games that do what this one is meant to do, such as Dear Esther or (nobody hit me) even Amensia: A Machine for Pigs.			"

												The game isn't all THAT bad if you know what to expect. I read the reviews before buying, so I knew to have much lower expectations of it.It's NOT worth 10$, but if you recieved an 80% off coupon, I think it's worth the 2$. The tags and description is pretty misleading. I saw ""psychological thriller"" with the ""horror"" tag and was expecting some creepy stuff. [spolier]The only creepy thing about this game was that damn little kid that just appears. And really its not even that creepy.[/spoiler]In all though, the mild story is pretty interesting. Keeping in mind throught the game that someone went through a similar psychological experience. (I'm still searching for the original story that the game was based on.) Most of the puzzles are easy enough and they're a bit fun to figure out. One or 2 are far more annoying than they should be...you'll know 'em when you see 'em. Though the grey bleakness gives it a good touch, it could be improved upon to be less annoying. The most annoying thing about the game is how slow you walk. When you have to back-track, it gets rather tiresome to take so long to do so. The ending does make me look forward to the second part...if they ever go through with it. Interested in seeing where it goes and what improvements they make. I WOULD recommend giving this game a try ONLY if you get it super-discounted. I would NOT recommend buying it full-price though. NOT worth 10$ but worth experencing for ~2$			"

												While the atmosphere is on point the rest of the game is just too all over the place. The constant wobbling of the character makes it hard to look at things and lighting is bad in that you can't see the notes that are supposed to give you information on what to do. Puzzles aren't all linear, which is kind of nice but some frustrating that you just might need a guide to get through (if you can find one!). The lack of saving at any time is annoying as you'll likely be forced to repeat steps you have already done and wonder if you've already done something or not. Overall, would not recommend for the lightharded or easily frustrated but some fun can be had in the puzzles if you are willing to work for it.			"

												The first time I heard about this game was when I got a coupon for it. The reviews made me hesitate a bit, but 2€ is a price I can pay for some exploration. It was worth it. I liked the story and atmosphere and scenery, but some puzzles were so hard to figure out that I had to resort to a guide. The thing that most bothered me was the interruptions in pace by unnecessary cutscenes and quotes. I liked the slow walking pace and I tend to take my time and look around and explore everything in games like this, but I don't like being forced to look into a certain direction at a certain moment when there is no need for it.

												Not really a puzzle/adventure game as much as a quest to try to find objects in the dark.  Many of the ""puzzles"" that do exist are provided with flat out instructions that say ""you need to find these things and then do this in order to progress"".  There really isn't a whole lot of thought required to complete the game...just a little patience in trying to find the required objects in most cases.  While I have to admit that there were one or two times when I had trouble finding the next piece of the puzzle, most of the time I stumbled across what I needed before I even knew I needed it.  I somehow managed to find every last one of the hidden/secret areas without even trying, while simply exploring the island in a logical manner. Overall, the game wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great either.  If I had to pay full price, I probably would have been dissapointed in the purchase.  I purchased this game via a discount coupon and would have to say it was worth the couple of dollars I spent.  If you get a chance to get this game at a deeply discounted price, then by all means, go for it.  If you are on the fence about paying full price, I would recommend you look elsewhere.			"

												I'm annoyed by the negative reviews for this game. Very annoyed, because I fear they will keep this excellent game from getting the sequel it deserves. :(But first, let's start with my review, which is very positive.This game is primarily about atmospheric immersion, fostered by excellent graphics, sound, color, and lighting design, especially for weather. The rain beats on you throughout almost the entire game, the world is gray, and you can almost feel the sting of the wind shaking the bushes and trees and ocean. Those precious few moments where there is a break in the clouds and some color fills the world seem especially precious. (A great time to hunt for hidden objects, too!) The world (an island) is thoughtfully designed, and it's quite neat to see all the pieces come together as you explore it. The Irish pride is very apparent, with all names translated from Gaelic, and a few flags to remind you, in case you forgot.And there is a story, a very clear one, with a clear ending in which some of the core questions are resolved, and yet there are still unanswered issues demanding a sequel.And this is no ""walking sim"": it's a real game with real puzzles, some of them quite challenging indeed. It's not as hard as Myst/Riven for sure, but a few puzzles don't give much indication if you're on the right path. They're not the best puzzles I've seen in adventure games, but are far from the worst, and there is quite some satisfaction in completing them on your own. There are also achievements, which involve finding some hidden items, many of them very difficult to find. I would have been quite lost without a guide! Note that you can finish the game and then easily go back to various checkpoints to find the hidden objects you missed, so there's no need to get anxious about achievements during your first run.So, what's with all the negative reviews?Some of them are from people who just have no interest in atmospheric games: because you can't run here and are forced to move quite slowly, they dismiss it as a ""walking sim."" Honestly, you don't walk that slowly in Montague's Mount, the island is rather small, and all in all you are rewarded with the gorgeous environment for those few times you do need some patience. I didn't feel like this part of the game was tedious at all. Hell, you need much more patience to get around in Skyrim!On the other hand, there are those people who compare Montague's Mount negatively to Dear Esther. There are embarrassingly obvious similarities that do beg a comparison: both games take place on barren, gray, northern islands, and involve uncovering a dead past. But, whereas people complained that Dear Esther didn't have any real ""game"" to it now they are complaining that Montague's Mount's puzzles are too nonsensical! There's just no pleasing some people.Dear Esther's textures and lights are better designed, but Montague's Mount still has a lot going for it visually, and though it looks less gorgeous and lush, it's still quite beautiful and immersive.My only real complaint is that the physics are a bit buggy. In a few cases I was sure I clicked something, only to return later to find that I didn't. Super big hint: make sure to check all the drawers!If anything I wrote here appealed to you, please play the game and leave an honest, hopefully positive review. I would really like to see a part 2 in the future!Finally: I'd like to thank the developer for supporting Linux so well.			"

												Montague's Mount is a dark, atmospheric game, with wonderful voice acting. It's puzzles are challenging, and the mystery of the island will keep you moving forward, wanting, and wondering what you will ultimately uncover. There are a few glitches, like the camera getting stuck, but overall it's an intriguing experience.Read full review: http://killstreakmedia.com/review/montagues-mount/ "

												A beautiful title that promotes a beautiful language, most of the reviews that are negative are unfortunately biased towards either the genre or the style of gameplay. (dont buy games you know you wont like, or do research before you buy. just because you dont like a game doesnt mean it is bad, just not to your taste) it is a walking simulator with some satisfyingly complex puzzles and intriguing story line. beautiful atmosphere and phenomenal sounds and music. i would reccomend this to any one who likes a challenging puzzle, exploration and just generally looking at the scenery. treat this game as if it were a painting, it makes you think and its nice to look at. id give it a 8.5 out of 10 as it achieved its goal in providing an interesting thought provoker and good story line, but the graphics pop in can be a tad irritating. all in all i hope part 2 gets finished soon!

												I really don't understand why people have a problem with this game. I will happily admit that I'm not an expert gamer, but I completed it today without resorting to any hints or guides (except for the plinth puzzle, which was my own fault for not realising that I had a compass).If you like Dear Esther you will like this. The Metacritic score is ridiculous, I would give this a clear 80% (I'd give DE 90%).Just turn the film grain off and yes, the very beginning may give you motion sickness but you should find the walking stick within five minutes and from then everything is great.Very atmospheric, loved the soundtrack, storyline and Celtic influence. Can't wait for the second part! "

												tl,dr: I get the feeling this game was a college project that got out of hand. I can't recommend buying this game at full price but if you see it on sale pick it up.This game has some really well composed environments and the engine has some very nice shading options, but the model and texture artists seem to have been modelling for a bygone era. There is a lot of low detail models and textures that could be so much more detailed. The environments are really well composed. A lot of places look very pretty and screenshottable except for the noticeably low resolution textures andrepetetive models. Maybe you guys only had one artist and he was under the pump the entire time? Usually low detail wouldn't bother me but for a game that so heavily advertises its art, and has a setting for 'superb' on graphics, I was expecting something more... impressive. Considering the game was released in 2013, I saw no baked normal maps and the normal maps I did see were obviously generated in photoshop from images. The environment composition was great but the models and textures themselves left me feeling unfulfilled and alienated.As for the timing of the release, I'm sure you guys have had some pressure from comparison to Dear Esther. And I gotta say, you invited it. Guess which game I am summarizing: A quiet, piano fuelled romp along a deserted island with some old pom narrating about a sickness that cleaned the island out. Gameplay focus on exploration in pretty, gritty environment. Some scaryish bits. After playing both I'll attest they are quite different, but those who liked one would like the other. Maybe you could have delayed the release for a little while, focussed on some of the problems and then released to an audience with not such a fresh memory of your direct competition? More time to bake those normal maps too.The gameplay itself showed some bad design decisions. For instance, the massive camera shake at the start. I think I played this how it was supposed to be played - late at night, lights off, headphones in - and I think you guys were trying to force the player to feel like a concussion victim. I know I did and I don't usually have motion issues. When I did finally get the walking stick it was a bit too much of a relief. Also the first part with the kid laughing was badly executed. I didn't know if I was still in a cutscene or not because the screen still letterboxes until the player moves. The laughing track was repeated and not creepy and there was no creepy leadup to that scene so it felt really out of place.What this game does show though, is the capability of a team to band together and get some♥♥♥♥♥♥done. The game seems programmatically sound and, even though there are some bugs and strange occasions, it all works well enough. If this was the entire work of two or three people then I applaud your efforts for getting this thing out the door and shipped on steam. You can only go up from here. If this was a big team then I'm not very impressed with the net product. I'm going to recommend this game though because I like seeing small game studios like you guys get publicity and go on to greater things. Fills me with hope. Hoy ti, mañana yo.			"

												I was drawn to this paranormal/mystery game because it was something different, in that it took place on an unknown irish island and the text featured in-game for signs, item descriptions, and location is Gaelic (with translation). Many sites mock/belittle the atmosphere, the voice acting, the puzzles, and just plainly the game itself. In all honesty, it is a bit much for such a short game and like myself would wait untill it goes on sale. The game itself is short, linear and the music is limited yet pleasing to the ears. The scenery/atmosphere is a bit dark and add film grain to the visuals which can be removed in the options. I like this as it is the dead of night on a moonless island and I feel the film grains adds a re-telling or recollection of a tragic past through the eyes of someone alive, desceased, maybe somewhere in between...The puzzles I think are the main downfall. They are easy despite being odd, convoluted, and elaborate considering the storyline and the current situation. Though, some puzzles fit in nicely but all are blended in to that one really has to look carefully, and I do admit it is kind of hard given the dark scenery and film grain (*film grain can be removed in options). But really, it's you're looking for something in real life it doesn't magically give off an glowing aura or flash for you to say ""Here I am!."" (*...Although it would be great....*) but the game does highlight SOME things for you.All-in-All, the game was a good lilttle experience and educational as well for those interested in Gaelic and want a game that takes you somewhere else.NOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.			"

												Summary:7/10 - don't buy it for full priceThis game is strange but good. There were parts in the flavor text that sent a chill down my spine, and the overall story is superb.Technical issues:[EDIT: I'm told the devs released a patch which updated the Unity3D, fixing the mouse issue among other things, but I haven't verified this.] Linux support is very buggy. It gets one simple thing wrong that hurts the game tremendously: It doesn't grab the mouse. This causes the mouselook controls to be awful, ""catching"" 10 pixels every 100 pixels, and then only sometimes. It's hard to explain. Next to impossible to turn while moving forward.Game design issues:The graphics could have been improved. It's a cheap trick to put a simple film grain over everything to cover up a lack of graphical design. It also made it too hard to see anything. This is especially annoying when looking for brown crosses in a black-and-gray environment in the pouring rain. I mean seriously.Sometimes the puzzle mechanisms weren't apparent. It's not hard, I need to know there's a puzzle before I set about solving it.			"

												Did a blind Live Stream of Montague's Mount for Sunday (twitch.tv/4KbShort) and was able to finish it in ~3 Hours. Like Dear Esther, but darker and with puzzles the game is straight forward and fun to play. There's some tension of fear in the game as there are apparitions and the island is dark with grey tones during storms and brigher colors when it's clear. The game does en abruptly and though your current objectives are completed the game gives the feeling of a second half not yet available. When the two halves come together this game will surely be a top playable game in the Dear Esther/Home/First person adventure genre.			"

												Don't be fooled by the starting statement of ""based on a true story"". The author's intention was to metaphorically represent his ""hardship"" as a non-irish learning his way into ireland and its language. The whole plot and twists have no meaning at all if not to leave to the player imagination that they actually have.The ""learning"" part is useless, since there is no voice pronouncing the irish bits, not even the secret music speaks in irish.The game itself felt unfinished, as if DLCs or sequels were already in mind. Luckly, there is none.Not to mention several clipping areas where the player is either throw in the sea or stuck in a hole, losing some progress.It has, however, a ""Myst"" feel, the way the puzzles demand more than using item A on item B to open a door and do it again. Some of the puzzles were a bit faulty in the explanation, but still manageable and entertaining.The end and the ""true story"" bit were the agents of this game mediocrity. Could have been so much better.			"

												Sadly I cannot recommend this game. Most of the reasons were already mentioned in other reviews, so I'll mention them very briefly. Let's start with the good points, though:+ AtmosphereWell, that's it. The game looks good, even though you need to cut down on your graphics settings, and I, for instance, had to have the sea turned off, so that I was walking on dry beaches and the barrels that were supposed to be floating in water were actually bobbing in midair.– Terribly artificial puzzles (I mean: really? Burning candles all around and the game has you search for several specific ones? Or the rigged sundial. What was that supposed to mean?) – Unrealistic 3D. OK, the guy is sick and injured, but so much that he can't climb over the gates and spend hours walking around the island? Come on! The only place this could only work is an 80's 2D adventure.– Incomplete story. It's not that it is short. It FEELS short because it does not explain itself. It just ends and leaves you non the wiser. If it ""clicked"" in the end, I imagine the reviews would have been much more positive. As it is, it only leaves you wondering if it really could be based on a true story (which it is not) and what it might be (which you won't find out).Sorry, this may still be worth playing for the sake of the atmosphere, if you have already bought it, but it is definitely not worth buying.

Some of the mechanics are clunky, the lighting and color made some things hard to make out at times and the worst part is how SLOOOOOW things are.  Walking is slower than in Dear Esther or at least just as slow.  Waiting for gates to open seems like AGES.  If you make it through all of that, just wait until you get to those animation sequences that are very slow and boring (which you cannot skip.)I used the walkthroughs on some parts just to get through the game and get my $2 worth.

												My main reaction to this game is ""what. the. efffffffffffffffffffffffffff.""The story was good, if a bit vague and plot-holish, and the Steam guides were my lifeline for the elaborate, why-the-frick-would-you-every-build-this puzzles. And yet, once I had adjusted the settings and got through the Prologue, the game was strangley compelling and playable. Sometimes I think it took itself too seriously--I didn't absoluetely NEED those long shots on Peter's photo--but I wanted to find out what happened to all the villagers, beat all that Irish puzzle ingenuity, and stick around for all those Irish words. I also appreciated the representation for disabled people and older protagonists. It wasn't particularily scary, more of a ""the horror! The horror!"" feel, but speculating on the remaining loose ends is really fun. I'm going to encrouage my other friends to play it just so I can talk about it with them.			"

												Montague's Mount is certainly a difficult game to review. It's a visually beautiful game that's for sure, the atmosphere is great and the dark tones and ambient music add a lot to it. The game has such a promising setting full of intrigue and mystery, but be aware that the game has a rather snail’s pace of movement and progression. The puzzles are ok, but become somehow repetitive after a while, you basically go from one section of the island to another, collect fuel for power generators, turn it on, solve easy puzzle, proceed to another section and repeat whole thing all over. Montague's Mount is a decent indie title created by one person, to which a lot of credit is to be given, but it is difficult to find this title trully memorable. I'd still recommed it to all to try, especiallty if on sale. 6/10			"

												To be fair, the type of game you enjoy will affect how much you get out of this game. For those who enjoy challenges, the puzzles are simple and can be solved in a relatively easy fashion, so you won't have a lot of fun here. For the visual junkies, the graphics are rather lovely, but I had to turn it way down in order to run the game without serious lag...so I couldn't enjoy that aspect. (The raindrop effects were really beautiful, though, and the mood of the plotline is set perfectly within the color palette this game offers). Finally, the voice acting was actually VERY well done, it was a nice break from the bleakness of the landscape.Favorite parts of the game: -Color palette/mood-Voice acting-Rain effects -Easy achievementsLeast favorite parts of the game:-Lags unless low quality-Constant crackling due to ""film grain effect"" (?) that won't turn off even if I uncheck the film grain option-You don't know if you get an achievement or not until you exit the game completely-The ending wasn't too unexpected and was a bit anticlimacticI came into this expecting this game to be relatively short and quick mystery game, which it was. Therefore, I can't say I was unsatisfied. This is a good deal (if you have a coupon) because the achievements are easy to complete and it also comes with trading cards. I wouldn't buy it at full price, however. Overall I'd give it a 3/5 stars.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but I'm afraid I can't recommend it.  What could have been a gripping, atmospheric, puzzle game instead felt tedious and frustrating.  The player is asked to suffer through invisble walls, obscure puzzles that aren't logically consistent and to have control taken away from them as a character repeatedly, whilst still believing in the world and being emerged and engaged.  It doesn't work.  We are asked to care about a family we have never met.  We are asked to believe in a badly animated child, with real life photos within the game drawing attention to the imperfections.  Above all this, the ending (I assume it was the ending - I didn't bother sitting through the montage of scenes of the island with heavy-handed sad piano music in the background to find out if there was any more) is disappointing and confusing.  Don't bother.			"

												  I bet this game would be a decent narrative if one could get past, and live with, its impeding faults. You start on a beach barely being able to walk. You are injured and must find a makeshift walking stick. I only knew to find one by squinting like ♥♥♥♥ to read a small note on a gate. I wanted to progress but quickly got infuriated by all the small things. I couldn't get past the gate cause the latch was shut. I try to open the latch, but I had to complete an objective before I could proceed. I couldn't find anything except for a small note that was almost impossible to read.  ""Find a makeshift walking stick."" I scaned the beach in this disorenting bobble from my injured character until I gave up. I also got an achievement for investigating 100 items. I frantically clicked 100 times on random things trying to progress in this game.    I can't recommend a game that is so hard to just make it past the first area due to its own design.			"

												Overall I really enjoyed this game, mostly because the atmosphere was so well done. The ""wet lens"" and vignette effects used do a fantastic job at making you feel small and under pressure, like the rain is really hounding you rather than just seeing it. Story is a little empty and the animations seem unintentionally slow but as an atmospheric experience I see it as step forward. Even though the ending didn’t have the kick I thought I could have, I’m still keen to know more! I would recommend this game for those on the lookout for innovation no matter how small.			"

												The primary reason to buy this game is its compelling story. Gameplay is short at 2-4 hours but that was enough for me. Poor framerate has been an issue for many people, including myself. However, I would expect that a more capable machine could enjoy the good graphics and decent atmosphere. In relation to the puzzles that need completing to progress in the game, I found they could certainly be improved since many of them just required you to keep a eye out for necessary objects. Finally and most importantly, if you can get it at a good price -I had 75% off coupon- you should find it worth the time and money.			"

It seems to be endless walking around the beach and shacks looking for every damned thing you need so you can move on. The graphics are very plain and the lighting terrible.

												I'm torn on this one.On one hand, it has an interesting story, with decent voice acting, and sticks true to Irish heritage, especially by using Gaelic words to describe items you see.On the other hand, it's very slow paced, with obscure puzzles and a color scheme that makes it difficult to see certain objects on the ground, ones that are needed to advance the story. The game's description says ""challenging puzzle solving"", but the only challenge lies in figuring out how the puzzles relate to the game at all. In a sense, it evokes Myst, where the puzzles are there, but they're so obscure you'll be scratching your head. It's also very short, and can be completed in under two hours.As of this review (June 14th, 2015), the game is currently 80% off. For its current price, it's worth the purchase. The atmosphere is foreboding, and you'll definitely want to see the conclusion.The devs say this is part one of a two part story; let's hope part two is more fleshed out in pretty much every aspect.SUMMARYAt the end, I do recommend the game, if you're a fan of exploration. Do not expect much in the way of a ""psychological thriller"", but its story is genuinely interesting.			"

												Experience on Linux so far:- The game doesn't run well in full HD for some reason. Although workarounds that may or may not work have been suggested, I feel that charging full price for a Linux port warrants a fully functional game. From release. Don't release unless it works properly. My workaround: run lower resolution.The game:Very nice looking game with good voice acting and an engaging story. It is a first person puzzle game with point-and-click interface. You are stranded on a island with amnesia, not very original, but once the story starts picking up the premise is soon forgotten (like amnesia, sort of) by the horror of the gruesome revelations you are treated to while exploring.Score:3/5			"

												I was lucky enough to have a 75% coupon for this and was excited to play this game, due to the mysterious atmosphere and puzzles the game seemed to offer and had high expectations, however.. the walking simulation is extremely slow, and animations are extremely slow and glitchy, allowing the player to walk through many objects.Personally, I didn't like that the game did 0 to assist the player but left you on your own, leaving me with no idea what to do,although it is in most cases self explanatory, a bit of assistance in terms of controls would be helpful. The subtitles in the game are extremely small and difficult to read, so there isn't much point in turning them on anyway.All in all, the game is OK. The diary pages are effective in intruiging you, gradually leaking the plot, yet the slow, frustrating and long cutscenes/ zooming in is ok a few times, but it happens throughout the game and left me wanting to be able to skip through them. This game has potential, it just needs a few tweaks and it will be more than an OK game, but for now, unless you absolutely love its  genre, I dont recommend the game.			"

I'm hopeful that lessons can be learnt here, that so much focus on backtracking will be annulled. I'm hopeful for a game I could better recommend because, for all its haunting anti-beauty, for all the prefect little details that have been absolutely nailed, Montague's Mount will make it certain to frustrate you.Full review - http://www.honestgamers.com/12132/pc/montagues-mount/review.html "

												This game begins with a drunkard waking up and searching for his car keys.  Being unable to find them he staggers around looking for the friendly neighborhood ghost child to request his help since he can only see things in grainy technicolor, not unlike if one took an old Merry Melodies cartoon and ran the disk over with a magnet several times.  Anyway, the protagonist, whom we shall call Sir George Blandington's horrible vision makes it incredibly difficult to read the tutorials.  Once you manage to do that, then you are forced to find objects to solve puzzles.  The problem with this is that Sir George is unable to see anything that he is not standing on top of.  The puzzles in this game are not hard, but rather tedious, as in one which requires a frame rate to solve - something this game lacks.  In short, unless you too, are very drunk, and are at the point where this is the least bad decision you can make after prank calling the NSA and telling them you are a terrorist, then by all means play it.  Otherwise, stick to something safe and entertaining, like emptying the Pacific Ocean with a sieve.			"

												first it has a spooky atmosphere. You feel helpless as if your character has lost his mind. You don't know anything. There are no markers or waypoints so the very first thing you'll encounter is being stuck on the beach with no clue what to do. The gate even says ""you still have things to do"". What things? you're not being helpful game.....I had to use walkthrough with almost every puzzle.....being stuck at areas where I couldn't solve the puzzle really pulled me out of the game.....I think the focus was more on the character loosing his mind. I think I would have enjoyed it MUCH more if there were NO puzzle elements in it.This could have been the next ""Dear Ester"" for me, but it wasn't. Instead it was a game inspired on Dear Ester with some ""interesting ideas"" (various puzzles) that didn't add a lot to the game. In fact it did the exact opposite.if this game was a one way journey, meaning without too much side roads, without the puzzles I would have liked it MUCH more			"

												The game is broke out of the box, then again - it's broke in the box.  Works for some, not for others, no feedback on the problem or if it'll ever be investigated/fixed.  When the game loads up, the opening sequence is promising, and then the controls go awry - turning around constantly to the left, as though sticky key or extra invisible controller.  This means the game is completely unplayable.  Don't risk it, supporting developments that aren't complete or have immature development cycles will only mean you're more likely to encounter more of the same another day.			"

Posted: September 3, 2014
												I wasn’t very impressed with this game.This game wasn't what it is advertised to be. That is for certain. In truth, it reminded me of Dear Esther more than anything. Its atmosphere was good but that was about it. Like Dear Esther, it felt more like a “here take a walk around our pretty island” than a decent game. My thoughts on the story are as follows:It claims to be a psychological thriller, but I was never on edge at any point during the game. And the “scary” parts were not at all. The story in general didn’t really lead me down a path to the ending’s conclusion. At no point did I think this man was completely nuts. Only two notes really pointed towards this fact and not much else. I guess what I’m trying to say is that this character’s “decline” was not explored very well or given enough time for it to sink in. We as the player didn’t really have the time or information to start making theories of our own as to what happened on the island and to the protagonist or what he had done. And on top of this, there was an illness on the island, so what? It didn’t seem to play into the story at all, other than making the protagonist the only one on the island. The story is left open ended and felt incomplete to me, especially since there was little build up for the conclusion.In all truthfulness I found the game to be rather boring on the story side of things.My thoughts on the technical side are as follows:After reading some of the other reviews, I noticed that several players had issues with frame rate. I’m pleased to say I had no issues at all, but I’ve got a good amount of RAM and a very good and up to date graphics card meant for gaming and working with 3D software.I found some of the subtle emersion qualities of this game quite fun, like rain splatters on your screen. However, the game was overall very gray and lacking in color which, while lending itself to the isolated atmosphere, made it difficult to see in darker parts of the game like the inside of sheds and buildings. I didn’t turn my gamma up to help this but I figure that would be the solution. The puzzles I found to be very easy for the most part, although I did get stuck on a couple, but that was because I didn’t find a clue or the puzzle was not explained very well. Other than that they were all pretty logical, which is an accomplishment in this genre since a lot of similar games lean on taxing and nonsensical puzzles to pad out the amount of time spent playing the game.There are a few complaints I would like to point out about some of the menus, cut scenes and puzzles. The cut scenes would often linger too long on pictures, or a new area. I actually found myself looking away from the computer while waiting on these scenes to end. I think I actually got onto YouTube on my laptop for a couple minutes while waiting during one. While these scenes may have seemed emotional to the developer, the player only needed to see the images for 30 seconds or less to get the point. Also, during the compass puzzle, the dial turning animation took FOREVER. I was once again checking my watch while waiting on these dials to turn. A faster animation would be much appreciated. This goes for the checkpoint menu as well. When I loaded up the game after I had put it down for a day, I found myself scrolling, and scrolling and scrolling to get to my last checkpoint (which was the 9th one) and the animation for this also took FOREVER. Speeding up the scrolling here would have been very helpful. Speeding up a lot of the game in general would have been a large improvement. Doing so would not have taken away from the atmosphere. It would have made for a more pleasurable experience. In the end, I wouldn’t recommend this game to a casual game player, but if you are a hard core point and click, puzzle game player I wouldn’t tell you to not give it a shot. Especially if you got it for $2.00 like I did.  "

												This game does have some good points, for instance it has a nice atmosphere, pretty decent voice acting and an interesting plot with some good ideas, but everything is let down by an overly-tedious prologue, unclear objectives, unreadable tutorials, a confusing inventory system, the inability to access any options during the game, and poor graphics. I reccommend only if you have the patience to wrangle with its confusing and poorly-designed layout, otherwise don't bother.			"

												Hoping to find a game dimilar to  ""Dear Escher"" I purchased this game today. Upon starting I was imersed in a very dark world walking around like a drunk on a 3 day bender. It seems I had an accident, and hurt myself somehow. After limping around for a bit I found a walking stick and started to explorer further. At this point i quit back out to the main menu and set the Gamma higher and turned off the film grain shader. The game was stillw ashed about and colourless but a least I could see somthing. I wandered around found an old generator got some fuel started it up went back the first shack....Problems 1) Dark way to dark. I am sure that developer thought it would be moody...2) Washed out colours and generaly uninteresting environment.3) Why the hell do I have to adjust the options for the screen environment from the main menu, why cant the options be available in the game itself?I might put some more time into this later. IF I do and it impoves I will let you all know.Evil "

The puzzles were good and difficulty was fair. My only complaints are that some scenes were a bit dark graphically and it is a bit short. Overall I found it to be bug free and enjoyable.			"

												It has to be said Montague's Mount is a game panned by both gamers and critics alike, Criticism are made of its 'drab' colour scheme, 'pondorous' pace and obscure puzzles. Indeed, many describe it as plain boring. Now, I'm not saying they're wrong, but I feel many missed the point of this game hugely.Before I go onto why I adored this game, I'll address the flaws.1: Yes, it's way too dark and finding things is a nightmare among those incredibly shadowy graphics. There is also a real lack of structure in the way the various objects are scattered around. Sometimes they're in a logical place, others it's just pot luck if you find them.2: Yes, it's slow. CoD this is not. The lack of any run feature is annoying, but given how the game starts out it becomes clear WHY you can't run.3: Yes, the slow pace can get a little boring, with the wandering back and forth to do this and that forcing you into long slow journeys.4: And yes, some of the puzzles are absolutely dreadful. The spinners puzzle was quite simply too much for a video game, requiring the gamer to understand morse code. It's something you don't need when you want to just play a game.5: And also the saves were a little glitchy. Sometimes a checkpoint would actually erase a previous section you'd just done, meaning you had bits of your pick ups but not all.However, the flaws are compeltely outweighed by the strengths, or maybe it's my kind of game. And here's why.Montague's Mount is intense. It is easily the most intense game I've ever played, and draws heavily on psychologically disturbing themes to make its mark. For me they work brilliantly - the island is MEANT to be drab and depressing as we are dealing here with some incredibly heavy themes. They get deeper and more powerful the further the game goes, and as far as video games go in general, there are such emotional and psychological barriers this game goes past that other games simply haven't gone near.The plot is also as well-crafted as it can be without spoon-feeding you all the answers. This is a story designed to make you think, to make you put pieces of a fragmented world together - to decide for yourself the greater meaning of it. The game gives you the tools to make you arrive at your own conclusions without those plot devices feeling half-baked.I admit some of the mechanics of the gameplay were messy, but the game wasn't about them. The puzzles and methods were just a way of putting together a story, and I admit also that they didn't blend as seamlessly with the story as they could have. Indeed, in many ways the game could have done better without the puzzle element as it doesn't seem to match the greater story overall.But if you can live with that, and want a dark, intense, psychological thriller with emotionally powerful overtones and disturbing themes, this is unique and hard-hitting.I can understand why many would hate this, but I felt totally engaged by it throughout and would recommend it on the terms I have done. If you want quality puzzles and amazing graphics, Portal 2 is your man. But if you want plot which cerebrally engages you, this is a fine way to spend your time.The current sale also helps hugely.

I do like the game, especially since I got it on discount, but I'd say unless you want to be raging for a day, don't try the game. They are on the right track, but they need to put more effort instead of placing stuff randomly all over the place so that it takes forever. also, it has massive lag whenever I play it, even when it is the only thing i have open.

There's an optional ""collect all the ___"" item challenge, as well as a ""find all the secrets"" challenge.Despite having an achievement for walking X distance that makes it sound like you'll have to do a lot of back tracking, you aren't likely to have to do much if you're just following the storyline. Despite a half hearted effort to collect all the items and secrets, it only took me about 5 hours to finish the entire game.Story-wise, it's pretentiously poetic, with a very predictable (and obnoxiously ableist) ending.

												Shame really. I’ve played almost two hours of this and know there’s a good (in a understanding about someone’s mental illness sort of way), introspective experience burried in this game. If you had assumed it’s a lot like Dear Esther you’d be right. But it’s hard to enjoy the story when annoying puzzles, busywork and odd gameplay mechanics make this a chore to play. I think this game would have reached a better potential by leaving out more of the gamey-elements, especially when it’s constantly breaking the fourth wall, pulling you out of the story so it can explain how to solve its convoluted puzzles.I think I got my value out of this when it was on sale for $2. But in the end it just ended up being a frustrating experience that I can’t really recommend, even after the patches.			"

This had a bit of potential, but by the time the painful cliche of echoes of childrens laughter that turns out to be ghosts(?) hallucinations(?), I had to tap out.  Whatever.

												Amnesia clone that is not as tense. Enjoy the scenic views of Ireland, should you be able to see through the weather. Walk with a limp until you find the right stick. Struggle to read the tips and controls from the posted pages because you can't zoom in or pick the pages up. Solve puzzles in the dark until you figure out what's what. Get scared by ghost children (of course). Learn Morse Code somehow. In all seriousness, it is an interesting game. Not undeserving of having Mixed reviews, but definitely deserves more Positive ones.EDIT: Said ""Amnesia clone"" to get it across that it's a creepy and atmospheric game; it is really nothing like Amnesia - no enemies to avoid, very few puzzles (though good puzzles when there are), no such system like Sanity.You can alter visual settings to make the visuals more crisp. Also: cough constantly. Open up a guide so as to read what the clues and whatnot say (not to find said clues). Ghost children seem to have been a one(or two)-off. The few Negative reviews I've read bash the game hard. I've been intrigued the entire time I've played it. They must have also thought ""Amnesia clone"" and were subsequently greatly disappointed. I went back on my saying so and really enjoy this Walking Simulator that actually has a story and things for you to interact with.			"

												Honestly, this isn't a bad game. I don't understand why it's so poorly reviewed. It offers some pretty decent puzzles, well constructed scenes and environments, good soundtrack and an overall rewarding experience. You should be warned, though, that this isn't a traditional first person game. It's not a shooter, it's not a AAA adventure, action packed game. This should be played as almost an interactive movie that prompts you to solve challenging puzzles to progress through the story.About the story, even though there's a substantial amount of written material that somehow explains a bit what is happening, in my opinion the plot itself is just accessory to the real experience offered by Montague's Mount: the constant feeling of isolation and desperation while you search for answers about who and where you are. It's so much more about the atmosphere that the game conveys than the story itself - which is really not so important, in this case.			"

												This game is only for a certain type of person. Those who brand games like Dear Esther 'walking simulators' won't enjoy MM. You can skip right over this one.This game and Dear Esther have alot in common. Both have you start on an Island without explanation. Their storys are told in a weaved thread, out of context. Verses read by an excellent voice actor are filled with saddness and confusion.While DE leave's it's story open to your own conclusion, MM has a set story that while enjoyable to listen to while exploring, dosen't really give you the closure it deserves. It kind of leaves itself open for a sequal which I didn't really like.It's true your character move's slowly. However a player like myself came to like that. I don't rush through area's anyway and the pacing of the player character was that which allowed me to explore comfortablly.I've also heard criticism for the film grain (which you can turn off) and the use of dark shadows. Again, this was something I enjoyed and thought the developers put to good use.I would conclude by saying, buy on offer if you're unsure but it sounds like something you'd enjoy. If these kind of experiences are something you don't like, stay well clear of this one.			"

												I WOULD NOT BUY THIS GAME AT $9.99. First the Downsides: It is very short and there is a lot of running back and forth, except it is walking. You cannot run, and that is very annoying. And to many would be consider it very slow. Also, it seems like they ended with a cliffhanger. Now the Upsides: I like the story and the voice acting is great. I like that everything is labeled in 2 different languages. I can tell a lot of love and detail was put into this by the developer, which I've been told it was made by ONE person.TL:DR: ONLY get it when it is on sale. The pacing is slow but the story is interesting.  "

												If you want something that really makes you think, give this game a try, don't let the head bobbing and slow speed turn you away. I'll be honest, this game made me rage quit a few times, the beginning drove me nuts, I found myself facepalming when I struggled to complete a puzzle I hadn't realize I had just completed(missed the checkpoint image) and I backtracked to the beginning of the island at least 10 times that I can recall. I think it could be put togethera little better as the dark environment makes it really hard to find the items to progress and not all the pieces of paper that have notes on them can be picked up and viewed full screen, but once you get to the end you feel really accomplished and the story truly pulls at your heart as you realize a little of what is happening and how isolated you feel.

												In Montague's Mount you play as a geriatric mime that washes up on the shore of some island. As such you walk as slow as your busted hip and brittle knees will allow, and very often stop to admire the odd invisible wall. You find letters, you find generators, and every so often you find a youtube video of someone stumbling upon the one thing you've been looking for for the past 20 minutes. You also get to admire slow, in-engine, establishing shots of the environment you literally just walked into and will have to walk through multiple times as you have to stop moving for the cursor to come back and tell you if you can pick that up or not.I had started and stopped a few years ago, and had nothing to do today and decided to blaze through it.
