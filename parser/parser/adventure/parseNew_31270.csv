												First off, let me say: I come from a Professor Layton and Ace Attorney background. I live and breathe puzzles, but that's not to say that I'll take whatever I can get. My feelings towards the core factor of the game, puzzles, in Puzzle Agent are a bit mixed, but lean way more towards the positive end than the negative.Let's start with the negative. First off, some puzzle instructions are a bit difficult to understand or are surprisingly vague. However, this only happened to me a few times, and was far from the majority. Secondly, there were some jigsaw puzzles that, if you've played the Professor Layton games, are like the ones where you have to fit items into an area without them overlapping. There are a few here too, but it's odd in pieces automatically click together when placed correctly, and they STAY together, which greatly lessens the challenge. Those puzzles could definitely benefit from a better system, especially one where the general shape of objects were outlined and could snap together even if they weren't placed correctly.Other than that, I found the puzzles enjoyable. A few were quite easy, yes, but others took me a few tries and for some, I had to pull out a good ol' fashioned piece of paper and pen to plot it out Layton-style. Frankly, I don't understand how some people claim to have spent so many hints trying to solve them; I ended up using only 5 or 6 throughout the entire thing. There are 35 puzzles in all - I'll get to that in a moment - with 3 hints per puzzle, so with well over 100 hints you can imagine that 5 is far from a lot. To each their own, I suppose. I've also seen people claim that the puzzles are placed erratically and interrupt the story, but honestly? I've felt that numerable times playing Professor Layton. That is the consequence of puzzle games. They WILL interrupt the story if you choose to do the non-plot-important puzzles, and even some of the necessary ones. That's just how it is. However, especially during the climax of the game, the puzzles begin to weave into the story a bit more cleanly than before, and in my experience, are appropriately some of the easier ones, so you can get through to the ending quicker without having to spend half an hour on one puzzle.I think the game's biggest downfall for me, personally, is LENGTH. It is simply too short. Like I said before, there are only 35 puzzles. The average Professor Layton has over 100. It only took me a few hours to get through the entire game, and it leaves you on a VERY unsatisfying cliffhanger ending. Granted, it does pick up again in the sequel, but it literally goes right from the climax to ending in the first, with practically no conclusion. It was surprising, to say the least. Once the credits popped up I said ""that's it?"" out loud. I was genuinely surprised.It's a bit cheap to me to separate these two games when it certainly feels like it should be only one, twice-as-long game, but I have no played the second as of yet, so I have no info on how the story of that unfolds or if it is completely related. At the very least, there should be a package including both games so it can be one long, consecutive playthrough without people having to wait until they get money (i.e., me) to finish a story that should have been wrapped up already.The art style, characters, storyline (it's one of the ""out there"" kind of stories, but it's strangely fun at the same time despite its absurdity), and audio are superb. Music matches the in-game events wonderfully, but don't distract during a puzzle, as it should. I enjoyed the protagonist and the supporting cast, and their voice acting was wonderful as well. I fully recommend this game to new players of puzzle games, or veterans of the Professor Layton series. It may be a bit clunkier than the latter in some respects, but it is definitely worth a good playthrough. You're bound to get some enjoyment out of it.EDIT: Oops, I believe there are actually about 37 puzzles in the game; I had missed two during my first playthrough. Also, I'm going to add that I am currently on my third playthrough of the game, and I still enjoy it. I'm going to add that the game is somewhat fast-paced, or at least the cutscenes are, so even though puzzles will be extraordinarily easy to solve, I'd recommend multiple plays because I've noticed several things that I didn't recognize the first time around, buuut perhaps that was because I was intentionally reading into things because I was analyzing Nelson Tether's character a bit. In any case, definitely worth another look at if you enjoy playing it.One final point I'd like to bring up is that of the somewhat ""rating"" system assigned to the puzzles. Depending on how many wrong answers you give (resulting in the anger of millions of taxpayers) and how many hints you use, you get assigned a rating of sorts. Perhaps unintentionally, but hilariously, there is some pressure on the player to answer correctly on the first go, so you can expect to unconsciously triple-check your answers before you submit. It's really not something to fret about - at least to me, it's more humorous than anything else.			"

												I really enjoyed this game although it was fairly short. The story was engaging and the air of mystery about it kept me wanting to solve the puzzles. The puzzles were fairly difficult at times (I was being kind of lazy though because I wanted to see more of the story). The difficulty level of the puzzles varied throughout the game. The end puzzles were no harder than the beginning ones. I will say that there were a few ""light"" jumpscares (if I can use the term ""light"" in regards to jumpscares) which while not particularly horrifying, were just enough to leave you with an eerie feeling. To be perfectly honest I bought it on sale and there is nothing I feel the need to complain about. Overall it was very enjoyable as a casual and lighthearted game.			"

												Interesting game. Some of the puzzles actually gave me a headache, and I had to sit down and scribble on a bunch of post-it notes. The story is actually really compelling, compelling enough for me to want to buy the second game.Sadly, this game is very short, since most puzzles were quite easy to solve (some are actually jigsaw puzzles, come on...). Also, I cannot say I recommend this game to anyone looking for a classic-style point-and-click adventure like Monkey Island, Edna & Harvey, and such. This really is more like a stripped down point-and-click game, where all focus is on separate puzzles. This means no items and inventory, and no multi-room puzzles (the most challenging and best puzzles, IMO).This game could be better if the developers would have made the puzzles harder. Perhaps even adding a couple of puzzles. But I suppose that for the itty bitty price tag, it was totally worth it.Long story short: Good game, great story, could be better though if it was longer and harder (that's what she said).			"

												Great visuals and decent writing, but for a game called Puzzle Agent it definitely does not handle puzzles well enough.  Some of them are based on overloaded incomprehensible instructions, incorrect assumptions or missing statements, some fail to recognize more than one distinct correct solution, others are too simplistic and tired to be challenging at all. Those few good ones left are drowned by the random overall difficulty curve and unwieldy interface. Probably worth it at 75% discount for both chapters if you really like the art and want to dump a few hours into something mildly entertaining and undemanding. Otherwise don't bother.			"

												If you're a fan of Professor Layton, stop reading and buy this game.  For everyone else, go ahead and pick this up if you like brain teasers.  Similarly, the story is very clever, and the cast of characters are all fun as hell.  By the end, you too will be jealous that you aren't a puzzle agent.  Unless of course that's literally what you do for a living.  In that case, well aren't you fancy, mister big fancy pants.			"

												Fantastic! A mix between, hm...Professor Layton and Fargo/Twin Peaks. It sounds ridiculous, but it totally works. The trailer is a perfect way to see what kind of atmosphere the game sets for you and the puzzles are fun throughout. It can be completed in only a couple of hours, but it's also only $5. Buy it!

												Puzzle Agent is an amusing puzzle game in the vein of the Professor Layton series on the Nintendo DS, where a narrative is played out interspersed with (seemingly random and often unrelated) visual puzzles which the player must solve. The puzzles are fairly easy (with one or two exceptions which are QUITE obtuse), and shouldn't cause most people much trouble. Furthermore, it's worth noting that the game is rather short, and the story ends rather abruptly (to be continued in the sequel). It's not a ""to be continued,"" mind you, but....well, you'll see.The story is....weird. It is to be experienced. It's kinda the point, and is rather surreal (in a literal sense). I found it amusing, but my sense of humor is nicely warped, so that's not too surprising. It might not be for everyone, but I'd recommend it.			"

												Not a bad pilot series from Telltale games. It definately has a Sam & Max feel to it concerning the music. Essentially it's an advanced puzzle game with point & click elements, it isn't as bad as it sounds or looks because the game offers hints and there are guides on Steam for it.  It's worth your time.Update 29/01/2017:Additionally after nearly 3 years since writing this commendation, the game really sticks to mind with its rich narrative and presentation of a small North US city in something resembling Alaska or North Dakota/Minesota. It's a rarely engages topography for media. Literature, motion pictures and games alike. Great, great art brought and inspired by Graham Annable. Search him on YouTube for more and for free!			"

												If Professor Layton was to take a trip to Twin Peaks by way of the Telltale Express, you'd probably end up with a game like Puzzle Agent. An adventure game whose puzzles stray away from the traditional ""put item A in slot Y"", opting instead for brain twisting riddles and logic puzzles that fit perfectly with the quirky world.Everyone seems to have a puzzle on their mind, and solving it for them is all too much fun. Though at times overly vague, they are for the most part interesting and well designed. The story takes a back seat for most of the game, and in traditional Telltale fashion, leaves you with a cliffhanger ending.All that aside though, Puzzle Agent is one of the better adventure games I've played in a long time. The art is simple and charming, as is the voice acting which I found very enjoyable. A welcome change from the Telltale's traditional offerings, I can’t believe it remained unknown to me for so long. I’m very eager to continue Nelson's story in the sequel, and can easily recommend it to any adventure game fan!			"

												Warning: some non-plot related spoilers ahead. Do not read if you want to be completely surprised by the game.Puzzle Agent is a fantastic idea on paper: a hybrid between Joel and Ethan Coen's Fargo and solving puzzles. It is Professor Layton game set in the snowy midwest with plenty of hot dish of ""you betcha"" remarks added for fun. At first glance, it certainly looks like it will deliver on its promise. While the humor is somewhat subdued (there are no character moments as genuinely funny as the ones found in Fargo) and the story takes its time getting interesting, the art style is appealing and the voice acting is fun. The music is also pitch-perfect, setting the mood to exactly the right type in each scene.But a game like this is ultimately going to succeed or fail based on its puzzles. And that's where Puzzle Agent drops the ball. The puzzle quality and difficulty is all over the place. Some puzzles are clever exercises, such as the fuse box puzzle where players must figure out the correct pattern for the missing fuse and another where players must find the missing gnome on a shelf using an earlier picture negative of the shelf. But others are so simplistic that they belong in a Highlights magazine, such as a riddle about how many socks must be drawn from a drawer to guarantee a match and a ""follow the curvy line in a crowd of lines"" puzzle). Also boring: several jigsaw-style puzzles where objects automatically snap when they come close to each other, making the challenge negligible. Several puzzles are reused, but luckily, those are usually the more solid (if traditional) puzzles with (somewhat) progressively harder variants.Making things worse is how some classic puzzles are shoehorned into odd themes (at one point, the lead character stumbles on a closed store, leading into a ""draw a line from spot to spot without hitting a barrier"" puzzle themed as football players practicing while working at a glass store - talk about a stretch). But some puzzles are just downright awful - the worst is probably convoluted puzzle involving fish eating other fish inside that personally took me spending two of my three allowed hints to even understand what the written instructions meant. A close runner-up is a puzzle about using a series of statements to determine who won an arm wrestling tournament - a puzzle that neglects to mention the format of the tournament in posing the question, making it solvable only for those who make that assumption (I'll save players some time: it's a single-elimination event, not a round-robin affair).Even at a low price, I can't really recommend Puzzle Agent. The story is good, but not good enough that it is worth slogging through the puzzles (even if they can be solved very quickly with the ample hints available). As this review should make obvious, it isn't that great for fans of puzzles - a cheap newsstand puzzle magazine has puzzles of better quality. Puzzle Agent is a great idea, but it simply fails to deliver in execution.EDIT: After playing Puzzle Agent 2 (which I purchased at the same time as the first), I would now advise adventure game fans to skip the first one and go straight to the ""just good enough to recommend"" sequel. Everyone else should probably skip the series entirely.			"

												It’s like Dean Koontz, Stephen King, Stanley Kubrick and Professor Layton sat down at a dinner table at Twin Peaks and said ""let's make a game!""This creepy little animated puzzle game is made by Tell Tale games ( https://telltale.com/ ) and seems to be in the transition period when they went from comedy story board games to overly adult themed games. The game's story is heavily inspired by the 'Grickle' Comic series which I had heard nothing about til playing this game. ( https://www.grickle.com/ ) You can imagine my further surprise when I discovered that the game and comic is loosely based on a real folk lore tale of the Icelandic huldufolk aka 'The Hidden People'.A recent survey in 2007 discovered that a dedicated bunch of people still really, really, really believe in the hidden people and in the past have either gone out of their way to protect the interests of the hidden people or believe that the bad misfortunes around certain events and places are a direct result of the hidden people such as the Álfhóll road incidents from 1930 - 1980, the Keflavik NATO base protest in 1982 and the fact that there are over 1600 pieces of literature today attesting to their existence.This VG follows the same routine of inquiry suggesting that such beliefs in hidden people are real and that certain towns such as Scoggins will go to extreme religious lengths to look after the interests of 'the hidden people'. The VG story and characters introduced in the game are seriously creepy in their own rights, it's even more creepier when you discover that there are towns and individuals in Iceland that are seriously this dedicated.Beautiful Animation, and great voice acting and sound that helps immerse you in a quirky folk lore. My only gripe is with some of the puzzles. Some seemed too vague in their explanation, some seemed to have multiple answers though the game would only accept one and some were too easy and didn't feel like a puzzle at all. If you ever get stuck, you can find discarded gum around the place and chew it and you will be given a hint. (Seriously Tell Tale...you are now suggesting to children to put discarded gum in their mouths???)The game never really answers anything in the end, but just serves as a demonstration as to the folklore and leaves it open ended for you to want to buy puzzle agent 2 and too start looking more in depth into grickle animations and comics for sale. The 'Hidden People' told me to give this a thumbs up or else!

												Puzzle Agent is an excellent puzzle game.The story follows a detective at the fictional ""department of puzzles"". It also makes a foray into nordic culture, which I very much enjoyed. There is something intensely creepy about gnomes. The serious nature of detective work, mixed in with comedy makes for a very enjoyable play-through. The gameplay involves either moving around the environment, point&click style, or solving puzzles Professor Layton style. If you've ever played one of those games on the Nintendo DS, you will find the play style very familiar. The environment is easy to move around, it has puzzles hidden in it, and the ui is very intuitive. As for the puzzles, there are 3 main types: Logic, Jigsaw and Grids. The logic and grid puzzles are very good and challenging, and provide a satisfying feeling when completed. The jigsaw puzzles, less so (the pieces just seem to auto-snap together far too easily for my taste).The art in this game is very expressive. I didn't think it possible to show such a range of emotions on the characters, but somehow they pulled it off, from deadpan stares, to sheer terror, to being entranced it all looks very high quality and really adds to immersion and the personality of the characters. The environment also looks very nice, with a very ""northern"" and cold feeling. As for the sound, the voice acting is all top-notch, as are the various music themes that play throughout.There was one puzzle which bugged out once, but my only major complaint with this game is that it is quite short. But it is definitely worth playing if you like point and click puzzle games.			"

												Immediately after playing The Walking Dead Season 1, I've stumbled upon Telltale's Puzzle Agent. Done in collaboration with Oscar nominated cartoonist Graham Annable, Puzzle Agent is great looking puzzle adventure game.  There are two aspects to Puzzle Agent. First is story and atmosphere. Dark, twisted humor and eerie characters will immediately remind you of Twin Peaks and other Lynch's works. Although the animation is crude (on purpose) and the whole style might belong in children's books, the atmosphere is horrific in all the right ways.   You are Agent Tethers of US Department of Puzzle Research. Tethers arrives to small, isolated town of Scoggins where nothing is what it seems and myths are colliding with reality. You will move around and experience the wild story by clicking on objects and talking with people. There are no multi branching dialogues and you may skip most of them, but that would be such a shame.  When it comes to puzzles, they're gradually getting more and more difficult, although never impossible to crack. Various types of puzzles are contained within Puzzle Agent: visual, mathematical and logical are all in there. Players need to complete 24 puzzles to complete the game, but at least 10 optional puzzles are available. Game also has a great hint system.  Puzzle Agent is truly a great indie game all lovers of wacky cartoon style, David Lynch, eerie atmosphere and puzzling will learn to love. ***Hey, you've liked this review? Hated it? It made you buy the game / abandon the idea of buying this game? Super awesome!

												Puzzle agent is a light adventure/puzzle game with a lot of charm and some imaginative puzzles, based upon the work by Graham Annable (which I was entirely unfamiliar with when I played the game)Graphics & SoundPuzzle agent has a very distinct art style, one that I guess is a bit of a love it or hate it kind of deal. It's very consistent though, everything looks like it belongs in the world, and nothing looks out of place. Personally, I found the game to be nice looking, in its own peculiar way.The sound design also works well with what the game tries to be. The voice actors do a good job at portraying the different characters, and while there are no Oscar winning performances here, it works well. The voice acting also helps lend the game a lot of personality, which makes it memorable for more than just its puzzles.Story & settingIn Puzzle Agent you play as agent Nelson Tethers, who works at the US department of Puzzle research. There are trouble in the small town of Scoggins and their eraser factory, which supplies erasers to the White House. Thus your job is of utmost importance to the safety of the country.Scoggins is a peculiar place. Everyone is obsessed with puzzles, and not only that, everyone is also a bit Norwegian. Your job is to find out what is going on, and why there are pointy red hats seen everywhere.To make matters worse, the entire city is out of chewing gums, something that agent Tethers need in order to focus on his puzzles. This ties in directly with the games hint system, if you spend some of the gum you have in you've picked up you get a hint for whatever puzzle you're working on.GameplayGameplay is mostly straight forward. You click on objects like in a point & click adventure game, gather talk to people, and quite often you're given a puzzle. These puzzles don't fit in as well with the world as something in say Syberia or The Longest Journey, but are their own self contained little entities. This does allow the game designers to constantly mix things up with new and interesting puzzles, but at the expense of some immersion. If you've ever played a Professor Layton game, you'll feel right at home here, the puzzles are handled in a similar way. And the vast majority of the puzzles are fun to solve. Puzzle Agent is not a particularly lengthy game. The game can easily be beaten in less than 3h if you're comfortable with solving logical puzzles.Final thoughtsPuzzle agent is an excellent little puzzle game with a really fun story, and some well thought out puzzles. At a base price of 5€, it's hard to not recommend this game, despite its short length. "

												Puzzle Agent is a Professor Layton puzzle solving game but with a story and atmosphere of that from Twin Peaks. You are sent off to a small town to solve a mystery of a factory shut down and you are soon thrown into solving various puzzles. There are a total of 37 puzzles which makes this game somewhat short. The puzzles range from being very easy to some which are difficult and have vague rules/directions - furthermore, some puzzles may have multiple solutions but the game only recognizes a single solution so you may have to look at guides/solutions in order to progress which is somewhat frustrating. Even though there are some frustrating puzzles, the story and gameplay are still very solid for puzzle solving fans.			"

												Puzzle Agent is a casual little 3-4 hour puzzle game that remains reasonably entertaining throughout, though it's a tepid sort of entertaining that I can't really recommend.The puzzles themselves aren't very well scaled in difficulty, with both easy and trickier ones mixed together throughout, though none of them could be called challenging. Certain puzzles reminded me of SAT logic questions back from my high school days, so I suppose it takes a certain kind of person to enjoy them. I recommend using a notepad, since many puzzles with a logical process of elimination or others with more visual elements are made easier this way. The puzzles are also graphically unappealing - the in-game story / adventure sections give way to single static screens for each puzzle, without any moving elements (uncontrolled by the player at least) and an overall board game-type look.The biggest problem though is that the puzzle design just isn't very good. A few puzzles have a set of ""rules"" that must be followed to successfully complete them. Unfortunately, certain rules are vague and open to different interpretations, and others are entirely ommitted (unintentionally) and must be discovered by submitting an incorrect answer. An example of this would be a sequence of platform movements to build a bridge - ommitted rules include ""all platforms move at the same time"", and ""platforms stop moving once they reach a destination"". I know that's a bit hard to visualize if you haven't played the game, but I felt like I should give an example.In at least two specific puzzles I can remember, I submitted absolutely correct answers that followed every rule provided by the game, but were not the solutions the game was looking for. Those are disappointing oversights for a game built around only a handful of puzzles (just over 30). And there are 4 or 5 puzzles that involve assembling objects like a jigsaw - these can all be easily and quickly cheated without any effort by dragging a piece around the screen until it snaps together with another, and repeating until the puzzle builds itself.Puzzle Agent's shortcomings in puzzle-solving are offset by the fact that there is no real penalty for wrong answers. They reduce your score, but perfect scores are not rewarded by anything at all, so no one save the most addictive completionists will care.What elevates the game from ""bad"" is the story, which I found charming and mysterious. I'm a sucker for the Mountain Town with a Secret kind of vibe. The voice acting isn't better than okay, and the game also struggles with its tone - it jumps from dark and mysterious to silly and unbelievable - but it's still sort of fun.(At one point you distract someone pointing a gun at you by throwing a crossword puzzle at him, and he just can't help himself from filling out a crossword puzzle, can he? It's looney, I guess.)Fair warning though: the game ends on a cliffhanger without revealing its mysteries, so it feels more like Episode 1 to the sequel's Episode 2 rather than a self-contained full story.Another warning: Puzzle Agent 2 does not work on any Mac OSX released since mid-2013. This is not a problem that is likely to be fixed, so if you're strictly a Mac user, DO NOT invest any time into this game, since you will be left without the story's conclusion. This is another example of the Steam Store's lack of quality control, and Mac's terrible habit of compatibility issues with each new OSX release. Who's to blame but everybody I suppose?So in short, there's nothing really *bad* about this game, but it's not great. Definitely not worth a full-price purchase, but if picked up on mega sale, it makes for a reasonable distraction when you have nothing to do.5/10			"

OverviewThis game is very similar to Detective Grimoire, where you play a detective tasked with solving a mystery. Here, you travel to some town to find out more about some strange events that have been going on in their eraser factory.Likes Art style & graphics Story & premiseDislikes Insufferably slow Intro took ages to play through - we see several seconds of a person's stunned expression, and other such unimportant, inane things. Is there really a need, for god's sake? Every single conversation is animated, and takes a long time to get through. You absolutely cannot fast forward anything. (See point #2 below.) No way to fast forward dialogue without missing out on reading it The way dialogues take place in this game is like this: as every character speaks, a text bubble appears, and the text only displays as they speak, and not at once. Now, if you try to make the dialogue go faster, clicking just causes the entire text bubble to disappear, instead of making the remaining undisplayed text appear! How stupid is that?! I wouldn't mind so much if characters said important things with every speech bubble, but most of the time the text is extraneous, so you are forced to sit through tons of worthless dialogue before you can finally glean the important stuff. Puzzles are way too simple E.g. Put fragments of a torn picture together. And said fragments are very big, not small or complicated in the least. E.g. Click on squares to rotate them until they all face the correct way, forming a complete picture. Puzzles are misleading E.g. One puzzle said you would find a ""hidden object"" once you rotated the squares correctly to form the correct picture. There was no such ""hidden object"". Some puzzle instructions are very poor E.g. In one puzzle, you must place logs to make your character go the correct way. You are supposed to ""pass 2 traffic lights"" along the way. Now, I had no idea the 2 traffic lights were ""passable"" (i.e. your character could go through them), as opposed to being an obstacle on the board. Also, when you say ""pass"", do you mean you need to pass them on the left? Or right? Or through them (which was the intention)? As a result of the complete ambiguity, this puzzle had to be attempted a 2nd time before I finally understood what the game wanted. Way too much hand-holding in the beginning At the start of the game, instead of asking you if you want a tutorial or stuff, the game just SPECIFICALLY TELLS YOU WHAT TO DO next. As in, ""talk to man"", ""enter hotel"", etc. This went on for quite a while, until I thought the entire game would be like this.  No free exploration + no real choice If you're looking for a true adventure game where you can freely roam and check out objects in your own time, this is not that game. It is extremely linear, and most of the time you are implicitly told what to do or where to go next. So it plays out more like an interactive novel, only with so-called puzzles to solve along the way.ConclusionBased on the interface, excessive hand-holding, extremely slow dialogue & game pace, way too easy puzzles, etc, I have to conclude that this game is more for kids. As an adult, I just did not have the patience to deal with the horrible mechanics of the text bubbles in particular. I cannot for the life of me understand why clicking to fast forward wouldn't just show you all the text immediately rather than make it completely disappear. This was extremely frustrating and irritating and I could not see myself sitting through this game waiting for countless text bubbles to disappear.			"

												I bought this game because it was five dollars and being new to Steam I had to add $5 to my Steam wallet before I could add friends and such.  I loved the Sam & Max series from Telltale, and have heard great things about Monkey Island and some of their other episodic game series. I bought Puzzle Agent because I thought it would be similar to that format: casual, short, point-and-click, humorous. There was also a puzzle or two in Sam & Max that actually made me think.This game is not like that. In Sam & Max, the puzzles are smoothly embedded directly into gameplay. You take this bowling ball, you click on this window, and you drop it on the guy below. You pick up the bowling ball of your own accord and can carry it wherever you want, for as long as you want, until you figure out what to do with it. If you can't figure it out, you can turn on various hint levels and the character dialogue will release a little more information to help you. But here, the general gameplay is too easy, showing you exactly where to click with no setting to turn this off. It feels like you are in a level that teaches you how to play, but it's like that all the time.Once you get into a puzzle, gameplay is halted until you complete it, which is annoying, and on top of that, it is oftentimes a stretch in relating the puzzle to the actual game in the first place (making them seem pointless). Frequently they don't give you enough information to complete the puzzle without a hint, or it isn't well-explained, and when they are, they are so easy, they could be for children or teens. Plus, the puzzle formats are the same thing over and over again - you endlessly rotate tiles, literally connect dots, and do logic problems like in math class at school. A lot of time is spent tallying your score from these dumb things, surprisingly. And then once you can get back to the story, which you want to finish,  you get to the end and nothing is explained at all. It's like you go out in the middle of the plot.			"

												Was Puzzle Agent really made by the same company that brought us the much acclaimed Walking Dead? So, just like Professor Layton, which inspired this game, we have an adventure game on our hands where the classical adventure game mechanisms (environmental puzzles, item combination, branching dialogues) have been replaced by logic puzzles, the vast majority of which have no actual tie to the story whatsoever.The main problem with Puzzle Agent is that the puzzles aren't very good. Of the 37 that I've solved, I'd say only 5 to 8 were both fresh and challenging. The rest were either much too easy or felt really, really old. Far too many puzzles involved rotating tiles on a grid to form a loopy picture, or jigsaws of some sort. These were really not fun at all (but easy so at least you could get rid of most of them fast). When there was difficulty involved, it's unfortunately often because of poorly written instructions.Another problem is the humour. It works occasionally. But 50% of the ""jokes"" involve characters staring at the main protagonist in silence when asked questions. Let me underline that: 50%!!! It's not exactly hilarious the first time, and it becomes completely, utterly stupid after a while.It's not all bad. Like I said, a small number of puzzles were inventive. I also kind of liked the story (bar the humour), although I wish one shouldn't have to play the second episode to see the conclusion. (I won't!). The art style is pleasant, but inconsistent, at least on PC. It's mostly ""blurred/irregular lines"", like in some comics, but then some stuff gets drawn with geometric precision, causing a very unaesthetic clash of styles. The animation is also very stiff, but I think that's on purpose. It may or may not bother you.If there is one thing that I feel is wholly praise-worthy, it's the audio department. I loved the music. It sounds like a subtler version of Danny Elfman and admirably suits the story. And while the dialogues won't leave a lasting impression because of average to poor writing, the voice actors themselves made a commendably good job despite the material at hand.Now, I'll be honest: I don't think puzzle adventure games have a bright future. It's a genre that is great in theory, but never works in practice. You'll always get more, better designed puzzles in a magazine (like GAMES Magazine) and the stories in those video games will always feel tacked on. I didn't like Puzzle Agent, but I didn't like Professor Layton either. However, if you absolutely must play a game from that narrow genre, well, Layton has better puzzles.			"

												What do you get when you combine the adventure and puzzle gameplay of Professor Layton with a surreal world heavily inspired by Twin Peaks? You get Puzzle Agent, a Telltale adventure game made in collaboration with Canadian Artist Graham Annable.You play as Nelson Tethers, FBI Agent in the department of Puzzle Research who is assigned to his first field mission of getting an eraser factory re-opened. Said factory is located in the small town of Scoggins, Minnesota where you very quickly figure out not everything is as it seems. As said before the plot takes heavy influences from David Lynch and Kubrick, creepy surreal happenings mixed with just the right amount of humor make it a very interesting plot, leaving you guessing as to just what is going on.If you have ever played a Professor Layton game then you will feel right at home here, if not then I shall explain. The main gameplay is divided into two parts, you have your normal point and click adventure gameplay where you talk to locals and learn more to uncover the mystery, and the puzzles where you will be tasked with solving something for someone or just to get past something and rather than the usual point and click style of searching around for items in an inventory it just pops up another screen and gives you a puzzle all laid out for you to solve ranging from putting together pieces of something, rotating blocks to line up pipes, finding differences between pictures, and more.Now just looking at all of this you would think I could recommend this game wholeheartedly. However, for every nice thing I have to say about it I have just as many problems.While the story has wonderful setup and great dialogue, including horror elements which I was not at all expecting, it sadly feels incomplete. I won’t spoil the story but very little actually gets explained which leaves you to question just what happened and in some way it feels as if Puzzle Agent 1 and 2 should have just been one full game, but considering this is a Telltale game that does not surprise me.There are only about thirty puzzles overall in this game which is not a lot and while some are clever and tricky, there will be a few times you are getting a puzzle wrong because the instructions themselves are incredibly vague as to what you need to do sometimes and on the flip side there will be some puzzles that you could complete while being half asleep with nearly no brain function, trust me on that. Because of how few puzzles there are in the game it is also short, my runtime is around three hours and that is with me messing around or leaving the game paused a bitOverall I wish Steam let me pick a middle ground between recommended and not, because it is a bit of a tossup either way. However in spite of the issues I had with the game and in light of its low price and thinking of it as the first ‘episode’ of the Puzzle Agent series I recommend it to adventure and puzzle game fans, and if you love the likes of Twin Peaks as I do you will greatly enjoy the little nods and references sprinkled throughout.

												Puzzle Agent is the equivalent to cheap Professor Layton. Maybe bargain Layton would be more apt. Solve riddles in this short two part mystery from Telltale Games. Don't expect to choose dialogue and influence the story like newer Telltale games.The hand-drawn world has a lot of character and I wish the story could continue, like originally intended.			"

												I am a fan of Puzzle Agent. It's a point-and-click adventure game, but the story weaves in 20 logic puzzles that match the theme of the game.There's not a lot of pointing and clicking -- mostly, the game moves along quickly from puzzle to puzzle.What's interesting, though, is that the storyline is surprisingly creepy. It's like a very good episode of The X-Files (or Fringe, for you youngsters out there). This is not good material for little kids. It gets a bit intense.The puzzles in Puzzle Agent aren't terribly difficult, which I think is a good thing for this game. Huge roadblocks would only get in the way. Instead, the adventure and the puzzles create a framework for a pretty good story, and it moves along at a good clip. If you want killer difficult puzzles, look elsewhere.			"

												Half of the puzzles are just barely hard enough to be stimulating, a tenth of them have incomplete descriptions that doom you to fail on the first try, and the rest are trivial. The story's kind of amusing, and intrudes on the puzzles in exciting ways sometimes. Overall, provides light entertainment for a couple of hours.			"

												I think that Puzzle Agent is a really nice puzzle game. A bit short, if you want, but enjoyable all the time. It also succeeds in linking a decent story with the various puzzles, not an easy task. As soon as you beat this, I suggest you play Puzzle Agent 2, which is also great (and longer, and slightly more complex).			"

												This is a great point and click puzzle game. Played with the family and we had a good time working out the puzzles. Most puzzles were not super hard but they threw some tricky ones in there. The story is good, I enjoyed it. It didn't weave a tale worthy of any prizes but it was funny. I am hoping we get some closure on the events of the game in Puzzle Agent 2.10/10 would br freaked out by Gnomes again.			"

												Puzzle Agent is a game that really caught me off gaurd when I played through it.It's a casual adventure game, which anyone who likes puzzles can enjoy. What I didn't expect is the great dark humor, the quirky characters, and a bizarre story as you try to uncover a mystery surrounding a small town.The game controls much like a classic point-and-click adventure game, but without the worry of an inventory or a ""verb box"" that more traditional adventure games have. No pixel hunting or cryptic item combinations here. All puzzles are presented in an obvious fashion, and can vary from a logic puzzle, to a jigsaw puzzle. It's a fairly short game, with simple mechanics and a unique vibe. I feel speaking more on the story would be saying too much. If you like little brain teasers, this comes highly recommended.			"

												Do you like puzzles? How about quirky, point-n-click adventure games? Or Professor Layton, perhaps? If your answer to any of these questions is 'yes', then Puzzle Agent is the game for you. This game is basically a minified version of the tried and true Professor Layton formula - walk around, talk to people, and solve puzzles to unravel a deeper mystery - only for PC. It's also a very short game (it will take around 3 hours to finish), but it also has a pretty low price tag. I approve of both of these things. Add to that a pretty cool animation style and a strange, unpredictable plot, and you've got a nice little treat for puzzle fans. The only slight issue I found was that the puzzles were really easy. I mean, REALLY easy. But even so, it was still fun to play. All in all, Puzzle Agent is a nice, refreshing, casual game, perfect for whiling away a lazy Sunday afternoon. Just be warned, once you finish it, you're going to want/need to pick up the sequel to find out what happens next!			"

												One of the greatest, if not THE best, puzzle games out there. You play as agent Tether on a mission to solve an issue with an eraser factory. Sounds easy enough, but you quickly figure out how wrong you are. The townspeople are quiet, unfriendly to strangers and complete crazy about puzzles.It is up to you to solve their puzzles in order to gain some tiny point of information from them and solve the mystery about the factory.While the puzzles aren't the hardest thing in the world they are still for the most part fun, but where this game truly shine is in the atmosphere and setting. You constantly have this feeling of something is watching you and nothing is ever explained fully, which makes you even more determined to solve this whole thing.Overall, a very solid puzzle game with a great atmosphere and cloud of mystery, even when you know what you are dealing with, well kinda.

												Puzzle Agent is a short but sweet point and click puzzle game.It takes place in the charming, yet weird and eerie Grickle universe.The game is pretty straightforward. Mixing up puzzles with story.You won't find any hard point and click puzzles in the overworld. Every puzzle is presented to you in a similair fashion as in the Proffessor Layton games.You get a problem, additional explenation if needed and the puzzle itself.You can use pieces of gum you find lying around for up to 3 hints per puzzle.The story itself is quite mysterious and at times even eerie.At certain times not much explanation is given to add to the mysterious feel the game has.Go look up some of Grickle's animated shorts on youtube to get a feel of his story telling and animations.If you like those then be sure to buy this game during a sale.If you're still curious go ahead and watch this review, it's a good one.

												Want to know what Telltale made before Walking Dead, Tales from the Borderlands, all the 'your choices matter' games? Puzzle Agent follows Nelson Tethers, an FBI agent in the Puzzle Research Division voiced by Doug Boyd, as he travels to the town of Scoggins, Minnesota to solve the mystery behind an eraser crisis at the White House.The game's art style is quite charming, with a minimalist but still quite diverse cast with distinct personalities and an amazing voice cast. Tethers' habit of recording his findings into a dictaphone becomes kind of a quirk that ingrains itself into his character and makes him that much more relatable, like someone recording a university lecture. The plot is interesting with a few twists and turns in it, while not quite as shocking as the Layton games which this is clearly based off of, is decent in its own way.The main negatives are that the game is quite short (I beat in in around 4 hours) and there is zero replay value whatsoever after you've beat the game aside from redoing the puzzles, which you can't improve your score on unless you start a new game anyway. Most of the puzzles are also fairly easy with only a few real brainscratchers in there.

												This game is about Nelson Tethers, an FBI agent part of the puzzle division (I don't know if the FBI has a puzzle division ,seems like a CIA sort of deal, but agencies like to compete so I can see it being a thing) who gets set out into the field to investigate the strange town of Scoggins in Minnesota because the eraser factory supplying the White House with erasers has shut down. The game takes on the point and click adventure genre that deviates from the mainstream by sacraficing most of the open-worldlyness of most games like this. This sounds bad, but this game's surreal storyline makes up for it. The gameplay consists of puzzles and basic point-and-click navigation which is mostly linear. I reccomend this game to anybody that likes puzzles, and to anybody who likes a bit of spooky Lovecraft-style storyline.The art in this game was done by Graham Annable who creates a series of animations and novels set in the grickle universe, where this game takes place, he has a website: http://www.grickle.com/ "

												The best game by Telltale I have ever played. However unlike other Telltale games, Puzzle Agent has better narrative and game mechanic. While playing, you will be spending your time either engaged in a trilling/spooky tale. (With even a jump scare or two if you are in the dark with headphones like I was.) Or you are solving challenging puzzles, which while some can be quite hard, don't suffer from crazy adventure game logic.If you like Twin Peaks and/or puzzle games. This game is a must play.			"

												A cute collection of puzzles wrapped around a nice story. Graphics and animations are a bit off-putting at 1080p. It was probably intended to be displayed at a much lower resolution. Most of the puzzles are fairly straightforward (I'm a bit over halfway through), but a couple or three took two tries, mainly because some of the puzzle instructions were less than clear, but I haven't had to resort to hints yet. At a cost of a couple of bucks (sale), it was well worth the price and ought to be a nice addition to the libraries of people who enjoy puzzle-solving. Well done, Telltale Games.(EDIT 10/9) Two additional items: total play time was about 3 hours and puzzles can be replayed (free play mode) after the final credits finish rolling. Also, some of the ""move pieces around"" kind of puzzles have issues with the mouse being unable to grab the piece that you're trying to grab, so you'll need to spend some time clearing away all of the stuff you don't want in order to get to the stuff you do want. It's a tad annoying, but not completely game-breaking. Since this is a 5-year-old game, I suspect that a fix from Telltale will not be forthcoming.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. The weird plot makes you want to keep playing, and the puzzles are varied. It's not the same thing over and over. It's not like a random point and click where nothing makes sense, nor is it like the ""puzzle"" games where all you do is hidden object screens with one or two puzzles throw in. It's truely unique in plot, style, setting, the amount of variety and really kinda everything. It's easy to jump into for a few minutes or for a while, and the puzzle grading system is very fair. Using one hint doesn't insta-fail you, and using 20 hints but still gatting right won't get you the top score. This is one of those games you really just have to play in order to understand it. I bought the second one right after playing the first.			"

												Although this game may not be a tour de force that you'll play for 50 hours, it is a charming (if simple) game with a lot of character. It manages to take (fairly boring and standard) puzzles, and place them in the context of such a bizarre, unique story that you want to keep playing. The game is a riff on the standard cliche where you are an FBI agent investigating a bizarre crime in a town with a seedy underbelly (e.g. Twin Peaks, or any number of ""detective"" style games). You work for the FBI's puzzle department though, and the crime you are investigating could threaten the president's supply of pencil erasers. The story that unfolds is, well, just odd.Pros:+ Game is light with a good (if odd) sense of humor+ Story is interesting and quirky enough to merit a play-through+ Art style is interesting and fits the game's vibeCons:- The puzzles themselves are not particularly good.- The UI in the puzzles is sometimes clumsy- The story is not very well-resolved in the end			"

												Buy it but buy it on sale. The whole experience is pretty short and bare bones, but it has some genuine charm and more than a few more original puzzles (uncommon puzzle types) throughout which make the game more than worth to try out. About half the puzzles however are pretty standard visual puzzles either demanding trial-and-error reshuffelling which solve themselves or only demand the basic ability to trace out sequences visually. These are also enjoyable but it reduces several segments to time-sinks which aren't providing much exictement.			"

												Puzzle Agent was a very nice surprise for me, because I didn't know anything about Puzzle Agent when I started playing it. So I went in blind and was very much entertained by the charakters the puzzles and especialy by the goofy story. The game has a very distinct style, how the characters look, speak and overall it has a very strange but funny tone to it. So I was very much happy with this game and also the second one Puzzle Agent 2. I recommend them both, if possible both of them together because they tell one story.			"

												This game is essentially a lo-fi Professor Layton game. While I ultimately found this to be a pleasant experience with a good amount of humor, I did not enjoy the uneven scaling of puzzle difficulty. In puzzles based around putting things together, jigsaw-style, the hitboxes for clicking on items are often strange and make it difficult to move things into place. This style of puzzle also relies on an uneven fit. Some puzzles do a poor job of explaining what is an obstacle that will block you and what is simply there for decoration. This game can be fun if you are willing to forgive its flaws, and the characterization and story do have a good amount of heart, but the core gameplay mechanic of the puzzles is the game's weakest link. Additionally, there are just under 40 puzzles in this game, with many of those being variations on a few different puzzle mechanics. If you are looking for puzzles, you will probably find more value elsewhere. If you are a fan of the Grickle comics, you may find yourself more able to enjoy this for what it is.			"

Product received for free
												Before buying Puzzle Agent on Steam, please consider buying Puzzle Agent on GOG[www.gog.com]. GOG.com is home to DRM-free games and supports older games far better than Steam does.Game: Puzzle AgentDeveloper and publisher: Telltale GamesReleased: 30 June, 2010Genre: Point-and-Click Mystery with ComedySetting: Winter, 2010, Scoggins, Minnesota, U.S.A., EarthSpoiler-free plot summary: You play as Agent Nelson Tethers, the only member of the Puzzle Research Division of the FBI. In his first ever field assignment, he is tasked with reopening the factory that supplies the White House with erasers.Full review: Puzzle Agent is a typical point-and-click adventure game. Even though the game is shorter than average, what it lacks in quality, makes up in quality.First off, Puzzle Agent is set in the Grickle universe, made by Graham Annable. Grickle is based in a very surreal setting of the supernatural and downright bizarre, so those already familiar with his works will find themes in this game familiar.The puzzles in Puzzle Agent can be a mixed bag of easy and difficult, though are pretty consistent with the easier puzzles being found near the beginning of the game and the more difficult ones being found near the end of the game. Puzzle Agent also comes with an interesting help system; Nelson finds it easier to solve puzzles when chewing gum, but can only chew on three pieces of gum per puzzle, one hint given per piece of gum chewed. The hints given are usually in the form of clue > how to work out the solution > here's the answer. Thanks to this helpful hint system, I didn't have to look online for any guides when I was completely stuck.I can't talk about the plot of Puzzle Agent without spoiling anything as everything kicks off right from the getgo, but if you are interested in finding out what happens, you can watch Ross Scott's Game Dungeon episode here.Do I recommend buying Puzzle Agent? Yes, especially if you're in the mood for a small, charming puzzle game. For NZD$5.99, I'd wait for a sale for when this game is $2 - $3 before buying it.			"

Scoggins, a village with inhabitants obsessed by puzzles, they will give you various puzzles and you will help them clear their minds for them to help you in return.The game is kinda dark with some jumpscares, some conversations are funny, the story is immersive but short (2 hours a full gameplay), it's a great start.

The puzzles are mostly arbitrary (i.e., they don't further the plot, but they do allow the plot to progress) and a bit easy at times, but it's a fun and relaxing game to play to keep the mind sharp. The plot contains enough intrigue and humour to motivate you to finish and play the next in the series. Voice acting was very enjoyable, and I quite enjoyed the art design - good cartooning here.

												This game is fun, and I think that's the only thing that matters right? It's not as intricate as other TellTale games, yes, but the puzzles are decent (though the difficulty is sometimes odd, like sometimes it's really hard, other times it's something you could solve just by looking at it) and there is a mixture of mathematical-logical puzzles and puzzles that require intuitive insight.It could kill around four or so hours in one sitting if you take it slow and enjoy the art, story, atmosphere, and optional puzzles. It has a very twin peaks esque atmosphere with a very unique art style. The ending is very much a cliffhanger so it'll leave you wanting to buy the sequel if you've enjoyed this.I've played through it twice to see if there is a secret ending or new collectibles or hidden puzzles or things like that, but there were none. So it really doesn't have much of a replay value. Still, a good time-killer for the appropriately cheap price.			"

												Puzzle Agent is a game with puzzles. Duh. It's not a classic point n click adventure game though. While those games had their puzzles integrated into the world, in Puzzle Agent you go through a story, while talking to people and often stopping to solve isolated puzzles.The puzzles themselves are usually solvable without having to resort to adventure game ""logic"". The instructions could be clearer sometimes, but other than that they suit the game nicely, allowing for a relaxed gameplay of going through a story while solving entertaining puzzles. As for the story, it's mostly on the funny side of things, doing a good job of accompanying the gameplay.Overall, if you're looking for a somewhat short (2-3 hours) relaxing experience, the game is quite good. If you're looking for really hard puzzles in a serious context, better look somewhere else.			"

												At first, I found this game fun and perky, one of the very first games I bought on Steam. I enjoyed the first few puzzles, and walking around, talking to people. But as soon as I arrived in Scoggins, I instantly hated this game.The snowmobile puzzle and many others don't even show up. I had to waste all my hints and time trying to find out where the logs even were. Some puzzles were unreasonably bad, and flat out stupid. I am still unable to get past the time puzzle at the eraser company plant because nothing is showing up. I can't see anything on the clock, even though I know when it happened. A complete waste of time and money.Another thing, you can't save or back out of the game until you're at the hotel, which is past the invisible snowmobile puzzle. I couldn't even shut down my computer, it was frozen on the Puzzle Agent screen. I had to figure out the invisible snowmoblie puzzle, which took about 20 minutes, just so I could back out of the freaking game.Usually I love Telltale games, which is why I bought this one. But I was so disappointed. Don't buy it, it's a waste of $4.99.			"

The instructions for the puzzles were sometimes worded so vaguely that even after getting the correct answer, I wasn't too sure why I got it. Would read the ""Why?"" post it and still not understand.Other than that, the ending was abrupt.

The gnomes are genuinely terrifying (to me anyway, I was scared of gnomes beofrehand anyways) the big problem comes in the second game (no spoilers). The truth is, the ending is not conclusive, the mystery isn't really solved, all the clues we found and all the mystery leads to a very inconclusive ending. But that is in the second game, the first game is good in it's own right, just don't expect a satisfying conclusion.			"

												It's a blatant Professor Layton clone, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's pretty funny and feels like a mashup of Fargo and Twin Peaks. It does suffer somewhat in the puzzles thou, most of them are variants of the same mechanics and they are not that challenging. But it is worth playing it at least once. The sequel is pretty good too, basically more of the same.			"

												I fully enjoyed this game. The puzzles were legitimately challenging, and the unsettling mystery element is fantastic. However, I felt that the game was a bit short- but for the price, it's to be expected. It has quite a bit of replay value, as I feel as if most people may miss a few things the first playthrough. The ending leaves a bit to be desired, but that's what sequels are for! My main issue is that a lot of the puzzles' instructions weren't very clear, although this seems to be common judging from other reviews. All in all, it is a great game despite these minor flaws, and I wholeheartedly recommend it!			"

												Something about PA really stuck with me.  Endless charm awaits you--or at least 4 hours of charm until you open it for a replay a year down the road--esp. if you count yourself among the many fans of Fargo and Twin Peaks.  Even if it's just a string of fun, if easy, puzzles on a plot that's never resolved or explained and in some points moves into a territory slightly creepy (or is that all a buncha pluses?), it's worth looking into.Mixed feelings about the too-familiar setup and lukewarm reception for the sequel aside, I'm antsy-in-the-pantsy excited to play it.

												Puzzle Agent's story is a hommage to Twin Peaks. There's a little town with strange inhabitants, haunted woods and supernatural things happening and FBI man Nelson Tethers has to solve an accident at the local eraser factory.The story continues in Puzzle Agent 2, so better get both games.The gameplay consists of simple puzzles. Some are immediately solvable, some need a bit of thinking and some can be solved by trial-and-erroring. The puzzle variety is widespread, so it doesn't get boring.The story is told in ingame sequences and via dialogues that you can click through. No challenge or different paths here. Just select every dialogue option and you're good.The main aspect of the game is the story, the art style and the atmosphere. If you don't like G. Annable's videos, this won't be your cup of tea.Graham's YT channel => https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqz4lWE_7FjyIzkO_9KM6KA "

												Well, this is rather a recommendation NOT to buy or play this game. Linear, most of the time puzzles are quite boring and really get repetitive because there are about 4/5 ""styles"" of puzzles in the game, and they repeat over and over. The most awful are those food/object puzzles, which are made of shapes you need to move in the right place to find the final placement for the whole lot, but the puzzle pieces act as magnets so it's quite lame and not fun at all. The plot isn't really catching, you can see there's an idea behind and some humor which still serves to nothing cause both the characters and the whole plot are pretty much undeveloped, and you get to know next to nothing about Scoggings. You can see several locations on the map you will never have a chance to drive to (well unless you're given a chance in PA2 but that would still make PA a really brief experience). The adventure pace is kind of dumbed down by the puzzles, you can't really enjoy playing through the game. At some point you feel like playing a collection of puzzles which was fitted into another game which it barely belongs to. Pro's for this game: the soundtrack and the comics style.			"

												Would be a 10/10 game except for the puzzle directions... which in my opinion bring it down to a 7/10. So far I'd guess I'm about halfway through and there was only one puzzle I legitimately could not figure out how to solve. All the others I didn't follow the directions correctly, because they're just so bad sometimes. Also in puzzles where you rearrange tiles and such, in Professor Layton it would automatically submit it and tell you you're right, but in this game you still have to submit it. It just adds to the confusion of whether or not you did it right.I thought the writing was funny, art style appealing, and puzzles fun when I could actually try one without wondering what the heck it wants me to do.

Puzzle Agent is charming, but also weird and dark puzzle adventure game. Overall very recommendable.Graphics: The artstyle is very delightful and unique in its own way. It's like a pencil drawing come to life. At larger resolutions it does take some getting used to. Additionally, the animations consist of very little frames, making movements very abrupt.Sound, Music & Voice: The soundquality and music were at an acceptable, but not very impressive level. The main character's narration was well done and fits his character. However, I felt that besides him the other voice actors tried to paint a too stereotypical picture and subsequently found the narration besides the protagonist subpar.Gameplay & Story: There are around 37 puzzles, which consist of many different mini-games. There is rarely a repeating puzzle design, which prevents the many puzzles from becoming tedious, but also makes it difficult to improve over the course of the game.The puzzles usually advance the story a bit, before you are tasked again with the next puzzle.Definitely the most enjoyable was the weird setting of the game, where the protagonist belongs to the FBI Department of Puzzle Research and is tasked to investigate an accident at an eraser factory in a village with people who are obsessed with puzzles (and little gnomes).It takes about 3 - 4 hours to finish this game. Beware of unexpected, dark story twists!Funfactor: I found the game to be more enjoyable than expected, mainly due to the charming and amusing setting. The puzzles were mostly on the easy side, although due to the many different types of puzzles, not all were intuitive and well-explained. Some might cause you a bit of frustration. Exceedingly and unnecessary long were the resolutions of each puzzle, taking 20 (!) unskippable seconds. Verdict: Wait for a sale. Puzzle Agent is charming and often enjoyable story puzzler, but inconsistent puzzle design and long waiting times prevent it from being an outstanding one.			"

												I absolutely loved this game. Although it was pretty short, it was well worth the price of the game. I bought it for half off during the Summer Sale so I got even more out of it but after playing it I know I could see myself paying full price. The humor in the game is excellent and made me laugh more than a few times, the puzzles were very entertaining and many of them towards the end were complex (but not too complex to not enjoy them), the mystery of the story grew and grew as I went on and it ended really captivating me. The whole thing develops much more than what originally meets the eye, and with help of complex characters, the game kept me going and I ended up staying up two hours longer than planned just to finish it. The one complaint I have about the game is that the game ending was lackluster and left on a bit of a cliffhanger. It felt more like a first chapter than an entire game, which I can't be too surprised by because it was made by TellTale, a company, with titles like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us that come with chapters or installments. Luckily, there is a Puzzle Agent 2, which I will be purchasing and playing very soon. Overall, the game was amazing, and I would truly recommend it to anybody.			"

												A surprisingly good little game.One of the better casual games I have tried. A great little game for short breaks.What really excels here is story, atmosphere and music. The puzzles are not that hard, nor really replayable, and not what sells this game. They are just a simple distractions from the main story, even though cute and fitting well with the style of the game. They are never hard work or annoying, just small amusements.Even though animations are very simple, and not  captured in the highest resolution, they still convey the atmosphere and story really well. There is lots of weird humor and bizarre ""horror"", and the music is just perfect. Voice acting is really great as well and the rest of the game feels very polished.The game is quite short, but also quite cheap. The story does leave a lot of loose ends, but the end still feels quite satiesfying. I guess the story continues in puzzle Agent 2, but I have yet to try that.Well reckommended.

												A good alternative of Layton for pc. It plays exacly like the Layton series, you do not wonder from room to room in order to find a key but solving puzzles to do almost everything. You want some information? First solve a puzzle that person you want to talk is working on. You want to look through window? Solve another one.While it is fun game with a fun story like every TT game it is episodic. Well, almost, there is only two episodes and after finishing the first one it does not feel like you complete a game because of the story and the game lasts for 5 hours max. Nevertheless I can recommend Puzzle Agent for people looking for not very hard puzzles and fun story.PS: Sorry for my Engrish :(			"

												Telltale Games has drastically risen in popularity over the last few years thanks to their incredible work on games such as The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us and Game of Thrones. I haven't the faintest clue of their past work except for this little gem, Puzzle Agent. If the name didn't give it away already, this title focuses on solving puzzles to drive the story. You're an FBI agent in a little town in Minnesota trying to uncover the mystery of a recent accident at the local eraser factory. The plot is odd but amusing. I found myself smirking in amusement and sheer confusion as to what was happening at some points. I feel that, for me, this was the driving force of Puzzle Agent. The peculiarity of the plot continually peaked my curiosity as I solved puzzles. I wanted to know more about the bizarre going ons of this small Minnesota town. The puzzles themselves are rather straightforward, save for a couple that had me stumped. Each puzzle is graded as it's solved--taking how many attempts and hints it took for you to solve it. I found the majority of the brain teasers to be enjoyable and at a pretty comfortable level. The few I had difficulty with I can blame on the presentation of the puzzles. You're given rules to each puzzle before you try your hand at it, and sometimes the developers did poorly in explaining how it was supposed to work. This happens especially near the end of the game when you face your greatest challenges. Overall, I didn't find it overly frustrating. That's not to say that no puzzles got the better of me because of their clever designs, because there were a few that did. Those were my favorite because it made me smile when I realized what I had missed. The game ends on a cliffhanger and I find myself debating if I want the second instalment of the series. I can tell you now that I will someday. It's only a matter of time before my curiousity of what the hell was going on in that town gets the better of me. This game is for puzzle lovers only. There's no other gameplay, hardly any exploration and the graphics are the equivalent of a stop-motion film. If you enjoy an intellectual challenge then I can certainly recommend this one to you--but only when it's on sale.			"

However, when he gets there, he finds more than just damaged machinery keeping the factory from opening....I recommend this game to anyone who likes quirky, enigmatic and small Minnesota towns with Nordic heritage. Or somebody who likes puzzles.			"

												A game filled with puzzles that are fully plausible, but logically intensive, that progress you through the story wonderfully. Doesn't seem to be too interesting, but as you continue you start to piece things together and get more in depth into the story. You will be driven to keep playing even though the small amounts of horror keep you frightened to continue. The ending will leave you stupefied as you solve the last final puzzle of the game. Giving you the feeling of accomplishment and amazement, but leaving you craving for more. A game like no other that is sure to please. 10/10.			"

												Great game, nice storytelling with humor and suspense hand-in-hand. The puzzles are great, from simple to complex, none impossible, and has a nice story-driven pacing.Cons are that is a very short game and can be played only ONCE, since you'll know the solutions of every puzzle at the end of the first run.Still, totally worth the money and the time, pick it up next time on sale, along with Puzzle Agent 2.

Puzzle Agent is charming, but also weird and dark puzzle adventure game. Overall very recommendable.Graphics: The artstyle is very delightful and unique in its own way. It's like a pencil drawing come to life. At larger resolutions it does take some getting used to. Additionally, the animations consist of very little frames, making movements very abrupt.Sound, Music & Voice: The soundquality and music were at an acceptable, but not very impressive level. The main character's narration was well done and fits his character. However, I felt that besides him the other voice actors tried to paint a too stereotypical picture and subsequently found the narration besides the protagonist subpar.Gameplay & Story: There are around 37 puzzles, which consist of many different mini-games. There is rarely a repeating puzzle design, which prevents the many puzzles from becoming tedious, but also makes it difficult to improve over the course of the game.The puzzles usually advance the story a bit, before you are tasked again with the next puzzle.Definitely the most enjoyable was the weird setting of the game, where the protagonist belongs to the FBI Department of Puzzle Research and is tasked to investigate an accident at an eraser factory in a village with people who are obsessed with puzzles (and little gnomes).It takes about 3 - 4 hours to finish this game. Beware of unexpected, dark story twists!Funfactor: I found the game to be more enjoyable than expected, mainly due to the charming and amusing setting. The puzzles were mostly on the easy side, although due to the many different types of puzzles, not all were intuitive and well-explained. Some might cause you a bit of frustration. Exceedingly and unnecessary long were the resolutions of each puzzle, taking 20 (!) unskippable seconds. Verdict: Wait for a sale. Puzzle Agent is charming and often enjoyable story puzzler, but inconsistent puzzle design and long waiting times prevent it from being an outstanding one.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I really liked the game. The gnomes were super creepy and the townfolk seemed interesting. But the main meat, puzzles, left me cold. Some jigsaw puzzles were too easy because the pieces seemed to snap in place too easily. At least one puzzle looked like it had multiple solutions, you just had to figure out what the game wants from you. In the end, the game is short and unsatisfying. I haven't played the second game yet, but my suggestion is to save your money. Skip straight to Puzzle Agent 2. Trust me.			"

												This is my favorite Telltale game if we don't count The Walking Dead. It's funny, not too long (and not too short), puzzles are enjoyable, story is great (and the writing even better), audio is awesome and, most important: it's fast paced. What I mean is that most of Telltale games will have you watching the character move/talk for 30 seconds, then you make ONE, just one click and you'll be watching for 30 seconds more. That doesn't happen here, hence, my favorite.Two important bad points are that the puzzles are not that varied (you have like 5 ""puzzle types"", like rotating squares or connecting things with wires, and then you have 10 puzzles each type) and that some puzzles are just bad made/bad described so they're pretty much unsolvable without using a ""hint"" (and I found this important because it'll be written down on your history that you used a ""hint"" on that puzzle).I highly recommend this as well as its sequel (which follows on the same story, concluding it and is just like this one plus some new ""puzzles types"").

												Nelson Tethers, Puzzle Agent is a ... well Puzzle Game. You have to solve different puzzles with varying difficulties and each solution brings you closer in solving a strange case of a weird crime.Red Herrings galore, so to say, Agent Tethers is of course also a strange little character, likeable because he himself is the weirdest little white collar that you might meet in games for some time. The game is short, I played it through with pauses in about 2 hours of pure playtime. The puzzles and riddles aren't so hard that you can't solve them - some of them were already used in other games, by the way. The game is captivating nonetheless. Mostly because the adventure style it was bound in. The story is a funny naration and you'll be getting more paranoid by the minute while playing the game, oh and erasers aren't the only thing that you should mind... since the shortage is also affecting you, you'll have to collect used chewing gum... Have luck finding loads of those.The interviewing section of this game also is quite funny. The solution is quick and easy. For a short term game of fun it's easily recomended. I liked it, therefore I will recomend it.			"

												While I love the aesthetic and mood of Graham Annable's works, this puzzle game falls flat. It's slim on content and features many repeated, unchallenging puzzle mechanics.  A number of them are re-arranging puzzles that literally boil down to mindless clicking until the game glues them in place telling you you're right. I don't feel cheated for the slim cost, especially on sale, but I couldn't recommend it to anyone other than a fan of Grickle who wants more of the artist's style.			"

												People seem to generally overlook this game when it comes to Telltale. It's a really funny, charming game. It's got a Fargo/Twin Peaks thing going on with a cute chalky visual style and animation with a lot of fun, challenging puzzles, sort of like Professor Layton. It's also quite creepy and very atmospheric at times, despite its cute and comedic style. You play a puzzle division FBI agent sent to investigate an eraser factory that has stopped production in the strange town of Scoggins, where everyone has some insane addiction to puzzles. I found it to be really engaging and the pacing and challenge was just right. The puzzles are very fair, and you can collect usable hints in the form of chewed up gum.Only downsides are that it is a little on the short side and it ends strangely suddenly, perhaps anti-climactically. It feels like there was still more story to tell. Perhaps this is a cliffhanger for Puzzle Agent 2 to continue further. I don't know, I haven't played Puzzle Agent 2 yet, but now I definitely want to. If you like mysteries and point-and-click adventure games or puzzles, this game is very much worth a look, and $5 is a good price for it.			"

												Puzzle Agent is great. Any fan of Professor Layton on the DS or puzzle adventures in general will enjoy this game. The setting is weird, the story is very weird, and the characters are all weird. But the weirdness is in a charming way. The length is typical of the genre, about 3 hours at a normal pace. The puzzles weren't difficult at all. I found them relaxing.There are voice-overs and they are done well I think. I personally didn't care for the art style.Unfortunately, there are a few jump scares. The worst part about them is that that they happen when you are vulnerable.

												7/10 Perfectly Passable PuzzlerFar from TellTae's usual offerings, this is a well plotted collection of varied minigames rather than a point and click adventure game. This shouldn't be seen as a bad thing as it still delivers a good enough storyline with some humour and a fairly interesting set of puzzles. The puzzles are pretty varied with little repetition, but all of them are simple enough without resorting to cheats. I picked this up in a bundle with some old Sam + Max games, and it lay on my backpile for a while for once I got into the story I was hooked enough to puzzle through. All in all, it delivers what it promises, and that's fair praise in the current market.			"

												The story is good, although short, and then the ending is bad. the puzzles vary between ok but easy and frustrating because of poor explanations/no ability to make notes/having to constantly click to another screen for rules. I struggled on a few puzzles because of difficulty but most of the struggle was just frustration. Others aren't hard but purely tedium - eg connecting the images together, when you put them in the right place they snap together so you can't go wrong but it's very hard to actually see how they should connect together often so you just move stuff around hoping they'll work. A couple puzzles have too many steps but you can't make notes or draw or anything which is a pain. A few have confusing explanations and eg the one revolving around patrons looking like food I couldn't work out which a couple of people were supposed to look like. I had some fun and for the price it's not bad but kind of a frustrating experience.			"

												Puzzle Agent, jak sama gra wskazuje, jest o zagadkach i agencie. A dokładnie o Nelsonie - agencie z wydziału zagadek. W wyniku wysłania do miałego, zimnego miasteczka Scoggins w Minesocie staje się on świadkiem nadnaturalnych wydarzeń i wielu niebezpiecznych i tajemniczych sytuacji. Sam nie wiem co jest ważniejszym elementem gameplayu - fabuła czy same w sobie zagadki. Łamigłówki są różnorodne i wymagają logicznego myślenia, a fabuła na prawdę wciąga i chcemy jak najszybciej dowiedzieć się wszystkiego o tajemniczych zjawiskach. Styl graficzny Grahama Annable jest bardzo klimatyczny i idealnie wpasowuje się w charakter gry. Polecam tą grę zarówno fanom łamigłowek i logicznego myślenia jak i tym, którzy są ciekawi fabuły małego miasteczka. Dla tych drugich wciąż zostają podpowiedzi, porozsiewane po całej mapie w formie gum do żucia, które używane podczas sekwencji łamigłówek czasami po prostu odwalają za nas całą robotę.			"

												Although this is a good game i would advise you not to play this game to be honest for the $4.99 you sunk into this you get a often times agrivatingly easy/hard ( yes i said easy ) With some of them making some sense like "" oh hey you gotta do this this and this never diverge from that "" so you're like okay "" oh yea btw i'm gunna be a specific ♥♥♥♥♥ so if i don't like it even if it's right under my rules you're ♥♥♥♥ing wrong ""That is what the puzzles are like some are even so easy you wonder why they put them into the game like "" okay just..... * Smokes weed * j-just throw♥♥♥♥♥♥around until they snap together maaaan "" and it's in one of the FINAL PUZZLES! YES YOU HEARD ME ONE OF THE FINAL PUZZLES IS SO EASY infact all of the final puzzles are so simple a todler could finish 90% of them. And while the red guys had some shrowd of mystery on me they where just a jumpscare exscue or to pad out the game length and also these guys are foes and they help you in one of the final puzzles.....H-How can you be that backwards to ♥♥♥♥ing with this guy not wanting him to get to this other guy and then just beeing like "" oh hey you need that LemmeJustGiveThatToYou. All and all this rant if you couldn't understand hopefuly conveys the message of buysing something better than THIS steaming pile of crap			"

												I just played through this game start to finish in four hours and here are my thoughts.Puzzle agent has the potential to be a good game but falls short. I started playing and found certain dialogue genuinely funny but as the story progressed and became more ridiculous I lost complete interest in the story itself. Now I'm not against a 'random' or 'quirky' storyline, in fact there are many games that have thrived under that direction - however these stories work because you are invested in the characters and want to see them develop regardless of how outlandish the story may seem. Just for example - there is a cutscene where you are carried off into the woods by gnomes and wake up in a space shuttle in zero gravity where you need to solve a puzzle to get out, once you solve the puzzle you wake up in the lodge. That's it - there is no explanation given as to why you were there and it is literally never addressed again. I was thinking - are you trying to be random? funny?? Oh and before you go there this isn't a case of 'it was all just a dream'. Apart from the random story line this game has provided me with what is possibly the most unsatisfying ending I've ever experienced in a game. The ending was so frustrating that it may have encourage me to purchase puzzle agent 2 just to see what happens but because I wasn't at all invested in the lead character (heck I've already forgotten his name) lets call him detective mcgee that I wouldn't play puzzle agent 2 even if it promised a satisfying conclusion.That all being said, this is a puzzle game which means that the puzzles should be worth while. Yes and no. The original puzzles are clever and original - however they tend to repeat themselves and the final three puzzles of the game are hilariously easy. Also there is one particular puzzle that is unclear and could be interpreted several different ways.So to conclude I would only recommend this game if you are a serious fan of puzzle games - if not go pick up a copy of Lyne for a dollar more and focus more on the puzzles than any actual story.3/10			"

												Professor Layton meets The X-Files in this brief 5-hour puzzle adventure game. While the graphics are not your latest AAA blockbuster, they are endearing and suffice in conveying the in-game events. The puzzles aren't very challenging and, sadly, don't increase in difficulty as the game progresses, except in short, side puzzles. The writing, quirky humor, and horror are well balanced and act together to drive intrigue in the storyline. However, the spot-on voice acting is what completes the game, adding a nice depth to the characters' personas.			"

												I bought this game after thoroughly enjoying the Professor Layton games, thinking this would be in the same vein.While it definitely is similar, Puzzle Agent employs a darker sense of humor and a more adult atmosphere.  This is not a game I'd recommend for kids under thirteen.  The story is compelling and the art is awesome, but the puzzles themselves leave a bit to be desired.  There are a few that seem too simple, and one or two that still make no sense to me whatsoever.It's easy enough to bang out the game in an afternoon, and it's worth it for one particular moment that will make you jump (you'll know it when you get there).It's not a perfect game, but it's definitely fun.

												It's hard to decide which way to go on this one, but on the balance I have to acknowledge the basic competence of this game. The art is crude but charming, the writing is cumbersome but witty, and the voice-acting is low-key but amusing. The puzzles are of course the main dish, and these are sufficiently diverse and feature a reasonable ramp-up in difficulty. The story is just weird, but that works for the light-hearted tone. My main complaint is that I've had a few puzzle solutions which met all the listed requirements and yet were rejected by the game - no flexibility allowed. That frustration aside, though, and it's a perfectly decent experience.			"

												This game is very... fine. I have a lot of small gripes about it but they're mostly inconsequential in the end, it's a decent adventure game and it's a decent story with decent puzzles. But it never goes beyond decent. I'm fine with the art style for the most part but when the images are blown up to large proportions they look very blurry and ugly. Some of the puzzles are vague or give vague instructions, resulting in either the need for a hint or the solution being marked as wrong because of the missing information. There's a weird awkward pause after dialogue ends quite frequently that feels... off. The characters just stand there unmoving for a second or two. The game's pretty short, too, completed in around three hours without any difficulty. There's never any mystery where to go, the game always guides you. The endgame feels like it just... happens. There's a small puzzle gauntlet and a non-ending that doesn't resolve any of the game's mysteries. I figure the second game will do so, but... don't. Keep your games self-contained, PLEASE. I have the second game already so I'll probably just play it soon and all but yeah... not a good way to end a game. Also plot-wise there's a point where you're forced to walk into an obvious trap without questioning a thing, which is lazy writing if you ask me.Despite all my small gripes... it's fine overall. The puzzle variety is decent though some get repeated like three times in a game with only 37 puzzles, which is eehh. The puzzle design is for the most part decent, though fairly easy. The plot's fine except for the ending. There's a neat thing where your puzzles get interrupted a few times. The horror elements here are used pretty well. The art style is unique and works well enough. The voice acting's pretty good. I like this game, I don't love this game, it's not very expensive and you can get it on sale dirt-cheap, check it out if you want your puzzle fix with a side of mystery novel.			"

Product received for free
												Honestly, I have a hard time grading this game. Normally, it\'s either good, or bad, too hard, too easy, too short, or too expensive.However, in this case, the reason I recommend it, is because I won it on steamgifts.com.About the game: Graphically, there\'s nothing wrong with it. The graphics are a bit kiddy for me, but not overly so. Also, the story in the movies you get through the game is very entertaining, and more scary, then I want to admit.The puzzles itself aren\'t that great. The biggest difficulty with them is: what are they asking you exactly? Birds on a wire, or crows, put everything on a plate, or put everything on a plate in their order, but you can fit them together like puzzle pieces? The puzzles itself don\'t seem to have too much to do with the mystery/story, which is a shame.The idea of the game is amazing! FBI agent in charge of puzzles! It\'s both hilarious, and serious at the same time.And eventually, the time this took, probably wasn\'t the fastest you can do it in, but it\'s a great ballparc figure for it. Don\'t expect too long to finish this game.In the end, I did enjoy it immensely, but with all the great investigation hints, I found, that weren\'t used at all in a final huge puzzle, and the time it took to finish this game, I am glad I got it free!

												Good premise, faulty execution.Yes, the plot is rather silly, and serves mainly to tie the puzzles together. But since you bought a game called Puzzle Agent, presumably you're mainly interested in the puzzles, so that's okay.Where the game fails is that too many of the puzzles are poorly described: either the rules, or the goals aren't clear. For instance, in one puzzle, you have to place tiles to form a path through a forest, to a goal, without meeting any monsters. Except that it's not enough that there be a monster-free path to the goal: none of the branches may lead to a monster, something that the game doesn't make clear.In another, you have terminals on a circuit board, and have to form an electrical connection between them. After banging my head against this puzzle for half an hour, I bought hints and learned that the electrical circuits already printed on the board were purely for decoration, and not part of the puzzle at all.With some additional playtesting, and tweaking of the puzzle descriptions, the game could be much better.

												I received everything I expected from 'Nelson Tethers: Puzzle Agent', and also a few more ""surprises"" that I wasn't expecting at all. There are a great mix of problems to solve throughout this adventure (even though some puzzles have nothing to do with the game's progress), and I found myself paying close attention to the intriguing story. The plot is fairly linear, but it was still super fun learning what was going to happen next. This game left me disturbingly pleased using its eerie and unique aesthetic.			"

Nelson Tethers doesn't get a lot of field work as one of the FBI's top puzzle research but when the eraser factor closes down under mysterious circumstances it's time to head to Scoggins to find answers.This seeming small friendly town is home to not only puzzling citizens but also raw puzzles themselves.  The puzzle mix in this game is solid, with enough variety to provide some easy/hard ones to any player skill set.			"

												Its pretty much like an even wierder Professor Layton game.It won't take you long to beat, and the story is very strange. However the voice acting is superbly well done and Nelson Tethers was a rather fleshed out character for the main character of a puzzle game. The game is short but it doesn't cost much, as long as you don't hate puzzle games, I think you will find it enjoyable. The game's main drawback is its short length. Its quite possible to beat the game in only a few hours. Difficulty-wise, I would say most of the puzzles are pretty easy, there were a couple that felt like unfair attempts to stump the player, but other than those few, all the puzzles seemed fairly fair. You will NOT need a guide for this game. A sequel was confirmed, I can't wait for it to come out.			"

												Synopsis: You, an intellectual, solves the the puzzles they have on the back of kids menus around 37 times.Gameplay:If that synopsis somehow doesn't sound unappealing, you genuninely might enjoy this game. When I say, puzzles you find on the back of kids menus, I am not emblelishing anything whatsoever. This game features top down mazes, connect the dots, and that activity where you have to rotate the tiles of an image to fix it. It's a very casual title and accessible to pretty much anyone. You're given infinite time to solve each puzzle, you can use gum you find in game for hints if you find yourself stuck, and it actually does feel rewarding to solve some of the harder puzzles. The individual puzzles were the absolutely the main hook for playing Puzzle Agent through all the way, as redundant as that sounds. I should note however, being a telltale game, you also have to walk to each puzzle and sit through unskippable cutscenes.Story:That said, the overarching ""puzzle"" of what was happening to the main town in game was lacking, to the point where I wondered if someone just wrote the whole thing up as they went along and never looked back. Stories traditionally are supposed to keep the player hooked, especially for point and clicks. However, Puzzle Agent went for the classic ""I'm not going address the main issues with this game here so please support us anyway and buy our new game, fallout 4,"" so I didn't get closure on most essential plot points. Occasionally purposeful loose ends that can be executed well enough, but in my opinion it just felt sloppy or unplanned for here. For reference and without ""spoiling"" anything, if you watch the store page trailer, that's all you find out in Puzzle Agent. The premise sounds intriguing, but that's all she wrote.Art:It is functional for the purposes of making on screen pixels resemble persons, places, and things. The artstyle is meant to resemble the stylings of Graham Annable's Grinkle cartoons, but the choppy animation and missing drawn frames loses most of its charm for me since this is a full fledged studio team working on this and not just one man. It was endearing for a little at the beginning, but once 5 minutes passed it felt just ok.Music:Ok. It's not a strong point of the game, but when music is drawn into focus to make scenes more alive it works well. When doing puzzles, the music becomes very soft and low to mask the fact that it obviously has to loop. It never became annoying for me.Recommendation:I'm not going to recommend this game because if you or a friend is a fan of this kind of gameplay, I would sooner recommend either buying a real life puzzle book for like a dollar or a harder puzzle game.

												I watched Ross' Game Dungeon and gave this a try. I can't see any reason to praise this game. The game is impossible to lose or even screw up, you play for points. If you beat it once you can perfect score the game on your second try. The Bad:Weak story- when you first say ""I wonder if this is what's going on"", it is.Easy Puzzles- At least half are impossible to not get a perfect score on, like tile flips, pathways, and puzzle piecing items togetherNo Exploration- The game litterally tells you by dialouge ""I should go here next and talk to ______"" abd incase you forget there's a log. Also going to places you have no reason to check out seldom results in anything, no new dialouge, no new puzzles, nada; just worthless gum.No characterization- everyone is static and sterotypical. If you play this and think, ""he looks bad but he may be good"" no he's bad. Infact this is the only cliche missing, a good guy you don't trust at first.Reused ""jumpscare""- The quotes should say it allAwful Tease- You're told to stay out of the woods at night, but the game has no timer and it never transitions to night. You are done before evening. How am I supposed to be scared of the dark woods and a possibly evil entity if I never have to encouter the scenario?The goodKilled a few hoursI only wasted $1.50I jumped once, then they reused the startle, so...Really it was the fact that you knew where to go and who to talk to at all times that killed me. I mean what kind of puzzle game says ""here's what you do, now go do it"". It was like a fetch quest plus tile roataion puzzles for 3 hours.			"

												I was waiting for my bus to Buckingham Palace to pick up my rifle when my mobile recieved a message. I thought it was Rab Butler sending me snapchat messages about his illiterate wife. However, the message was from a myseterious source, claiming that there was a problem with some NHS legislation. I haven't been prime minister for a long time so I though nothing of it. That was until I saw the contact number the message was sent from: 80085. I smirked at first, thinking it was a prank message, but then I remembered; The co-ordinates of my treasure were oddly similar to the text message. I threw on my bowler hat and picked up my cane, ignoring the bus that had just arrived. I ran as quickly as I could to Hyde Park, without the aid of public transport to aid in my camoflage, and reached the last known location of my stash. I took my remote detonator out of my pocket and blew open the ground beneath me. My fears were confirmed when I noticed that the chest that normally housed my gold bars was absent and a note was left in its place: ""I have the gold now Clem. If you ever want to see it again meet me at the Old Docks at midnight tonight."" The note was unmarked and had the vague scent of lacquer oil. Now I don't know if you're familiar with your wood preservation techniques but this type of lacquer is used to protect sporting instruments from decay. It was at that point that I realised who was responsible for this heinous crime. I quickly went home and assembled the cabinet. I told them my predicament and they said that they would be willing to help, if I got a new dishwasher for the house. So after much screaming and Bevan nose-breakings, I agreed to buy 4 and a half cases of Carlsberg Export for the house to share. I actually got a great deal on 'em because they were 1 for 1.5 at Morrison's. A plan was set up; They would wait by the dock with a collection of blunt instruments and I would approach the area at the specified time. As the event horizon drew near positions were met and I waited near the solitary lampost. A cloaked figure rose from the shadows and addressed me with chilling clarity. I identified myself and just as he was about to speak, I gave the signal and everyone jumped out at once. Except for Roy Jenkins, but then that's what I get for putting non-cabinet members in my plans. They beat him to within an inch of his life. He sat there motionless, his shoulders heaving under the stress of his laboured breathing. ""Why?"" he asked, as if I was under trial. ""You stole my gold; You tell me."" I replied. He said that he didn't steal the gold, but that it was stolen by my arch-nemesis. Embarrassingly, I was unsure of who this was. I asked him and he said one simple word: ""Wood."" I knew what that mean. It was all clear now. I knew what had to be done. The lacquer oil, the wooden dock, the missing wooden chest. Something was oddly connected about all of these things, and I knew what. For some time now, the future cabinet has been leaving me distracting emails about how eventually I will fall, but I haven't read them for two reasons: For one, I don't negotiate with terror♥♥♥♥♥ and two, I have a monopoly on the timber industry, so they've been using wood-based threats for years to ""Send me a message."" Up to this point I ignored them, but now I knew what had to be done. I had to investigate this further and figure out who had it in for me for so long. I would not rest until the identity of my greatest foe was revealed....Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥yeah, Puzzle Agent. Good puzzles, decent writing - 12/1			"

Professor Layton and the Uninspired Ripoff GameThis game blatantly rips off the Professor Layton series. If you're unfamiliar with those Nintendo (3)DS games, you play as professional puzzle expert who solves a mystery in a town filled with jerks who refuse to tell you anything until you've solved a puzzle or two for them. Oh, and you can buy up to three hints to help you with any puzzle, by spending some sort of token. (In Layton it's coins, here it's... wads of used gum. Don't ask.) Aside from the fact that Tethers doesn't have a rent boy ""apprentice"", the structure is exactly the same.The one thing that Puzzle Agent does better than Layton is atmosphere. The game is fully (and competently) voice acted, which adds a ton of personality that's missing from the Layton games (which only has brief voice acted cutscenes, because of the space restrictions of 3DS game carts). Puzzle Agent's setting is a mix of Fargo and Twin Peaks, instead of Layton's weird intensely-Japanese idealized version of 1930's Europe.Unfortunately, this game's puzzles are consistently... mediocre, which is a big problem in a puzzle game. Many don't make the details of the puzzle clear enough (FYI the arm wrestling contest was single elimination), and sometimes keys details are needlessly split between multiple screens. And the other BIG problem with the puzzles is that there's no way to make notes within the game! Sure, it wasn't too hard for me to use pen and paper to figure things out, but what if you're playing on a laptop on a plane? This is a BIG oversight.			"

												I played this game for 45 minutes.  In that 45 minutes I did not read a single line of dialogue, and skipped forward through everything as fast as I possibly could.  In that time I did 5 puzzles, most being solved in less than 1 minute.  The rest of the time is unskippable cutscenes that aren't even dialogue heavy.  You sit and wait several seconds as a character glances around back and forth, before finally the speech bubble pops up and you can click to continue.The puzzles may be good, but you have to wait 5-15 minutes between them.

												It's like buying a puzzle book...bound in with a short story and the occasional jumpscare. Dem gnomes almost gave me a heart attack! Haven't played the sequel yet. However, it certainly seems a necessity since the game ends with many unanswered questions. I've yet to find all the puzzles but have completed the story. You have the option to play the puzzles seperate from the story if you haven't bothered to find them.Now, for the bad. Most of these puzzles are easy, and are the type of fair found on the back of cereal boxs (in the old days, not these days) and puzzle books. Any puzzles you might have trouble with might not explain the rules well enough, though I won't give mentions about which specific puzzles in order not to spoil it. Let's just say one for sure requires an extra 'common sense' rule that isn't listed.Now for the neutral: Gum wads give you extra tips during the puzzles, and you get them while searching scenes. Do you need them per say? Eh...maybe, maybe not. I only used one once, after collecting several dozen. Now, using the wad tips will affect your score a little, but it is certainly better then guessing wrong, which will hit your score much harder. I'm not for or against this system, but it seems like more life could have been dragged out of the game if you didn't get any tips.Do not watch a Let's Play of this. You will literally have no reason to get this game because it will spoil the answers and the story. It's too short to for that. That said, it is worth the money for what it is. And it is a digital puzzle book...with jumpscares. Frickin' gnomes!!! Y U SCARE ME WHILE I TRY TO PUZZLE?!? But I wouldn't have it any other way.			"

												Suprisingly, this was a really enjoyable game. I don't normally play genres like this, but I am really glad that I did. It made me laugh-out-loud in some parts and I found it genuinely amusing. Interesting story-line, and I found the puzzles were a good variety.			"

												This game had SO MUCH POTENTIAL. The style, the game play, the story, it was all really good! Alllllllll the way until the shoddy ending that explained nothing and left you with the feeling of disappointment. If this game were on sale for under $5 I would recommend it, if not, just wait for the Summer/Winter steam sale.I really hope the second Puzzle Agent concludes the cliff-hanger :/			"

												Puzzle Agent reminds me of the ""professor Layton"" series on the Nintendo DS. Point and click adventure with puzzle solving in between as the main thing. Those who played Layton will imidiately get into the game, though the puzzles are way easier and can be solved with no big effort. Later ones are a bit more challenging, but overall the game is an easy casual entertainment.			"

												The following review is of my opinions and I understand that some people may disagree with some or all of them.Puzzle Agent is a nice little Tell Tale style game with quite a few puzzles and riddles to solve. There is no inventory or items to collect except for bits of chewing gum that you find scattered about randomly in most scenes. Each piece of gum collected allows you to use a hint during a puzzle or riddle. Puzzle and riddle difficulties range from simple to thought involved but definitely not impossible. Some do make you think a bit and may take a couple attempts and hints to get, but they are fun to solve.The comic sketch pencil outline graphics style suits the game really well. Animation is fairly basic and simple but again suits the game well. I like the style and actually feel that I enjoy this particular game more with this style compared to if it was done with lots of fancy animations and renderings. Game sound effects are pretty good for the game. The music theme is good, although there is repetitiveness I did not find it tiresome or annoying. I did turn it down to about 75%-80%, but this is a preference of mine in general for all games. The voices are well done and suited to the various characters.The story is amusing and has a few quirky and comical bits. The ending was a bit odd and quick. I kind of felt that it left me hanging as in to be continued or something but without the To Be Continued text, which is probably why there is a second game.The entire game took me about 4.5 hours to play including a few breaks and mid-afternoon snack. For myself I feel that this was an appropriate amount of time spent for the game. Some people may finish the game faster while other may take longer. This is a great little game to pass away an afternoon or evening, also probably good for streamers to play on those short streaming days who are looking for a quick and short game to play. Overall I found the game entertaining and did enjoy playing it quite a bit. Will I play this game again? Yes. I will definitely get Puzzle Agent 2. For the type of game, I give this a score of 8/10.

												Puzzle Agent is a smart, dark, and intriguing puzzler and made me feel dumb at some points, and is definitely worth a look. It is a tad short and to me somewhat inconclusive, but buy it with the sequel and you'll have a complete and challenging adventure, with a deeply interesting mystery.			"

												First, I love puzzle games and any game where you have to think rather than just shoot everything that moves.  But puzzles need to be intuitive or, if not intuitive, the rules should be easy to understand.  That is where this game goes off the rails.  The puzzles are all over the spectrum from really easy to really hard.  There isn't a series of progressively more difficult puzzles.  I like the humor of the game and the graphics style is minimalist and clever.  It would seem they spent more time on the looks and not the puzzles which is a shame.  I bought this for a couple of bucks during the holiday sale and still feel cheated.			"

												Simplistic, but charming nonetheless. The Twin Peaks/Fargo/X-Files style plot is enhanced by some good writing and voice acting that sells the characters. Graham Annables art also helps to give it a distinct style. It's a very simple point and click where dialogue progresses the story and unlocks puzzles, some of which are also found in the environment. Most of the puzzles are fairly easy, and even the harder ones can be due to the rules being unclear, but they were still plenty of fun. Overall it should run you about 4 hours depending on how quickly you get through the puzzles, with not much replayability unless you want to run through the story again.The game suffers from a very anti-climactic ending, but I've been told the sequel helps to wrap the story up. So if you're interested, I'd recommend getting both during a sale and playing them in order.			"

												I can really only somewhat recommend this game. The puzzles in the game are interesting enough. Some require some fairly deep logic, others are pretty obvious. The rotating block puzzels and assembly puzzles that keep coming up are somewhat of a chore, as they don't tend to involve deeper logic, just rearranging until you get it right. Some puzzels are genuinely interesting though. The story is servicable and somewhat interesting, though it ends with more questions than answers. It opens up some interesting tangents, then never explains the loose ends. I understand the episodic approach, but it ends just as suddenly as it starts, leaving the feeling htat this is only half of a game. The addition of a ""hard mode"" with the same puzzle mechanics reworked into harder puzzles would be nice. There are several puzzles that are there just for the enjoyment of the puzzles themselves. In the end, the game will only take about 3 hours to complete. Wait for a big sale.			"

												Telltale Games delivers yet another masterpiece with Puzzle Agent--a charming puzzle adventure with a mildly amusing story about an eraser shortage. As always with Telltale, voice acting is top notch, but this time they use crayon style graphics to set up a casual atmosphere that really gives this game a leisurely feel.Each puzzle is self-contained so there are no multi-level puzzles. It differs from traditional point-and-click puzzle adventures where you usually have to find several items or perform a specific sequence of actions before you can advance. Most of the puzzles are on the easy side, but they do throw in a few brainteasers that aren't obvious at first. There is a hint system which, if used, lowers your ranking for that specific puzzle, same as if you submit a wrong answer--although it is completely casual so there is really no reason to care about rank anyway.Puzzle gamers will certainly enjoy this.

												This game has a great story to wrap around its puzzles and fantastic animation that brings back cartoons of the 70's that I used to watch on Saturday mornings. The only thing that keeps it from being perfect is the instructions that accompany each puzzle. They are maddeningly inconsistent. Sometimes they are adequate to understand the puzzle, sometimes they are so completely vague that I couldn't even understand the basic requirements. On those puzzles I had to lose a turn ""submitting"" an answer just to see the playing field. No, that's not part of the puzzle.Don't let that keep you from playing. You can circumvent the broken puzzles by using hints to help understand the vague directions, though it reveals some of the puzzl-y part of the puzzle, not just the missing directions. Oh well. But once you understand the puzzle requirements, what it's asking you to do, you can then engage in the challenge of solving it. Hopefully Telltale does a better job with puzzle instructions on Part 2.			"

												Honestly feels like a poor man's Professor Layton. This coming from a poor man who hasn't played Layton. So... pretty good! As with games of this nature, there's not much in the way of replay value, because once you figure out how to solve a puzzle once, it's pretty easy to remember on any subsequent playthrough. The art style is neat, but sometimes the limited animation makes it seem...incomplete. Dialogue and pacing is funny, in a sort of charmingly awkward way. The story, on the other hand, makes a big deal about SEEMING like it's going somewhere, but the ending leaves you with more questions than answers. I assume some of these are resolved in the sequel, but know that going in you won't get a narratively satisfying conclusion.			"

												Not sure what to say... I didn´t enjoy the game much but I would still recommend it. Why? Well...The graphics design wasn't my thing but blame me as I alredy knew this before purchasing. Still I decided to give it a try but unfortunately I didn't like the story either so I wasn't hooked from the beginning. Puzzles were OK (some super easy) but I think few puzzles were not very well explained and that's what made them quite hard. Who knows?

												This is why Steam needs ""meh"" rating. It's basically just a bunch of puzzle mini-games connected together by very simple and linear adventuring parts. There is a big focus on the story which is... just weird. It looks like a cartoon comedy but there are virtually no jokes; it's slightly funny just because how strange it is...Please note that the game has virtually no ending and you need to follow up with Puzzle Agent 2 to wrap up the story.

												I wish I could give a neutral recommendation. But since I can't, well, it's cheap and not a waste of money, especially if you get it on sale.For a $5 game, you get a few hours of pretty easy puzzles, most of which are loosely tied to the story, at best, and a fun slightly weird animated story with decent voice acting. Unfortunately, the story just stops. If you want to conclusion then you have to also purchase Puzzle Agent 2. The puzzles aren't especially challenging for the most part, which probably wont appeal to hard-core puzzle solvers. But they are quickly solved, so they don't interfere with the story all that much either. "

The story and unique visuals make for a great atmosphere.My only complaint is that sometimes the rules of a puzzle is unclear and you will fail because you made a false assumption. "

												I was drawn into Puzzle Agent by it’s intriguing and comical story, and it certainly did not disappoint. I rushed through puzzles just to get to the next cut scene, which in hindsight is one of the glaring problems with the game. The gameplay itself is actually pretty boring and entirely unchallenging. There were a few promising aspects to it that got my hopes up, but overall most of the puzzles put me to sleep. Finally the ending to the story, ended up being somewhat of a let down. It leads me to believe that the game was probably rushed for release and never ended up being truly finished. The graphics of the game could’ve fit well with it’s charming story and lore, but often it was pixelated and blurry instead of looking hand-drawn like intended. I’m honestly rather disappointed by the lost potential here.Graphics: 7/10Mechanics: 5/10Performance: 10/10Story: 10/10 (until the end 7/10)Fun-factor: 6/10Overall scored: 7/10I’d recommend this game, but only while on sale for cheap. I’m hoping that there is some kind of remake from Telltale that makes up for the disappointment that this game left me with. "

												Puzzle Agent is very...Layton-esque. The puzzles in this game had much fewer types than I would've liked. And while there are no sliding block puzzles, doing twisting puzzles or tangrams (that auto-lock) gets pretty repetitive after the fourth one. Some of the descriptions seemed too vague as well, making hints almost needed to help explain what I needed to do (or what I was doing wrong). Hints in this game are given in the form of chewed gum stuck to walls, which I liked since it actually makes sense (despite being disgusting). Clicking on nothing important on the screen sends out a wave that reveals interactive things on the screen and gum, which I also liked. The story, writing, voice acting, and crayon-like art stye were all very pleasing, and the skippy animations only helped it remind me of an old computer game like Putt Putt (or my computer was having trouble processing it, but I didn't seem that way). However, it was all short-lived, as I completed the game in about five hours (and I bet you could do it more quickly).Overall, Puzzle Agent had its flaws in terms of puzzle type variety and descriptions, but it was still a nice game to play through. I give it the usual ""buy it when it's on sale"" recommendation.			"

												I expected a game consisting solely of puzzles tied together by a read&forget story but in the end I was positively surprised by the game's story. It's really funny, there a lots of great weird characters and the voice acting is done very well, too. The story alone is worth to play the game (it's a bit like Twin Peaks with gnomes).Besides the story parts there are, of course, puzzles to solve: There are several puzzles that are mandatory to solve to proceed in the story and some additional optional puzzles every now and then. I had fun solving all of them, although I found them to be a bit too easy - making at least some of the optional puzzles harder would have made the game more interesting but that is really the only negative thing I can think of.If you like to solve puzzles and you enjoy humorous detective stories than you will probably like this game.

Puzzles are not very original or hard and there is a built in hint system, so there is no chance you will ever get stuck. The story, characters and music are all well done, and the game was very fun. My only real complaint would be the puzzle interface, especially the part after you submit the solution, that takes you out of the game world a bit.There are some scary moments during the game, and if you like that kind of stuff, go to YouTube and check out videos by the author (grickle) like ""The Hidden People"" or ""The Webb"".

												With about 4 hours worth of gameplay and a total of 60 (I think) puzzles, Puzzle Agent is an interesting little game which can keep boredom away on a rainy afternoon.The art direction and the voice acting go perfectly together, creating a delightful atmosphere, which combined with the captivating story will, most probably, leave you wanting some more. In terms of puzzles, I can't say they are hard at all, but they're more like entertaining brain teasers. Most puzzles take about 10 mintues to complete, and you can always use a hint if you're stuck. Unfortunately, one problem is that in some puzzles the rules aren't exactly clear, meaning you probably won't get it right from first try, hurting your stats. Aside from that the game is really good for its price and is worth a try if you are a fan of the genre or want a short and gripping story.			"

												As yet another Professor Layton fan, I really loved Puzzle Agent. It just has it all - the humor, the mystery, the odd characters, the chills-down-your-spine moments...The puzzles are diverse in types and difficulty and even though some are a bit catchy and vaguely described, I didn't find myself being too frustrated about it. One or two hints usually got me unstuck and on the right track. Other puzzles are way too easy and not much of a challenge, but I think that this brings a balance into the game, so you don't spend too much time solving hard puzzles and you can enjoy the story as well.The story itself is interesting and it kept me speculating the whole time, but I'm not really sure that the cliffhanger ending was a good idea. Because of that, I wouldn't recommend buying this game without getting Puzzle Agent 2 as well.Overall, the game is somewhat short and fast-paced, with only 40-ish puzzles, but it is immersive and worth its price. I personally don't see too much replay value, because there is only one path through the story, there are no hard to find puzzles that require replaying the game several times and, with the lack of achievements, mastering all the puzzles doesn't seem as satisfying. I will probably replay it at some point in the future though, if I feel like I've missed or forgotten something from the puzzles and the story.Off to Puzzle Agent 2!			"

												This game has a great story to wrap around its puzzles and fantastic animation that brings back cartoons of the 70's that I used to watch on Saturday mornings. The only thing that keeps it from being perfect is the instructions that accompany each puzzle. They are maddeningly inconsistent. Sometimes they are adequate to understand the puzzle, sometimes they are so completely vague that I couldn't even understand the basic requirements. On those puzzles I had to lose a turn ""submitting"" an answer just to see the playing field. No, that's not part of the puzzle.Don't let that keep you from playing. You can circumvent the broken puzzles by using hints to help understand the vague directions, though it reveals some of the puzzl-y part of the puzzle, not just the missing directions. Oh well. But once you understand the puzzle requirements, what it's asking you to do, you can then engage in the challenge of solving it. Hopefully Telltale does a better job with puzzle instructions on Part 2.			"

A quirky, confusing ride through Scoggins, Minessota, full of enigmatic townsfolk, shadowy conspiracies, and a whole lot of puzzles.Though relatively brief and fairly light on brain-benders, the engaging tale and offbeat humour are well worth the price of admission. It adheres to the early Telltale formula, pre-Walking Dead, so it's still very much a point-and-click adventure game, rather than a choose-your-own-narrative experience, but so long as you know that going in, you'll have a good time.

												In the words of my very sage wife, this is pretty much Twin Peaks: the game. As a puzzle game it's very uneven, with some challenges that are genuinely difficult, a few that are difficult mostly because the rules are unclear, and a lot that are pretty easy. As a story and/or experience it's very fun, though, with a quirky sense of humor, a compellingly weird plot, and a distinctive and cool visual style. I don't recommend getting it without picking up the sequel at the same time; the primary mystery of this game is unsolved by design and continues into the next.			"

												Pretty short puzzle, completed slightly more than 3 hours.The story started out slow and at some point, it became creepy. However, some instructions given during the puzzles were a little vague and difficult to understand, took a while to figure it out.Overall, it is still quite an enjoyable game.			"

												If you like puzzle games, you will fing this one mediocre. It's not a bad game, but it's not a great one eather. Still I was interested to play trough the game and that is why I recommend it. I recommend it for people who play puzzle games or point and click adventure games. Not many games no play in the genre, give this game a try if you can find it on a discount. Not worth 5 euro imo. 2 euro tops.			"

												Short, but pretty fun distraction. The plot does exist and the voice acting is good, the art is highly serviceable. Puzzles aren't too difficult and hints are abundant if you need them (you don't).Cons: There are sometimes really vague puzzle rules, not describing restrictions fully. One doesn't make instructions so vague in a puzzle game, especially since there aren't ""try runs"" for puzzles normally requiring a run test. And I'm saying it as someone who solved hundreds of similar puzzles in Layton games.			"

												This is my preface to my review: this game is a blatant clone of Professor Layton, but much shorter, and much harder.On that note, I love it. This is the only game series I know of that uses the PL format for its puzzle solving, and it is wonderful. I wish there were more games that used the type of mystery town invaded by even more mysterious creatures. It's even better that they make the premise of puzzle obsession work. The connection between Layton's puzzle obsession and what's actually going on is weak at best, but Puzzle Agent has someone who actually solves puzzles in a town that actually has a puzzle obsession makes it even better.I would wholeheartedly reccommend buying this game, and wish for even more puzzles in the future. I played it to completion, and left feeling like an idiot, unable to comprehend even the easiest of puzzzles, and clamoring for more.			"

												Fun little puzzle game with an interesting story (based on a series of books, thus the 'lo-fi' art style) of an appropriate price point for the length (~3hrs).Some of the puzzles were actually quite challenging, to my satisfaction, and resorting to hints (which were well-written) shouldn't be something the player feels lesser for doing.  A fair number of the puzzles were 'familiar format' to me (being an old fart who's fiddled with puzzles for...*ahem* well, okay...more decades than my vanity lets me admit ;) ), so consequently I breezed right through them  - ""Yeah, yeah, but I'm the bus driver, so what do you want to know about me?"" ;)All in all, I heartily enjoyed the diversion this game provided and am just about to go buy the sequel because of my experience with this one!

												I really enjoyed my time with this game, and that quite suprized me!This game has a good sense of humor, a great art style, a great cast of charicters, and it doesn't overstay it's welcome. Beat the game in two sittings, and was happy with the whole experience.Two quick notes though: The puzzles are occasionally frustrating, not because they are perticularly difficult, but because a few of them are explained in a strange way. If you plan on playing this game on mac, be aware that the sequel does not work on the mac, even though on first glace it looks like it does. I want to know what happens in Puzzle Agent 2, but I may have to look up a playthough on youtube, which isn't the same as just playing the game.			"

												While the gameplay is fine (even if puzzles do get a bit repetitive, and are not many) the story lacks coherence and terminates on a cliffhanger. The sequel is even worse, with puzzles that are always the same, a rushed final and a plot that makes no sense. If you're used to Professor Layton, this game won't live up to your expectations...

Some puzzles required application of logic outside of the problem space.A few bugs in this game kept me from really enjoying it - such as one a single accepted solution for puzzles that could be solved muliple ways - with no good framing around the problem to enable a decision to be made. The puzzles also got repetitive, with a core of 4-5 bread-n-butter type puzzles.Fun for any casual gamer, who likes to solve puzzles.3/5			"

It looks like a cartoon comedy but there are virtually no jokes; it's slightly funny just because how strange it is...Please note that the game has virtually no ending and you need to follow up with Puzzle Agent 2 to wrap up the story.

												Not sure what to say... I didn´t enjoy the game much but I would still recommend it. Why? Well...The graphics design wasn't my thing but blame me as I alredy knew this before purchasing. Still I decided to give it a try but unfortunately I didn't like the story either so I wasn't hooked from the beginning. Puzzles were OK (some super easy) but I think few puzzles were not very well explained and that's what made them quite hard. Who knows? Maybe it was me who lost interest and wasn't paying much attention.However I continued 'til the end out of curiosity. And I liked the rating system after every single puzzle depending on hints and attempts. If these two factors were related to achievements for Steam, it would have been great. But listen, £1 for 3 hours of entertainment, can I really complain? I won't be buying the second part, but give it a try if you have nothing else to do/play :)			"

												Intensely disappointing on many levels. The story appears to be Twin Peaks crossed with Fargo, and just as it starts to get going, the game ends abuptly.The puzzles are fairly repetitive - many of them either very obvious or solveable via trial-and-error with no real ""puzzle"" quality. The better challenges are let down by ambiguous instructions that leave out key details, leaving you submitting a very plausible solution only to be told you are wrong.I completed the game in about 3 hours. The length of play is due to how slowly the animations run and the incredibly drawn-out nature of the in-game conversations. If it ran things at a normal speed, this is little more than an hour of gameplay to a proficient puzzler. The slow drawl was immensely irritating at times, and interfered with attempts to build tension in the story - just as things get interesting, the painfully drawn-out action elicits an overwhelming sense of boredom.I like what they tried to do here. I don't like the finished game. The story was full of potential but never came anywhere near a climax or a resolution. The puzzles were very hit-and-miss, some of them very clever, but others very bland. The load times were ridiculous for a game that didn't seem to need any sort of heavy processing power, too.Oh, and there is zero replay value here.Glad I bought it on sale, and it wasn't terrible enough to give up on. I saw the game through to the end, but I doubt I'll play it again. Given the opportunity, I wouldn't buy it again, even on sale.			"

												A resfreshing game. Funny story, witty puzzles, quite diverting. I wouldn't pay full price, as it is quite a short game. however, It has replay value. If you have kids, you might want to let them have a go at this and train their brain.As for myself, I can't wait to check out Puzzle Agent 2 once it's on sale.			"

												This is a great little puzzle game.  I bought it not expecting much and was delightfully surprised by its quirky charm.  It has many little puzzles which are just hard enough to keep you wanting to play and easy enough to keep you from throwing your keyboard.  The storyline alone was enough to have made me want to keep playing.  An absolute gem and a definite recommend to puzzle lovers.			"

												Puzzle Agent is a cute little puzzle game that has an weird storyline combined with a lot of puzzles and brainteasers for you to solve. It reminded me a little of the Professor Layton series, so if you're into that, you might enjoy this. All in all, this is a few hours of solid entertainment if you're looking for a casual point-and-click with riddles thrown in.			"

												It's a cute game. The game was better than I expected it to be, although i wasn't sure what to expect. The point and click interaction seems to only be there just to get you to another puzzle, but the game wouldn't be called Puzzle Agent if it didn't have a lot of puzzles. That doesn't mean it does not have a story, it does, and it's humorous. Nelson Tethers is an F.B.I. agent that was sent to the town of Scoggins to figure out what happened to the Scoggins Eraser Co. factory. He has to solve the mystery of the shutting down of the factory, the missing people, why the people of the town seem to be hiding something and all while solving puzzles. The beginning was a little slow and the puzzles seemed too easy but they started to get more challenging, which made me continue to play the game. The game started out as a comedy mystery and turned into a comedy suspense thriller. I enjoyed playing the game.			"

Explore Scoggins, Minnesota, talking to the townfolk and solving puzzles, trying to discover the truth about an explosion at the local eraser factory.  What caused the explosion?  Why is the factory locked up?  Where did the foreman go?It's a fun little story with some puzzles to solve.  Just be prepared to pick up the sequel if you want the conclusion to the story.			"

Basically, I really liked this game. However, it is quite a short game and doesn't really need more than two playthroughs. This being the case, some people might not be happy to pay £3.99 for it (although actually I think it was going for more than that last time I checked). I bought this game as part of bundle (ths also included the sequel, which is shaping up to be quite good) and so I was satisfied with my purchase. So if the short length of the game puts you off, wait for a sale.			"

That being said, I'm writing this immediately after finishing  this game, knowing full well that there is a second one available. I'll probably be eating these words soon. They will wash down fine with more puzzles.			"

												No need to fear, PUZZLE AGNET is hear. Puzzle Agent is a game about, you guessed it, an agent that solves puzzles. Ok my discription is a bit shallow but it is the truth. The game starts out by introducing us to our protagonist, Agent Nelson Tethers of the Department of Puzzle Solving. You start off bye doing a puzzle and you get a message that an eraser factory has closed and you need to get it back open. When you get there you realize that things arn't that ordinary. Past this point in the story i'll be giving out spoilers so I guess I can stop hear. Gameplay wise, it's a point and click adventure puzzle game. You go around, find answers, and solve PUZZLES. Even though it sound light heartened the game has an air of mystery to it and can even feel dark. The story is so good that I listened to every line of dialouge. Even though this game is humorous it still keeps a dark and mysterious tone. The visuals were pleasing and the story was good. My only complaint is that the ending seems shallow and kind of hollow. It made me feel like my adventure was all for nothing. Still  , Puzzle Agent is a good game and I give it a 7/10.			"

												At first this is a decent variant on Professor Layton, but after the stovepipe puzzle, I was interested enough to finish it. The game is humourous, but not laugh out loud. It has controller support, but you're moving around a mouse cursor and there's no snapping to interface elements.The anti-pixelhunting radar ping is nice and there are tons of hint tokens (gum) if you get stuck. I didn't get stuck on many puzzles.Overall, it's a pretty good game that has a unique twist on the puzzle adventure. The puzzles are integrated into the story (not too abstract), but some are more labour than challenge (arrange the pieces to fit a zig zag).			"

In my opinion fabulous. But I have tell about three main disadvantages. Firstly the difficulty level of puzzle is very irregular and (secondly) most of them are rather easy. Finally Puzzle Agent is terribly short!! But for me it's nothing acording to whole game. Love it!! And I'm going to start playing second part, see you in Scoggins!!P.S.

The game only got a few good puzzles, and the rest are either ""get from point A to point B"", or ""rearrange the picture.""The story is ok, graphics are acceptable, and animations are minimalistic.

												An interesting little game for those who like their minds exercised. It's a point-and-click adventure game interspersed by puzzle sections that are often quite difficult. Oh, and it's an excellent horror game, and will scare your pants off better than most that claim the genre. The developer is very good at setting tone. You also get graded on how well you beat the puzzles, so if you want to go back and ace them all to show off, you can. Except for THAT PIPE PUZZLE. You'll know which one I mean. ♥♥♥♥ that puzzle, Jesus Christ, it was so good. On the whole, it's a lightweight game with an interesting premise and a solid execution.			"

												In this AAA title (No panty shots or a pretentious story, so it's certainly not an indy title) you play a FBI agent trying to brake up a union strike at a remote factory. You do this they only way you know: using armed violence and your wits. However, the union stands strong. At the end of the game you just indiscriminately shoot at the socialist strikers. In the end cinematics your boss applauds your actions, and when you ask about the casualties your boss just shrugs.

												Meh. It's got some good brain teasers in it, but the animation is slow, and I mean slow. The point and click adventure elements were a real turn off for me. I found myself just clicking through conversations because they are slow and the individual staements I can read in a second, and then you're waiting for the speaker to catch up to you. Should have forgone the voice acting and just went with text bubbles. Would have saved them a lot of time and effort, because I wasn't listening to any of it. Then you have to sit through slow animations, which is sad because the animation is not anything spectacular. The artwork is cute, but kind of looks like a blown out tattoo on larger, HD screens. For a dollar or two this might be fun to play on a road trip when you're stuck in the car, otherwise there are better puzzle games out there. I would suggest it for little kids, but the puzzles are going to be too difficult for some. The only thing I thought was itneresting about the game was the laughable amount of money the FBI is spending on solving puzzles. Basically if you get it right on the first try it only costs the tax payers a meager $75000. That's a pretty funny comment on government spending. Not worth it for tha tone joke though.			"

												It's a cute game. The game was better than I expected it to be, although i wasn't sure what to expect. The point and click interaction seems to only be there just to get you to another puzzle, but the game wouldn't be called Puzzle Agent if it didn't have a lot of puzzles. That doesn't mean it does not have a story, it does, and it's humorous. Nelson Tethers is an F.B.I. agent that was sent to the town of Scoggins to figure out what happened to the Scoggins Eraser Co. factory. He has to solve the mystery of the shutting down of the factory, the missing people, why the people of the town seem to be hiding something and all while solving puzzles. The beginning was a little slow and the puzzles seemed too easy but they started to get more challenging, which made me continue to play the game. The game started out as a comedy mystery and turned into a comedy suspense thriller. I enjoyed playing the game.			"

												It's not Professor Layton, but it's good enough to scratch that itch. Very few puzzles were overly challenging; the ones that took me the longest were repeated trial-and-error, brute-force style affairs rather than tests of logic. But if you do get stuck, the hint system is easy to use and hint currency is plentiful. I enjoyed the quirky story, setting, and art style a lot. For what it is, it's pretty good.			"

												Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of those weird Big Fish puzzle games that you can get at Wal-Mart in the discount bin for a dollar. So when my friend linked me to this game and told me ""it's like Professor Layton and the Curious Village, but the village is a wintery Twin Peaks/supernatural Fargo"" my first reaction was ""how fast can I buy this game."" If your reaction upon hearing that sentence is ""why would I ever want to play something like that"", Puzzle Agent is not for you. If your reaction is ""wow, that sounds like fun"" then let me assure you that yes, it is fun, and you should give it a try.Puzzle Agent has a lot going for it, including some pretty fun voice acting and unique ""scribbled"" characters. It's always interesting to see what clicking randomly on the screen will do in a game like this (more often than not, the game punishes you somehow for clicking aimlessly) so I was delighted to see that Puzzle Agent simply highlights clues in the immediate area. It's a simple mechanic, but really helpful for things like finding all the gum pieces. There's a lot of little things to like about Puzzle Agent - which is good, because the main plot was not my favorite. I don't want to discuss it much, because I don't feel I could discuss it without talking about the second game -- and yes, there is a second game to be aware of, the first one ends on a fairly unsatisfying note -- but... it was not my favorite. Thank goodness the puzzles are clever and the game design is sharp enough to make up for it.			"

												Puzzle Agent is an excellent puzzle game.  There are no hidden objects and no object based puzzes.  You won't be wondering how to use tape and a can opener to get past a hedge that you should just be able to walk around or having to solve any other non-intuitive object based ""puzzles"".  Instead, the puzzles you solve in the game are all logic based or can be solved with some creative thinking and the information provided.  The story is somewhat silly, but very enjoyable and humerous.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes the puzzles in puzzle games, but hates the usual time wasted wandering around, pixel hunting, or trying to combine weird objects in your inventory.   I would love to see more games like this!			"

												Played this point and click puzzle game with a friend and was suprisingly entertained. I never finish games (and I'm not much of a gamer either) but was able to make it through at my own pace. Puzzles were mixed, some pretty easy, some required thinking and some were just plain hard. Game provides hints and the story was cute and somewhat intriguing. Definitely recommended for solo play (or you know, skyping with someone and making them help you!).			"

												Professor Layton-type puzzling game with a dark, sinister edge belied by the game's cute visuals. As a puzzle game, it's solid. As a story out of equal parts Twin Peaks, Fargo, and X-Files, it's surprisingly gripping.			"

												At first this is a decent variant on Professor Layton, but after the stovepipe puzzle, I was interested enough to finish it. The game is humourous, but not laugh out loud. It has controller support, but you're moving around a mouse cursor and there's no snapping to interface elements.The anti-pixelhunting radar ping is nice and there are tons of hint tokens (gum) if you get stuck. I didn't get stuck on many puzzles.Overall, it's a pretty good game that has a unique twist on the puzzle adventure. The puzzles are integrated into the story (not too abstract), but some are more labour than challenge (arrange the pieces to fit a zig zag).			"

												This game is so bad that I created a category in my library for it, entitled ""NO!""Spend your money elsewhere. This game is really quite bad.Some of the puzzles are so ridiculously easy that they belong in a child's game. Others are just … arbitrary. I played 5 hours, which is about 4-1/2 hours too long. Thankfully, I only paid $2.50 for it. I'd give it away if I could.			"

												This is a nice little point-and-click puzzle game. The art style and sound is nice. It's somewhat comical. Puzzles range from very easy to ""HUH?!?"". The user interface could be better, including how your puzzle results are presented. Playtime around 3 hours. You can retry the puzzles if you wish, for a little more.I got this game as part of a cheap humble bundle deal. I'd suggest getting it on sale if you're into this type of games and want a short, entertaining game.			"

												This may not look too intense, but I found some puzzles reasonably tricky!  Definitely relied on the paper-and-pencil method a few times, and at one point crowd-sourced potential solutions from friendsl.  I'm not sure if this speaks more for the challenge of the game or to my inability, but either way it was enjoyable.The plot itself was..unique.  Definitely intriging.  The ending was a bit of a disappointment, but I imagine that's what sequels are for!

Then again its not called riddle agent.A cute game with a hand-drawn aesthetic, for kids though, for kids.  Certainly not ""dark and twisted"" as it claims.			"

Puzzle Agent is a point-and-click adventure game in which you play as Nelson Tethers, a puzzle agent from the FBI. You are sent to Picturesque and Historic Scoggins, a small and apparently quaint village in which everybody is obsessed with puzzles, to uncover the reason as to why the eraser factory had closed. The game has a quirky and rather dark humor at times, while the story basically took your average Nordic fairy tale and added a twist to it. The frequent puzzles that appear through the game are either very easy or take more effort to solve than you might have thought at first glance. The artstyle of images drawn by hand makes this game unique but some objects/characters feel too out of focus at times. Even if this is intentional, it just feels like no effort was put in drawing separate images for close-up scenes, and rather they just used scaled images, giving such scenes an amateurish feeling.I think this casual point-and-click adventure game deserves your time and puzzle-solving attention, the price is right and it is entertaining, even if it has some artistic errors. 9/10			"

												Puzzle Agent plays very similar to and of the Professor Layton games, multiple puzzles of varying design and difficulty linked together by a greater mystery. The puzzles themselves are different enough to keep you on your toes and satisfying when you get it right. The story itself is Twin Peaks if it was written by Stanley Kubrick, and is just interesting enough to keep you entertained and interested. My personal favorite characters beside Tethers being the unhelpful law enforcement, Sherrif Bahg and the curmodgeonly Bjorn. The art style and gameplay is the best of modern adventure gaming like Deponia and Broken Age, mixed with a classic text-based style. If you enjoy great puzzles and a suspenseful story, try out both Puzzle Agent games.			"

												Hello, I'll make a quick number out of ten for those of you just stumbling across this game and are looking for a number only. 9/10.Now that that's out of the way let's get into detail on why I personally think it's deserving of such a high set of marks. For starters I personally recommend watching one of my favorite YouTubers , and his video which convinced me to buy this game after a steady *6* re watchings of said video.

Beyond that there is always the pure gritty details of the game itself.It is a puzzle game, as the name says and this shouldn't frighten any would-be buyers from purchasing it due to complexity, in reality the puzzles are fun, some imaginative and others fairly average. All in all the puzzles are good in the sense they each tie into the story, as they should. Speaking of the story the story in my opinion is quite interesting, it has a mystique air to it that can only be unraveled by, well you the player. Your puzzle solving explains the story in depth and thus makes understanding what's going on much more plausable. I'll take the time now to apologize for any spelling errors or rather tedious boring information or even overblown details of my review as I'm currently typing this at nearly 4:00 A.M. U.S. Pacific Standard Time. Besides my rather atrociously long review I'll be sure to try to cover what I can right now A.S.A.P. (As soon as possible.)What is the story? : You are an F.B.I. agent in the Puzzle Division, and your goal is to, you guessed it solve puzzles, without spoiling anything further on that front you're asked to leave your cozy desk job to go to a town called Scoggins, as you approach the town things are very, off or even flat out strange or unnatural. This doesn't scare you away as it's your job, and so the puzzles begin. The story throughout has a very fascinating grip on you, causing fear in some puzzles and a sort of horror vibe without every in my opinion truly overstepping the boundaries, now I will admit that there is only one particular scene of this game that truly did make me feel uneasy due to how they portrayed it but it honestly would go unnoticed by many if they made it past the eighth mission.Moving on the voice acting is absolutely lovely, I love the accents of the characters differing based off of their culture or religion in some cases (I suppose you could say nationality as well but white is as white is, and everything in Scoggins is white with the exception of red.)What about the music?, I'm sorry I can't hear you over this catchy tune playing from the game could you speak up!? But in truth the music is delightful, I love the soundtrack to this game, but for the more difficult (for me) puzzles I found hearing the same loop of what I might consider an ""alright"" track to be less than charming for when you're there on that particular puzzle for fifteen or so minutes.What about gameplay?, have you ever played a Tell Tale game before?, specifically something along the lines of Poker Night at the Inventory 1-2 ? Think of that style of interface but much more smooth with a more hand drawn touch to it, it's very nice for me in my opinion.Graphics?, Do you like hand drawn looking animation with the characters skipping a little? (Not due to frames but due to art style.) Yes?, then you'll like this game, but in truth the graphics aren't entirely great, but they certainly aren't bad as the art style is at least for me, nice to look at, I never had a problem staring at anything for more than thirty minutes, but that's just me.And we'll round this all off with the story, well I'll put it to you this way, I'm a bit of an odd one as I love utterly to mess with people who have never read 1984 (By George Orwell) And saying how incredible ""The thing"" is, what is the thing you may ask? The thing is the thing that the main character, and everyone has, it is primarily known to humanity can be nearly anything, and isn't particularly difficult to guess in the right context, in fact it's so simple!, but what is it?, well if you made it over three quarters of the way through, let's just say a ""Certain building"" had our character in it, and in said certain building it was revealed what our main character's ""thing"" was, and how they used it in said building, leading up to ""The This"". What does any of that have to do with this game? Well, as it turns out this game has a ""Thing"" and this ""Thing"" is actually staring you in the face the entire game as soon as you arrive in Scoggins, just like the thing in 1984 if you don't know what it is, you actually do, but at the same time you'll go crazy trying to guess what it is, I must be coming off as a stark raving lunatic at this point but I hope someone out there found this part remotely creative or entertaining, besides my gibbering at the end I hope whoever stuck along this far in the review found me even slightly insightful on this game as I would highly recommend it to anyone I know.Oh also I'm uncertain as I haven't checked just yet but I believe there are actually many side puzzles you do not need to complete to complete the game itself, giving the game just that much more potential gaming value, I will say this if you're very clever and find this game highly entertaining you'll zoom through it in about 6 hours give or take. It's rather short, but the story is gripping to me like 1984 was.Oh also for those of you puzzle nuts out there the hint system is 3 hints, you find ""hints"" anywhere you can, and you'll find them in the most.. interesting places. I certainly hope someone enjoys my review, and to those of you who simply couldn't bare to read to this point I apologize utterly, I had a blast playing the game, and I'm going to go pass out now (Yes I typed this up after playing the game, neither my passing out or the completion of this game are connected... who left that garden ornament behind me... ? )			"

Why not.""I was not ready for what this game really was.The story is excellently told to make the rather short 3 hours it took me to complete the game feel like 12 hours, and the puzzles struck a perfect balance between being hard enough to be challenging but not so much as to be impossible. Hints are given out plentifully to help you from getting stuck, and I actually never ran out through the entire game. I cant recommend this game enough. BUY IT NOW!!!			"

												Entertaining story with some good puzzles. Be aware that some of the puzzles are very difficult - but only because there isn't enough information about what you are supposed to do. This either due to incomplete instructions, or clues that are too obscure.  THese same puzzles with correct info are not hard, just made harder from incomlete details.			"

												Puzzle agent is a pleasantly quirky concoction of mysterious adventure, smart puzzles and offbeat humor, wrapped in a refreshing 2D art style. For this user, it's reminiscent of the frosty locales and charm as seen in Northern Exposure and Fargo, where events are unexpected and ripe with personality. 8/10, or a bit higher if you enjoy the Telltale engine or aforementioned media.

												The only reason that I do not recommend this game is because it does not work well on Mac.I was really excited to play this game but on the second puzzle I came across a glitch. The logs, along with the character and the stoplights, were all behind the gridded map. I looked through threads to try & find a solution and found that the same glitch had been going on with Mac users for years now.Besides that, this game looks really enjoyable. I'd say get it on sale and hope that it works?			"

												Playing this game is like solving one of those kids puzzle magazines while watching a silly detective cartoon. Puzzles are not very original or hard and there is a built in hint system, so there is no chance you will ever get stuck. The story, characters and music are all well done, and the game was very fun. My only real complaint would be the puzzle interface, especially the part after you submit the solution, that takes you out of the game world a bit.There are some scary moments during the game, and if you like that kind of stuff, go to YouTube and check out videos by the author (grickle) like ""The Hidden People"" or ""The Webb"".

It's not very hard except several times I didn't understand the directions for solving the puzzles and I had to use up hints and submissions just to see how it worked. Elements of the story went unresolved. Replay value, none that  I can see.In my opinion, not worth the $4.99. Too short, unclear directions, unresolved story elements.			"

												This is really a puzzle game masquerading as point-and-click. There is a story here, and the bleak way in which it is presented is actually creepy as hell (protip: if you can't take jump scares then stay away!).The other side of the game consists of the ever-present puzzles, that range from pretty enjoyable to insanely hard. These are all kinds of puzzles of the kind you'd find in those puzzle magazines. Now, I don't consider myself to be a retard, but I had to use the hint system A LOT of times as some of these puzzles are REALLY hard.Also, there's a limited number of puzzles and thus practically zero replay value. IMHO it's not really worth the money.			"

												Puzzle Agent was ok. The protagonist is the top puzzle solver at the FBI and he's gotta find out why there was an explosion at a eraser factory in a remote mid-west town. The gameplay is all puzzle box format. There are minor, minor adventure elements to the game but, the story progresses by solving brain teasers. The puzzles themselves were mostly easy. Only around 10% posed any real challenge. There's a running joke where every time the solution for a puzzle is offered for verification, it shows an exorbitant running tab for how many taxpayer dollers were used to investigate the explosion. The game took around 3-4 hours to finish. This game is really geared for the younger crowd.			"

												Overall, I enjoyed the 3 hours it took to finish the game.  I am glad I picked it up from a Humble Bundle dirt cheap, would not have wanted to spend more than $2-3 to buy this.  The story is actually pretty decent, starts pretty slow and picks up nicely in the middle.  Graphics have some appeal, makes you feel like you're in the middle of a children's book. The puzzles are the main gameplay element, and unfortunately, they are also the weak point of the game.  Most puzzles are extremely easy, most having very simplistic shape-matching mechanices.  Some puzzles seem very abstract and require multilple hints to finish, since not enough information is given about how to solve them. Many times I found myself screaming at the game, ""WHY IS THAT THE ANSWER?"", simply because the puzzles can be frustratingly difficult at times.So, yeah, just buy it if you like the art style and story concept, and don't pay more than $2 for it.

However, be aware that the difficulty does not scale based on your progress in the game. Some puzzles from the beginning and half-way through the game will be much harder than some you will have to solve at the end. The end of the story is also quite abrupt to encourage (force?) you to buy Puzzle Agent 2.			"

The humor was a great way to remind us gamers to not take this game too seriously, just have fun. There were some character interaction but only to set up the puzzle.

												Puzzle Agent is a very interesting, quirky, and surprisingly creepy game that, rather appropriately, revolves around puzzles. The story is well-done, the voice acting is fantastic, the puzzles are challenging but still make sense (with a few exceptions, which I'll get to in a moment) and actually gave my brain a decent exercise. Overall, playing this game was a pretty enjoyable experience, though it's rather short-lived.There was, however, one puzzle that almost ruined the game for me: ""Menacing Map"". I'm honestly baffled as to how this one got through playtesting; the instructions are INCREDIBLY ambiguous, and I repeatedly came up with the wrong answer simply because I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do. Maybe I was just being a bit dumb, but I literally had to look up the solution. This wasn't something I had to do for any other puzzle in the game. Some of them I had trouble with, but for the most part it was because it was a genuinely challenging problem, not an ambigious mess like that.Once I got past it, though, I enjoyed the rest of the game thoroughly. I loved how wimsical and surreal everything was. The art style somehow fit the progressing tones of the story just wonderfully.7/10			"

Beat the game in two sittings, and was happy with the whole experience.Two quick notes though: The puzzles are occasionally frustrating, not because they are perticularly difficult, but because a few of them are explained in a strange way. If you plan on playing this game on mac, be aware that the sequel does not work on the mac, even though on first glace it looks like it does.

A fair number of the puzzles were 'familiar format' to me (being an old fart who's fiddled with puzzles for...*ahem* well, okay...more decades than my vanity lets me admit ;) ), so consequently I breezed right through them  - ""Yeah, yeah, but I'm the bus driver, so what do you want to know about me?"" ;)All in all, I heartily enjoyed the diversion this game provided and am just about to go buy the sequel because of my experience with this one!

												This is my preface to my review: this game is a blatant clone of Professor Layton, but much shorter, and much harder.On that note, I love it. This is the only game series I know of that uses the PL format for its puzzle solving, and it is wonderful. I wish there were more games that used the type of mystery town invaded by even more mysterious creatures. It's even better that they make the premise of puzzle obsession work. The connection between Layton's puzzle obsession and what's actually going on is weak at best, but Puzzle Agent has someone who actually solves puzzles in a town that actually has a puzzle obsession makes it even better.I would wholeheartedly reccommend buying this game, and wish for even more puzzles in the future. I played it to completion, and left feeling like an idiot, unable to comprehend even the easiest of puzzzles, and clamoring for more.			"

The story is fun, the puzzles are clever, and I liked the look and feel of the game, the Minnesota accents and the references to hot dish. Tater tot topped ground beef casserole for the win!If you're a puzzle lover...especially for visual puzzles...this is a great game for you.I give it an 8/10.			"

												Puzzle Agent 1 & 2 are rather strange games. There isn't always much sense behind the puzzles in regards to the story, but they're all simple and fun anyway. I thoroughly enjoyed these games a lot more than I thought I would. The story a bit silly, but it's all well produced. You can pick this one up and put it down again at any time. Well worth the money.			"

												Some decent puzzles in this game, but I thought the story was pretty weak. There were too many simple puzzles in the game too. I beat the game in 3.5 hours, but I'd say 30-45 minutes of that time was enjoying puzzles (particularly the logic puzzles) and the rest was reading/listening to slow dialogue and doing puzzles that I've already done at some point before (pipe puzzles, picture puzzles, path puzzles, etc.).The game wasn't bad, but I was left pretty indifferent which makes the game hard to recommend.

												LD;DRThis is one game; not two.  You should get it if you can get both games for less than five dollars.Pros- The videos will give you a feel for the game.  It is an interesting, slow paced game that has a twist here and there.- Humor is sprinkled into the game.- Getting your pen and paper out is satisfying for some of the puzzles.- The fact it costs the taxpayer so much per puzzle is both funny and realistic.- There is a resolution to the second game but there could be more (the right way to end the story).- The premise for the game is hilarious because it's realisitic.Cons- A third or more of the puzzles are completely throw away.- The first game is NOT COMPLETE.  37 puzzles and half a story is not a full game.- the second game is NOT COMPLETE 34 puzzles aand half a story is not a full game.- There should be a better way to make sure you get all the puzzles before leaving a scene.- They should cut off dialogue options that you've already heard (you can talk to the same person again and on it will repeat when they're done but that means you'll have to repeat dialogue at least once per person per situation to make sure you hear everything they have to say.)Tips- Always look carefully at the images behind numbers or other puzzles, they can provide clues.

Puzzle agent combines 38 puzzles with approximately 20 of those being derivatives of easy to solve puzzle variations ( rotate the tile, direct via reflection, organize click into place pieces, etc.). If you want some decent humor and coherent story, puzzle agent will satisfy. If you want difficult or challenging puzzles across a variety of styles, you will be disappointed.			"

												I got this game for one dollar in a Humble Bundle, so I can't really complain about the content I got for the price.That being said, I played the crap out of Professor Layton. This is not Professor Layton. This game makes you assume - a lot. There were puzzles that took me ages to do, because I didn't understand the instructions. Games in particular: the arm wrestling one, the crow-counting one, the fish-key one. These were insanely difficult for me, because the instructions were unclear. I'm typically a completionist when it comes to puzzle games like this. ""Aw ♥♥♥♥, I messed up, I'll just redo it."" No, you have to restart the entire game in order to get a perfect ranking. Nah, no thanks. You can pick up hints in the from of gum, which is available arbitrarily and everywhere. Go into a diner, get gum, leave diner, go to woods, get gum, leave woods, go back to diner, get more gum. It kind of defeats the purpose of having a finite, countable amount of hints, when they're infinite. Why bother toughing out a battle with little health when you have 30 potions and that chest replenishes potions when you leave the room?Also, super did not appreciate the jump scares. What the ♥♥♥♥. Why would you put jump scares in a puzzle game. It only happened a few times, but enough to make me aggrivated. I get it, it's spooky atmosphere. You don't have to rip me away from the middle of a puzzle to make it creepy. If the puzzle would have been weird in some way, and then something happen, cool, whatever, but having me pluckin away at something and then for a single frame, a face appear - nah. I'm good.Really worth the less-than-a-dollar I spent on it. Not really worth the price of a sandwich.			"

												I hate to be torn between yes & no for recommendation here - it really does depend on your tastes!Why have I leaned towards no?The puzzles felt out of placed and forced for the most part.Overall, the game is entertaining - a quirky story, puzzles which make you think - but are accessible to any level of puzzler.Very minor spoilers (specific puzzle descriptions - NOT solutions/clues) below.Several of the puzzles were a little obtuse - you needed to make assumptions beyond the information presented to you.Other puzzles were a little repetitive - by the third snow sled, I was losing the will to play for a while.Some puzzles felt just plain out of place - again I am looking at you, Mr. Snow Sled - why on earth would I run around moving logs to get the snow sled along the track that I just moved the logs through? Even if I need the sled at the destination, I wouldn't need to go back through the tracks as I've already followed them putting the logs out!Finally, some just feel plain wrong - arranging a bunch of items to exactly fill the mouth of a furnace, so that it can breath fire out of the hole suddenly?The final puzzle is highly entertaining though, but far too short!I will launch into the sequal soon, and am hoping some of the problems may be overcome.

												This game is a really fun puzzle game reminiscent of the Professor Layton series in play style (point & click) with an overyling investigation constituting the plot and puzzles strewn throughout. The game has an interesting story, but a pretty short play time, probably about two hours or so. The only problem I had with this game was that a few puzzles had complex rules that forced you to switch to a different screen to see them. It would have been nice to be able to access these rules while still seeing the active puzzle. All in all, if you're a fan of this type of game, I highly recommend it. I personally look forward to playing the sequel.			"

Puzzles are not very original or hard and there is a built in hint system, so there is no chance you will ever get stuck. The story, characters and music are all well done, and the game was very fun. My only real complaint would be the puzzle interface, especially the part after you submit the solution, that takes you out of the game world a bit.There are some scary moments during the game, and if you like that kind of stuff, go to YouTube and check out videos by the author (grickle) like ""The Hidden People"" or ""The Webb"".

												A game that is truly inique.I personally love stories and themes of stuff being seemingly normal but having something slightly ''off'', subtly weird about them. Now Puzzle Agent NAILS that. Great story and characters, brought to life with excellent art (done by the artist behind Grickle) and equally excellent voice acting!As for the gameplay, I would say it's an adventure game but without the BS. No stupid inventory puzzles, it's just conversations and good logic puzzles. Logic. The puzzles are really great and most of the time aren't mind bogglingly hard so don't be scared! The game does a great job of making you figure it out by using sense.All in all it is a great experience, and I'd say it's worth it for any price, let alone the 90 cents I paid for it.

												This is my preface to my review: this game is a blatant clone of Professor Layton, but much shorter, and much harder.On that note, I love it. This is the only game series I know of that uses the PL format for its puzzle solving, and it is wonderful. I wish there were more games that used the type of mystery town invaded by even more mysterious creatures. It's even better that they make the premise of puzzle obsession work. The connection between Layton's puzzle obsession and what's actually going on is weak at best, but Puzzle Agent has someone who actually solves puzzles in a town that actually has a puzzle obsession makes it even better.I would wholeheartedly reccommend buying this game, and wish for even more puzzles in the future. I played it to completion, and left feeling like an idiot, unable to comprehend even the easiest of puzzzles, and clamoring for more.			"

												With about 4 hours worth of gameplay and a total of 60 (I think) puzzles, Puzzle Agent is an interesting little game which can keep boredom away on a rainy afternoon.The art direction and the voice acting go perfectly together, creating a delightful atmosphere, which combined with the captivating story will, most probably, leave you wanting some more. In terms of puzzles, I can't say they are hard at all, but they're more like entertaining brain teasers. Most puzzles take about 10 mintues to complete, and you can always use a hint if you're stuck. Unfortunately, one problem is that in some puzzles the rules aren't exactly clear, meaning you probably won't get it right from first try, hurting your stats. Aside from that the game is really good for its price and is worth a try if you are a fan of the genre or want a short and gripping story.			"

Basically, I really liked this game. However, it is quite a short game and doesn't really need more than two playthroughs. This being the case, some people might not be happy to pay £3.99 for it (although actually I think it was going for more than that last time I checked). I bought this game as part of bundle (ths also included the sequel, which is shaping up to be quite good) and so I was satisfied with my purchase.

												TLDR: Get this if you like solving logic puzzles. Worth the price and is often on sale.Puzzle Agent is a nice short game where you spend most of the time doing puzzles which are somewhat related to the plot. Each puzzle is preceded by an explanation and then once you think you've solved it, you submit the puzzle. This way you really need to use logic rather than just trying to solve things randomly. There is a hint system if you find yourself stuck.The Good Good mix of puzzles, with some of them being optionalUnique art styleGood voice actingNo inventory, so no ""try everything with everything until something works"" approach.In game hint system, so no need to use a walkthroughInteresting story, with a real creepy vibeThe BadDialogue text advances with the speech, so even if you are a fast reader, you can't really move things along much fasterUnskippable cutscenes, including one that plays each time you submit a puzzle, and the end creditsSome puzzles are super easy, and some of them have instructions that are hard to understand, but mostly the difficulty is OKGame ends with sequel bait (something that TellTale loves to do), and no real answers are given to the story "

												Extremely silly in the best sense.  Wonderful story with lots of ridiculousness, fun graphics, and unpredictable puzzles.  With such a wide variety of mini games/puzzles, they're definitely a bit hit-or-miss.  Luckily, the point-and-click aspects of the game more than make up for it. Feels more like a cartoon version of something by David Lynch than a traditional pnc adventure. Definitely would reccomend, and in fact already have!			"

												This game and it's successor (Puzzle Agent 2) feel like a mixture of Fargo, Professor Layton and a charming graphic novel. If you like puzzles and comedic, gloomy, criminal stories then give this game a try. Short and entertaining, the ideal thing for the evening or a rainy weekend :-)			"

Why is the factory locked up?  Where did the foreman go?It's a fun little story with some puzzles to solve.  Just be prepared to pick up the sequel if you want the conclusion to the story.			"

Recommended for beginners of the puzzle and adventure genre, but also for veterans who are open to new presentation styles and self-referential genre humor packed into a quirky story around a federal agent of the FBI Puzzle Research Division!

												""Puzzle Agent"" is a quite short but entertaining puzzle/adventure mix that lets you be Agent Tethers who has to solve a mysterious case about what seems to be an accident in an eraser factory. Or was it even an accident as everyone says?The game is pretty much all about solving puzzles - some easy, some pretty tricky - and the rest is changing locations, taking a look at suspicious objects, picking up gums (you'll need gums as ""puzzle hint providers"") and asking characters a few questions. You can't die in the game or let a ""Game Over"" end it but every puzzle you solve influences the costs on the US-American taxpayers and your reputation as a puzzle agent, it's a kind of work record (so the less tries and hints you need to solve a puzzle the better agent you are obviously). So despite of the crime elements in the story it's more a relaxing than a stressing puzzle game but that doesn't say that the story is boring.The story is sometimes suspenseful and sometimes funny so it helps to keep you on the puzzles.The sketchy graphics may seem unfinished or unusual but they still look fine and especially the unique character designs (done by Graham Annable who also co-directed the Oscar-nominated animated movie ""The Boxtrolls"") make the game. The music is great, the melodies will certainly stick in your head but for good reasons and they support the sinister atmosphere. As I said it is quite a short game but if you have a few bucks to spend and you want a little adventure game to challenge your brain cells this game is for you. Personally, I already plan to buy the sequel in the near future.			"

												Fun little game, reminds me of Proffessor Layton although i found the puzzles easier. The hint system has its perks,  there were one or two puzzles that i just didnt enjoy and after a hint or two it practically gave me the answer. Having said that knowing there was an easy out probably lessened my motivation to try as hard as i could have.The art style and characters are brilliant and funny (I really wish the US Department of Puzzle Research existed because i'd totally work there) and it has the right story to puzzle ratio. The length of the game really depends on your puzzle solving ability. I got through in about 4 hours and paid £3.99, i would say good value for money. Looking forward purchasing and playing Puzzle Agent 2			"

I also like the click to highlight interaction spots mechanic which avoids the tedium of the old adventure pixel hunt.			"

												Puzzle Agent is one of the most enjoyable Telltale games that I've played through because it achieves exactly what it sets out to do and does so in a very entertaining manner. It doesn't stand on a terribly strong story, though its strange atmosphere and Twin Peaks feel sets a wonderful tone, it stands on the writing, fun humor, and wonderfully engaging series of puzzles it offers the player. The game is summed up succinctly as a series of varying puzzles loosely tied together with a very strange and intriguing narrative. The puzzles themselves include logic, spatial, mathematical, and visual, and they increase in difficulty as the game continues. None of the puzzles are overly difficult, and there are plenty of hints for those seeking to play through casually. Highly recommended for puzzle gamers, curious point and click fans, and anyone interested in something unique and fun.			"

												At first this is a decent variant on Professor Layton, but after the stovepipe puzzle, I was interested enough to finish it. The game is humourous, but not laugh out loud. It has controller support, but you're moving around a mouse cursor and there's no snapping to interface elements.The anti-pixelhunting radar ping is nice and there are tons of hint tokens (gum) if you get stuck. I didn't get stuck on many puzzles.Overall, it's a pretty good game that has a unique twist on the puzzle adventure. The puzzles are integrated into the story (not too abstract), but some are more labour than challenge (arrange the pieces to fit a zig zag).			"

												Telltale delivers a bracing shot of thoughtfully crafted adventure-puzzle fare, with a terrific Lucasarts-meets-Lynch vibe... droll like Day of the Tentacle shrinkwrapped by the Coen brothers whilst reading the Sunday funnies. Ominous, obscure and dipping its big toe into the oneiric, this indie “pilot” whets the appetite for more of Agent Tethers’ bumbling proficiency, and some answers to the menacing perplexities of Scroggins, MN and its sundry inhabitants. PA1’s score and voice acting are top-notch and Brad Neely webisode worthy; the gameplay—if a bit simple—is well-paced, brisk, and surprisingly organic, given the strictures of graduating from static puzzle to static puzzle. Further episodes should endeavor to develop and differentiate the puzzle mechanics.PA’s concept, vibe, and production values add up to the kind of brief but fully-envisioned storytelling experience that indies are best-suited to deliver. Toothsome, weird, and recommended.			"

												It's a cute game. The game was better than I expected it to be, although i wasn't sure what to expect. The point and click interaction seems to only be there just to get you to another puzzle, but the game wouldn't be called Puzzle Agent if it didn't have a lot of puzzles. That doesn't mean it does not have a story, it does, and it's humorous. Nelson Tethers is an F.B.I. agent that was sent to the town of Scoggins to figure out what happened to the Scoggins Eraser Co. factory. He has to solve the mystery of the shutting down of the factory, the missing people, why the people of the town seem to be hiding something and all while solving puzzles. The beginning was a little slow and the puzzles seemed too easy but they started to get more challenging, which made me continue to play the game. The game started out as a comedy mystery and turned into a comedy suspense thriller. I enjoyed playing the game.			"

												The game is just full of logical puzzles; if you like that, then you will probably like this game. I could also imagine this would be a good educational game for those with school children.The game has a number of different types of logical puzzles and you will find that you will solve some types of puzzles easier than others. The puzzles are varied and the difficulty seems pretty constant throughout the game. In saying that, when you encounter the same type of puzzle again, it will be more difficult than the last time you solved that type of puzzle.The little bit of humour in the game's story stopped it from being boring. I did enjoy the game and, as you can see, it can be beaten in 6 hours.As much as I liked the game, there were a couple of things that annoyed me a little:*  There is a mechanic that allows you to discover items to interact on the screen. The game doesn't introduce this and it could easily have done this at the start. *  I found a handful of the puzzles very hard to solve. A couple of puzzles were actually difficult, but I think the instructions were not clear enough on the others.  "

												Pros- Dry humor- Creepy story- Suspensful musicCons- Sometimes vague puzzle rules- Have to go away from a puzzle to see it's rules- No ability to skip a puzzle if you really can't figure it out- Hints are often unhelpful or I couldn't find it in me to be intersted enough in the suspense of the story and how it was going to end to put up with the cons of the game.

												Think Professor Layton meets Twin Peaks.  You play Nelson Tethers, FBI Agent, who is dispatched to a small town to investigate a disturbance in their eraser factory.  This game lifts Layton's point & click adventure with non-sequitur puzzles almost entirely, right down to a town full of puzzle obsessed residents.  Even for those who like Layton (like me), nobody gets that excited to solve a sliding block puzzle, so don't get too excited about the gameplay.  Where the game shines, much like Layton, is in its presentation.  Puzzle Agent has a beautiful pastel artstyle, a haunting soundtrack, and a bizarre story that is very reminiscent of Twin Peaks. Like all good point & click adventure games, Puzzle Agent sets you in a story with interesting characters you want to talk to, and locales you want to explore.  Any David Lynch fan will appreciate the way it blends comedy of the absurd with dark and disturbing themes.  The game is short (4 hours), but certainly worth $5 for adventure fans.			"

												First, I love puzzle games and any game where you have to think rather than just shoot everything that moves.  But puzzles need to be intuitive or, if not intuitive, the rules should be easy to understand.  That is where this game goes off the rails.  The puzzles are all over the spectrum from really easy to really hard.  There isn't a series of progressively more difficult puzzles.  I like the humor of the game and the graphics style is minimalist and clever.  It would seem they spent more time on the looks and not the puzzles which is a shame.  I bought this for a couple of bucks during the holiday sale and still feel cheated.			"

The only big complaint that I have with Puzzle Agent is that there was not enough balls to the wall puzzle action. That being said, I'm writing this immediately after finishing  this game, knowing full well that there is a second one available. I'll probably be eating these words soon.

												No need to fear, PUZZLE AGNET is hear. Puzzle Agent is a game about, you guessed it, an agent that solves puzzles. Ok my discription is a bit shallow but it is the truth. The game starts out by introducing us to our protagonist, Agent Nelson Tethers of the Department of Puzzle Solving. You start off bye doing a puzzle and you get a message that an eraser factory has closed and you need to get it back open. When you get there you realize that things arn't that ordinary. Past this point in the story i'll be giving out spoilers so I guess I can stop hear. Gameplay wise, it's a point and click adventure puzzle game. You go around, find answers, and solve PUZZLES. Even though it sound light heartened the game has an air of mystery to it and can even feel dark. The story is so good that I listened to every line of dialouge. Even though this game is humorous it still keeps a dark and mysterious tone. The visuals were pleasing and the story was good. My only complaint is that the ending seems shallow and kind of hollow. It made me feel like my adventure was all for nothing. Still  , Puzzle Agent is a good game and I give it a 7/10.			"

Not only does it present a nice variety of puzzles (from jigsaw puzzles to logic puzzles), the voice acting and overall style of the game is also really well done. It is also much more unsettling than a game about a bumbling puzzle agent has any right to be. I will have nightmares of those red gnomes for days!Pick it up during a sale if you like puzzle games.

												It's not Professor Layton, but it's good enough to scratch that itch. Very few puzzles were overly challenging; the ones that took me the longest were repeated trial-and-error, brute-force style affairs rather than tests of logic. But if you do get stuck, the hint system is easy to use and hint currency is plentiful. I enjoyed the quirky story, setting, and art style a lot. For what it is, it's pretty good.			"

												So I finished this game and I have mixed feelings on it.  First off, it is a Professor Layton rip-off, no question.  If you like the Professor Layton games, you might like this.  It doesn't have the same feel to it that the Layton games do, it's darker and sillier.  The cut scenes and dialogue is fun though.  Second off, through the whole game my mouse was extremely laggy - which may have been due to the fact that I played it on an old computer with a limited amount of storage space, look at other reviews to make sure its not the game.  Thirdly, the game was fun, the puzzles were decent, but the story felt like it ended abruptly.  There is a part 2, I imagine it continues the story, though I wish the whole thing was one game - though for the price it's fair I think.  Give it a try if you like puzzles games, take it for what it is.			"

There is a wide range of puzzles to play ranging from logic puzzles to jigsaw style puzzles.  The only real drawbacks are some of the puzzle instructions could be clearer and it is a pretty short game.  I finished it in 5 hours.  It left me wanting more which is good that there is a sequel!

												Bought this game on a recommendation and played it in a night. It's a very quick, charming game, with an intriguing plot. Though the plot is somewhat whimsical, laying somewhere between Twin Peaks and Gravity Falls, it often does feel quite heavy and is always driving. The plot threads reveal themselves nicely, and the atmosphere, sometimes humorous and sometimes ominous, is well delivered. However, I do think the game lacks resolution and feels like it drops a lot of what is happening very suddenly. Perhaps this is all addressed in the sequel? Still, I can't quite decide if the lack of resolution is affective or disaffecting.Furthermore, this game is basically fully animated and voice acted with a unique look and feel. The acting is mostly good going on great. The choppy, sketchy animation style is tonally versatile and a pleasure to look at - furthermore the occasional moments of typical Paradox 3d visuals fit quite nicely.Perhaps most importantly, the puzzles are often very fun, but sometimes initially ambiguously worded. They do ramp up in difficulty from simplistic to quite challenging, but I never found the puzzles annoying.So, overall, very fun, incredibly intriguing game, much in the vein of Myst. Definitely worth it.			"

												7/10 This game is so hilarious with its numerous references to Twin Peaks. It even joked about the gum on the walls! If you're a fan of the show, I'd recommend it just for the laughs. However... some of the puzzles were confusing at times, because the instructions were either vague or misleading. I would recommend purchasing it on sale for a rainy day. Not the most amazing because of some kinks in the puzzles themselves, but worth well worth playing for anyone who enjoys point and click puzzle games based off pop culture references.			"

												Puzzle Agent is a basic linear adventure story, well drawn, well voiced, and well scripted, with the occasional traditional logic puzzle tossed in to break it up a bit. It is a visually pleasant piece and the story is enjoyable and a tad quirky. For the most part, I would recommend this game. I had fun. And really that's what it is all about- having fun. Something light, something quaint, something you can do in a night.My only three complaints were: 1. You run through the exact animation for every solution submission for every single puzzle. Your answer is ""submitted"" in an envelope (couple seconds), a rubber stamp tells you if you were correct or not (couple seconds), and in there somewhere it tells you how much money it cost the government (few seconds), and how many hints you used (couple seconds) and so on (seconds seconds seconds) until you get your score and ranking and are finally allowed to continue (more seconds). Those seconds really added up and after a few puzzles they began to really drag on me. Around puzzle 10 I decided to wisely use that time waiting for the animation to finish by doing other things. Like read War and Peace. Sing 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall. Build a lifesize model of the Ark. Take a power nap. 2. The jigsaw puzzle based games had a tight snap, meaning I could grab one piece and kinda jiggle it around the other pieces and the puzzle would eventually put itself together in just a few seconds. I discovered this trick when I was frustratedly shoving a piece out of the way to get to a piece underneath, and the stupid piece  just kept getting connecting to other pieces and being more in the way until it just solved itself. This trick was also how I managed to solve the gear puzzle faster than the animation squence notifying me of my score. And I am not be sarcastic when I say that.3. However the other puzzles were also easy. Very easy. I did find a work around by drinking an intoxictating amount of alcohol but that probably isn't the best solution, nor even remotely advisable, for underaged players. If you don't mind only having a mild challenge or if you are newish to logic puzzles, then really the level of difficulty probably isn't going to be an issue for you at all.			"

												And excellent game with an interesting art style and a quirky story that is like a parody of an X-Files episode.  The puzzles aren't terribly difficult, but they will take time to solve, so don't be impatient.  Nothing like 7th Guest level of difficulty, this is clearly intended to be a more casual game.  Your character cannot die, so you should move around and check out every lead presented.  It is only at the end that you can mess up, and if you do, you will be given as many ""do-overs"" as are necessary to finish the game.  That last part is the only one that departs from thoughtful puzzles to pointless clicking, which is a bit irritating but not impossible to overcome.  My hope is that, eventually, they will release a third Puzzle Agent game.  Yes, it is that good.			"
