												Damn, they really delivered. If you liked the old games even a little bit you are going to love Tesla Effect. This is pure fan service and a pretty awesome game. It's nice to be back on Chandler Avenue. I love it. Pros:- Humor- Entertaining story and characters- Awesome FMVs- Cool locationsCons:- In game graphics not really up to date			"

												Just like old times.Can't remember the last modern game that had FMV (maybe C&C series).  The video and composite green screening was very well done.  Film was shot on a Canon C100 and the quality was just right.  It is so fresh to have an old technology.Acting was terribly great!Story was fun and tied things together.Great homages to all past games.Puzzles were fun but in my taste too easy for a Tex game.Fun easter eggs.Fair amount of gameplay, but could always ask for more.At some point will try some of the other game paths.  There are 5 possible endings, which always makes a game fun to play again.The success of this game should show that FMV is no longer a dead technology; quality video and compositing should open up a world of interactive fiction/non-fiction.  I expect to see another Tex and really hope others try to borrow from this design.			"

												WOW what a GAME!I played the originals back in the 90's?.  This is just fantastic old school gaming.  There is a magic about these types of games that are missing from todays games.  The 3d environments are not that great at all and probably the bigger issue is seeing peoples eyes move as they are reading the ""Q"" cards during the investigation scenes (which is unfortunate).  But that does NOT matter here.  This game HOOKS you and wants you to keep going.  I miss these types of games, and I hope this brings back (if nothing else) a niche resurgence.  Be it FMV or great story-telling adventures.  I just can't believe how much I forgot what it was like to care about a game I am playing.   THANK YOU TO THE TEX MURPHY TEAM!  WELL DONE!			"

												The only game where I've audibly cheered at the ending was a game I had bought my non-game-playing father for his birthday, Under A Killing Moon, on CD-ROM back in the 90's. He never played it, but I did. I'm 41 now. This game brought it all back with such a great fedora-tip to the golden age of FMV games and Tex Murphy fans alike ('It sure is good to have the ol' Muyph back!') Now that I've finished the game and my brain isn't stimulated by puzzles and witty banter, I sadly go back to my FPS killing and sigh and wish I was booting up Tesla effect again for the first time. It's a great experience for Tex fans or newcomers, I'm so glad you guys got the chance to come back for one more hurrah and thank you so much! (I didn't know about the Kickstarter or I would have chipped in!) Also, whichever one of you is the conspiracy-nut you did a great job on the Tesla research, good stuff. p.s. Tesla Effect FMV trailer is best trailer.			"

												What can I say? It's good to be back on Chandler Avenue! For Tex fans, this is a brilliant addition, lots of references to earlier games, and all the old characters you loved. Things have changed on Chandler Avenue, but not by much. It's great to revisit and explore. The gameplay is pretty much unchanged, except faster, less load times and the addition of a torch to show sparkles, if you need it (on casual mode). The hint system is still intact, and the game elements remain the same - point and click, with mini puzzles and a lot of diaglogue and cut scenes. This is perhaps the easiest entry in the series, but while not mentally challenging, it is highly enjoyable. The story is gripping, the mystery very well written, and the locations a joy to explore. I cannot recommend this highly enough. Especially on sale - buy it :-)			"

												I had never even heard of Tex Murphy before getting this game in a bundle. The last game that came out before this one came out when I was eight years old and we didn't even own a computer at that point in time, so I was completely clueless about the series before getting it in my library. I read about and thought it sounded interesting and like a relatively quick game so I downloaded it first to give it a try.I am so happy that I did. It is so much fun and now I definitely want to check out the rest of the serious when I have some extra money. It was funny and kept my interest for the entire time it took me to finish it. Of course there were things I didn't understand and there were several call backs to the other games in the series that meant almost nothing to me but they weren't a vital part of the game and it didn't really take away from gameplay. It was a nice little insight into the series and a brilliant ploy to make me want to buy more.The game feels dated. It's graphics aren't the best and who really used FMV like that anymore? But that's the beauty of it. Tex is an old-fashioned man in the future and this game is much the same. To be honest, it's refreshing. There are actual characters in this game, not just flashy designs to distracts you from how boring everyone is.Of course being a puzzle game, it can become an exercise in frustration. I played on gamer mode which disabled all of the hints and the ability to skip puzzles. Some of the objects you have to find are ridiculously small and without the flashlight hint it can take awhile to find them amongst all the background clutter. And  the last puzzle of the game is enough to make you want to tear your hair out. But in general, I enjoyed the game all the way through.			"

												I had no idea what FMV games are previously to playing Tesla Effect. I also had no idea who Tex Murphy is. Anyway, I really enjoyed it and can hardly wait to get my hands onto other similar games. This game just left me thinking why on Earth it isn't more popular. It's got all the right ingredients: lots of jokes and humorous lines (puns and ""dad jokes"" all over, enjoyable even when cheesy or goofy), a quite interesting storyline (a bit childish at points but still decent), intricate puzzles for those looking for a challenge that can be quickly turned into reasonable puzzles for those that prefer a more relaxed approach, and best of all, the FMV part!... Nowadays there's no way a CGI-designed character (NPC or whatever) could look anywhere close to real humans played by actors. And this makes the game so immersive and captivating. Yeah, the acting is a bit awkward here and there, but I wasn't expecting Oscar performances anyway. And some characters are actually well-played (and I loved Jodi Russell's smile - the actress playing Taylor Lamintz). The overall graphic quality was pretty good as well. The hint (Smart Alex) system is well-done too. There are even multiple endings based on the choices you made throughout the game.I guess the only left to blame is the lack of attention and care from the publisher. They could've add some features like steam achievements, steam trading cards, some leaderboards, they could've made some proper ad campaigns and whatnot. I mean, it's quite a shame this game is rather obscure at the moment. I know it needed a kickstarter campaign to be funded and become reality, and I know it's a game that mostly claims to be made ""for gamers and not for money"", but still... And yeah, it's as cool as this trailer depicts it:

												Strange game - but in a ""positive"" way. Feels like an interactive Trash-Movie from the 80's. Funny Characters & a lot of humour - but on the other side, there are a few lengthy passages. Especially, the beginning and the last 10-20%, including the end. But on Balance, it entertained me (~8 hours playtime). So if you're able to enjoy those kind of movies & humour, i suggest you should get it when it's on a steam sale.			"

												5 out of 10. Add 3 points if you are a fan of Tex Murphy, you like FMVs or you plan to play this on casual mode otherwise steer clear.There are two difficulties in the game, Casual and Gamer, my impressions are from playing the game in Gamer, in my opinion this game was made with Casual in mind.This is a ""point and click"" adventure game that sadly is full to the brim with two particular adventure game tropes; item & pixel hunting.Almost EVERY puzzle of this game is about finding out of place items, particularly small ones.It gets very frustrating, specially when a particular section requires you to literally hunt tiny broken pieces to assemble a symbol and STILL every other puzzle afterwards is the same ""find hidden items in the environment"" until the end.Unlike other adventure games before it, puzzles don't have two or more ways to solve and they don't particularly require much deduction to figure them out, either you have that screwdriver or you haven't found it.The game becomes more of a visual novel if you play it in casual mode, since your flashlight will highlight items in the environment and you can skip puzzles. There are choices to be made that will change your story and Tex's relationships, other choices won't change the story but it is fun to go back to them and see the reactions to the different decisions in glorious High Resolution FMV.

												This is my first FMV game. The game is similar to a point-and-click adventure wherein you explore your environment, pick up stuff, combine, and then use to solve puzzles, however you are in a first person view, using WSAD to move.I was genuinely entertained during the first half of the game, but as I went along, the puzzles seem to be drawn out, and items are scattered on the map on some of the most obscure places possible.I cranked up the brightness to the max in order to even SEE all corners of the rooms - there is a flashlight but it is very time consuming to sweep every inch of the map.This process is very tedious and for me it takes away from the fun of the game - I barely stayed because I wanted to see the ending to this Tex Murphy Adventure. The cheesy down-to-his-luck private investigator storyline made me hang on and finish the game.I recommend this to the fans of the genre. Other adventure fans, pick up when it's on a bundle (like I did) or when it's on sale.			"

												A great reboot of a long lost genre of games. Adventure FMV games were at their height in the mi-90’s as CD-ROM’s were becoming a popular option in desktop PC’s. While a great deal of these games contributed greatly to killing the genre, it had its merits and gems, with the Tex Murphy series being a clear stand-out. However, did the series deserve a second life? Upon it's 2014 release, and 20 years later, Tex Murphy's back and it’s rather refreshing to encounter in a sea of modern military shooters, generic game mechanics and poor story telling. While the graphics are slightly below modern standard, the actors have aged (some better than most) and the medium dead, it is a thrilling ride with great narrative, funny dialogue and challenging quests and puzzles, it is proof that games can still be creative, entertaining and intelligent.In an era were games are judges by sales figures, it is a great relief to see a game that journeys back to when they were made for gamers and not for profit. A lesson to where the industry should have been headed instead of what we have now.			"

												The full motion videos are amazing. Even though some actors aren't Hollywood-class professionals, I can enjoy them all. Chris Jones as Tex Murphy did an amazing job! The soundtrack is amazing from the start to the end. Some puzzles are challenging, but they also can get repetitive and irritating because of small little things that are easy to miss. I pre-ordered this game at full price and haven't regretted my choice. I would give this game 4/5 stars. Don't even hesitate buying it, just do it.What a great game.			"

												Tex Murphy was a FMV (full-motion video with real actors) point-and-click adventure series back in 1990. I did not play previous games back then, so this is a newcomer review.The idea of playing the role of a private detective in a cyberpunk world with a bit of humor is interesting, but the game has its flaws.- First of all, there are many reminiscences to previous games. They are supposed to touch the hearts of the series veterans, but looked out of place for me. The same can be said about most of the game - many things feel out of place (for example you are in a cyberpunk city, ok, and then you're solving ancient Egyptian puzzles all of a sudden) but I heard it has this cheesy feeling on purpose since all the games were designed like this. Not a design I like, but whatever.- The story was also a bit hard to follow for me, a couple of times I struggled to understand what I just uncovered while Tex acted like it is clear as day for him. I don't think I could tell you the uncovered story from start to finish even if I wanted to. Perhaps it makes more sense to those who played previous games.- Graphics outside video sequences are so-so (Unity engine), but they are light years ahead of previous games of course. I don't think I have the strength of will to play the previous ones if navigation there is represented via static images like in old Myst.In spite of these cons, I'd recommend this game if you like detective stories and adventures.+ FMV with real actors looks good in Full HD.+ Gameplay with finding clues and combining things is good if you like adventure games. Puzzles are manageable (I resorted to walkthrough just a couple of times, there is also a casual playing mode where you can skip puzzles if you don't like them).+ There are multiple endings, too bad I didn't get the things as I wanted In the end (so-so ending without love and such). Choices that lead you to one or another are rather obscure (this is not so good).Overall, I recommend playing it if you like point-and-click adventures and don't mind the cheesy setting. For veterans of the series it is a must buy I presume. "

												One of the best video game movies you will ever play / see. I've been a fan of Tex Murphy adventures since Mean Streets (coincidentally one of the first PC games I played). I loved Martian Memorandum, Under a Killing Moon, Pandora's Directive and Overseer. They all drew me in with their story line. This one does NOT disappoint. The narrative pathing (i.e., different endings based on decisions you make in the game) are great. The game play is fun, but if you hate puzzles, I recommend the Casual Gamer mode so you can skip the puzzles if you want. And there are quite a few brain-teasing puzzles. Thankfully, the only one I got stuck on (a sliding puzzle) was not mandatory to complete the game. My only real complaint is that you can go entire hours without having a situation where you can die, so you're constantly moving around and clicking on stuff without fear. Then all of a sudden, there's something that can kill you and you walk right up to it without the game making you aware (you have to actually click on it for the game to tell you that it can kill you). This only matters if you care about reaching the highest award the game offers as a Detective. Other than that, you can die as many times without repercussion. Pros:-Great story line, must see/play!-Puzzles can be funCons:-Can get frustrating trying to solve a puzzle (I recommend Googling a guide if you get stuck)-Can get frustrating trying to find a missing object (again, Google a guide if you get stuck)-Some of the puzzles are so complicated that you need to Google just how to complete them (Auxiliary Power reactor puzzle was one of them I did not understand how to work)-Can die without notice. -Not much replay value. Once you complete it, you can check out the other endings on YouTube.			"

And I have to say, I REALLY enjoyed it. Yes the graphics can feel a bit dated despite it being released in 2014, but the atmosphere, and the FMV sequences... are just fanastic.

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure 

			Views: 450		

			Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure is a detective adventure FMV experience on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/261510/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing:...		

	Tesla Effect is an adventure game in a full motion video style, meaningthere are real actors in the game.  This is a converational heavy detective gamethat embraces its corniness.  The music and the effects do a good job to tie the game together.  You play as Tex Murphy, and intrepid detective who is tryingto regain his memory.  The conversation and the story move forward in a linearmanner, and while you have different responses that you can give, there is littleimpact on the base outcome. 	The story and the voice acting are done very well, and while the humorous undertones are entertaining, this would almost be a game that is moreenjoyable to watch as a Let's Play rather than to go through yourself.  Itcomes accross as more of a movie than a game.  	The player has a limited interaction with the environment, and some of the puzzles are more simplistic such as scavenger hunts rather than puzzles that challege your intellect.  There was no failure state in the game; combinedwith the auto save, this means that even if you make the wrong decision and ""die"", there is no problem because the game will just reload at the most recentsave spot.  	It's not a bad game, just heavy in cinematics, and limited in what choices you can make and in what order.  I was hoping for more of a detectiveelement in the game instead of an interactive adventure.  The game holds yourhand, and doesn't respect your time.  If you're looking for a low pressure,no stress game, this could be good, but for anybody else who wants to play adetective game and feel like a detective, I cannot recommend it. This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:http:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												This is a very weak recommendation.It's great to see the entire cast of the old Text Murphy games back again.  The story is pretty good too, and the acting seems to have improved.  It's is based on an old Tex Murphy novel that begins right at the end of Overseer.  To explain the plot would be to give away the small twist thats right at the beginning of the story.  Suffice to say, the mythology is based on Tesla's work.Unfortunately they also brought back the scavenger hunts from the old games that really make it not so fun to play.  When you finally give in the towel on a puzzle and look up the solution, only to find you missed something laying under a newspaper that was supposed to look like a wheel, behind a building with absolutely no hint that it was there, it makes the game not so much fun.  Now you realize you have to scan every single inch of every single location to make sure you haven't missed any inventory items.Even with the magic flash light that makes things you can interact with sparkle, it's only slightly more bearable.  Primarily because the sparkles don't show up very well in the flashlights beam.Also there are some puzzles in the form of simple brain teasers that seemed very out of place and lazily thrown in just to have a game with more puzzles.  Today's games have puzzles that are organic to the story.  Tex Murphy still lives in a world where people throw in Magic 15 puzzles to lock doors.So if you liked the old Tex Murphy games, I would recommend this.  Just make sure you play on casual so you can use the hint system and even then, you might want to keep a walkthrough handy.			"

												Fantastic, everything you could expect from a Tex Murphy game and more.  The only downside are the relatively low-res textures in the 3D environment, however the ""Full Motion Video"" is top notch and extremely high quality. The game control is simple and intuitive, and there are  a multiple of conversation paths to pursue.  There is also a robust hint system and the ability to skip puzzles in ""casual mode"", so you won't really have to worry about getting frustrated and stuck if that's something that usually turns you off.   I recommend trying the demo so you can see what you would be getting your self into.  If you enjoy the demo, you will likely enjoy the game.  Also ""Tom Servo"" is your PDA.+High Quality ""2K"" FMV +Robust Hint System+Easy mouse and WASD driven controls+Multiple conversation paths and game endings+Lots of things to click on to get a reaction out of Tex, including scenes from previous games+Tom Servo as PDA-textures are a bit low res, not the best looking game-may have problems with the FMV if your computer isn't up to spec (update your drivers!)

												Tex Murphy is back! I played these games when I was younger, in the late 80s and mid 90s and had a blast on them. I was excited to see a new one beign made but was also very skeptical, but I am here to say it is JUST like the old games and in some ways even better. These adventure games where a blast back in the day and it is great to see the Tex Murphy series back in action. The silly humor is there, the choices, the interesting characters, the atmosphere and funny story, if this even looks remotely interesting to you, pick it up! I really hope this does well as this is really well done and old fans such as myself are enjoying it so much I hope we get more of these down the road! Hop into the Tex Murphy adventures with this new game and get ready to laugh!			"

												8/10+ tex is back, this is a plus on its own+ classic point and click adventure game in 1st person mode, it's actually a game for hardcore adventure gamers, don't expect casual difficulty like in most recent adventure games+ presentation is great, proves that fmv adventure games when done right, can be impressive. san francisco of the future looks realistic+ music, voice acting excellent as in all tex murphy games+ story is very interesting, tex seems darker this time, with that weird sense of humour though, you don't have to play the previous games to understand the plot (the mini clips that are scattered throughout the world presenting scenes from previous games are a fantastic thought implemented great here)+ puzzles are mostly inventory based, dialogues with many options, secret comics to collect, you really have to pay attention to progress- i don't really like the points system, seems you are rewarded for everything, i would prefer one that would be more story focused, like in old sierra gamesthis is a great franchise that comes to life again with this successfull (in every way) modern game, hope the game goes well so that more tex murphy games  come in the future			"

												Decent first person adventure with puzzles. Some of them are great, others – not so much. The main thing why this game is unique is real actors acting in front of the green screen during cut scenes and dialogues. It gives some kind of old school vibe to the game. The story is kind of strange and I can see that not everyone is going to like it. Sometimes it's very hard to spot the object with which you have to interact, so I'd recommend playing on casual mode – it will show sparkles around those kind of objects when you point your flashlight at them. I played on the harder mode and, I admit, I had to check a couple of playthrough videos on YouTube in order to continue.			"

												A perfect continuation of the Tex Murphy series after all these years. Tesla Effect carries the same spirit and feel as the rest of the Tex series. It’s like no time has passed. All the awful goofy jokes are all there and Tex is as Tex as Tex can get. Seeing Chandler Ave in hi-res modern graphics made me deliriously happy and all the references to past games are enough to make a long time fan of the games tear up a little. Even the new characters to the series are a joy to interact with and get to know (and having Kevin Murphy in your pocket is absolutely AMAZING). There were one or two gory moments and some rather dark elements, I didn’t mind but they were a bit jarring when brought about.

												I've had such a great time playing this game. Solving puzzles, talking, watching and listning to all the characters, and visiting all these awesome places, this game is like nothing else. Now that it's over, I can't help to feel a little bit sad.This was my first Tex Murphy game, and I'm really happy I found out that it exist. I did not back this during the kickstarter campaign, but if there's ever going to be a new kickstarter for another Tex Murphy game, I will be amongst the first to back it. I want more.The only minor faults that I could find is that the 3D part of the game could have been a bit more optimized. But this not something that bothered me much, because once I got into the game and the story, I quickly appreciated the game for what it is. If you like point and click / adventure (first person) games, and have a thing for detective (tv shows/stories) then you should not miss out on this one. Just listen to the music and you'll be hooked.9/10.			"

												An absolutely amazing treat for long-time Tex Murphy fans, this keeps fully in the spirit of it's hallowed predecessors. The most fun a post apocalyptic, down-on-his-luck gumshoe can have!Warning: The dreadful pop-up puzzles are not to everyone's taste but thankfully, they can all be skipped in ""Casual"" mode.			"

												This game really scratched the itch for me--I love adventure games, especially ones with full motion video, though I somehow missed out on the Tex Murphy series back in the day. Playing Tesla Effect, I kept thinking--man, we are REALLY missing out by not having more FMV in modern games. Live actors, especially likable ones with a good script to work with, add so much emotional depth to a game that just can't be delivered via 3D models. Furthermore, the FMV is integrated here very smoothly into the gameplay, and even when the segments run long, you're so invested in the story that you don't feel the game is playing itself. I guess the game won't appeal to everyone, but I am very happy to have found it. I played it through to the end without ever feeling bored or frustrated. Furthermore, all of the nods to the older Tex Murphy games (they include a lot of the footage from those games in the forms of flashbacks) have whetted my appetite to try them out, too. This game is more focused on story and characters than Myst or Riven and the like. It's also helpfully broken into ""days,"" which you can get through in an hour or less if you don't have all day to play. The dseigners also did a good job providing you with just enough areas to explore and options to try that you don't get overwhelmed, yet still feel that you're the one solving the case.In short, I really enjoyed this game and highly recommend it to anyone who likes adventures. One thing's for sure--if I ever see a new Tex Murphy game on Steam, I'm buying or pre-ordering that baby. This game would've been well worth paying full price and then some. "

												After a frustrating 15 year hiatus, Tex Murphy finally returns to resolve the cliffhanger seen in Tex Murphy: Overseer. I remember how outraged I felt after seeing that cliffhanger at the end of Overseer, and the subesequent hiatus in the series only served to further justify that anger. However, Tesla Effect makes up for the wait with its cinematic production quality (filmed in 2K video) and its solid classic FMV adventure-puzzle gaming experience. You can tell the developers put their heart and soul into its development, and were anxious to please their fan base with a quality sequel that was highly improbable ever to happen, and yet greatly desired and made possible only with a wildly successful (by adventure gaming standards) Quickstarter campaign. Since watching the story unfold is one of the most satisfying parts of the gaming experience, I won't spoil it for anyone with further details, other than to say it has a multipath story with different possible endings based on your choices (akin to Pandora Directive). Fortunately, most of the actors were able to reprise their roles in this sequel. Overall, everyone really delivered the goods, which is a rarity in and of itself these days. Suffice it to say that veteran adventure gamers like myself, or anyone with a desire to see a good ""interactive"" story with puzzles will want to play this game. Best of all, it ends with a true sense of closure, with just an open-ended allusion to another possible sequel in the future. Please make another sequel possible by supporting this game with your friends, because this is the kind pf gaming experience we need to see more!			"

All I can say is that it was well worth the wait, the story was that classic cheesy Tex Murphy that we all know and love. I just hope they make more! I was never really into the point and click adventure games, but Tex Murphy really drew me in, and this one was no different. Fantastic job by Big Finish games!			"

												Tesla Effect is a pseudo-noir first person adventure game with real live actors.It was very enjoyable. The puzzles are all challenging enough to be fun, but not so hard as to be frustrating. The dialogue and acting is always entertaining and well done, and the story is quite engrossing with an interesting mystery at its center.The only complaint I have is that, at some points, the game tries to be something it's not. There is one terribly executed stealth section, one area where you constantly have to watch your step to avoid proximity mines, and an area where u have to run faster than flying electro-balls that will kill you on touch if you want to survive. All these don't actually add challenge or thrill as the developers may have thought, but instead they just get in the way of what's actually fun about the game. Thankfully, there aren't many of these sections, and the penalty for death is simply losing a few points that don't matter anyway.Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys a well written game, clever puzzles and the whole noir atmosphere.

												Three main reasons i bought it 	nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgiaIt delivered on that part I was 15 years younger in a sec(I know it is 16 years ago but I bought it later)FeaturesStraight forward point and click adventure with an atmosphere like no other game (could be my nostalgia again)Fairly simple puzzles. The hard parts are when u don’t find an object right away, If U want originality in your puzzles stay away from this game.A Hint system for those that are stuck and don’t want to spent some time figuring things out by themselves (but why would u play a game like this if u don’t like to solve stuff)Negative points (for  me)WSAD movement is not adjustable and I don’t have a qwerty keyboard. Not possible to change the keys but luckily the arrow keys worked.Stealth part was a bit dull nut hard but annoying.End game puzzle was extremely annoying due to the lack of time died like 20 timesI rather have some difficulty here then a cheap time limit to make it hard.But it made me dig after those cd’s from the previous one (yep still have those) eager to play that one as well.

												Most reviews will say this game is cheesy, with dated graphics, outdated FMV and mediocre acting, but they are the one that misses the point of this wonderful adventure game made for the fans who yearn for the golden days back in the 90s.Very early in the game it already acknowledges itself with its dated gameplay on having to click through every single dialogues for clues, the cheesy acting and puzzle gameplay. Yet this is exactly what makes this game so charming. From the camera angles, to the uneven (even amateur) acting, where a lot of times it feels like you are watching a fan-made Star Trek movie on Youtube, to the cheesy storyline/telling should made the player cringe at this day and age. But when all of those are lumped together, you can't help but feel it's very charming, down-to-earth and unpretentious in its presentation. With a budget of only about a million dollars, it has produced 5+ hours of FMV and another 8-10 hours of actual gameplay AND a branching storyline, and charge half of what a AAA title cost, you certainly cannot fault the producer for trying very hard to dedicate this game for its fans.Granted in terms of an actual point and click adventure game, the difficulty is not very hard, most puzzles are designed so that you will not get stuck and in general the clues are logical and not too out of place. The only downside is the few section where ""stealth"" is required to progress, they are certainly a low point for the game as they are lackluster for a FPS gamer and irrelevant/pointless to an adventure gamer.This game where the majority of the funding came through Kickstarter is made for the fans. If you do not enjoy adventure games or one that doesn't understand the charm of B-movie level FMV, this game is definitely not for you. But if you have even remotely enjoyed games like King's/Police Quest, Sam & Max, Gabriel Knight, Phanstamgoria or Tex Murphy series itself, you will certainly enjoy this little gem and see for yourself what a FMV game in the 90s could be like if it is made today!

												Played Tesla with my wife. We've played all the Tex Murphy games, and we're pretty sure this one is our favorite.Puzzles are sometimes hard, sometimes easy, sometimes just right, and there are lots of them. We got many, many hours of good adventure gaming out of this Tex Murphy game.If you've never played a Tex game before, you might not like them. They're a totally unique series unlike any other FMV game from the golden era of the '90s. They're classics, and Tex Murphy has a cult following for reasons.That said, if you're a pretty serious person, need every little detail to be highly polished like a 60-dollar AAA title, or lack the patience necessary to go looking around with a flashlight like a real detective, then this game probably isn't for you.As for us? We loved it. I really, really hope Chris Jones and the gang get back together for Tex 7 before we have to wait another 15 years.			"

But, only if you don't mind low res textures and 3d environments that are a little dated by todays standards. Also, the game truly plays like an old school adventure game. Flaws and all. If you are the type of gamer that can overlook things like this and are looking to play a great old school adventure game. This game could be just what the doctor ordered.			"

												First off, let me just say that I never knew of the Tex Murphy games until this one.  With that being said, there are items scattered about in the world that will trigger nostaglic cutscenes from previous games.  They intrigued me enough to look into the other 5 games previously released, which can be purchased via Good Old Games (sorry Steam, but they at least update older games to run on new computers).So now that that's all out of the way, I have to say I enjoyed this game.  There are two different difficulty settings; Casual and Gamer.  I played through on Casual, which means the objects I needed to pick up sparkled when the flashlight was aimed at them.  I also had the option to skip puzzles (which only did for one, due to the time constraits, and not being able to click fast enough).  All in all, it was a fun experience (loved that Kevin Murphy was the voice of the Smart Alex), and the story was well thought out.  If you're a fan of adventure/puzzle games, I suggest picking it up and giving it a go.  Take it from me, you don't have to have played the others in the series to make sense of the story here.  It gets explained quite well throughout your jouney.			"

You WILL be killed, and you WILL be confused as to why you are dead, until you reload and the game explains it to you like it was obvious.--Entire egyptian area/arc feels like a non-sequitur--It has one stealth segment that is pretty terrible--Too many hard logic puzzles. Logic puzzles are also of very mixed quality/difficulty.Some random praises:--The voice of your computer is Tom Servo! Tom f***ing Servo! He will occasionally drop some MST3K fan service on you.--Some of the FMV segments look incredibly good.--With a couple of exceptions, character design/wardrobe/etc is overall pretty good as well.--Exploration--Exploration--Exploration			"

Even down to  that awkward silence and the locations being barren. It really takes you back and I love it. So don't expect anything related to modern gaming other than the improved quality of the FMV and slightly upgaded graphics and resolution.			"

												If you enjoy The Wolf Among Us, but have occasionally thought, 'I wish this had more mutants and a stupider protagonist' this is the game for you!Set in an irradiated future, you play as Tex Murphy, a private investigator living in one of the more muti-filled run down sections of San Francisco - the sort of place robots come to drink themselves to death on cheap motor oil.If you haven't played a Tex Murphy adventure before, don't worry - you can dive right in and still enjoy. Tesla Effect is a old-school style adventure game with FMV cutscenes and conversations. Most of the time you'll be free roaming locations looking for clues, solving puzzles, finding bodies and getting head injuries. Decisions count along the way, so make your choices wisely.I'm only a few hours in, but so very happy to be back with Tex. Lots of laughs, lots of noir, lots of dodgy looking pictures on walls and a mystery that only seems to be deepening the more I delve into it.			"

												Absolutely worth it.  ESPECIALLY if you like noir.  This is an amazing adventure game.  I adored Under a Killing Moon when I was younger, and this game is a wonderful update to that formula.  Don't like the 'FMV' tag fool you; this game is NOT a ""click to watch the movies play"" game.  The cutscenes are FMV, as are the conversations, but the vast majority of the game is an adventure game.  You walk around the world and explore, talking to people, collecting items, and solving puzzles.  I've missed really good games like this so much.  There's a few modern series that do the adventure game well (like the Blackwell games), but there's something MISSING from those games that Tex Murphy has.  I'm absolutely not saying they're bad, not at all, but this is something greater.  Something I've been missing for years.The game does have nostalgia value, but it stands on its own very well.  The environments look nice and there's plenty to explore.  The acting is a bit goofy and corny, but that's part of the fun.   Tex is supposed to be a ""lovable moron.""  The plot is serious, but the setting lapses into silliness at times, and I love that.  Highly recommended to anyone who likes adventure games.  Note: I recommend playing on ""gamer"" mode, so that you don't get magic sparkles around plot items.  It's much more rewarding to figure things out on  your own.			"

												I first played many Tex Murphey games as a pre-teen back in the late 90s.  I never got to finish any of the games however, as CD-ROMs weren't very reliable back then and ""compatability issues"" entered common vernacular.  I looked up the series on steam in hopes that I could play some of the old games (I can!!) but when I saw there was a new game, I had to download it right away.  It was everything I hoped for.  I think I can appreciate it more now as an adult, since I'm sure most of the humor went over my head 15 years ago.  The game has complex puzzles but nothing that's going to stump you enough to give up.   Chandler looks exactly as I remembered it, and it was fun seeing old characters pop up (and some new ones!)  Old fans of the series should definitely buy this, and I think this is a good game for people who want to try something new.  Cute humor, interesting story, and hours of interesting game play.			"

												Tesla Effect is the long awaited and crowd funded next edition in the Tex Murphy Adventures.With it's full motion video and not half bad acting, this title has sent this 38 year old gamer down memory lane.But with new twists and turns, the FMV is very nicley shot and as mentioned before the acting draws you into the story as the actors did a nice job of showing you their characters motivation, if a little over the top at times.The puzzels are of average difficulty and the only weak point that this title seems to have, as previous Tex Murphy titles have been much more difficult. If you are a fan of point and click adventures, Tex Murphy, or simply an old fart that wants to play a new FMV game, this title is for you.9/10			"

												This game is far more than your average point and click adventure game. The puzzles are fun, varying, and quite difficult at times, but what really makes this game is the witty script writing and excellent live action acting. Tex's constant commentary and one liners really help to keep the game enjoyable when working your way through some of the harder puzzle environments. The game also does offer a number of dialogue choices which do affect your interactions with characters, and the game's ending. A really pleasantly surprising game.			"

												Almost finished with the game as I write this... Im having a blast playing it! I remember playing ""Under A Killing Moon"" when I was a kid, and not only is this game a faithful continuance to the series, I think it can stand on its own as a fun adventure game. Its amazing how well they were able to revive Tex. BTW I am playing it on ""Gamer"" difficulty because in my opinion that will give the most authentic feel of the classic adventure games. Back in MY day we didn't have no hints and internet walkthroughs... you had to mail-order the hint book! :)			"

												As a Tex Murphy fan, I was stoked after hearing about the newest installment, and boy was I eager to play!  But after playing half-way through, I found myself questioning whether I should even bother finishing the game.  It was only through sheer force of will and a weird, nostalgic obligation, that I managed to see it through to the end.  *sigh* So where to begin?Let's first talk about the things it did well:Revisiting Chandler Avenue and reuniting with the old cast was a treat for old Tex Murphy fans like myself.  And honestly, I didn't mind the mediocre graphics, as it felt reminiscent of the old Tex Murphy games.  The FMV sequences were well-done for the most part, and I enjoyed exploring areas without running into loading screens or having to change discs. (I know I'm throwing a bone here, but it's the little things that count, right?)  Unfortunately, that's where the good ends.  Now on to my personal gripes:What's with the talking, Tom Servo gadget?  In the beginning and throughout the game, I was questioning the purpose of this supposed ""character"".  Other than the tutorial, and occasional out of place quips, it didn't really add to the story - or much of anything else for that matter.  Tex's  inner monologues could have easily replaced this character - so why even bother with this?When initially exploring your apartment and Chandler Avenue, you come across seemingly random objects which upon closer inspection, will play back clips from the old Tex Murphy games.  While it's a nice trip down memory lane for fans like me, the references seemed out of place for the game's story.  I understand the intent, but the clips felt rather shoe-horned in, and were unnecessary to the story's progression - not to mention confusing for those who are new to the franchise.In terms of game-play, the pixel hunting wasn't a big deal for me.  What was a big deal was having to cope with:1.	Awkward and unpredictable stealth mechanics (which will kill you)2.	Navigating security systems via clunky controls (which will kill you)3.	Dealing with random enemy patrols with questionable aggro radius (which will kill you)All the while looking for obscure objects hidden in the environment to progress further in the story.  It was an immense frustration, and made me want to quit several times--it was just, not, fun.  Now if the stealth mechanics were actually fleshed out and developed, I don't think it would have been a problem.  As it was however, the deaths felt cheap, and you can't help but feel as if the game is working against you. The story...oh man, the story.  For the record, this contains *SPOILERS* - so don't say I didn't warn you.The story picks up where the last game left off, with Tex suffering from amnesia from the past seven years.  Now it's up to you to figure out what happened.  Pretty straightforward, right?  As you progress, you're introduced to more characters from your 'previous' life that you have no recollection of.However, one of the major flaws of this game is that you never fully interact with ANY of these new characters...at all!  I found myself scratching my head, trying to put names to faces and their overall place in the timeline of events.  When I asked questions to folks around town, I had to remind myself who the heck ""so-and-so"" was and why did I care?  Overall, the story telling suffers from a severe case of exposition.  You are TOLD who these characters are, and what your prior relationship with them was, but in terms of experiencing these relationships first-hand throughout the game and having meaningful interaction with any of them?  Pfft! Forget about it.  This is because the characters are either:A.)  DeadB.)  Soon to be DeadC.) Meet in 2-3 FMV scenes only to be never seen or heard from again The game lacks context in so many areas, that as a player I was left struggling to put the pieces together.   On top of that, the game adds soap opera-esque plot twists, as if the story wasn't convoluted enough! (Chelsee was actually the daughter of Margaret Leonard but was given up for adoption because of....reasons.  And J.T Donnelly was actually the past incarnation of Tex Murphy... WTF? Seriously?!  What does ANY of this have to do with ANYTHING!  *slaps forehead*)  Jesus, in terms of trying to make sense of the story - don't even bother.  The way the game plays out, it's like getting handed pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and asking you to piece it together - in the dark, while riding on a roller coaster.TLDR:I really wanted to like this game, but even as an avid Tex Murphy fan - I felt this was a bit of a disappointment.  It had potential, but with frustrating stealth mechanics, convoluted story-telling, and dangling plotlines with no resolution or relevance to the story - I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.I hope that if future installments are made, they get rid of stealth/patrol sequences, tighten the story (less plot holes please!), emphasize more character building and interaction, get rid of 'transition' characters (i.e. Tom Servo, Ariel, St. Germaine) and rely less on references from the older games -- it will make it infinitely more enjoyable.If you're a Tex Murphy fan, pick it up when it's under $5.  I can't see spending more than that.  If you're not a Tex Murphy fan - skip this one, and instead pick up ""Under a Killing Moon"" - it's dated, but it's definitely a solid and entertaining game.

												I have a split opinion of the game, but despite its shortcomings, I can recommend it to anybody liking point and click adventures.The puzzle are mostly fun and varied, and solvable logically, without frustratingly improbable solutions. The live action cut scenes are well done, with an undeniable low-budget charm.The story is largely very entertaining, but weak. It is certainly not the main attraction of the game, and one gets the feeling it only serves as background to somehow tie together Tex Murphy's quirky detective antics. Which is well enough, but without having played the previous Tex Murphy games, I felt a little left out at times.The only really bad part of the game is the horribly buggy and sluggish UI (on the Mac, at least). The user interface feels unfinished, and unfortunately detracts greatly from an otherwise perfectly enjoyable experience.			"

												If you never played the classics, this game still is amazing. It has small flashbacks to show you what happened before - and you can skip these if you wish, but they are quite funny at times, and highlight some of my favorite Tex Murphy moments.While the controls may be odd at first, anyone into FPS games will feel oddly at home before long. Sure, it isn't a FPS, but if you love detective games like ""L.A. Noire"" or Adventure games like ""Broken Age,"" then this is a must for your collection.The graphics are amazing, and the cutscenes, phenominal. The NPCs in the game have their own personalities, obvious from the NPCs being live actors instead of just pixels brought into a 3d image. There are amazing puzzles (some harder than others) and the story is definately well produced. I would recommend this game to anyone, and not just because I am a long time Tex fan, but because it truly is amazing.			"

												This was the first Tex Murphy game I've played and I really enjoyed it. I stumbled onto it because I was looking for a retro type FMV game after enjoying a game called ""Her Story"". This did not disappoint. The FMV scenes are laughably bad (in a good way) and playing a 1940's style private detective fits perfectly with the cheesy acting and dialogue. While the game has a retro feel, it also has many modern conveniences such as: being able to instantly skip puzzles that are too difficult or convoluted and being able to teleport directly to key locations. While some of the puzzles were difficult, I never felt like they were unfair or too random. Anytime that I skipped a puzzle, I always had a ""Oh sh*t, I should have thought of that "" moment. Would def recommend this to anyone who gamed in the 90's or is just looking for a cool retro style game without retro style crappy controls and puzzles. Enjoy.			"

You really notice how they've wanted to stay true to the fans and bring them a continuation from the Overseer game (the last Tex Murphy game before this one from 1998) which ended in a huge cliffhanger.This is a MUST PLAY for all the puzzle/point 'n click enthusiasts out there. If you haven't played the first Tex Murphy games yet then you'll want to do that first they're fricking awesome and plus...you've been missing out!			"

												Man. Let me start off by quoting your exact thoughts: ""What the hell is this game, how did I get on this store page and what on earth am I doing here? Do I own this? Why?"" Well. Please read on, because that's exactly what I thought. This might just be the next best thing in your library.I came into this game, not knowing what to expect at all. I had bought just another Humble Bundle, and this game happened to be in there. I selected one of the titles which had a pretty interesting name. Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure.I had absolutely no idea what kind of game this was going to be, and then I looked at the screenshots. They looked like actual photo's, or videos. Interesting. Decided to give it a go and download it. Booted it up, and man I was hooked.The game just keeps hitting you with witty remarks, thinks that break the fourth wall, but in a good way. Heck, here's an example. When examaning a wall in this game, at one point Tex says ""Is this the fourth wall? Because I don't want to break it."" It's just plain hilarious, and yet interesting. I love point-and-click adventures, and this takes it a step further.At first however, I was not at all impressed with the quality of the game. I loved the dialogue, but the acting and whatnot from pretty much any actor other than Tex, felt out of place. However, the story was intruiging enough to keep me playing, and I gotta say, it was worth it. After a while I got accustomed and didn't even mind the acting; here and there it's bad, sure, but it's got it's own vibe. This game is so refreshing from any other game I've played. I would absolutely recommend you checking this game out. You won't regret it.			"

												Bought the game from launch but really didn't get to playing it before now.Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure is good true-to-the-originals addition to classic Tex Murphy games which were done in the early 90's with FMV. It has maybe too many inside references to the earlier ones which do have a certain nostalgia value to the old timers, but might be considered more than little odd and not explanatory enough to new players. Puzzles are ok, but nothing out of the ordinary. There was one towards the end that I personally found really frustrating and had to cheese through. Partly because the overall mood in the game had changed too much from detective tale into a horror-ish stuff with sudden deaths and insta-kills and I just didn't have the endurance to click through multiple random button changes. Most usable items in game are easy enough to find and you don't have to quess much how to use them. Also your inventory is never crammed up which is a good thing.I think I finished the game with the basic good ending (hero saves world, gets the girl) which felt ok but without any special feelings toward the characters or the plot itself.TL;DR: Overall a good classic style adventure game with real (bad and campy) actors, which works as a big plus to the game itself :)Here's to hoping to see more of Tex Murphy adventures and with more detective work specific puzzles, not just basic ""button switching and slide puzzles"".

												Excellent adventure game with a great story (with multiple endings), great characters, excellent investigative adventure gameplay and solid length. The 3D is well-made and the game does a great job in introducing earlier story elements so even if you haven't played the previous entries (like me) you still feel right at home. The neo-noir feel is very well done and it is truly a hardboiled detective drama set in the future with seemlessly blended sci-fi elements. The music is great too and the video segments are well produced even though the acting is quite corny (in a good way). Absolutely worth it!			"

												Thank you for this game.  Very different from other genres.  An ingenious combination of FMV, puzzles, and computer graphics.  The actors were perfect for their roles and they were just fun.  Normally don't do puzzles, but these puzzles were fun and clever.  Besides, if you get stuck on some, there is an easy way to by-pass them.  The background story is as odd as it should be and the references to the direct current genius Tesla were great.Some had problems with not being able to find small but important objects on dark sets and that is a slight difficulty, but if you are stuck, walkthroughs of each stage are available (at a cost to your detective skills). Would buy another Tex Murphy Adventure should it ever be offered.			"

It reminds me of a Bioware game from 2040 or so. And mind, not only the FMV quality is good and SATISFYING (seriousl, after this I will have a hard time stomaching any Mass Effect/GTA/Uncharted kind of cutscenes, they just can't keep up with FMV), but the FPS and exploration parts are absolutely well done too, and the puzzle are pleasant without being frustrating (as you can skip them).A lovely told story, in a TellTale/Bioware kind of way, with better ""graphics"" and acting, and lots of content.

												I am a big fan of Tex Murphy, Louie, Chelsea, Rook, Taylor and all the other characters that make up Tex's world. I have played each Tex Murphy game as they came out starting with Meanstreets and I was thrilled to find out that Tex and crew was back in the Tesla Effect. The game did not disappoint. In two words, it was cinematic Tex.The video quality was excellent with highly detailed FMV that looked great on a big screen. The sound and music were excellent, The acting carried the story and humour along well with the varied characters convincing in their roles with only a couple of missteps. Although they don't reach Crysis levels of reality, the 3D environments were detailed, varied and atmospheric. The interface was clean, elegant and easy to navigate. Through all of it there was the great mix of humour and depth. Tex wants to find out what happened and he does it only as Tex can: sticking his fingers where they shouldn't go, always making a wry quip, and in the end doing the right thing with a little bit of luck, heart and battered thick-headed determination.The only drawbacks for me were the usual problems for an adventure game: occasionally spending an excess of time searching for a small clue in all the detail and some puzzles which are only very loosely tied to the story. That and the flow-breaking vagueness of the dialogue choices titles.  But for all the rest, the puzzles are finding and assembling the clues to tell the story, which is as it should be.I'm into the game for the story and the fun of it, so I played in casual mode and took my time to explore eveything I could. In honour of it being a new chapter in Tex's life, although I wanted to stay true to Chelsea, on my first run through, I thought Tex deserved to make the most of what his circumstances had granted him, and went with Taylor. Making those choices, Taylor vs Chelsea vs Ariel, was agonizing, in a good way.If you are a fan of Tex you'll enjoy the game. If you are a fan of Noir, Science Fiction, quirky characters, and a silly but heartfelt homage to hard-boiled detectives, you will not regret the experience of Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure. And if you are new to  Tex, and enjoyed this game, all the previous ones are available too for a retro-adventure gaming time and a Big Finish Games blessed fan remake of Overseer is in production as ""The Poisoned Pawn"" thepoisonedpawn.com projected for release in fall 2017.

												Man, this is a meaty return to adventure gaming roots! Video and the actors look a million times better than before, thanks to the 2k video - so play with this option if you can.  Puzzles can be difficult (I'm looking at you logic puzzles) but not impossible.  Story is H U G E and can be complicated so pay attention.  A great return to Chandler avenue - a long time coming.I think I'm like half way through the game and already have 10 hours into it.  Highly recommended!			"

												If you have a single adventure gaming bone in your body, you owe it to  yourself to play this game.  Storywise, I've always considered the Tex Murphy games to be some of the best in the business, and this save-the-world-(again) scenario once again delivers.  The acting and the green-screen effects deliver the same B-movie aesthetic that made Under and Killing Moon and Pandora Directive so memorable, except everything looks so much better.And, as always, Chris Jones *is* Tex Murphy.  He, more than anyone/anything else sold the Tex universe, and it's great to see that 16 years on he can still give us a Tex worth rooting for.			"

												Really neat throwback to '90s point 'n click. The campy vibe throughout the game is great, and the writing is just earnest enough about how cheesy the plot is to make the experience extremely entertaining. There are plenty of jokes, and they're pretty good.On the design front, I have to admit I think about 20% of the puzzles I've encountered so far (I'm about 2/3 of the way through the game, I think) have been sorta weak. I've had to collect 7 objects by hunting around the game's environments to unlock a door 3 times now, and have discovered how much more annoying pixel hunting can be if you're doing it in a 3D space.All that said, Tex Murphy is definitely the most fun I've had with an adventure game in recent memory. Play it!EDIT: After now having finished the game, I have to admit that the puzzles don't really get all that much better. It's still well worth the price that I paid, but it could've definitely done with a few more months of polish.			"

												I have been a fan of Tex Murphy since Under a Killing Moon – nearly twenty years! That said, I will not do this game or the community a disservice by writing anything less than a fully honest review. The game succeeds far more often than it fails, but is far from perfect, so I will not score it 10 out of nostalgia, or 0 out of disappointment.First, let me give this game a score out of ten. In my opinion, it falls somewhere around 7.5. I think this game will please Tex fans and newcomers alike, even if it isn't perfect. If you like a good story or adventure games, then check this one out. If you like it, I highly recommend trying out Tex's past adventures.Let me start by talking about what the game gets right. First and foremost is the story/cutscenes. Tex Murphy is definitely back and they hit the nail on the head, bringing the right balance of humour and drama to the story and protagonist. The story is a satisfying conclusion to the cliffhanger of Overseer and with multiple story paths and endings provides some good replayability. I have completed the game  twice and got two endings. One was near perfect, the other was mediocre, but easily avoided in the future. The characters in the game are mostly quite good, with some familiar faces returning to Chandler Ave, and a few new ones. I particularly like Mojo, the owner of one of the new establishments on the street.The multiple paths and endings brings with it something new to Tex Murphy. Unlike The Pandora Directive, the path you choose will affect your ability to access several locations and will uncover different story elements. While these are all relatively small, most come with puzzles you won't get playing the game along another path. My only wish is that this was more pronounced than it was. The  gameplay is about 90% the same regardless of the path you're on.The gameplay is what you'd expect from an adventure game: inventory and “logic” puzzles. While easier on this front than it's predecessors (more on this later), it was still fun. The atmosphere in several of the locations is excellent, particularly the last big location in the game, which manages to capture some of the atmospheric elements that made The Pandora Directive so good. The main musical theme of the game is also excellent.While all of these elements are good, they all fall a bit short of what they could have been, and keeps Tesla Effect from beating out Pandora or UAKM for best Tex Murphy game.While the story is quite good, it can feel a bit rushed or disjointed at times, like just a bit too much wound up on the cutting room floor. Sometimes you're thrown from one scene to the next with a bit of exposition in between – rather than returning control to you. You also can't visit locations whenever you want, even when there's no reason to disallow it – e.g. Why can't you return to the resort whenever you want, even if there is nothing to do there? This all gives the game a very linear feeling.While I noted that characters are mostly good, one in particular stands out as not: Smart Alex. Your new PDA sidekick (voiced by Kevin Murphy) feels out of place in a Tex adventure and is rarely very funny. Instead of hearing Tex's inner monologue, we're too frequently left hearing Smart Alex – this is of particular note during the death sequences. I miss Tex lambasting himself for violating PI rules, or calmly explaining that he was mauled to death by a pack of hungry coyotes (try breaking the alien abductor in Pandora for that one). All in all, I don't think this hurts the game too much, but it is part of what holds it back from being the Tex masterpiece I had been hoping for.While multiple paths are interesting, they seem to revolve exclusively around which woman Tex would like to romance, which is unfortunate. During the Kickstarter, it was promised that the three paths would be to find out what happened to Chelsee, uncover the truth about yourself, or find the people who were responsible for shooting you at the end of Overseer. I don't feel this was really delivered on. While the Chelsee path is there, the other two don't seem to be. It would have been more satisfying if the woman Tex ended up with was caused by which path you're on, not the other way around. Though Pandora's pathing was a bit too rigid (try getting the good or bad endings without a walkthrough – few people can), it was stronger as it relied on your actions as a whole (are you good to everyone, bad to everyone, etc.).As I said earlier, the gameplay is a bit too easy. There are fewer logic puzzles in the game than in the past and not enough head-scratchers. Only for one or two puzzles did I feel the need to take out a pen and paper. Objects are also frequently too close to where they will be used. I assume this was to save players from wandering around, but to me that was part of what makes an adventure game an adventure game. I want to feel stumped, if even for a just a few minutes. With the full walkthrough system right in the game, this would have been possible without frustrating players who just want to move on. It would have also been nice if the “Gamer” difficulty (which doesn't let you access hints or bypass puzzles) had some differences that made it more challenging than the Casual difficulty setting.The graphics are good, but certainly nothing to write home about. I don't really care, either. To me, graphics always take a back seat to everything else (unless they impact the gameplay somehow). That said, a few environments are a bit too empty, giving them an incomplete feel. The sewers are particularly uninteresting and made moreso by the fact that they are just a maze. Even in the more complete feeling areas (which is the majority, don't get me wrong), there are so few things for Tex to look at. One of the greatest things about the previous games were Tex's humourous comments about mundane things, but almost every location has too many things that can't be interacted with – things ranging from vending machines to hot tubs to miscellaneous stuff on a shelf can't be looked at, but all of these things would have been in any of Tex's previous adventures.In summary – 7.5/10 :Pros:Good story, with plenty of Tex humourGood cast of characters (mostly) with some excellent newcomersMultiple story paths and endings provide replayabilitySome good adventuring gameplayAtmospheric locations come close to matching Pandora's and UAKM'sCons:Some story feels rushed or incomplete in a few places (not enough to seriously affect enjoyment, though)  Story pathing relies too much on which woman Tex wants to be withGameplay is a bit too easy at times given that stumped players would have a hint system at their disposalSome sparse environmentsToo few items can be commented on by TexSmart Alex			"

												Tex is back!  This game is in the spirit of all of the Tex Murphy games, especially the final 3, but updated with 21st Century technology. It's amazing what you get for $20 (that's release date price!)There are over 5 hours of cinematography (green screen, real actors), packed full of punch lines while still telling a serious, complex story. For the puzzle-lovers, there is plenty of that in here as well. If you hate puzzles, you can go on Casual mode which allows you to skip them for a lower score.This game also has replayability. Periodically, you are prompted to choose one of 3 dialog options. Over time, your dialog options have an effect on the game and cinematics. There are 3 different game paths, and 5 different endings.The cinematography with the actors is the highest quality I have ever seen--movie or game. You can clearly see someone as it would look if they were looking at you face-to-face, it is that detailed. They used double HD resolution (HD is 1080p; they used 2160p). That said, the game should run on a moderate-end system -- there are graphics settings you can tweak if needed.If you get stuck (on Casual mode), an in-game help system is available, again at the cost of a lower score. If you don't want to be tempted by hints and wish to go hard-core, you can choose to play on Gamer mode, though!It is not necessary to have played other games in the series. There are throw-back references (and some throw-back videos cleverly presented as flashbacks), but you can follow the story well if you just ignore those. That said, if you do decide you want to explore the rest of the series, they are available on GoG.The only mildly disappointing thing is that some of the rendered environments (when not in the cinematography) are a bit worse than typical games these days. This is to be expected for a kickstarter game with a budget of well under $1 million and only a few people to devote to graphics, and it certainly looks like it's 21st century technology, just that it's about 5 years old. But it's easy to forgive that considering the cinematography, story, multiple paths, and price of only $20.This game is my easiest recommendation of a new game to give -- the value for the dollar is higher than I've seen in a new release in a long time. Thumbs up without any reservations! Why are you still reading this review? You should have already bought it and be firing up the game!			"

												A worthy successor to the Tex Murphy series.The cut scenes and dialogues are all done in high-quality 2K FMV. The acting can be a bit cheesy at times but it's part of the game's charm. Everything is in line with the film noir genre that the games pulls it's roots from.There's a whole lot of cinematics in this game but the adventure gaming part is also fully present. the game plays from a first person perspective and the controls will feel familiar to any modern gamer. (It's worth mentioning that the controls can't be remapped from the defaults.) I felt at ease with the controls within minutes, although some parts of the UI can be a bit clunky at times. The 3D environment feels a bit dated but it doesn't detract from the gameplay.The storyline is a classic Tex Murphy adventure and pretty much picks up where Overseer left off. Returning players will feel at home back on Chandler's Avenue, but the story is being told in a way that newcomers won't feel lost from not playing the previous games. The grand theme and tongue-in-cheek humor will reel you in. Most puzzles can be solved with a bit of logic but a small number of them seems a bit nonsensical. There were also a few places where hot spots could be tricky but nothing that would put anyone off.The game takes about 12 hours to complete, but branching storylines and multiple endings means there's some good replay value in this.If you're a fan of the previous Tex Murphy titles, then it's a no-brainer. You need this game! Anyone not familiar with the series, but with a liking for good adventure games should also consider this little gem. Let's only hope it doesn't take another 16 years before we see another one.			"

												Are you a fan of FMV adventure games? Do you like a certain type of cheese to go along with all the puzzles? Well then, Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure could be a worthy addition to your Steam library. It’s filled with jokes, a sarcastic protagonist, plenty of puzzles, puns, and green screen FMVs.The store page already has a very good summary about the intro, so I’ll just mention that the game is one of those Kickstarter projects that actually made it to release and is a sequel to an old series of adventure games starring our favorite P.I., Tex Murphy. It’s also not a point-and-click style game as it makes use of a first-person camera and 3D environments.I’d like to point out the game’s biggest weakness immediately. The graphics of the game outside of the UI and FMVs are not easily digestible for the eyes. They look very dated for a title that came out in 2014 and the first-person view lets you occasionally see some horrible textures on certain objects. The good thing is that the graphics don’t interfere with navigation or the puzzles at all. You can also rest assured that the kooky FMVs are where the game shines. Talking to the various people and seeing their reactions are a highlight of Tesla Effect and the FMV cut-scenes have a certain style to them that make me chuckle. They certainly know how to utilize that green screen and their actors.


Now that's a face.

I appreciate the game’s sense of humor and my fondness of puns increased my enjoyment. I’ve seen some humorous green screen gags, glorious overacting, and witty observations. Tex has something to say about all the observable items in the environment and his trademark sarcasm can be found everywhere. Even the vague dialogue choices during some cut-scenes will sometimes try and make you laugh. Don’t worry, the extremely important choices that can alter the path of the game and possibly the ending are usually very clear. 


His jokes grow on you.

The game is split up into twelve days, each with their own set of puzzles. The puzzles usually involve putting items together using the Smart Alex UI (, using the correct items on objects in the environment (firewood on fireplace), or a special kind of puzzle that changes the camera angle so that you can have a better look at it. The latter has a bunch of different types of puzzles that can involve logic puzzles or inputting passwords that you’ve figured out from gathering clues. It also has its own symbol which is a puzzle piece when you move your camera over it. You can right click on it to back away or click on a “?” symbol which makes Tex explain what the goal is.Some of the negative aspects of the gameplay can mostly be found in Day 5. Even with an item highlighting flashlight (I picked Casual mode), I had trouble locating all the tiny items that you have to find in that area. Small items can be easily missed, especially if you’re running around everywhere with Shift. Now what’s an adventure game without a notoriously bad puzzle? Tesla Effect has one of those in the form of a sliding puzzle involving two rows with ten spots and nine pieces. I managed to solve it on my own, but holy smokes, what a time consuming and boring experience.I found the hint system to be pretty useful. It’s set up to keep track of your current, unsolved objectives which helped me remember what I was doing. You can also purchase solutions with Detective Points that you earn by examining items and exhausting topics of conversation with people. I like those type of conveniences and the puzzles I needed to buy solutions for gave me that, “Oh darn it, I should have known that.” feeling which is a good thing. I didn’t run into anything that was painfully elaborate or obtuse.I can completely understand some people being driven away by the mediocre 3D graphics, but Tesla Effect is still one of the best modern FMV adventure games I’ve experienced. To be fair, the only other one I’ve played myself was Contradiction. Still, I enjoyed my time spent with this goofy game and had fun as a sly sci-fi P.I. guy in a world gone awry.			"

												What a brilliant game. Tex is back in a brand new adventure about 15yrs or so after the last game came out. This one is set 7yrs after the events of Overseer and Tex has lost his memory after some shady events went down at his apartment block. Now he has to get his memory back and find his girlfriend Chelsee which ends up drawing him into the world of Nicola Tesla and his disciples. After playing the original Tex games back in the 90s it was amazing to play this game and it doesn't disapoint for old fans. All the old characters are there and being back on Chandler Ave is like coming home. Not much has changed since those previous games. You still move around the world in a first person view, clicking on things, picking up objects, solving puzzles and questioning characters. When you trigger a cut scene or talk to a character the 3D world switches to FMV footage. This technique was all the rage for awhile back in the 90s but hasn't really been used since then until now. The team at Big Finish have done a really good job with the quality of the FMV here. It's hi-def, the acting is pretty good (in a Tex way) and it fits pretty seamlessly into the rest. As with all the prior Tex games the humour is a big part and it's still here. Gotta love those eye rolling Tex jokes. The story is not bad, puzzles are pretty decent and gameplay is pretty easy to get a handle on. There were a couple of times in later sections of the game I found myself wandering around for ages trying to work out what to do next but I was playing on Gamer difficultly with no hints or guides. Luckily they also have a hint system and a Casual difficulty which will highlight objects if you get stuck. I've played this one through twice now and really enjoyed it. There is a team also working on remaking Overseer (the game that is a prequel to this one). Check out the site. www.thepoisonedpawn.com Will be looking forward to playing that one to.			"

												If you're new to this series, try starting out with Under a Killing Moon or The Pandora Directive. Both have great stories, especially Pandora Directive, and they provide a proper introduction to Tex, the loveable, cynical detective. They also happen to be two of the absolute best FMV games of the 90s.As cinematic adventure games go, Tesla Effect is quite good. The puzzles pose a decent challenge, but aren't too complicated to figure out, the story holding things together is generally well made, and the good natured, family friendly humor has more hits than misses, especially with Kevin Murphy from MST3k making quips as your PDA. I just wish the 3D graphics when you explore locations matched the polish put into the cinematics.As a companion to this game, I'd strongly recommend you consider reading Aaron Conners' Tesla Effect novelization. It really fleshes out the story a lot and is exceptionally well written.			"

I have never heard of the Tesla effect series until I played this game and this game was a new experience for me. The game has an interesting story, well developed characters, especially the main protagonist Tex Murphy and thrilling asmophere that drawn me into the experience. FMV's are often making fun of, of how crappy they are and there comes a time when a game amazes you and this is the game. The downsides are the puzzles but happily some are easy to pick through and others you wish you didn't press the skip button and lost points (Yes watch out for that) Overall good game and I would recommended it.

												Wow, this game i am impressed with, even despite the bad graphics. I enjoyed this game more so than Finding Ethan Carter"". I'm new to this sort of game, well kind of. It's like a point and click with puzzle solving, but it's in a first person 3D perspective. Some of the FMV is funny and cheesy, which makes the game even more worth playing. If you are like me who likes to wonder around clicking on everything, you'll be playing this game for about 18+ hours, so you'll get your moneys worth, i would however recommend you wait for a sale before purchasing. I think i might buy the rest of the series once they are on sale.			"

In my opinion only the slight touch of splatter at the end is unnecessary. But other than that, playing this game is pure joy and equally good as legends such as Monkey Island or Day of Tentacle.

												This has honestly become my favorite game. Some how I missed the Tex Murphy series as I grew up. That this game is so long after that last, I love the ""memory loss"" take on it. As someone who never played or even heard about a Tex Murphy game, it makes you feel like you too have just forgoten like Tex. You fit right into the game never feeling like you missed something. Now that I have played it through I am now making my way through the other 5 games and I love every bit of them. Besides nostalgia, or even anti nostalgia, The game plays extramely well. Some puzzles can be a bit hard, but that's the point. The only one thin about it is that the graphics aren't up to date, but now playing the older ones, I wouldn't want them to be (I know it was a kickstarter and they only had so much budget). Whether you are a long time fan or just getting into video games, this is a damn good pick. There needs to be more ""Future Noir""!			"

												This is probably the second-weakest Tex Murphy game after the Pandora Directive. Which makes it absolutely wonderful, My biggest complaint would be the old look of the graphics. There are many textures and models that are extremely pathetic by today's standards. The gameplay, however... and the story? No problems whatsoever.			"

												What a great and memorable game. It's getting a little knocked up in the reviews, sadly, but in an age of over-produced and soul-less block-buster games, and low budget indy games that are very hit-or-miss, Tesla Effect stands out as a true indy achievement. It is a (point and click-ish wasd) adventure game worthy of our time.			"

												I waited for 15 years to play a new tex murphy adventure, and for the most part this has it.  I'd like more pandora over under a killing moon, but that's a personal preference.  The reality is when something is on your mind for over a decade, and finally it's here, and you enjoy it - and its over - if you walk away perfectly content it's done it's job and then some.  Thank you so much Chris, Aaron & all for your fine work!!!!			"

												The Tesla Effect sees the return of fan favourite detective, Tex Murphy for the first time in years. The last game ended on something of a cliff hanger so it was a long wait to find out what happened.The game is a real throwback to the days when FMV was considered the future, and we all saw how that turned out. Even at the time though the Tex Murphy games stood out for having way better than average stories and really solid adventure game puzzling.Tex is basically your stereotypical hard boiled detective straight out of a 1940's detective film, only living in a futuristic dystopia version of San Francisco, complete with flying cars and hideous mutants. Part of the reason that the old games succeeded so well was that the actors revelled in hamming up their roles and chewing the scenery. The games for the most part, don't take themselves too seriously and there is plenty of humour. That said, Tex himself is a likeable guy and he ends up in pretty dark situations that despite their over the top nature, you actually care about the outcome of, simply because Tex is such a fun lead character.The game itself is very solid, in between FMV scenes where you will converse with characters in the usual ""pick a menu option for what you want to say"" style, you wander around in a 3D world, finding clues, looking for items and solving puzzles. The FMV is as fun and campy as ever, though your mileage may vary. The actual 3D itself looks pretty dated, with low poly count models and so so textures. It does the job though and the plot and puzzles carry it.If you are a fan of the originals you probably already own this, if not you should definitely pick it up as it captures the spirit of the originals. I still don't think its as great as my favourite entry, The Pandora Directive, its still a welcome return of a beloved character.If you aren't a fan, this is a solid puzzle based adventure game. Watch one of the trailers to see whether you are going to like the FMV bits or not, but honestly, the grow on you.Recommended 7.5/10Edit: Oh, I got the really sucky ending somehow. I ended up having to watch the good ending online.			"

												So I played Under a Killing Moon when I was a kid and loved it.  Imagine my surprise when I found out Steam had all the Tex Murphy games including a new one from 2014!?!  This game was amazing!!  The graphics were great, the story was captivating and the puzzles were a mix of challenging, but do-able.  It was also great to see all the characters from the originals.  Thanks Tex Murphy!!			"

												Steam needs a ""maybe"" option.  I've been playing Tex Murphy games since the mid-90s.  To this day I will still occasionally throw in Under a Killing Moon or The Pandora Directive and thoroughly enjoy them.  Tesla Effect will be this one playthrough.It's a Unity game and it shows.  The amount of audio channels is limited (engine issue) and will occasionally cause some artifacting.  The graphics are worse than what a lot of indie developers are putting out these days.  The worst--and most unforgivable--part of this is on Chandler Avenue.Chandler Avenue is the main setting for the game and at least half your playtime will be spent there.  That's fine for a Tex Murphy game, they've all been like that, but what is not fine is that their 3D artist had no concept of LOD.  The entire street has one LOD and it all seems to be loaded even if you're on the other end of the block.  This produces a ridiculous amount of frame rate loss and is rather inexcusable for a game these days.The story was convoluted to the point where Kafka might have ghost-written it.  Characters are completely re-written and made into new mechanations that are not true to the decade, or so, of writing that made them.A lot of the puzzles are obtuse and needlessly gimicky.The pros:The game still has the Tex Murphy charm which is worth the price alone.  The acting is fantastic (in it's intentionally over-the-top fashion) and it was fun to see the old characters back again even if a lot of who they are has changed.The overall sound design stayed true to the original games.  I got giddy when I first heard ""You have a fax.""Most importantly, the game knows what it is and is true to itself for the most part.If you played the games from the 90s then you should be able to spend $20 on a trip through memory lane.  It's less than the cost of a movie and you will get at least a dozen hours out of it.  It won't all be great but there is enough to justify the price.			"

												Full Movie Video game.  Has a Noir cyberpunkish vibe.  I have not played any of the other Tex Murphy games or games of this type but this one caught my eye while on sale.  Ok UI, graphics, movie elements.  This game looks like it will flash back to earlier Tex Murphy games.  This game has real life movie actors.for more info:http://www.gamefaqs.com/mac/680933-tesla-effect-a-tex-murphy-adventure/faqs/70564

												This new Tex Murphy adventure game does it all oldschool. Graphics, gameplay, story and sound.It feels old but it is a brilliant revival of a classic FMV adventure series on the PC.I personally do not think this will be picked up by most players because the grey beard this series has.And that is a shame because this adventure game does nothing wrong.If you read this and you know an liked the old FMV games like Tex Murphy, Phantasmagoria, Frankenstein, Ripper & Black Dahlia, this revival of a long gone videogame is actually damn good in what it does.If you did not liked this type of game 15/20 years ago then you will still hate this today..I say... RecommendedMy rating = 7 out of 10 "

												Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure is a great game that plays more like a movie. This game is especially enticing for those of us who played Under the Killing Moon, Pandora Directive, and Overseer for the nostalgia effect. With plenty of in game references to the aforementioned titles and the same campy-corny humor that we've come to expect and love from good ol' Tex Murphy, its a great game for both returning fans and new players alike. The cinematic scenes are in HD and look great and the in-game graphics are above average. Finally, the puzzles are challenging, but for casual gamers there are options to be able to skip the harder puzzles to allow the game to proceed without causing too many headaches. Definitely worth the price!			"

												An absolute delight! Worth every penny, and reason 4,592 that the metacritic model is absolute crap. Yes, I got it on sale, but it would still be very much worth your dollar at full price. I was introduced to the franchise a few years ago courtesy of GOG.com. Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon got me stoked for the franchise and may be the ideal place to start.This is a very thoughtful, fully-realized game world where I want to spend time. The main reason is Chris Jones' stellar sense of humor, and his interactions with other cast members.The game play is point-and-click, and there are puzzles with various levels of difficulty. I was pretty pleased with myself for figuring out the one where you have to activate the six power points. Nice little thrill there, after experiencing a a few minutes of despair looking at a seemingly-unsolvable puzzle. The only puzzle I skipped was the slidey puzzle over the fireplace. I guess it was late and I didn't feel like exerting my brain much. The hint system here is simplified. I kind of liked the old hints/points system better, but that's a fairly minor nit to pick.There is a good deal of exploring to do as well. I had more than a little bit of trepidation willfully walking into a big maze, following some kind of giant spider. But I was rewarded for my bravery (after dying a few times).It was a treat to see Todd Bridges from Diff'rent Strokes in here (and now I'm showing my age). Also, June freaking Lockhart. There are a bunch of great character actors that will have you thinking, there's a familiar face. It was fun to look at the cast on IMDB. My favorite character beside Tex would have to be the mutant Louie Lamintz, who in real life is a lawyer practicing in Utah! Brilliant, just brilliant. Really enjoyed the acting bits. The only one that somehow seemed a bit wooden was Holly, but hey, she's a hologram, what do you expect? And I don't want to hear from you hologram activists!The ""paths"" hinge on your romantic interests. I haven't seen all the endings. I elected to stay true to Chelsee the first time through. Anyway, some of those scenes are a touch cheesy, not necessarily in a bad way, but I always kind of got a kick out of Tex getting rebuffed at every turn in the previous games. He seems to have somewhat better luck here, although it's sort of important to the story. And there is a double-slap moment that's pretty good. So I'm more than satisfied with this aspect.If you're on board with the idea of detective noir satire, this is pretty much the pinnacle of the genre. I'm not sure of anything else that qualifies as such. You will have fun, which some of us think is what video games should be about.			"

												Before you read further, I am a ""Tex Murphy Newbie"" so this was my first exposure to the series... and if this is my first exposure then I sure do love what I have played. A suprisingly well written and well acted and entertaining game that should serve as a template for future adventure games.The Story:I don't want to spoil much but Tex Murphy wakes up with a case of amnesia... sounds boring right? A lot of games have done this but I feel that Telsa Effect does this in a unique way. Instead of it just being a plot device for the sake of helping players learn what is going on, it serves as an integral part of the plot that isn't intrusive and actually makes the story even more interesting as it goes on. As the story does seem confusing at first, the game surprisingly does an excellent job of giving just enough exposition for it to makes sense, and to not bring down the pace. The twists aren't hamfisted and are very well put (and once you replay the game the twists definatly help you enjoy it even more because you can see a scene again and say ""yep makes sense, the twist.""Gameplay:This is unlike any other Adventure game I have ever played... It is basically what i'd call a FPPC (First-Person Point and Click) it has the idea of a first person shooter, without the shooting,  and makes you explore to solve puzzles... and it works too very well. It is the adventure game genre in the modern age and it plays great. Sure the enviroments look like they came from the early 2000s, but it runs great and honestly it didn't hinder my enjoyment.Puzzles:Surprisingly the puzzles are very intuitive and never get on my nerves (except for the Sliding puzzle... I always hate those) if a puzzle seems confusing then you can press the help button and Tex will tell you, basically, what to do to solve the puzzle (not the answer or correct way... but an instruction) which makes puzzle a lot more tolleratable (looking at you Nancy Drew)Characters:Since this is an adventure game the characters play a major role... and I have a soft spot for every single one of them... they are all surprisingly entertaining to watch and complement off of each other fairly well. The only character I could not stand was the guy who you meet at the BBQ place (can't place his name) he was just obnoxious. The ner stereotype that doesn't work and only serves as a plot device. (Literally he does one thing and then he is basically worthless besides a few ""nerd"" jokes)Pacing:The pacing is where my first fault with the game comes. The game is split up into 12 days and each day acts as an ""episode"" with two amusing pun names to introduce them. My problem with the day system is sometimes you will have a crap load of stuff to do and could total to around an hour of game time... but then the next ""day"" could only be a puzzle and a cutscene totaling to about 12 or so minutes. This is especially evident in the final few days where it just flys by as though the writers were like ""oh we are at the end but we are schedualed to do 12 days... oh well rush the next 2 days"" It didn't hinder my enjoyment much (besides me being sad that the game would end) but it was definalty something I noticed. Day 8 took me a good hour and a half while the following day only took me about 30 minutes. Either way the whole Tesla Building segment besides creeping me out badly with its use of Bee and Spiders really drug REALLY badly. Music:From jazzy noir styled tunes to an epic orchestral ending this game's soundtrack is REALLY good. It may not be something you'd listen to all the time, but I'd be damned if I didn't enjoy everytime I heard the Chandler Avenue theme or feel a sense of bombast and dread when I hear the Tesla Building Theme. Very well done. And the opening song is freaking fantastic! Just Take a listen!Other Nuances:Some graphical glitches here and there (which didn't affect my liking) and a few green screen errors (artifacts were definalty noticable) and there was an exchange with one of the characters where the background behind them shifted all around. Again it didn't hurt the enjoyment at all.. but they were noticable. Also that sneak area was balls. Should be been developed much more. Overall:Is this the end for Tex Murphy? Honestly, if this game's quality speaks for the series I say I hope it isn't. Well acted, very entertaining, and a surprisingly excellent story helps Tex's newest adventure (and my first) become one of the best adventure games I have played ever. Sure there may never be another game with this being a ""reunion"" game, but for what is here it is certainly worth the 15 dollar price tag. And now I am off to play the other 3 FMV Tex Murphy games I have missed..HIGHLY RECOMENDEDOh and yes, there are MT3K references, rejoice!			"

												That is a great throwback to memories.Look, if you have played and enjoyed the previous Tex games, don't even think about it. Get it, start and you will not stop till you are done!!! The game has most of the things one would expect from a Tex game.Negatives are some bugs, annoying sound issues on one stage (though a bit large) and pacing. After half way through the game extends on exploring a big uninteresting and a bit underdeveloped area, just collecting stuff. I was glad to finish that and move on with the game. That was the only thing that bothered me. Some areas are really horrible looking. Low resolution textures and bad assets but, it is a bit rare, and it didnt matter in the overall.Loved the game!For nonFans or for those that never played other Tex games, .... not sure if I can recommend it to them.For fans, go for it NOW!

												I'm just going to say it this was an awesome adventure......Well 16gbs  and it gave us nothing but a classic hd comeback of tex murphy. I played the other games as a kid wanting to be a police man but the games gave more the a taste of what it could be lol's. Humor and puns are the game plus a flashback to my childhood when you see the easter eggs all over the city. It's worth playing this beacause its a diffrent adventure game from all others plus all the endings are awesome / funny as hell but in serious the game is worth every penny to play comn and join the case as tex murphy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Pros;Humor is really good here.The game feels like a movie.Really makes you scratch your brain?.Music is solid in this game.Cons:Goofy game all togther.Makes want to flip tables sometimes it's diffucult-Hope this review helps It's a great game!!!P.S  play the other tex murphy games before this !!!!

												Really good Tex Murphy adventure. The music has been stepped up and makes this game even better. Great graphics compared to older Tex games. Some of the puzzles are difficult but not overly so. The story was good but not as much as the older games. Classic Tex humor is back and pretty funny. Really hope for another Tex Adventure in the next 4 or 5 years. The editing and film noir are great. The ending was very good with the music. From some of the trailers before the game was released I thought we would meet Chelsee at least once. Where the hell is she? Did I miss something? Other then that I recommend this game. Good price also. The casting is way better than Overseer. The casting people actually got decent actors this time.			"

Posted: May 9, 2014
 Geek Citadel's Video Review of Tesla Effect I admit it; I love everything about adventure games. I’m especially a sucker for the ones featuring detective elements of any kind. Yet in this odd and twisted world, I have never played a single Tex Murphy title. That’s right, not even Mean Streets or Martian Memorandum. So I figured it was time to break my fast of Tex games by stepping into the world of Tesla Effect. Tex Murphy returns after the events of Overseer, and things have changed in the world of the not-so-famous detective.Years have passed since the cliffhanger ending of Overseer, and Chandler Street knows Tex Murphy as a completely different person. He became a hard-boiled, unforgiving, private♥♥♥♥♥♥who would do anything for a buck, at least until he got knocked on the noggin during a possible kidnapping. Now he has forgotten everything over the past seven years, and his memory remains in line with the events of Overseer.I won’t spoil the story from here, but I will say that I had a blast getting to know Tex and the gang. Tesla Effect injects a heavy dose of dark comedy move along the storyline. Tex is a bumbling detective with a sly wit, and he always finds himself in the most ridiculous situations. The best thing about Tex Murphy is that it has an intriguing set of storylines designed around multiple choices. The main storyline path focuses on Tex and his memory, but the player can branch off into a lovelorn relationship, and many other pathways.It all comes down to the way that you’ve been playing Tex as a character. There are multiple choices that appear during conversations with other citizens of New San Francisco. You can find yourself being a witty clown, or a straight up♥♥♥♥♥♥to the other characters in the world. Depending on the demeanor of Tex and the choices made, it will change the path and take him closer to an alternate ending. It’s fantastic and gives the player a reason to come back for more.Tesla Effect doesn’t sugarcoat the fact that it’s from the early days of adventure gaming. It utilizes full 3D roaming similar to titles like King’s Field, and Myst for exploring the world. Tex can walk around freely examining clues, solve puzzles, and explore the rundown city of San Francisco. Conversations are handled in FMV (Full-Motion Video) format. The game will switch to real-life footage and allow the player to choose from a variety of dialogue. It has that throwback feel of the 90’s, and it’s impressive that dialogue was specifically recorded for each comment made by Tex.Tesla Effect has pretty much advertised itself as a retro title, and that’s incredibly evident in the old-school graphics. Wandering around the city is as smooth as a baby’s bottom, but the city itself looks like it was created in 1998. The aesthetic is obviously on purpose, and it adds a hit of nostalgia of the good old days of adventure gaming. I absolutely love the way the title was designed, with the green screen backdrops behind the actors, and the Blade Runner themed cityscape. I won’t lie though, if you aren’t looking at it through rose colored goggles… it’s just ugly.The sound design on the other hand is incredibly well-done. The acting is on par with cheesy B movies, and it makes for some entertaining viewing material. Chris Jones is stellar in his role as Tex Murphy, and it’s clear that he was born to play the character – since he’s the designer after all. His deep rich voice lends well to the character, but his wacky antics on screen sell him perfectly as a buffoon who may be in the wrong line of work. A few of the other cast members are great as well, like Louie LaMintz, and Rook Garner. Okay, especially good ol’ Rook Garner, he’s just a guy you love to hate. The remaining crew plays their roles well-enough, but some of them just can’t help but look at the teleprompter during questioning sequences.I was genuinely shocked at how much I enjoyed Tesla Effect. The hours flew by as I became engrossed in the world of Tex Murphy. It may not be the most beautiful game on the market, but the FMV scenes shot in beautiful 2k resolution more than make up for it. Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure receives four stars out of five from Geek Citadel. This title is an old-school classic created for the modern day, and as soon as I finish beating each path in the game.  I’m going to go back and boot up the old Tex Murphy titles.			"

												a very silly, very corny, delibereately cheesy  interactive  detective movie.its good fun but it can be  VERY PICKY.for example: there is  a section where you need to place a ladder  under a window, i spent 20 minutes  trying to place the ladder where it goes before i looked online and found out i need to look into the window from below and try to place the ladder... i play this game  with my gf sitting next to me as if were watching a movie, and we take turns   answering the  prompts.if  you like cheeseball humor  like space balls or airplane  this is right up your alley.

The only one I experienced was a weird crash.Controls are very easy to use, WASD and the mouse buttons.  This is an improvement from what you would see in the past tex games by far.The puzzles vary from patience, to easy as cake, and to want to pull your hair out.Item finding in this game is very annoying if you do it on gamer mode.  In casual you get more leniency.All in all, I'm glad I backed this game and I reccomend this for anyone looking for a good adventure.			"

Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure is a Point & Click detective film noir FMV adventure game. Waking up with the past 7 years as a gap in your memory, you set out to put the pieces together of who you became during those years, and find out why you lost your memory.Pros: This is a new sequel to well beloved FMV franchise of the 90s. All recurring characters, 8 of which I can think of, are played by the same actors as those who left us off in Under a Killing Moon, Pandora Directives and Overseer, which is quite an accomplishment 16 years later, although only 7 years have passed in-game. The memory blank allows players of the previous games to jump right in where they remember the story, which is where Tex remembers it. Jokes are corny but Tex's smirk remarks are always worth a smile, giggle, or even laugh. The game has 4 different endings, and even branching path as entire levels could only be played with certain paths, like the Sewers, the Blue Dragon, and many flashbacks. There are many Easter eggs of clips from past games of the franchise, as well as many locations where points can be gathered by looking at the many portraits of Kickstarter backers on the walls (every single one of them with a personal one-liner from Tex!).Cons: In the first person perspective, the textures are awful, and I mean it. Any FPS players will be turned off by the game's graphics, and is obviously not where the attention was put. The game is somewhat short for an adventure game, and you don't feel as much as a P.I. as you did in previous games and barely spend any time in your office, or getting ""cases"" from clients. Money and shopping were completely removed from the game. The puzzles were for the most part easy, while the conversation options that define how your story will unfold are utterly vague, often misleading.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youHeck, I had fun playing this game! There is no doubt everything that did carry over from the franchise was an improvement over previous games. Some things could be better for sure, but the game's heart is in the right place: a homage to an underrated FMV franchise that should've been remembered as one of the best of its time, and it's great to have one more go at it. FMV as a whole might not make a comeback, but Tex Murphy is welcomed to do so!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												NOTE!!!:  I've played this game 3 times through!  Steam only counts online play, I've played mine while offline.Funny story driven detective game.  That's this game in a nut shell but it's so much more.  If you have played the previous Tex games, this is a must have game since it will fill you with nostolga and you will fully appreciate the occasional ""inside jokes""  If you are new to the Tex universe, this game stands well on it's own as it explains enough of the previous games(back story) so you know exactly whats going on at all times. If you like games that are story driven, like comedy, and figuring out clues in detective style game play...  This game is for you.If you're the type of person that fast forwards past the dialog in your games so you can get back to the action, hate small puzzles (not jigsaw, all types), or has to have cutting edge graphics in your game (FMV scenes are cutting edge, it's the 3D enviornment you navigate around in the game that are about 10+ years dated) .....then this game is not for you.Graphics:    Full motion video : 10  ---   3D environment: 6--Two scores here, FMV is awesome, the 3D is meh but it does get the job done.Sound:  9--- Awesome music and voice work, they should sell the music it's so good.Controls:  7--- The controls are nothing new or special and any person who has played a 3D game will jump right in.  Other than ladders seeming a bit aquard to climb, all other motion contols work fine with no glitches or getting stuck.Replay: 6---  This game has 5 different endings and the 3 different paths you can take have a unique location(s) to them which increases replay value but once you beat all five endings, the replay value does drop.Gameplay: 10--- This game is unique in this day and time and is truley something that should not be missed.  I can't remember how many times I laughed or got engrossed in the story that was unfolding before me.  The writing for this game is really awe inspiring and done quite well.  You get a real feeling of accomplishment when you piece clues together to get to the next part of your case.Overall: 9--- The only thing that keeps this from being game nirvana is the 3D engine being a bit dated.  That being said, the 3D environments looked good enough to me and they did quite well for the budget that BFG had.			"

												Long ago, back when multimedia was king and the future of video games was clearly going to be fueled by low budget actors performing in front of green screens so that viewers could watch cut scenes in tiny pixelated boxes, there was only one name in private investigation. That name was Tex Murphy. Over the course of the 1990s, Tex stumbled his way through five point and click adventures, most of which were highlighted by the same FMV goodness that made Mad Dog McCree a household name. Now, thanks to the magic of crowdfunding and nostalgia, Tex is back for a new adventure in 2014, ready to take advantage of both the lowered expectations of FMV games and the high quality cameras available in our own far flung future. Tesla Effect nails it when it comes to weird video insanity, but drops the ball when it comes to basic gameplay. This shouldn’t matter for FMV fans who’ve been waiting for a new fix since Lococycle, but fans of point and clicks may not be satisfied with what’s presented here.Read the rest of my review over at Geekenstein.com! http://www.geekenstein.com/tesla-effect-tex-murphy-adventure-review/ "

												Extraordinarily superb story line as ever (although I actually played none of its predecessors :P). This is the best hardcore detective adventure game I have encountered during at least the last 5 years.Actors and actresses are all cute and enthusiastic, they bring me excellent visual and emotional experiences through out the game. No wonder this kind of adventure game became so popular in the 1990's, it's fantastic!Great retro-postapocalyse style atomosphere, reminding me of classic sci-fi movies of 90s such as the Blade Runner. Er, 3d models and textures are horrible but who cares? The whole game is still so gorgeous and addictive that I cannot even bear leaving it for a snack.If there will be another crime adventure series like this babe, you know the drill - ""Shut up and take my money!""

												Simply fantastic!  Played the Tex Murphy series in the 90s and missed these types of games.  Only found out they made a new one just last month (Jan 2017).  I am so delighted they stayed true to the original winning formula.  It has the same flavor as the games of the 90s except with upgraded video and graphics.  The acting, makeup, story, old detective noir vibe gives the game a ton of character.  It is just a satisfying adventure game that is fun to play.Liked: - 2K high resolution video - Smooth controls when moving through the world - Great storyline - Great characters - Built in many nostalgic throwbacks to the 90s games - Fun puzzles that give a sense of accomplishment - Sufficiently long gameplayCould Improve: - Although the puzzles were fun, some of them could be a bit more challenging - SFX volume seemed a bit inconsistent (too loud in some areas while reasonable in others) even though you can adjust it in the menu - the point system could have been explained a bit better (although it isn't very important, I found)If you like adventure games, play this one.  Here's to hoping they continue making these fantastic games!			"

There are far more negatives about this ""game"" than positives, but ultimately it's not really a game but an interactive movie and if you like a hard boiled detective movie in a wacky Bladerunneresque setting, then you'll probably like this. Postives:- The movie is pretty good Negatives:- Can't modify controls- Random death in the ""stealth"" portions- Supporting casts' eyes follow the text they're reading- Have to ""examine"" everything in inventory for points- Puzzles are ridiculous, like trying to find a way over a broken bridge... while standing beside your hovercar- Graphics are weak			"

Was always impressed that they pushed the envelope on the technology at the time.  When Mean Streets and Martian Memorandum were made they were using the built in motherboard speaker to create speech in the game.Pandora was my favorite until Tesla Effect.  I liked Overseer too, but had problems with some bugs.Tesla Effect worked perfectly for me and finally got a conclusion to Overseer going the Cheslea path first run through.Thanks to Chris Jones and Aaron and everyone that made this game happen.

												I finished my first playthrough of this about 15 minutes ago and I have to say, it is a great game. Having never played a Tex Murphy game prior to this had zero impact on the enjoyment level of this. What needed to be explained was explained and even silly things from the previous games (ala video) was sprinkled in from time to time. My only gripes are minor ones: ladders are strangely slow to operate and sometimes things are overly hidden.If you enjoy a good mystery/adveture game, and can appreciate the silliness of a sarcastic, noir detective living in a future with holograms, mutants, and flying cars, this is for you. I know I'll be playing this over again soon.			"

												I've never played the old Tex Murphy games, but I thought this game was ok. I got it on sale for $4, and it was certainly worth it for that price. However, I wouldn't buy it for $20 unless you are a Tex Murphy fan.The good:The live action videos were actually pretty well done, and the story was better than I expected. The environment looks pretty good, and Tex makes subtle jokes all time when you click on various things. There are also random puzzles scattered around that must be completed to unlock containers or doors. These puzzles don't really fit the story, but I enjoyed them nonetheless.The bad:The gameplay eventually becomes burdensome, and I just wanted to get to the next part of the story. For a while wandering around and looking for clues was interesting, but eventually it becomes so annoying walking back and forth to pick up this, activate that, pickup this, bring it over there, etc. I guess that sort of thing can be considered a puzzle, but it is like a puzzle where upon figuring out what to try next, you have to walk for 2 minutes to the proper location to try it (and sometimes avoid obstacles like landmines). Basically too much of the game is spent walking around, wasting the player's time. I would like to see the other endings, but I am afraid it will take too much time to see them. I also don't know which decisions caused the ending I got or how to get the other endings.			"

The story was interesting, the puzzles were challenging but not obtuse, the humor was perfect, and most importantly in an FMV adventure, the actors were HORRIBLE!!!

												Ahh, Tesla Effect. How hard it is to review it. One one hand, this is AMAZING reboot of a FMV adventure series. On the other hand... its a FMV adventure, packed with some of the same issues it used to have back then, and a few new ones packed in. Yes, we still have some amateurish acting in here. Yes, we still have bad looking rendered backgrounds that don't mesh too well with the characters. And we also have another issue here: after 16 years, the actors aren't exactly at their prome. Hell, one of the main characters looks so old (and fatter) compared to his/her last game that it kinda ruined some scenes in the game. And that's one of the main issues with the FMV genre...As an adventure game, Its a great entry. It does have a few casual puzzles (you know, the ones you usually find in hidden object games - sliding, jigsaw, etc), but there are also some amazingly designed ones, and the detective stuf is till top notch. You can open every drawer, you can look at every corner of the maps, you can still click in everything just to hear Tex cracking some jokes... Fact is: even if the game is indeed flawed, its easy to forget about the issues when you have a game that delivers EXACTLY what the fans where looking for: an answer to the question that has been living on our brains ever since we saw the end of Overseer. And unlike most recent adventure games, you DO have a nice inventory management, including the ability to combine items. Yeah, like the classics. ^^Much like Pandora Directive, Tesla Effect features two things that are usually NOT found in FMV games: branching dialogue trees and multiple endings. This is nice, because it gives you a reason to replay the game. The story will be the same, but you'll be able to see different dialogues, different scenes and different endings (there are 5 of them, BTW). The story, BTW, is, in my opinion, amazing. Very complex, very detailed and very creative. It VERY fictional, but not absurd. While it continues from the cliffhanger ending presented in Overseer, it also features a new plot, involving Nikola Tesla's inventions and some urban legends around it. In fact, the connections between all the older games and this new plot are so natural that you REALLY have to congratulate Chris Jones for its amazing writing.The gameplay is actually quite good. You still are able to navigate full 3D backgrounds in first person view, but all dialogues and most actions are presented in FMV scenes with branching  dialogues. You don't really choose WHAT Tex is gonna say, but HOW he will deliver his next line (sarcastic retort, weird PI humor, change subject, etc). This is nice, since you never know what he is gonna say until he does. This game has two difficulty settings, but unlike the older games, you have can select between casual, which is VERY easy, and gamer, which is just ""normal"". Yeah, this game doesn't present too much challenge for classic adventure players. But it's still harder than most adventure games coming out nowdays, and still feels like a real game, not an interactive movie, which is nice.The graphics are ok. For some lame reason, they decided to use Unity (YUCK!), so expect unstable framerates, VERY low res textures and weird 3D models. But the game doesn't really look BAD. Hell, for a budget game, some places are actually quite pleasing to the eyes. The FMV scenes are fantastic though. Not only they are in a very high resolution (blu-ray quality!), but most of them are quite well produced (the ending scenes specially have amazing special effects!). The sound department is perfect. The sound effects are realistic and VERY atmospheric and the musics are great and always set the right mood to most scenes. I have nothing to complain about the soundtrack. Heck, they even put the UAKM day transition song in here!! :pAnyway... Tesla Effect isn't perfect. It doesn't poop on Tex Murphy's name, and actually make it even stronger. In fact, its a better game that most people expected, and considering how dead the FMV genre is, its amazing that we got a new game that feels so similar to the older ones. It's a game that REALLY delivers to fans of the series. If you are not a fan though... well, I recommend that you try the demo first, because this game is aimed at the fans. I give this game an 9/10. And I REALLY hope they do a new one in the near future. At least before the actors get even older. :p			"

												16 years..... 16 years since there has been a new Tex Murphy adventure. Hands down the best one yet! I'[m not gonna lie, I shed a tear as soon as the opening scene started to play. If you are a fan of the previous Tex Murphy adventures then this is a must have. Tex's witty observations are on point as ever, and the story is pretty spectacular. If you have never heard of Tex Murphy, definitely check out Under a Killing Moon, and if you like it, hit up Pandora Directive and Overseer. You are welcome! =P			"

												This is hands down the best drawer simulator I have ever played. Do you like opening drawers and also closing them?  This is the simulator for you.  The drawers available run the gamut: from desk drawers to kitchen drawers to bedside table drawers - this game has them all.  Even better there is a narative that gives a back story as to why you are opening and closing the drawers, unlike those other lame drawer simulators.  Many drawers are not accessible until you have opened and closed other drawers that contain items of great importance such as glue and baseball cards!  As you gradually open a close various drawers, others will become available for you to access.In addition to the drawers there are also  cabinets that need to be opened or closed  !You can forget all the other drawer simulator games you've played.  This one is handles above them all.			"

Unlike other adventure game titles such as Gone Home, which takes place in one location, has only one very anticlimatic ending and is devoid of multipathing, Tesla Effect is a big game with many vast locations, 5 unique endings, 3 narrative paths and a truly immersive story. The game engine is intuitive and fun to use, the graphics are very servicable considering the budget of just $1 million dollars and the 2K video footage is truly sublime. It's a game with enormous replay value and more than 30 hours of gameplay. For just $20, you should buy this instead of Gone Home, which is the same price BTW and can be finished in 45 seconds if you unlock all areas. Big Finish Games should be most proud of this magnifcant installment in the Tex Murphy game franchise.			"

												Tesla Effect is a love letter to the old FMV genre that stands on its own merits as a modern title. You play as a bumbling cybernoir detective named Tex Murphy in this reboot of a series that had its last installment in 1998. This game was crowdfunded by fans so newcomers (like myself) can feel a little lost but the story opens with Tex losing his memory of the last seven years which can help ease you in to the universe.The gameplay is fairly simple. Full motion video cutscenes are separated by 3D envrionments that you must explore to find clues and solve puzzles in order to progress. The puzzles are not very difficult and you'll find most of the challenge comes from finding small items hidden in obscure locations. These scenes are made more lively with Tex's commentary as you observe different items in the games world. Depending on how observant and you are and your profficency for puzzle-sloving this game will vary from around 8 to 16 hours. I took just shy of 14 hours to complete my first playthrough and the only other FMV title I have played is the old X-Files game.The real charm from this game comes from its characters and acting. It feels like watching a cheesy B-Movie in the best way possible. There are some real gems of good delivery to be found complemented by awkward lines that will make you grin. Tex himself is absolutely lovable and you will meet several genuinely interesting people along the way. The game doesn't take itself too seriously and focuses on being as enjoyable as possible.Overall it's a well-executed modern interpretation of the old FMV adventure games and I am so glad I picked it up. If you are on the fence watch the ""OMG FMV GOTY"" trailer (it should be the first video on the store page). It sold me on buying this in under four minutes and I haven't looked back since.			"

												Not having played a Tex Murphy game before, i didn't exactly know what to expect going in to the game, i only knew that the live-action sequences looked very intriguing. On this front, the game definitely delivered - the actors were all superb, and it was blast going around and meeting people during your investigation.This game really nailed it in the story and character department, i just wish i could say the same for the gameplay. This is incredibly standard adventure game fare from the object finding to the puzzles, which isn't helped by the fact that the graphics seem a bit outdated. Though it was hard to decide whether or not to recommend this game, i think it is worth a play for a fun story with quality live-action sequences you wont find anywhere else.			"

												Just finished a true Point-and-Click adventure game for the first time in years! And god was it good! The inbetween video sequences was top notch with really cheesy humour! Heck, the whole game was filled with cheesy humour, and I love it! The game doesn't really look good except during some video sequences, but that doesn't really matter since that's made that way purposely.The puzzles in the game are not too easy and not too hard (Even though I had to get some help sometimes) but almost perfect. The game makes fun of itself in the art and I'm fine with that.The references to other popular culture are also many in this gameI would HIGHLY recommend this to all players who like point-and-click games or/and comedy games!

												The Tex Murphy games were some of my best adventure-game memories from the mid-90s, with Under A Killing Moon being the first multi-CD game I ever owned. Tesla Effect is a complete return to form for the series, with the same campy dry wit of the older games. Filmed in HD, it reallly shows where FMV-driven games still could go when merged with modern green-screen tech.  The exploration sections are great, giving just the right blend of item-collection and puzzle solving.It's not revolutionary, but it's fun, well-paced, and just enough campy laughs to make it a good time through and through.

												Good Ol' Tex Is Back:If you're a fan of old school point & click adventure games, you probably know who Tex Murphy is.  For those that don't, Tex Murphy is a perpetually down on his luck, old school, wisecracking private eye, in the vein of Sam Spade.  The games take place in the near future, but with a distinctly Film Noir vibe to them.  They are a series of FMV-heavy point & click adventure games where Tex generally starts out with what seems like a simple case that leads him into conspiracies and wacky cults seemingly over his head.  Through a combination of investigative skills, wit, charm, and dumb luck, you, as Tex, must solve the case and save the world.This game, 16 years after the release of the previous Tex game, Overseer, is a Tex game through and through.  It plays just like the old games, albeit better looking and with a more modern interface.  The gist is still the same and the game has the same self-depreciating humor of the old Tex games.  It also packs a ton of fan service.  If you're new to the series you will miss a lot of references, but they're not critical to the enjoyment of the game.Like any point & click the game is filled with puzzles.  Most of them aren't too difficult, but there's at least some challenge to some of them.  Best of all, none of them are completely nonsensical, they at least make some sense, even if it is in a cartoonish way.  Like previous Tex games, the game is very heavy on dialogue, even more so than most point & clicks, and you have options to how you want to talk to people, generally giving you options to try to be charming, be a smartass, play it straight, and so on.  You also get to make some choices during the game and there are multiple endings.  I've only gotten one so far, but I intend to play the game again in the future to get the rest.The game took me a little over 14 hours to complete, which is pretty meaty for a point & click.  In my experience, most point & clicks last 8-12 hours.Visually, the game is a mixed bag.  The FMV video is super high resolution and quite nice, while many of the textures are kinda low res and sometimes clash with the FMV.  It;s not exactly a big budget game so I'm more surprised by how great the FMV looks rather than how low res the textures are.On the audio front, as in previous Tex games, the voice acting is all over the place, from amateurish and cheesy to professional and high quality.  This strange mix has always worked before in Tex games, and it works well here as well.  I think because the game doesn't take itself too seriously the cheesy acting winds up being a plus rather than a negative.Overall, it's a very enjoyable game.  If you're a fan of Tex then it's a no-brainer.  In fact, whay are you still reading this?  You should be playing the game right now.  If you're a fan of point & click adventures you will most likely like this game.  If you don't like point & click adventures, this game won't change your mind.			"

												Having played the game from start to finish with just work and sleep in the way, it's safe to say I really enjoyed it.  Is it for everyone?  Absolutely not.  Is there things I did not like - absolutely.  The game is very archaic in everything outside of its cutscenes and dialogue.  The game relies on almost 3D-like pixel hunting to find items in the inventory.  I cannot tell you how many times I was stuck because I couldnt find an item that was hidden or under a table or in a dark corner.  The puzzles rage from borderline  easy to incredibly obtuse/time consuming.  Most of it results in trial and error.  Some puzzles dont have solutions when you think there would be.  When you get stuck, especially on Gamer mode when there is no hint, expect to take a few dozen minutes to hours to find that random item you need to complete a puzzle.The game also includes something which I found very distracting/annoying - a computer companion named (Smart) Alex.  I understand why he's in the game as hes pretty much the only one you have with you at all times and gives the game needed exposition from time to time.  However for the most part I found his prescense annoying, he detracted from the immersion.  This is however a minor detail, or nitpick.The gameworld is pretty hollow, or empty.  Mean Streets is the same you remember, almost too similar.  You cant explore stores anymore and the characters you talk to from previous games seem to be just there to forward the plot.  Its pretty remarkable to get most if not all of the original cast back but none of them actually do anything for the plot other than forward it to the next scene.  Probably a smaller game world next time will make the game feel less barren.  Currently you're feel like you're on rails - going from one plot point to another until you're in a completely different location and doing the same thing but this time trying to find items to complete puzzles.I have played all the 3D Tex Murphy games, although this game is excellent I personally feel Pandora Directive is better but only because of the game world.  As previously mentioned, where this game excells is the video quality and quantity.  There is a staggering amount of detail in the game world.  It is unfortunetely however how convuleted the plot is at times - how the characters will reference or drop information as it was already common knowledge.  There are several times when they will say something critical or profound and just say, ""Oh I'm sure you know this already Tex.""  I dont know if this is intentional as the basic plot deals with Tex losing his memory, or because the plot branches so much but its very jarring.  It creates a disconnect with the plot and in the end I had no idea what was going on, or probably as much as Tex did.  Maybe it would be different on a different path?I would recommend this game first to previous players of Tex Murphy games - it will be interesting to see if multiple playthroughs make the plot more coherent.  Also due to the branching paths it will be interesting if theres different areas or puzzles that open up with it as well.  If you're new to Tex Murphy or even old school pixel hunt adventure games I'd try the demo first.  If I could give this game a score, it would be a 7 out of 10.			"

												I've played a lot of computer games over the years but the Tex Murphy games were, without a doubt, the ones I loved the most ""back in the day."" We had to wait 16 years for a conclusion to Overseer and I have to say, it was worth the wait. Is it perfect, of course not. No game is. However, it ran perfectly on my machine and the video looked fantastic! The gameplay was fun and the puzzles, at least on the casual setting, were challenging without being frustrating. If you were a fan of Tex, you'll most likely enjoy this game. If you weren't, give it a try. While there are a lot of dialogue references (and objects that trigger flashbacks) to the earlier games, it is a complete story by itself. If you like adventure games, I'm betting you'll enjoy Tesla Effect.			"

												I have never played any of the previous Tex Murphy adventures so I did not really know what to expect. But I fell in love with the game almost instantly. The full motion video is fantastic, not like anything back in the 90's. It's funny and has an intriguing story with multiple paths and endings. The 3D graphics might not be the latest and greatest, but that doesn't matter -at all-. You get sucked in and forget about it really fast.There were some moments of the game that I really didn't like. Some levels or puzzles requires that you are quick and has good coordination. Not what I expect from any adventure game. If I wanted that I'd play shooters or something.This game is very heavy on puzzles and while most are pretty well balanced others are down right evil. Luckily there's an option to skip these if one wish to do so.All in all it's a fantastic game.			"

												Tex Murphy was a staple of my growth into manhood and I have an incredible amount of nostalgia for the old series. When Tesla Effect hit Steam, I purchased immediately, because I had a feeling they were going to deliver and make a decent adventure game.Man, was I way off-mark.They made an INCREDIBLE adventure game. Like, really friggin' nailed it. Most adventure games nowadays suffer from uninventive puzzles (use a broom to sweep, use gun to shoot), but Tex Murphy is the first game in the last decade that has made me feel like I was enjoying the adventure games of my youth, exploring and inspecting everything, fitting together random, disparate items in hopes of gaining some positive outcome. And, more often than not, the game can be brain-bendingly difficult, which means that finally discovering the answer is so incredibly satisfying.Big Finish Games really struck the anvil while the fire was hot with this game. The music is amazing. The cutscenes and atmosphere are dead-on some of the best cyberpunk/noirpunk I've seen, and the FMV in this game is far and above the best I've seen across any medium. Even the actors are quite good at keeping you immersed in the game.There are only a few problems. The textures are fairly low-resolution in the game, but considering the amount of FMV and the fact that the game is a love-letter to late 80s-early 90s adventure games and isn't over 30gigs, I'm completely okay with it. The game is of a really decent length, but a lot of that may have been because I spent so much time exploring every possible nook and cranny, so you could feasibly finish this game in a few short hours by powering through. Additionally, there were some areas where I found a few holes in the world that I couldn't get through, but could still see through the map, which is a bit of a problem.Otherwise, though, this game is a solid 9 out of 10 for me. If you aren't a fan of the originals, this might be a pass for you, but I highly recommend at least giving the demo a shot and deciding for yourself if you want to purchase it, because I guarantee it is at least worth some of your time. This is the first time I have ever seen a franchise resurrect itself in another era of electronic media and not only pay PERFECT homage to it's predecessors, but grown and delivered a compelling experience of it's own. It's also the only adventure game I've played that understands it's audience's sense of humor and level of maturity.Please please please give this game a chance, for your own sake, and support a great developer, so they continue delivering amazing gaming experiences.-Palin""Danger is like Jello.

												I finished this on Gamer mode and didn't use a guide. I liked it.. I doubt many people would. It's got seriously dumb puzzles and a lot of stuff doesn't make sense or is excessively clunky by design. It has cheesy (though well produced and acted) cutscenes that often feel entirely out of place.So, pretty much a perfect Tex Murphy installment then. Couldn't possibly be better.			"

												Let me start out with this - I'm not a fan of first person puzzle/exploration titles. I was drawn to this game by the FMV which seemed interesting, though I've never played a Tex game before.Right off the bat I loved it.The setting felt just like a futuristic sci-fi movie (Bladerunner, etc.) yet still gave me the eerie, back-alley-at-night feeling of detective noire films. The characters are funny and are a joy to interact with. I'm only a little ways in, but this is a game I'd reccommend.10/10			"

												Tex Murphy: Tesla Effect is a very good adventure game with a plot worthy of the series. Being an FMV game might turn some people off, but it’s worth checking out if you’re a fan of noir or apocalyptic stories. More casual players might shy away from it, particularly those who aren’t big fans of tough puzzles, but over 7,000 people had faith in the concept to make the game a reality. It’s not without its flaws, but thanks to two different difficulty settings most of these can be overlooked or worked around. While it’s not classic point-and-click, the first person exploration might bring over shooter fans who want a more relaxed exploration-based title that uses controls very similar to today’s FPS games.http://www.kickstartadventure.com/home/tex-murphy-tesla-effect-review/ "

												I really liked this game.  One of the best point and click adventures I have ever played.  The 3D rendered environments are nothing special by today's standards.  The puzzles are challenging but not impossible.  The charm is a great story - well written, well executed with very clever dialog.  The video cut scenes are terrific. I give this game 8.5 out of 10.  I played it for about 15 hours and enjoyed it immensely.  Definitely worth picking up in one of the seasonal sales.This was my first Tex Murphy game and I did not know what to expect.  I was a bit disappointed initially - you have to play the game for a bit before it shows its magic. Be sure to watch the credits right to the end as there is a funny news report after the names of the Kickstarter Supporters roll past. I bought this on sale but I would have been happy if I had paid full price.  I hope that Big Finish Games makes a sequel.			"

												I'm on Day 3 and it's been great fun so far. I'm playing it with the girlfriend and its a perfect little game to sit down to together and play on the steam controller.I've never played the originals, so I'm new to the series, but from what I can see they stick very true to the original series.Pros:- Funny Dialogue- Mostly good acting- Runs very smoothly- Handles good, particularly first person sections.- Difficulty isn't too obscurely difficult, nor too easy. I'd compare it to the level of difficulty of Toonstruck.- The quality of the game is seriously impressive considering their $700,000 budget.- Music is great.Cons:- The interface can be a little fiddly, especially with steam controller.- The FMV quality often has the greenscreen cast a shade of greeen on the characters, this breaks the immersion a bit.- The absence of a ""journal"" worries me that I might forget what i'm supposed to be doing if I take a long break from the game.- Some of the 3D textures are pretty terrible.All in all, a refreshing FMV experience. They have successfully put down a modern twist on a classic genre, without butchering the things that made the originals so good.			"

												A quirky point and click adventure that pokes fun at itself but isn't over the top aside from the story which can be tough to follow at times.The game is fairly linear, without there being too much to explore in terms of side stories but the decisisons you make will affect the end of the game. I've played Quest for Glory, Kings Quest, Sam and Max; if you enjoy point and click adventure games this is a solid pickup. You'll spend more time solving the slide puzzle than you will on the rest of those games.And there's a casual mode that lets you skip puzzles in case you don't want to play the game that you just purchased.

												If you are a fan of the series, you have to get this game. It improves on nearly every aspect of the previous games and looks so much better.Pros Greatly improved interface, much easier to navigate and collect items.Interesting story.All the original main cast are back (with the exception of Mac Malden who passed away).Great soundtrack.FMV quality is excellent.Return of the ""Day"" system, breaking the game into easily digestible chunks.Lots of fun.Cons.The graphics, while a massive improvement on the previous games, are a little dated.The last act is a little weak.Not necessarily a con, but the first person collection is a lot simpler, only a few items are in each room.If you aren't a fan of the original, I'd recommend The Poisoned Pawn, a prequel that is under development, to get caught up, then this game.

												Tesla Effect is overall a fun adventure and a great tribute to the original series of games.Moving around is now done in a nice FPS-style which definitely makes it easier.The puzzles can be quite difficult, also in a large part due to the fact that they're part of the game world instead of on an overlay or a new screen. Unfortunately this means sometimes the puzzles become a bit too zoomed out to easily read, at least on a television screen.There are a lot of references to the old games, but I think that if you love cheesy FMV games you'll still get a kick out of this one even if you haven't played any of the previous ones.As a fan, I could buy and play one of these every year or so.

												If you were both a mystery lover and a PC Gamer in the early 90s, the name Tex Murphy must certainly make you smile. His games felt real, the stories were fantastically well-crafted and mysterious, the characters were all engaging, sometimes funny and other times intimidating, and the puzzles made your head spin. Sadly, these games were casted into oblivion by modern pop-style blockbuster video games, were the ""X"" that marked the spot was as big as a planet. When I heard that the team that made the Tex Murphy adventures was back, I gave them my support, and thank god I did! Tesla Effect is certainly not a game for everyone, it has its flaws and its virtues, and that's quite alright. Do yourself a favor and play this game for all those times you wished you could live inside a futuristic dystopian movie. Put on your fedora hat and live a Tex Murphy adventure!			"

One of the best detective stories I've ever experienced in Point and Click genre. It is really great in building atmosphere of future city. Scenes are gorgeous and our main hero Tex, is an complex character and a very funny one. He could've read an TV manual in such a way that we would all burst into laugh. Many stories to tell many riddles to solve. Finding objects is sometimes difficult but game is rewarding it really well. Story is great here goes clear recomendation for this future noir trip with tons of humor.			"

												Brings me back to the glory days of the ""Future of Video Games"" when Sega Saturn launched FMV games. However, this is the only game that has successfully melded the game and full motion video. All other previous hybrids I have played before have been misreable failures.And even though I hadnt heard of Tex Murphy before this game its very easy to jump right into the story, identify with Tex, and realize that the pulp and noire feel just works seamlessly. Tex really needs no intro. Prior to starting the game I feared there was going to be too many references that were inside jokes from previous chapters of the Tex Murphy saga. Im glad to say that this stands alone well and everyone can get the same level of enjoyment whether they were very involved with previous storylines or are a total newcomer like myself.Easily a 4.5 out 5 stars. The half star deduction will be explained later. But its nothing that should stop you from getting the game.			"

												This is the first time I ever played a Tex Murphy game and I must say, it was better than I expected.  It isn't a great game, but it is very good.  It was nice to see that the developers brought back the FMV format, I haven't seen that since Myst IV, Revelation.Pros:Good story-lineThe puzzles are well balancedDecent graphicsRespectable actingFor the most part, the humor was well doneFive different endings, each with it's own set of consequencesFull Motion Video (depending on your preference, this could be a con)Cons:No real detective work, just follow the clues until you finish the gameSome of the jokes fall flat (can't hit a home run every time)There are two things that I really, REALLY hate in gaming and I mean HATE with a capital H.  One is mazes.  The maze in The Tesla Effect isn't that hard but the developers had the audacity to combine it with the other thing I hate... spiders.  I despise those eight legged freaks of nature.  As I already stated, the maze isn't that hard, even with those disgusting arachnids, but still.  I had to shower after I navigated through that hideous maze.Other than that, I'll have to give this game a thumbs up and I look forward to playing it again and trying out the other endings, the only thing is... that damn maze and those things.At the time of this review, The Tesla Effect was selling for $19.99, is it worth that?  I think so... but barely.  I got it on sale so I was very pleased.			"

Most of the budget goes towards green screen work, actors, voice talent, and music. As is normal for the FMV genre of game, the acting and dialogue is cheesy, but the plot and characters are interesting and engaging. Definitely worth playing if you're a fan of the series.			"

												Often when old series are revived in modern installments, the gameplay is changed or dumbed down to appeal to modern audiences, leaving fans alienated.  Not so with Tesla Effect. The gameplay is more or less identical to the last few efforts,  for good or ill. While not as fiendishly difficult as Under a Killing Moon or TPD, there are still puzzles to be found sprinkled throughout the game. There are many surprisingly well-acted and high budget, high-resolution FMVs, some great humour and alternate endings depending on some decisions taken. Weaknesses are the length and the way the story seems to fizzle out half way through (many major plot events are simply left hanging).			"

												This is your 2014 Game Of The Year.Yes, its old school. Yes some of the graphic can be a little dated and the ""NPC's"" are not of the state of the art.Big deal.This game trumps all recent adventure titles in the past 10 years and makes the much ballyhooed The Walking Dead look like a indie turd by comparison. For 20 bucks, you will get 15 hours of pure-gaming-bliss.I was a backer, and I was a fan of the original Tex titles, but this is the best Tex EVER, beating out the legendary Pandora Directive. You owe it to yourself to buy this game, grab a nice drink, a bag a chips, a pair of headphones and some quality alone time with your PC.Out of all the games being made today, with the huge budgets, advanced graphic technology and women used as sex objects, its refreshing to see this game, with an amazing yet mature storyline comne out that puts the rest of the industy to shame.Bravo Chis Jones and Big Finish, this game rocks, now don't wait almost 20 years for the next one, we backers will back you as long as you need us and as long as you keep making games THIS GOOD!

												I have been waiting for this one and its pretty good, the game retains all of the classic Tex games, dialogue choices,dialog trees,exploration and great FMVs, however the game isnt perfect, like the graphics which are pretty dated, and puzzles are mostly easy.Still the game is pretty good, for anyone that have ever played a tex game and enjoyed it, this is a very faithful sequel.For the players that are new to the series, I really hope you could try the demo and see if it's your kind of game, or better yet start with the old Tex games, like Under a Killing Moon or Pandora Directive.

So far this game is great! Some people may say the graphics could be better but honestly I think the graphics fit and bring back that nostalgia from that era of gaming. Overall I have not been dissapointed. The graphics are good, the music is great, and the crude humor is superbalicious. I only wish they would remake more old games!			"

Some puzzles to solve, but just use your brain and you can beat them. Just remember that you need to talk to people periodically to see if they know something else about the clues you uncover.			"

												I loved this game. So much so that I am actually bothering to write a review for it. Which I don't often do.Everything in this game captures what a Tex Murphay game is and what a Tex Murphy game should be. Humor, intelligent puzzles that aren't obtuse, mystery, and a brancing story line. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of my first playthrough so much that as soon as the credits were done rolling I started a second playthrough right away.While the 3D enviornments you explore in game are average at best the game lives and dies by it's astonishingly beautiful FMV. I played a lot of FMV games back when they were popular and even as a fan I understood why the meduim fell out of favor. They were expensive to produce and video quality was low. There is no evidence of that here. The video is beautiful, every scene helps to draw you in and increase your immersion.If you have any appreciation at all for adventure games you should play this. Even if you've never played another Tex Murphy game you should play this because it's a great example of the form.			"

												Tesla Effect is a MIRACLE.See, I was hoping for this game long for its Kickstarter, long before these was ever a glimmer of hope that there could be a new Tex Murphy game. Now, here it is. It's a dream come true! T.E. is everyhing I'd hoped it would be, and more.The cutscens are where the $$$ went in this game, and it shows. The acting is pretty good, with only 1 or 2 exceptions. Chris Jones is back again as Tex Murphy and it's wonderful to see him on screen again. He's not really an actor, but his talent and charm is what makes all the Tex games so special.Chris also designed the puzzles, as before. They are hard, but not too hard, and you'll be hunting for objects too, like any Adventure game. There are 2 modes: causal and gamer.I'm really happy with the way the game looks and feels. But Is the game kinda ugly? Well... yes, sometimes. The textures are not that complex, and neither are the 3D models. It has the looks of a game from about 2005. But please remember, this is not a AAA title. It's a small company indie game, and there were only about 3 dudes working on the levels. But I never really noticed any of that. For $20, you can't go wrong! There are different story paths to follow, and multiple endings, so it's always worth playing again.			"

												First and foremost, this game is for Tex Murphy fans. If you haven't played any of the old games, you probably won't like this one, unless you are a fan of the puzzle adventure genre. If you have played the old games you will not be disappointed. This is a classic Tex Murphy adventure with all the old humor and even the odd flash back to moments from the old games. The acting is pretty average and yes you can see actors occassionally reading from the cue cards, but that's just how all Tex games are and I wouldn't have it any other way! The use of the Unity engine breathes new life into the world although some areas appear to have been rushed and a lot of textures are below par for what I would expect from todays games. On the other hand the full motion HD video is top-notch, a massive leap forward over the older games. It could have been easy for these guys to change the formula and go down a more open-world route with this game but they've stuck to the old formula well and it's a credit to them, it works and provides a nice bit of nastalgia. I got about 11 hours of play out of it, and thats just the first path I haven't replayed the different paths yet. So for $20 it's great value classic puzzle advernturing.			"

												The very best game ever, YOU'RE TEX FREAKING MURPHY, it's a game that makes fun of itself and does it wonderfully, a grand revival from the 90 series and to make things even better this one was funded by the FANS! The fact that this game was made solely on a kickstarter campaign speaks highly enough of the game, if it was funded by an actual company they would have made bank! The story is hilarious, the characters are truely just that characters. Tex Murphy is back again and more badder then ever!  Tex 4 life. I give this game a solid 8.5/10 and i'm not even sure that gives it justice as this should go to eleven. Best 20 bucks i've ever spent, Tex gets all the women and all the cases.			"

												In MY opinion it was well worth the wait. The last game in the series Tex Murphy: Overseer came out in 1998 according to wikipedia and it all ended in a huge cliffhanger. The game has a couple of bugs, I have only found minor graphic glitches and miscues and mispellings in the texting of the audio cutscenes and such small issues I don't really care about. They really put all the money into the cutscenes and it really shows, the cutscenes look good, not Star Wars green screen good but it's not bad but the regular graphics when walking around and exploring looks rather horrible and I'm totally okay with that, it's still easier to notice things in this game compared to the former games which also had the same issues. The game has atleast 3 different endings so it's not just over after you complete it once. The game might be a bit short, skipping the dialogue and skipping or finishing the puzzles quickly you can finish this game in a small amount of hours but then you would miss the Tex Murphy charm.For all of you who haven't played the original games this one contains flashbacks to the older games which lets you see some of the charmier moments and people from the old games. Don't worry about not understanding this game if you haven't played the old ones this is completely standalone from the other ones and the cliffhanger it's based on is shown several times and you will not miss anything.

												Nostalgia to the MAX. While I never even heard of Tex Murphy prior to this game, it does make me want to go back and play the older ones. The FMVs are the great, using the advances of the past several years. The 3d graphics are notably dated, reminding me of early 2000 games. But we arent here for the graphics, it would be like playing CoD for the story. The story is excellent, given its goofy/campy nature (which I feel makes it even better, too many games these days try to make themselves to be more serious and profound that they really are). The plot is something right out of the 90s-00s cyperpunk genre. I could rattle on and on about this game, but I wont. So Ill just give it a good thumbs up. If you like cyberpunk, film noir, have about of nostalgia for 90s-00s games and/or point/click adventures. This is a good buy for you.			"

												I personally love and recommend this game, if you have some years behind you it offers a kind of “Blade Runner” atmosphere. The FMV is fantastically implemented and it is good to see a mixture of real actors telling a story in a videogame in a sci-fi / noire style.Puzzles are ok, probably they could have taken a bit more ideas from old style adventures (i.e. Lucas Arts) and some requires a pixel precise check to find very small items, playing in casual settings you can use your torch to light up items part of puzzles, however it could be frustrating if you play with a different difficulty setting.I do look forward to see more Text Murphy games with improved mechanics and less frustrating ""mini games"".8/10			"

A lot of FMV, as advertised, but not enough that it gets annoying, it has just the right amount.Playing on the hardest difficulty to start, was probably not a good idea, as there were many frustrating moments with puzzles, and figuring out what to do next.  The challenege was fun, although stressful.  Had me yelling at the screen a couple of times.This game taught me not to never trust pillows, and always shake your bathroom paintings while shouting ""TSUNAMIIIII!!!"" at the top of your lungs.9/10 .. would buy again.

Posted: June 8, 2014
												Tesla Effect is one massive love letter to 90s FMV adventure gaming, and a *very* faithful follow-up to a long-gone series (for better and for worse).Working with their lite Kickstarter budget, Big Finish Games delivered a full-length adventure game loaded with (generally) well-acted cutscenes, great music, devious puzzles and alternate endings. They had a lot of ambition going into this project, and they somehow managed to pull it together into a solidly engaging 10+ hours of detective-ing. Sure, the game's central plot - in which our hapless hero attempts to piece together the last seven years of his life, whilst on the trail of Tesla's lost inventions - is convoluted and sometimes poorly explained...and the humour frequently dives into dated dad joke territory...but if you're at all interested in this series or 90s adventure gaming in general, this is a solid addition to your library.Be warned though: the game also revives some of the major faults of 90s adventure gaming. Several sections of this game suffer from severe pixel-hunting-itis (less of a problem in Casual Mode, but potentially rage-inducing on the standard difficulty setting), there are some minor awful stealth segments, there's an extremely lazy bit where you have to solve a ""the chicken and the fox can't be on the same boat"" puzzle...and yes, there's even a maze full of spiders. Still, it's nothing worse than what the 90s threw at us. It's worth bearing through it for the overwhelmingly fun, nostalgic, and authentic Tex Murphy experience that this game has on offer. Thumbs up from me!			"

												The reviews for this game were pretty mixed, but I decided to pick it up anyway. I'm completely new to the Tex Murphy games and FMV games a whole. The only others I'd really seen were the phantasmagoria games and the handful of Wing-commander games in the same format, which were kinda like interactive movies. This game is no different, but it was cool to see a dead genre reborn. The game was definately one for the fans, and you can tell a lot more work went into the FMV sequences rather than the game-play itself. The acting is very cheesy a lot of the time, just like most FMV games. For example, in at least two scenes, actors were supposed to be dead, but you could see them still breathing. The puzzles in the game were pretty basic and the puzzle difficulty ranged tremendously throughout the game. Sometimes I had to use brute force to pass a puzzle, other times I managed to solve them very quickly. With all this said, I still really liked the game and would happily buy and play a sequel. Hopefully we may also see other FMV games return in the future.			"

												A man out of time. A game out of time. This game just like Tex, has awoken with amnesia with no idea where the hell all the years went. It would seem FMV's have no place in today's gaming scene however this game seems to carry on regardless, despite the fact that FMV's have been dead for a long time. Tex Murphy is finally back to his old self with a game that delivers, with funny and cheesy dialogue and an interesting story. This game however is not for everyone and i would check out the demo if unsure. If you are looking for a game that has great graphics you will not find it here, however if you can look past the graphics then you might find something you will like. As a backer i thoroughly enjoyed the game despite its downfalls and only discovering the Tex Murphy games a few years ago. I would definitely recommend this game however people should be aware that this game might not be for them. I hope we get to see another outing in the future.			"

												As a Kickstarter backer and a fan of the series, and as someone who enjoys a good story, I give this a general thumbs-up. But it's not without its flaws, and I think it sticks a bit too slavishly to the formula of the old Tex Murphy games, even for a fan-funded project. A lot has happened in the gaming world since the 1990s, and I thought they could have picked up a few tricks from other games. The flashlight mechanism is a worthy exception though.My full review is at https://medium.com/p/85e0c4756bbb.			"

												Just finished TE and found it to be one of the most enjoyable games I have played. Now, fair warning, this is a point-and-click adventure game, so if you do not like that type of game, then you probably won't love it the way I do. However, if you do like that genre, this is a wonderful game for you. If you played any or all of the Tex Murphy games from about ten years ago--Under a Killing Moon, The Pandora Directive--then you are in for a double treat. Many of your favorite characters are back, and Tex is played by the same actor with all the wisecracking and corny P.I. jokes (of course). One of the things I got the biggest kick from is the flashback sequences drawn from the old games triggered by objects in the environment (remembering how Tex got a hole in the brim of one of his fedoras was one of my favorites). The flashbacks appear to be the FMV from the old games displayed in a little letterbox in the center of the screen. The new FMV shot for this game is high-def and full screen and looks and plays beautifully. There is a casual mode for beginners with hints as to what to do next and objects that are needed for the story highlighted by Tex's trusty flashlight. More experienced adventure gamers are going to want to play without the hints or the object-highlighting, but either way this is a great ride--especially if you played any of the earlier games. I played without the help, and while there are a few items that took a bit of work to find and a challenging timed puzzle at the end of the game, I only had to rely on the Universal Hint System two or three times. So a great point-and-click adventure for anyone, and a special treat for Tex Murphy fans from earlier games, Tesla Effect is not to be missed.			"

Great puzzles that really make you think. Gamer mode may not be for everyone, but I wouldn't skip a puzzle, you really feel awesome when you finish some of them.Great value for the price, and I'd recommend it to everyone.Graphics could have been better, though.

												Any fan of classic Point and Click Adventure games will love this title. The graphics are very dated and look like they could be from a game in the early 2000's; however, the comedy is, in my opinion, hilarious and the story is ""batshit crazy"" and I love it. They seems to have spent most of the money on the Full Motion Video cutscenes, voice acting, and music, thus the rest of the game is not up to modern standards. If you are a fan of point and clicks that have more puzzles and exploration than other games, like Telltale's Walking Dead, which emphasizes more on being an interactive movie, you will love this game.Edit: I forgot to mention that the game itself is quite lengthy compared to modern point and clicks. Comparing to Telltale's games, again, most are only around 10 hours with all episodes included; however, Tesla Effect took me around 15 hours to complete, and I enjoyed all 15 hours of it.			"

												As the time of this review I got 2/5 endings, with save files for the other 2.  Tesla effect is  like that old quote from batman ""he is not the hero we want but the one we need""  In the days of over-hyped dlc fests that need DOD level processers to meet the base requirements, we have something in my opinion that is a game of the year that took gamers coming togther and producing something quality.  Is it perfect no but it proves games don't need to be 60$ dollars and need alot of horse power to have good characters and a very good story. If you have never played any of the old Tex Murphy games, you will enjoy it.			"

												Tesla Effect takes me down nostalgia lane harder than any Mario game ever could. It's probably mostly a game for people who played the older Tex Murphy games ~20 years ago, but if you're into noir and don't mind some not-quite-modern 3D graphics, then you're absolutely in for a treat even if the basketball behind Rook's Pawn Shop doesn't immediately bring a smile to your face.Having recently played through Under a Killing Moon in anticipation of Tesla Effect getting released I must say that it's incredibly true to the old games. It's very, very obvious that this is a labor of love. It's a game made by fans (even though a lot of these ""fans"" were involved in making the old games too) for fans, and it's spot on.			"

The steet was how i wanted to see it, just the same only modernised. Lots of exploring and a coment about almost every item on display. Movie interaction on conversations just like the original, and backed up with loads of live action movie scenes, original actors to boot. Come across a few puzzles, nothing too mind bending yet.Bang on for the Original, just revamped for better graphics and controls. So, so far so good imo.			"

												I really liked this game. It's like a 90s FMV came through a portal into 2014.If you ever played the old Tex adventures, all you need to know is the same Tex you know and (hopefully) love. Same style, same puzzles, same humor, same characters, and same actors. Only this time it's HD, the controls are smooth, and there's a nice hint system. Be careful, because it also keeps a lot of the brutal puzzle design of the 90s too. It wouldn't be a proper retro game without a challenge, though! Definitely play it on ""casual"" dificulty, unless you love pixel hunting.			"

												Tesla Effect is the latest game in the Tex Murphy series, a first person point and click adventure game with a heavy emphasis on FMVs (full motion video). FMVs were quite popular in the early nineties because computer graphics still weren't able to provide a good character representation. However they fell out of favour because most of them had bad gameplay and even worse acting. The only games I played which really used FMV effectively were the Command & Conquer games. The FMVs there felt like a reward for progressing through the story.In Tesla Effect I get a similar feeling, I enjoyed most of the FMV sections. Mostly because of the protagonist Tex Murphy, who is played in a very self aware manner, the game knows it's cheesy and doesn't take itself too seriously. And if you strip away all the videos there's still a pretty good game underneath it all. While the 3D graphics certainly aren't anything to special (they look like something out of a decade old game) they were actually better than I expected, especially since the levels themselves are reasonably large. I am pleased with the size of the world they constructed, there isn't that much of revisiting the same locations and they are quite varied as well. However pretty much the whole 3D world is dead, there are very few encounters with living beings outside of the FMVs.The story itself is cheesy and by the end of the game I felt it became pretty much ridiculous. The game played much better when it wasn't focusing on the main premise of the game. It would have been nice to have some side quests, but in true adventure game fashion every single thing is connected and you can not progress without doing everything. I wouldn't fault most other adventure games with this, however as I mentioned I felt the game was best when it wasn't focusing on the main story.The videos themselves are quite well made, the acting is cheesy but not bad. There are barely any real world objects, almost everything besides the characters themselves is CGI, which is on par with the rest of the game. So, not great, but considering the budget they had to work with I think it's good enough.As an adventure game there are quite a lot of puzzles, I was OK with most of them, however I certainly needed help sometimes. Thankfully there's an optional help system included in the game and an option to skip the puzzle mini game sections, which I used once because the puzzle itself made absolutely no sense to me.Tesla Effect is not an easy game to recommend, it's a throwback to a type of game which existed for a very short amount of time, due to limited technical capabilities of the time. And the series from which it comes is probably one of the best of its type. When I played the game I took it as such and mostly enjoyed what I got, so if you do the same you can go ahead and try this out. I hope the series continues, as I think a really good game can be made from this, with the right story.6 / 10			"

												I'll preface this by saying that I've never played a Tex Murphy Adventure before Tesla Effect.  They were very much on my radar and I remember quite well wanting to play Under a Kiling Moon when I was young.  FMV games for the most part were a flash in the pan fad that really overstayed their welcome in the early/mid 90's.  Some did it very well and are among my favorite adventures (Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within,) some were flawed but still highly enjoyable (Phantasmagoria) and some were pretty abysmal (anything released on Sega CD.)  Tesla Effect falls promptly into the middle catagory. The story, characters, presentation and FMV are pretty fantastic.  The acting is terrible but in the best possible way.  Any positive things I have to say about this game all center around those aspects.  The game environment and gameplay on the other hand did leave quite a bit to be desired.  The world itself is pretty ugly by todays standards.  It was like navigating a 1999 poly environment.  I guess you could argue that works for the game since it's a return to a medium long dead since the 90's. The gameplay relies HEAVILY on finding items as every adventure games should.  The real trouble here is that the items and world are so murky and blocky that they blend together.  I highly recommend playing on ""casual"" settting because your flashlight will call sparkly attention to these things.  Even then it was still difficult finding them.  I feel bad for complaining about this game because it has so much character.  I just wish more time and effort were put into the gameplay.   Also I hugely enjoyed the easter eggs that pulled video from the original Tex adventures.  They really made me want to go back and see what I was missing.  Sadly they were missing from the final half of the game or I was just missing them.  Still a recommended play for anyone looking for a nostalgic trip back to 90's FMV			"

												I wasted many hours of my youth in the 90's playing the Tex Murphy Adventures and it's great to see it back without being changed, updated, adjusted or mutilated for todays modern audience. It doesn't need it! It’s great to see a classic style game brought to life with the same love, care and attention that was given to the originals. From the funny, over the top but brilliant acting in the FMV scenes, to the vivid albeit dated graphics and interesting story, the game is a work of art. The story, while perhaps not quite upto the standards of previous adventures, is fun and keeps you interested throughout. Fantastic game. Other developers should take note and could learn a lot from this! Buy it now!Pros+Tex is back!!!+Great to see an old series brought back to life in the same spirit as previously without ruining it+Brilliant acting+HD FMV+In places it’s hilarious +Interesting and challenging puzzles+Decent story+Good sound and music+Runs great with few bugs - uses the Unity EngineCons-Interface is not the greatest-Graphics are dated (though this is not really a down side and has no negative impact in the game, they just could have been a bit better) "

												Great adventure game with a lot of charm. Really liked how they brought back FMV and the acting/humor is probably the best thing about the game. Other then that the environments are very nicely detailed and their is quite a bit to explore as well as plenty collectibles/eastereggs to find. There is also a pretty large variety of puzzles most of which are challenging but fair, and only a few that require you to really search every nook and cranny of the environment to find hints. Altogether I highly recommend it if you like adventure games and I hope that they make a few more of these this decade  :lol: .I would rate it a 8/10 overall.Gameplay:8/10Story:8/10Visuals:7/10Music: 8/10On a side note the game has plenty of room to be replayed since there are multiple slightly different endings and you are bound to have missed something your first time through.

												A great pulpy detective story, marred by plodding hidden object searches, and generic adventure game puzzles. The characters and cutscenes are superbly written and a joy to behold, and the game really hits its peak when it gives you a mystery to unravel and an open space for you to find clues within.However, half the game's puzzles seem to exist just to exist. Too often I was left in an interesting location, with uninteresting objectives. At one point, I found a sliding block puzzle in an old woman's mansion and simply quit because it completely broke immersion for me.Still, an enjoyable experience, and a tentative recommendation. However, if you're looking for gameplay that actually makes you feel like a detective, I'd recommend the Sherlock Holmes' or Blackwell series' instead.			"

												I really liked this game. It's like a 90s FMV came through a portal into 2014.If you ever played the old Tex adventures, all you need to know is the same Tex you know and (hopefully) love. Same style, same puzzles, same humor, same characters, and same actors. Only this time it's HD, the controls are smooth, and there's a nice hint system. Be careful, because it also keeps a lot of the brutal puzzle design of the 90s too. It wouldn't be a proper retro game without a challenge, though! Definitely play it on ""casual"" dificulty, unless you love pixel hunting.			"

												Great old school adventure game, although some of the puzzles were frustrating at times (including some of the timed puzzles) I throughly enjoyed this game. I got the 2nd highest rating with about 15 hours of playtime. I generally like to take my time with games like this. I plan on playing it again to see the other possible endings. The graphics are not as impressive but the gameplay is solid, this game is well worth the money if you enjoy adventure games and full motion video. Big finish Games did a great job with this one!

												Chris Jones does a unique adventure puzzle solving game.  I started playing these games back in the days of Access Software.  I was completely dissapointed when the company was sold and was even more bummed when no more Tex Murphy games were being released.  I thought it was done and just a great memory.  I was completely shocked to find a new Tex Murphy game with the old Charachters!  This was the best one yet because of the new technology that makes everything look better.  I know that Chris Jones puts his whole soul into these games.  Thanks for all the hard work.  I am a fan for sure.  I wish I was as smart as some of you at solving these creative puzzles.  It must be a labor of love to work that hard on this project, with so many people involved and then sell it for less than 17 bucks on sale.  I used to pay $60 for these games!			"

												Being someone who has played Tex Murphy games since the second one, I enjoyed Tesla Effect and confident to recommend it to other folks who have played the earlier ones.For the folks who have yet to, I recommend playing the the original FMV Tex games first otherwise you won't get to appreciate this game as much and make the mistake of writing it off as another mediocre Steam game.It's not perfect. The first half of the game was a sublime mix of FMV and 3d adventure gaming, but during a point half-way in the game, the FMV and humor gives way to puzzle minutiae, which turned me off. Thankfully the game gives you the option to bypass most puzzles in case you want to see how the story plays out without beating your head against the wall.It's a throwback to 90's gaming, warts and all, and I hope they make a sequel!!

												If you're looking for a game where you pixel hunt for things most of the game, waste time solving unoriginal puzzels that don't seem to have anything to do with what's going on, and a story that is questionable as even being a story... THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!!!The Pandora Directive is a far better game, but hell, at least I'm not complaining about the graphics in this new one. This kind of game isn't based on graphics. I also enjoy that you get three choices for things to say, having no idea what it really means, and it determines the end of the game. 10/10			"

												""Save me Tex Murphy! You're my only hope!"" 7/10I should mention that I had never heard of ‘Tex Murphy’ growing up in the 90’s. I guess the series was pretty popular though if they were able to get a Kickstarter to bring it back. Remember games that had cut scenes with actual people in them, almost like movies? Yeah, I had forgotten about them too. Having said all of that however, I still thoroughly enjoyed this game and would definitely recommend it to anyone who grew up in the 90’s playing FMV games. If you can get it for a low, low, oh-so-low price that is; I really can’t justify paying $20 for this game. Having said that, I really have no idea why I enjoyed this game. As I have already stated I had never heard of these games before a few weeks ago, so there really isn't any nostalgia there. The graphics are dated, the puzzles are tired and old, the atmosphere is dull and extremely basic, the story isn’t anything special, and the controls could be better. I mean sure, it's supposed to feel like those early 90’s PC games with live action, but this game is really pushing it with these graphics that look like they came straight out of 2006. But whatever, story and graphics aren’t everything that makes a game great. I mean who plays games for their stories?  This game is also pretty damn hard, even on the ‘casual’ mode. So be prepared to ask for some guidance along the way by seeking the in-game itinerary for where to go and what to do. I mean, unless you don’t mind wandering around for hours, aimlessly looking for objects that are sometimes pretty hard to see. See? Even as I’m writing this I’m still questioning why the hell I loved this game so much. And I truly did love this game. The acting definitely helps with that too, as I found myself getting more and more engrossed in the cut-scenes, watching this story I started out not caring about, unfold before my very eyes. Todd Bridges, some guy from some show, even makes an appearance. So in closing…this game is extremely dated with graphics from a decade ago, needs some fiddling to work with a controller, has ridiculous HD cut-scenes with sometimes stupid characters, has some stupid puzzles, and is a blast from start to finish. Go get em’ Tex…that’s not a line from the game but I think it fits quite nicely.			"

I can go on, but at the same time, I haven't felt this enthusiastic about video games for a long time, and that made up all the issues in the end. I hope they make a sequel.			"

												An enjoyable, crowd-funded detective game that's really half-game, half-movie (it's a 16GB download!).  Good acting and interesting storyline that can branch into 5 different endings.   Except for some annoying 'jumping-through-the-hoops' at times (some puzzles and items quests were a bit 'unintuitive'...), it was, overall, an entertaining ride. Good writing and appropriate music, too.  On the downside, there are some graphic scenes of violence (Tex getting beaten unconscious with an iron rod, which I did NOT find funny...), depictions of decapitation, and certain 'adult' themes, all of which make this game inappropriate for pre-17s. What I also liked about it was that it appears to be designed to help raise awareness about the life of Nikola Tesla and his work.  If you get a chance, read up on some of Tesla's monumental discoveries and their importance in not just our daily lives (e.g. AC power, brushless motors, etc.) but also in the implementation of certain advanced technologies (e.g. wireless transmission of power, resonant systems, scalar electromagnetics, etc).  Helps fill in the missing 'forbidden' knowledge purposely omitted from most college-level Physics courses these days...Check it out.(Note: Acquired via a bundle)			"

												I've been on Steam for a long time but this game is the first one to motivate me to write a review - it was that good :) As a hardcore point-and-click games fan, I somehow missed the hype around Tex Murphy series when previous installments were released. This is the first FMV game I've ever played and this is what I liked about it:- Quality of graphics and FMV scenes exceeded my expectations. Transitions between cutscenes and in-game content is smooth and 3D environments in general are a real eye candy (for a game this type)- Story is interesting, full of some (sometimes) cheesy humour but overall very engaging - the cheesy parts are actually funny and enjoyable rather than annoying. Acting is great but then again, you won't see much of acting from the secondary characters in the game (mostly short dialogues)- Puzzles are logical for an adventure game and mostly enjoyable rather than frustrating. The game auto-saves a lot, so even if you happen to die (which in some parts of the game may happen a bit more often), you won't have to replay anything- There is a decent hint system (pretty much an in-game walkthrough), so if you get stuck, you can always review the solution of this particular puzzle/episode of the game. I used the hint system a few times in the beginning of the game until I got used to the mechanics of character control and interaction and almost haven't used it since- Hunting for items/interactable objects can sometimes be a pain in the butt, since it's much harder to do pixel hunting in 3D environments as opposed to 2D environments used by most point and clicks/adventure games. I am playing the easy mode which makes an item ""sparkle"" when you use the flashlight but I still had some difficulties noticing several items in the game (they were only noticeable when Tex approaches them closely). I think that this happened 2-3 times so far, so definitely not a frustrating experience (if you play it on the hard mode, some items may be very challenging to find :))Playing the game felt a bit like L.A. Noire (due to its unique Film Noir like setting), a bit like Fallout 3 (in terms of exploring relatively spacy areas and buildings) and a lot like a very good adventure/point and click game. I even went ahead and bought all other Tex Murphy adventures even though I probably won't be able to stand the old graphics for too long but as all point-and-click games fans know, these games are not about the graphics (e.g. Wadget eye games) :)I sincerely hope they will make another one or remake one of the older ones - I will buy it instantly.

The voice acting is excellent and the story enjoyable, allthough it might help to know more of the previous old games. The price is right for this game and I hope they do a lot more of these.

												Definitely recommending it to all gamers that like the adventure genre. The game was pretty satisfying. The fmv were well made (the textures less so). Audio and the various performances were also excellent. There were a few pacing issues (some days would be just fmv's and some days would be just puzzles , i would have prefered a mix) but nothing that detracts from the experience. I liked that they targeted not only old fans but gave a good backstory for the new players as well. There were a couple of really frustrating parts though , like Sensen. I do not enjoy hunt the pixel modes. But the good news is that people can always use the casual mode that a) makes the flashlight illuminate objects that you can pick up and b) lets you skip puzzles.In conclusion it definitely reached and exceeded my expectations for my backing. They did an amazing job with it, a big bravo to everyone at big finish games. P.S Let's not wait another 16 years for the next one eh?			"

												Tesla Effect is the kind of a game I though I wouldn't be seeing again. While the gameplay itself is 1st person 3D, the game narrative uses FMV. It's a real flashback from the 90's, when FMV was the latest craze, only to die because of overuse in less than stellar games. Tex Murphy series never was bad though.In its day Tex Murphy games were one of the few that got FMV right. The games weren't poorly acted choose your own adventure types, but real, honest adventure games with exploration and character interactions. They were, and still are, good games. And then FMV died and so did Tex, at least so it seemed.Previous Tex game, The Overseer, left things in a cliffhanger. A cliffhanger, that would take over decade to be resolved. Tesla Effect doesn't continue directly from the end of the Overseer, but the mystery it left is part of the mystery that needs to be resolved in Tesla Effect as well. At the same time Tesla Effect is its own story, so being familiar with previous games isn't mandatory.While Tesla Effect is a bit lacking in graphics, especially in comparison to modern AAA games, it is a great game none the less and especially the FMV sequences look pretty damn good. So if you are a fan of adventures, or pulp sci-fi, then Tesla Effect might just be a game for you. I know it was a game for me. "

												Conclusion: I liked the game when I wasn't tearing my hair out because of having not found an item, but that's about all the challenge there is to the game. Definitely not for everyone, but one of the more enjoyable/better ways to giving FMV adventure games a chance once it inevitably lands in a sale. I'd expect this to be the best-looking adventure game with such focus on full-motion (greenscreened) live action video for a good while, if only because there probably won't be any more of the kind in several years.Gameplay: The bulk of the adventure is viewed from the first-person perspective and the player can walk freely around like in FPS games, except there's no jumping or crouching. In this mode, the game looks really ugly. Low-detail models, low-resolution textures, very few no character models (and those that are shown are usually even worse). The stealth and action sections are... something that can be cleared, but no highlights of the game. There are no ridiculous item combination puzzles, which is a big plus.Dialogue: The dialogue in the game is played by greenscreened live actors. In these, there are usually several options to pick from - two to three - but I can't say if they branch the game plot outside one or two rather obvious points. Once this dialogue tree is handled, it's back to picking one from the list of topics. I'd call the acting mostly passable - at least better than what is shown in the clips from the old games.Puzzles: When it comes to puzzles, it's nothing overly difficult. I don't recall any ""how was I supposed to know I had to combine these?!"" problems, and the ""in-situ"" puzzles (a Simon Says -puzzle, solving a board game problem, ...) are relatively straightforward, if you listen to Tex telling what you're supposed to do in it. (The board game, I'm talking about you!)Issues: For me, the biggest problem was finding all items. I played the game without the flashlight aiding me and I had to check a walkthrough maybe three times. (Wheel, hook, glue). Some items are hidden so well and/or in unlikely places, making the game too much like a 3D hidden object game. On the other hand - this is the investigation part that some might find interesting.

												Ah damn, this is a hard review to do...Well, I love the serie, you know? I was so pleased to see a new episode coming out. FMV is all my youth after all. I rushed on Harvester when it was re-released, own both the 7th Guest and the 11th Hour and enjoy them almost as much as first time.And if I must be honnest I would go down on my knees for some Phantasmagoria or Gabriel knight but this is a totally different story.Ok, so this new Tex.Those new gen FMV's are gorgeous, I connected my notebook to my 55"" TV and were all ""WOW"" like when I saw Tex HD. The intro is great, sweating Blade runner from all its pixels. The first minutes were plain joy, a nicely done optional tutorial and then, here I went on my own ready to investigate this new open world. Then...Well, yeah, then...THEN, I realized that the game is just no more than FMV's and a nice scenario continuing the main serie story.Let me explain myself, the game got a single and only bad point: it's realisation is rubbish. It seems like the team spent all the budget on the movie part and the rest of the game, the interractive ""real"" playable part, was build using HL 1 engine. It's cheap, cubic, empty for the most part with plenty of 3D models repetitions trying to furnish the maps but failed.The level design, if I can call it that way, is madly wrong and screams: ""So boring to do those additional buildings, anyway you would have no interraction on them except maybe an optional object to find so why try harder"".No joke, I saw some better textures on Minecraft...Click on one of those ""useless buildings"" and enjoy Tex repeating again and again the same comment.Countless amounts of objects here and there triggering some ""flashback"" style videos getting the player back to the old episodes of the serie but with no links with the actual story would then finish the work and make you understand that the Dev's are just imploring you hands joined to buy the older episodes.Another epic fail was the translation. For those who master english, no problem at all. Characters are all on ol'time noir movies slang and they sounds great.Heh, me bad. english isn't my mother's tongue so I turned on the subtitles. I'm not stupid. I pretty well know that slang or expressions are sometimes really hard to translate as they sometimes got no compare on another language but dude!Who the hell did you guys picked to do the job? We have litteral translation here, word for word. Not any comprehension of the original meaning and worst, on some dialogues with multi answers choice it becomes plain luck to choose witch one you must or want choose from...So after all that was said, you would certainly ask yourself: ""So, good or not?""For myself, as a real lover of Tex' debuts, it will definitly be a YES. I played some serious ♥♥♥♥♥ way more awfull than that and enjoyed them.For new incomers, those who never played Under a Killing Moon and even don't know what is it, don't loose your time here.If you're just curious about the franchise, get yourself one of the firsts.

												If you liked the old Tex Murphy games, you'll enjoy this game too. Only downside for me what the framerate improvement kinda made this game hard to play for more than 30 minutes at a time without getting vertigo. My dad, who was the biggest fan of the series, couldn't handle the game even with the settings adjusted.			"

												Got this as part of a humble bundle, and boy am I glad I gave it a shot.  If you played 90s point and click games, have a soft spot for cheesy jokes and acting, or even just appreciate bad movies or watch MST3K, this will be right up your alley.  I imagine that this game was a dream come true for fans of the series since I loved it and hadn't played any of the prior games.   Took me a little over 10 hours to complete one playthrough and since the story was Interesting enough, I'll be playing this again for a different ending!PROS:Great point and click adventureGood puzzles (not the best, not the worst)Great video, music, and design qualityInteresting storyGood amount of humorPlenty of references to prior games that won't confuse those that aren't familiarSome of the actors are quite funnyCONS:Largely story based (as point and clicks tend to be)Some of the acting is lackluster, or unbelievableSome locations are utilized too little or too much, making you stay at some places much longer than othersSome pieces to puzzles may not be intuitive or may be hard to findMost, if not all, deaths in the game are attributed to cheap deaths that you can't really avoid without dying first			"

												Old tex is back. This game brings found memories back to life. The graphics is greatly improved, and it still got left the same feeling as back in the days. As an adventure game, is still works. But in many ways it could still have improved, the first thing that comes to mind is that the puzzles in the game is all very easy is mostly just clicking and you will get it right within a minute or two. I would have wanted more locations, and possibilty to visit them when they were unlocked, now it becomes very cinematic focused, and the story is so easy to progress throu because they nearly always tell you what to do and how to do it. The real detective feeling and the feeling of what am I suppost to do, dosen´t exist as in the other games.  Now if your lost it´s just a matter of finding the iteam they tell you that you need. For the nostalagic feeling and because of that these games isn´t made today it´s worth playing, but it goes very quick and all to easy.   "

												I've been playing the Tex Murphy games since Mean Streets, so needless to say I've waited patiently for a sequel for a long time!  Tex is back better than ever, and yet everything you'd expect from a Tex Murphy adventure is here and modern!  Play this, even if you don't play first person games.  Puzzels, mysteries and Tex's dry, sarcastic wit can be found everywhere!  Great place to start if you haven't tried Under a Killing Moon, Pandora Directive or Overseer.			"

												I liked Tesla Effect I felt it was on par with previous games in the Tex Murphy series if not the best game yet. Unfortunately my main criticism lies with the graphics and technical aspects of the game such as modelling. The full motion videos where amazing and are some of the best in the industry and are all displayed in 2K video. All the actors where suburb and the real stand outs for me where Mojo and Smart Alex (in addition to Tex himself). 5 out of 5. "

												Allot of nostalgia here. Good to see Tex Murphy again and play a new adventure with him. The story and acting is ok, a bit low budget though. It is occasionally funny. Especially when hearing Tex's comments when exploring the environment, On the other hand, the CGI is sometimes just terrible. And the 3D engine used for the 1.st person part is outdated by at least 5-8 years.			"

												a blasT froM The futurEI’ve been waiting for quite some time for Tex Murphy Tesla Effect to arrive, long before the Kick Starter campaign and anxiously ever since.I have a lot of fond memory from my childhood playing Under a Killing Moon, Pandora Directive and Overseer, I also tried playing Mean Street and Martian Memorandum, but those gave an entirely different experience from the FMV games and it did not appeal to me as much....and so came the big day, the 8th of may 2014, Tesla Effect was finally released.I tried pacing myself while playing it, but I couldn’t resist the temptation and ended up finishing it in 3 sessions of about 6 hours each.Tesla Effect delivers the essential elements of a Tex Murphy game and more, that being said there were a few things that bugged me which i will expand on shortly, but all and all, after finishing the game i felt like i got the experience i was looking and remembered so fondly.What is a Tex Murphy Game?Tex Murphy, is a First Person, FMV, Adventure game, that is very story driven and filled with amusing dialogues and challenging puzzles.So lets break it down to section:-First Person-In Telsa Effect there was a big improvement in the controls and navigation through the game’s world, instead of pushing Tex forward and backwards with mouse movements, you control Tex like in most First Person games, with the WSAD keys, which is a great improvement, although i would have given the choice to custom map those keys for a better UX, personally i would have even set the middle mouse button as a move forward trigger, the less i need to use the keyboard the better.Another thing i missed from previous Tex games was crouching and stretching, simply because it made it easier to search inside drawers and cabinets and i also liked it when items could have been placed on the inside bottom side of a table, so you need to crouch and look up to see it, it adds another dimension to the game.FMV:Full Motion Video, This is a big part of the game, each time you meet a character you will see an introduction movie, then you will have a branching narrative that evolves the story-line and effects the path and outcome of the game.Then you can interrogate the characters, ask them about other characters and get more information and clues that will help you move forward in the game.The FMV in Tesla Effect is done very nicely in a stunning 2K resolution and some great acting performances from the old cast and the new, my favorite one besides Tex is and always was rook, look for him in the pawnshop.Another thing i missed from the previous games in Tesla Effect is seeing the characters inside the playing environment and not just in the fmv, as much as it looked cheesy and did not add one bit to the game-play it made the world feel a little more alive.Adventure Puzzle Game:The adventure side of TE is pretty much the same as in the other games, there are 3 things you can do to advance.1. solve inventory puzzles, most of the time the item you need will be close by to where you need to use it, but others will be located far away or even in a different location, this sometimes requires an insane amount of pixel hunting, but that was always a part of it.You will also need to combine certain items to advance.2. The dialogues, ask the right character the right question or basically make sure you talk with everyone about everything, even if it’s not required to advance, the dialogues are the most fun part of the game, so don’t skip any.Another little thing that bugged me in the game was when i got stuck because a previous unavailable location became available and i had no idea that this location was even a part of the game, it was one of the rooms in the hotel, i would have give the player some indication that this location will be a part of the game later on, even if the character just scream at you through the door “Come back later, i can’t talk right now”, i would know i should try it again every time i get stuck (for those of you who played the game i am talking about Saffyre).3. the puzzles in TE are not easy by today’s standard, but are easier and somewhat plainer than in the previous installments, I remember getting stuck on the Mayan calendar puzzle in Pandora Directive for over a week, but solving it was 7 times more satisfying and rewarding, i acknowledge that most gamer today do not have the patience for this type of puzzles and i believe that’s why they were dumb down, but this was not a deal breaker for me and i enjoyed the puzzles nevertheless.There was a small issue that bothered me with some of the puzzle, the camera view was way too far and it was hard to see what’s going on in the puzzle, this happened in about 3-4 puzzles in the game.4. the graphics, there was and still is a lot of chatter around the graphics and 3D models used in TE, the graphics are 10 time better than the previous games and that is obviously expected, but they are a little dated, which may draw back some of today gamers, i personally enjoyed the art and it didn’t bothered me one bit, so just watch one of the videos online and judge for yourself.In conclusion:As I said in the beginning of this review, I enjoyed playing TE, i got the experience i was looking for, but I think there is room for improvement on future installments.I am looking forward to see how the gaming community will react to this game and hopefully i will get the pleasure of playing a new Tex Murphy game in the near future.For now i’ll settle for a second run through with a different path on Tesla Effect.Time Played: 10-20 hours			"

												A great sequel to the Tex Murphy games I grew up on.  So unusual to see a modern game in this style, but it works really well.  I'm amazed they were able to maintain the same spirit of the originals and they even have much of the cast back in their roles.  Would absolutely recommend to anyone that enjoyed Under a Killing Moon, The Pandora Directive, and Overseer.			"

I'm sure those are good for some nostalgia for old fans as well.This is an utterly fantastic game.			"

												If you can remember the Tex Murphy games of old (Under a killing moon when I was about 11 or 12, The clowns head in the toxic sludge) You'll certainly adore this one... all Tex's old haunts back in Glorious 3D and a major case to solve.It's good... but...It was done on a budget... Tex needs the hollywood Budget... it's too big a game to pass off for less than a few mill... What they've done is amazing... The FMV's are truely great. Interviewing people for clues is well done... but it needs to be bigger... There should be 3-4 Cases for Tex to be solving... I hope Modding crews get onto it... could be done (Although FMV's wont be usable... maybe freeze frames of the actors?) The low budget shows in the Graphics... although it's not too bad if you played the originals newbies will wtf at the seemingly dated graphics... most painful if you get a glimpse of an NPC. I do understand that the effort was put into the FMV's and storyline. Maybe TM7 will get the publisher backing it needs. The road Tex lives on has been brought to life... it does look good... it's not next gen graphics... certainly does the trick... but it's not as good as it should be for the wonderous game it is. Few other nitpicks about items generally being small and you have to painstakingly examine rooms inch by inch (Certainly on the harder mode where you don't have the flashlight and *Sparkle* effect on items of interest) But it is a long game... first playthough took around 20 hours on hard. Like I say finding items can be a task. But certainly a great deal longer than the 8 hours on the recent COD game... there are also multiple endings and multiple chat paths which is nice. Can't help but think if a couple of mill had been thrown at the game for a decent graphical engine we'd be looking at a Game Of The Year easily. It's all well and good for those who loved the originals and wish to find out what happened to Tex and is a nice bit of closure on one of Gamings underdogs. But it needs more... I hope someone out there reognises this is a niche market that does have a fanbase... there are plenty of mature gmaers who'd eat this up... also there are a whole hoard of younger gamers sick of the 'run here, shoot that, run here, shoot that' games that are released daily. Tex encourages you to use your mind. Aside from that... I'm well glad I have this in my libaray with the other Tex games... they'll easily come out on a wet weekend where I can sit down as NSF's finest PI and crack a case wide open.			"

												Got off to a rocky start when I had to wait for a patch to remove audio stuttering and very laggy gameplay, but after that it played wonderfully. The game itself was fantastic and I really enjoyed my time with it. I'm yet another of the Kickstarter backers so I could probably be expected to like the game (and it's pretty obvious the entire thing was aimed at fans of the old games), and everyone's already mentioned the downside of the 3D environment's quality (didn't really bother me until I got up close and personal with the occasionally encountered 3D character models, eurgh), but if you like sardonic quips, unravelling a mystery, and good FMV, you can't go wrong with a bit of Tex.If you haven't played this or any other game from this series before, you might want to start out with the classics, starting with Under a Killing Moon, then Pandora Directive and Overseer, which you can now find here on Steam or on GOG (The first two games, Mean Streets and Martian Memorandum, play somewhat differently to these later three, which introduced and expanded on the winning formula seen in Tesla Effect).

												Tex is back and that's a darn good thing!  Everything I enjoyed about the Tex Murphy adventures, the silly and witty puns, the surprisingly deep storylines, the crazy cast of characters and engaging puzzles are all here in the Tesla Effect.  This time, they're wrapped in shiny Ultra HD and the video is SHARP!  There's definitely a tongue-firmly-in-cheek, silly Mystery Science Theater 3000 flair to the sets, costumes and makeup for the filmed scenes - but that's a REALLY good thing!  It feels like you're playing a B movie which is exactly what the Tex Murphy adventures have always been.  To lose that kitchy appeal would completely ruin the experience.Tesla Effect is kind of a love letter to the fans, bringing back a large number of the cast from previous games.  There are a few jokes that won't quite zing if you haven't played the game before, but do not be discouraged if this is your intro to the Tex Murphy canon.  Thanks to some lovely flashbacks, new players can familiarize themselves with the past games' plots and characters.  NOTE: I still encourage anyone to play the previous games because they are wonderful - I actually replayed Under A Killing Moon, Pandora Directive, and Overseer before playing Tesla Effect.  These games have stood the test of time.  Sure, the graphics are dated, but the story, characters, gameplay and puzzles are just as much fun as they were when I first played them years ago.Chris Jones still has me cracking up as the titular character, Tex Murphy, and the rest of the cast is obviously having a ball as well.  The puzzles are overall very good - similar in difficulty and creativity to those from the past games.  There are multiple endings (of which I have only found 2 thus far, but I hear there are at least 4) which are unique and worth replaying the game for.My only minor gripe is that the in-game graphics were only ok.  And that's mainly because so many of the textures were low resolution and some were sloppily applied to the models.  While this didn't detract or deter my enjoyment of the game, I would have liked to have seen a little more care put into the in-game graphics - the same kind of care that was put into the film sequences. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Tesla Effect and I hope that Tex Murphy will be back again soon to again save the world from annihilation. "

												Several hours into this game and Tex has infiltrated a creepy cult, and been told of an invention that would remove the veil between the living and the dead.  Also, a guy jumped to his death in front of Tex's eyes, right before Tex was propositioned by two entirely separate ladies.In other words, this game put a smile on my face.  If you love stories and characters at all--and don't mind a presentation that at times can feel a little ""stripped down"" (but charmingly so)--then I can guarantee you'll enjoy this game.  The light humor and noir atmosphere certainly don't hurt either.If you're wondering if you have to already be familiar with the Tex Murphy games to enjoy this, the answer is no.  Take it from me, as I've never played any of them before this one.  In fact, I only have a vague knowledge of what they even were based on hearing them being mentioned so many times on adventure game forums.  (I also once downloaded and listened to the humorous ""Tex Murphy Radio theater"" based on these characters.)I was aware of the Kickstarter campaign that got this game made, however.  And I find it miraculous that for such a low budget, they were able to produce this polished an experience.  (The team must be friends with a lot of people in the industry.)  No, it does not look like a ""real"" movie.  It's not quite that cinematic.  But coming from someone whose previous experiences with FMV (Full Motion Video) games included Gabriel Knight 2 and Phantasmagoria, this has to be just about the most polished FMV game ever made.  This may be damning with faint praise, but you can easily find clips and stills of the game in action on the net and decide for yourself if the ""FMV"" look is something you can enjoy.Special mention has to be made about the music though.  I said before that the look of the game wasn't quite on par with a ""real"" movie.  Well, the same can't be said for the music.  It's fantastic, and would easily fit in with any high-budget mainstream film.I do also want to make special note of the acting.  I see some people have called it ""cheesy"" or bad.  I could not disagree more.  Most everyone in the cast is very good, and any ""cheesiness"" seems to be ithrough intentional over the top hamming it up--all in good fun.  I think if at times it comes off as a bit amateur it is through no fault of the actors themselves.  Basically, this was shot in a very ""matter of fact"" way with HD cameras that don't entirely convey a purely cinematic look.  Add to that, for the ""interrogation scenes"" the actors have been instructed to stand dead center in front of the camera and looking directly into the lens the entire time.  It's really hard to come across as natural under such circumstances.  The fact that they largely manage to do so is a credit to them.Anyway, if you're a fan of the adventure genre--specifically because you're a fan of story and character--then you should give this a whirl.***I do have a few criticisms, though.  In no way do they make the game unworthy of purchase, but just know that they're there:  I wish that the streets you navigate through had been populated by some NPCs so as to create a more alive feel to the world.It should also be noted that the latter stages of the game are not as much fun as the first half.  Other reviews have mentioned the unfortunate presence of ""pixel hunting"" in this game.  While that's true, let me just clarify what that term means in Tesla Effect.  In the old days of adventure gaming, pixel hunting meant that one had to move their mouse all over the screen and click on just the right spot for the game to recognize they'd clicked on the correct object.  That's not quite what it means in the case of Tesla.There aren't truly any areas of the screen to confuse the player as to its ""clickability.""  Nor are there any objects so small that one can't precisely place their mouse over it.  (After all, when Tex turns his flashlight on, any such objects that tex needs to interact with immediately sparkle.)  What IS an issue however is that the latter half of the game is largely taken up with First-Person Doom like navigating around some real-time environments while Tex/you must find different objects, push buttons, etc.  I know most people wouldn't find such gameplay an issue.  In fact, first person, Blair Witch-like experiences are (unfortuantely) what most gamers have come to think of when you say ""video game"" to them.  For a lot of people, videogames are nothing BUT that.However, that's not the kind of experience I treasure in a game.  I enjoy games (particularly Adventure games) for the characters and story--elements that Tesla Effect has in spades at the beginning, but which gradually dissipate as the game goes on.  Unfortunately, as the player wanders around these vast, sterile 3D environments (the multi-floored ""Tesla Society"" building being the worst, in that it never ends), much of that sense of character and story is lost.  Yes, sometimes you'll hear Tex's voiceover comment on something when you encounter a locked door or whatever, but it's not enough to remove the sense that, yup, you're currently playing a game similar to 99% of games that people play these days.The cut-scenes and sense of story do return at the end, thankfully.  However, it's not until after the player has slogged their way through a lot of tedium.			"

												I played two previous Tex Murphy adventures when I was younger: Killing Moon and Pandora Directive.  This new game is better than both of them.  It still features most of the original cast that you know and love but vastly improves on the control interface.  Gone is that clunky old ""push the mouse button to move, use the arrow keys to look up and down"" interface.  It's now a streamlined WASD movement configuration that everyone is used to by now.  It still has the great puzzles and sense of humor.  I highly recommend it.			"

												I was introduced to Tex Murphy many years ago.  I sat up all night and fell asleep at school because I was so involved in the story and the world.  Fast forward to today and I am thrilled to be playing another game feature the curiously competent incompetent detective.  Tesla Effect is funny, clever and involving.  It seems to me a bit easier than previous installments but nonetheless no less enjoyable.  If I had a complaint it would be that it was way too short but hey, we can always cross fingers for Tex 7!

												I have to say that Tesla Effect turned out to be a lot better than I had imagined. The good things that made the old 90's games so enjoyable were still there: the gloomy, post-apocalyptic sci-fi setting, the tounge-in-cheek-film noir/detective investigative style, the wonderfully sleazy jazz soundtrack, and the cheesy, daytime soap-/b-level class acting. I was even pleasantly surprised that the graphics were as good as they were, with overall really nicely rendered 3D, even if worked a lot better with the environments/bakgrounds than anything that was supposed to resemble people.Still, Tesla Effect is by no means any masterpiece - for a game that took a lot of the great things from the original franchise and tweaked, improved and polished it, there was a surprising amount of things left in that you figured would have been removed. Just like previous games, there are a lot of rather frustrating and tedious logic puzzles that break the mood of the story by not really feeling like they are connected to anything in the games story, apart from being an excuse to throw in slider puzzles to lengthen the gameplay. But then again, those have always has been present in the Tex Murphy games, so I suppose it's not too surprising, but Tesla Effect definately seems to have A LOT more of them than previous games. (And yes, there even is a kind of a short maze puzzle. Not an old-school-bad maze, but still.) I would definately have liked more of the inventory- and investigative puzzles.However, the absolute worst thing is probably the extremely annoying bug that seems to be a common problem for a lot of people, where the audio/graphics of the game stutter and lag to point of almost making the game unplayable at times. That did remove quite a lot of the enjoyment from the game, and hopefully it's something that will be patched/fixed in the future.So, in the end, would I recommend Tesla Effect? Well, yes. If you played any of the earlier games and liked them: absolutely.  Tesla Effect captures the exact same feeling and mood that made both Under a Killing Moon and The Pandora Directive thourougly enjoyable. Story-wise, it's a nice and interesting plot that tries to tie together a lot of loose threads, and partly succeeds, even though it doesn't carry quite the same weight of conspiracy and thrill of it's predecessors. You might enjoy it even if you haven't played the previous ones and just like post-apocalyptic sci-fi/film noir, but I think a lot of the charm does come from its association with the previous games. An enjoyable, if not perfect return from San Francisco's most bumbling gum-shoe.			"

												I wasted many hours of my youth in the 90's playing the Tex Murphy Adventures and it's great to see it back without being changed, updated, adjusted or mutilated for todays modern audience. It doesn't need it! It’s great to see a classic style game brought to life with the same love, care and attention that was given to the originals. From the funny, over the top but brilliant acting in the FMV scenes, to the vivid albeit dated graphics and interesting story, the game is a work of art. The story, while perhaps not quite upto the standards of previous adventures, is fun and keeps you interested throughout. Fantastic game. Other developers should take note and could learn a lot from this! Buy it now!Pros+Tex is back!!!+Great to see an old series brought back to life in the same spirit as previously without ruining it+Brilliant acting+HD FMV+In places it’s hilarious +Interesting and challenging puzzles+Decent story+Good sound and music+Runs great with few bugs - uses the Unity EngineCons-Interface is not the greatest-Graphics are dated (though this is not really a down side and has no negative impact in the game, they just could have been a bit better) "

												I have never played a Tex Murphy adventure, but after playing this, I will certainly play more. The characters are charming and quirky, without the forced emotional ties that many heavy narrative based games tend to give you. I liked Tex almost instantly, and found his confused amnesia-based plotline really helpful in introducing such an interesting world to new players. I never felt left out, so to speak, by not playing the older games, and am looking forward to sharing this game with friends.			"

												After 16 years Tex Murphy is back and how!Tesla Effect is the best adventure i have played in the past decade. Everything about this game shows it has been made with a lot of love and passion for the genre. The story is nothing short of amazing, the graphics although they could have been better they aren't bad either and get the job done. The music is just plain and simple amazing this has to be one of the best soundtracks in recent years.If you played the previous Tex Murphy games you know what to expect and will love every minute. If you never played a Tex Murphy game shame on you! Those were the best adventures back in the day and they showed Tex is still the man to go to for your adventure fix.With 3 possible paths through the game and 5 different endings the game offers replay value and bang for your buck since my 1st playthrough took me 15 hours. 10/10 BUY THIS GAME!

												I've never played any point and click adventure games before. Never really saw the attraction. But, this game definately shows some of the best of what that genre must have to offer. A slick satire of the entire genre, packed with references to it's root, and modern pop culture, you play as a walking, talking parody  of the Film Noir Grizzled Detective trope in a Shadowrun-esque 2050, filled with mutants, radiation, and a story that seems way to intense for the shlock the game revels in for the first half of the game, but, after a harrowing, almost horror-esque section at the end of the second act, it hits it's tone nicely. If you like point and click adventure games, this is probably going to be quite the fun ride.Like playing Fallout New Vegas on wakcy wasteland, but wish there was less shooting, and more interacting with NPCs? You've struck gold.Just looking for a fun way to spend an evening or two? You could do worse. Much, much worse.			"

												There is a lot of emphasis on the ""full motion video"" part, but in the end, it's a point & click adventure in a 3D engine. The 3D environments could be better, though -- but the cutscenes are what you'll be hoping for anyway. And while it's not an hundreds of million dollars movie production, they are quite nice.Tex also doesn't get boring when examining stuff, unless you count the repeats when clicking on the same kind of item in the same environment and get the same comment again.The gameplay isn't too bad. I wasn't a big fan of some areas, when they put a timer on things or made you sneak around stealthy, but it could be worse. Playing in ""casual"" mode lets you skip some puzzles if you want to -- it will cost you some points, just like getting yourself killed does, but points don't matter anyway.Likewise, there's supposed to be multiple endings, but I doubt they are THAT different. You'll complete the objective, so what? Options in dialogues are usually vague, so you never know what you're saying or where you're heading; I just randomly clicked an answer. I still liked the game -- again, not much of a difference compared to a game where the outcome is fixed anyway. "

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.One on its kind.  Adventure game with real 3D scenarios and, where all dialogs with characters and all cinematics are videos, like in a series B film. The atmosphear of the videos is somewhat similar to Doctor Who and that kind of TV series with that odd series B look.Story line is strong, deep and interesting enough. Typical anti-hero detectivesque atmosphear but, full of humor, as well.Puzzles aren't mostly that hard and, usually easy to figure out (except very few). Things to do are so variate that you don't go easily bored.It takes a little while to understand games mechanics, since your character wakes up with no memories and, in a world where you can freely move. The tips come when you interact with characters and, your memory gaps start to be filled in.3D graphics aren't spectacular but, serve to the purpose.Voice acting is good and actors do a good job.Translation is a tad defective, at least, in Spanish. This can confuse you about tips and clues. Bad translated words or sentences can lead you to a dead end.Well, this game greatefuly surprised me!. Even that it got lot of topics, it's good enough.

												I just beat the game and quite enjoyed it. It's certainly something different from conventional games, both in terms of gameplay and its awesome FMV storytelling. The narrative was well-written and the characters were well-played. Sometimes the gameplay got a little frustrating when looking for something for a long time, but you can always get a hint when you need one. The music was great near the end but slightly lacking in the earlier parts. My main complaint with the game is how its graphics feel like they're from around 2006 when the game was made in 2014. Things are very low-poly and the texture resolution is pretty bad. As a result, the worlds felt much less immersive and engaging than they could have. I felt more time should have been put into the level art. The backgrounds of the FMV scenes were also from the in-game scenes so they were also lacking in visual fidelity except at the ending which was pre-rendered out-of-engine (and, as such, was quite awesome!) Due to the graphics and slightly slow gameplay, I would give this a 7/10 rating. It wasn't fantastic because it felt rather lifeless during the gameplay portions but it was still a very enjoyable story with some pretty unique FMV which is uncommon in gaming!			"

												At last, what seemed impossible after all these years, becomes a reality....a new tex murphy adventure!The best thing about this series always was the characters, the way they are played by real actors with fmv technology. It doesn't matter how good 3d graphics are , because to be able to watch a character being played by real human being it gives something to the player that it is impossible to emulate with computers. All this depends on the actor's interpretation and how good he is or she is of course.The story, interestingly enough, has good potential...being about Nicola Tesla, his revolutionary creations,  but...finally...it is a total waste. The story wich begins very very well, goes nowhere, and besides that, the narrative it is a total mess by the second half of the game. Really sad because there was some good beginnings there. Technically.... the game is 50 / 50. The fmv (video) parts are great, they are filmed with a 4k digital camera and they had a pretty good post production work. Not so much the production part, wich alltough it has great work done with the green screen and the actors, it has, from time to time, some basic image errors, like complete out of focus sequences, bad editing, weird cuts, and bad compositing (some sequences doesn't make too much sense, the character says something you should know, but in fact you don't , because you didn't play that part. And for a game that plays with choices and interactive fiction, that's a big mistake sadly. Even then....if you played a previous tex murphy game (the last one was from 1998....) you can clearly see the advancements in video technology and what it can be done today, and that's a great thing. Mixing real actors with computer graphics has come a long way.The 3d graphics on the other hand.... they are pretty bad, mediocre at best, even taking into consideration that they are done by a small team with little budget to spend, they could have done better even with this budget. Maybe they should have hired some people for making the 3d graphics part, because it has proven in many games that camed out recently, that you can do much better than this, even with low budget...you just have to know your limitations and hire someone who can make good use of the available tools.Finally, this is and adventure for people that played tex murphy adventures in the past, and wants to have some closure to the characters they knew from the 90s, reuniting one more last time. A bitersweet ending.To newcomers maybe you should pass.UPDATE 24/03/2016 :Finally after playing many adventure gamers from 2014, i have to say my opinion for tesla effect changed drastically. I still am happy to have played one more time with tex murphy, and to be able to put and end to his story. I am happy also to see what can be done with fmv in 2014, it is great. But the adventure has many problems , beginning with the story, the story has potential,begins interesting enough, but goes nowhere, and it is a mess of a narrative by the second half. There are some parts of the story that are necesary to understand what is hapenning and they are blocked from the player in certain paths. So you are playing , tex suddenly starts saying something HE knows, but you don't and the player gets totally lost. Then the story itself becomes completely ridiculous with all that happens after the first half....the guy dressed as the phantom of the opera, the 2 girls throwing themselves at tex (we are a little old for those games right?) the egyptian temple of the followers of tesla, wich works as a military base (???) the 3d graphics are horrible, it's not excuse to have low budget, better things can be done with it, you just need the right people to do it. As they are, the graphics for this game seem made in the 90s... And to be honest, when i played tex murphy games in the 90s, they not only had great FMV , but also great 3d graphics for that time. Those  games were pretty advanced, in all regards. I m sad to say this but Tesla effect is not that.			"

OverviewIt’s like going back in time. To 1994, to be exact, when Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon came out. It was a live-action, point-and-click adventure game, with bad acting, cheesy special effects, but a story that was pretty interesting and gameplay that backed it up nicely.Want the TL:DR?A great throwback to two decades ago, with an interesting story, and the same cheesy special effects and acting. It’s brought down by blurry graphics and a multitude of clipping issues, and is overly short. Play it in Gamer mode, not Casual, for the best experience.The Good+ Story. Like the previous games, the story is what makes this game. It’s humorous, serious, and at times, weird and offputting. But that’s the draw. There is lots to take in, from the required story portions to the optional questions you can ask pretty much anybody, all in typically cheese FMV.+ Acting. The acting is cheesy, and not the greatest, but it beats the previous games. Tex really is a character you’ll want to hate.+ Puzzles. Some of the puzzles are odd, but most wind up fitting nicely into the theme of the game. However, they’re all pretty easy, and you shouldn’t have any issues whatsoever with any of them.The Bad- Clipping. My word, the clipping is atrocious. You’ll clearly clip through windows, doors, gates and holes. It’s as if the dev’s didn’t even try to add collision detection. The worst is when you clip through a wall you clearly should be ducking under, but can’t because there’s no duck option, yet when you watch the subsequent cutscene, the people duck under through. It’s odd.- Poor graphics. Very poor graphics. Walls and backgrounds are blurry, the flashlight looks weird. A non-static point-and-click game doesn’t need to have the fanciest of graphics, but these are just bad.- Very short. The game can be completed in a couple of hours, and if you play on Casual mode, every object that is of importance sparkles for you when you shine the flashlight over it. Playing in Gamer mode removes the sparkle, as well as stops you from asking for hints, but it’s still over very quick.			"

												As someone who grew up playing computer games in the 90s, Tesla Effect offers a fantastic return to an era when the capabilities of the computers of the day were pushed beyond their boundaries with spectacular results. While Tesla Effect won't tax any modern computer, it still offers a compelling game with good graphics, which will hopefully stand the test of time.I'm a diehard Tex Murphy Fan. When I first started the series with Under a Killing Moon and its four CDs under DOS, I was instantly hooked. Having played the games that followed, I was always keen for more, so when Microsoft bought Access and effectively killed Tex Murphy, especially after the cliff-hanger that ended Overseer, I was devastated. Thankfully, due to a successful Kickstarter campaign, we now have a conclusion to that story, with spectacular results.Tesla Effect continues the same formula as its preceding games, which is actually not a bad thing. If you've ever played Under a Killing Moon, Pandora Directive or Overseer, then you know what you're getting into. In terms of gameplay mechanics, Tesla Effect benefits greatly from being produced in the modern era, with fantastic graphics and a solid control system in place that's a massive improvement from the clunky controls (relatively speaking) of the prior games.Tesla Effect continues the trend of Full Motion Video (FMV) embedded within a digital game world the franchise was famous for, which offers a great experience. While most games these days tend to use digital models for people, Tesla Effect, and its preceding games, capture real actors and place them within their digital environments. This provides for (IMO) a much better story delivery method, which has always been used to great effect in the Tex franchise.While the game can be played stand-alone, it's probably better if you jump back to Overseer as its story bleeds into Tesla Effect's to a degree. There's plenty of homage to the franchise, which should bring great excitement to fans (Which I certainly loved!), but it may not have the same effect on those who've never played the series before.Tesla Effect essentially boils down to a detective adventure game within a 3D world you can explore. It is loaded with lots of puzzles for you to sink your teeth into, as well as a witty story rife with choice. You will be expected to look closely at the environment to find elements to assist you on your quest, which at times can be a little irritating as the items are either obscure, or blend into their environments a little too well, but the reward for correctly identifying, combining and utilising the items is satisfying.All interactions with characters are provided through simple but vague options which you can choose. Importantly, the game is designed such that the choices you make as you interact with the characters have the ability to shape the game's ending, which is nice. Each of the options provides an interesting and often humorous reply from Tex, sometimes leading to your downfall if approached poorly.For fans of the series, all of the key actors are back and this is absolutely fantastic. It's great to see so many actors from the franchise put their hands up to recast their roles after such a long time, which provides great continuation for the series and continues to anchor the game in the franchise's world. The new cast members for this game, such as ""The Soup Nazi"", also work well, but there are also a few other well known celebrity actors included in the game too, much like in the earlier games.Overall, if you're a Tex Murphy fan, most definitely pick this up. If you've never played Tex Murphy games before, you owe it to yourself to try out what was, in my opinion, one of the greatest gaming franchises of the 90s. If you’ve never played Tex games before, pick up the preceding three games and give these a go too. While their graphics become increasingly dated and ordinary with age, their stories and detective mechanics are what really make them shine, and therefore, still worth pursuing.Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure, is a game I most highly recommend!

												I've played through all but Overseer of the previous Tex Murphey adventures when they first came out and had varying amounts of nostalgia for them, but I much prefered the later fully FMV entries in the series and Tesla Effect is a really fun conclusion.  Now I have to actually go back and finish my playthrough of Overseer, which I have kicking around somewhere.  But back to Tesla Effect.The best parts of the whole thing are the cast.  A few are soooo bad it's hilarious, most are decent, and a few, especially Tex himself and Rook, are really great.  Lots of laughs.  The humor from the previous games has survived.The story is interesting at first, but about 2/3 of the way in, things start getting weirdly complicated, like four or five people were writing while off on their own and then feeding their plotlines into the final product with only occasional collaboration.  I mean, you could follow what was happening, but it got pretty dumb by the end.  Also, while I very much appreciated the handful of branching choices, I would have liked more contextual clues when they popped up.  On my first playthrough I got one of the odd endings that didn't feel like it really fit the overall story up until that point, because of a single choice I took to be a joke at first.Gameplay is all about picking up everything that is pick-up-able, examining and trying different combinations of items, as well as asking every single person you encounter about every single topic available.  Death traps are situational and sometimes annoyingly cheap (I'm looking at you stealth section and lab exploration).  There is no combat.  It is a point-and-click adventure, afterall.The puzzles range from simple speed bumps a small child could solve, to the occasional head-scratcher needing a bit of trial and error, to the classic adventure game standby of ""now what were the devs thinking when they came up with this one"", where you have to imagine what would make sense in the immediate context rather than what would work in real life.The FMVs were all very clear and polished, while the rendered art style was classic Tex, and barely updated.  The devs were clearly writing a love letter to the series, the characters and the old school fans.  I had a great few nights running through this with nostalgia goggles on, and will probably do so again after I finish Overseer.  I would highly reccomend this to any fans of the early 90s FMV adventure genre, and it's a must have for anyone wanting to see one last Tex Murphy case.  If you're neither, however, odds are you'd be better off just watching a Let's Play, if only for the cutscenes, because the older style and sensibilities will probably be lost on you.			"

Both the puzzles and the graphics are nothing to write home about, but if you're looking for old school FMV Tex Murphy you should not be disappointed.			"

												Once again, the people behind this series have gone and done another great job of making a classic adventure game into yet ANOTHER classic adventure game.Tesla Effect is another story adventure of the Tex Murphy series. Although just another adventure game, it's not just the adventure game part. It's the ""tongue in cheek"" humor that, anyone who knows this game well, understands and appreciates.In this game, you are, once again, Tex Murphy, P.I., working on another case. Becuase of the humor it presents, there are MANY jokes and references to many icons, cultures, and even some movies and music. Indiana Jones, 1960's song, even flashbacks of the previous games, are in this adventure game.One thing that has not changed since the beginning is that they have used the same actor for all the Tex Murphy games. Because I have been a big fan of this series, it's great to see some things are not lost and haven't changed. Atlus designed a great game that follows how ""Access Software"" used to make. Thank you for making a classical game more classical than ever and keeping the original actor for this game.			"

												First and foremost, welcome back Tex!!! I have missed you!!  Been 16 years I have been waiting to find out what happened to Tex and Chelsea at the end of Overseer and I never thought I would see another game after Microsoft bought out Access Software and pretty much killed it all. But here we are and those questions have been answered. For any Tex Murphy fan, this is a must have. Is it tough seeing him aged?? Yes. Is this game as groundbreaking as the games he released in the 90's. No. But this game is still a blast.The graphics aren't spetacular, but they are solid and the  cutscenes are excellent. The same Tex wit we were used to then is still present in this game and i found myself laughing throughout the game. And the host of co-start is also present here just like in the all the other games. There are also many items throughout the game that u click that takes you back to the old games and shows you clips from those games as well.This game also brings back many characters from those older games and keeps the nostalgia going, making this feel like old times.Some of the puzzles are quite complicated and there is very little direction as to what you are supposed to do, but eventually, it can be figured out and solved. Most of the puzzles are very cool and the game continues to move at a fairly quick pace. But be sure to search and click on everything you can find because there are several little gems to be found that are absolutely hilarious.When the game ended, there was alot of hope that this would not be the last, and I hope that is the case. There is alot left in the series as far as I am concerned and I hope to enjoy a couple of more games before they call it quits.Thanks Chris Jones and Adrian Carr for keeping Tex alive and please don't give up. there are hardocre fans out there who have been waiting for this and will suppport you as much as we can. .Until then, I have this game, and if you don't have it (especially you Tex fans), get it. Nice price for an excellent challenging game.			"

												Tesla Effect is a Tex Murphy game for the fans. If you enjoyed the previous FMV Tex Murphy games, you can buy this game now. Essentially the same basic idea, but witch better FMV. Better yet, the stories will tie all the loose ends together/ If you are not familiar with the Tex Murphy series: it's more or less an interactive movie / adventure game. You need to solve puzzles and collect/use different items to progress. The game has film noir /  comedy / over the top vibe to it, so you must be in to that.  I really liked the humor and the story-line. The game has 5 paths and 5 endings, so there is some replay value. Off course, once you figure the puzzles out, the game will progress much faster. Don't expect hq graphics or blistering action. Your reflexes will not be tested. Just sit back and relax the show, the cut scenes can be very long. Recommended if you want to check out what the FMV-hype was all about or if you like the Tex Murphy series.			"

												After waiting decades for this sequel, I REALLY wanted to love this game. And then I found I really wanted to at least mildly enjoy it. And then I really just wanted to finish it and get it out of the way to free up my HD.I'm an oldschool fan of the Tex Murphy series, and have played all the previous games multiple times, and still have fond memories of those previous games. But this game was a tragic pig-piling of incredibly vague dialogue choices, badly cliched characterization, lame sexist jokes, and all around a boring story with no mystery.As far as gameplay and puzzles go, it's pretty much what you'd expect from any other point and click. Most of the puzzles were fun, but some where just so obscure and unintuitive in their execution that I often found myself rolling my eyes and sighing more and more.Being a fan of point and click adventure games, and having been an avid Tex Murphy fan, I can't even honsetly recommend this game to other Tex Murphy fans, let alone other adventure gamers. Don't waste your time with this one.			"

												I would give this neutral if I could, but when I thought if I'd recommend it to a friend, the answer's probably no. If you like Tex Murphy out of nostalgia purposes, then go ahead and buy it. The game really is funny. I definitely chuckled sometimes, but there were other times when I was super frustrated playing this game. My computer just doesn't run this thing well. There is massive lag and framerate issues. Now my computer isn't no prize chicken, but it can run Skyrim, Fallout, Civilization, and other graphic intensive games. The graphics of this game don't even hold a candle so it's a wonder why my computer can't play it. As for gameplay and story, it is just ""Eh."" I kind of had to force myself to continue.			"

												16-year gap since last Tex Murphy game is not apparent at all! Except for HD movie clips, the game looks like it had been released in 2000 :) (3D engine looks exactly like that). This is not a negative, just a fact.Therefore the gameplay is very nostalgic. Deliberately nostalgic, as the game contains many flashbacks in the form of original UAKM or TPD movies in 30x20 resolution.The good thing is that the game finally has normal FPS controls!And the game is much much easier that its predecessors. I finished it on my own and never got stuck. Unlike first 3 games which are IMHO unsolvable for common mortals without walkthroughs.And Chandler Avenue is slanted! I've never noticed that before!

												I adored the old Tex Murphy games, and really wanted to like this one.The first half of the game is great, but the second half is bogged down witha storyline that just gets more and more convoluted and confusing, topped offwith everything that was bad about 90's PC adventure games...mazes with invisibleinstant death monsters patrolling...and trial-and-error puzzles that defy any logic.

												I played all the Tex Murphy adventures.   I rate The Tesla Effect 6 out of 10.  I do/did not enjoy the timed content in any of these games but the ending for Tesla Effect was just plain bad.  This game used dark areas that you could not find items unless using the flashlight, and that would cost you points.... bad... needed a play choice for using the flashlight in casual mode without losing points.Some of the ""puzzles"" were without clear instuctions, or without any instructions.I appreciate the difficulty to bring this game out, and the delay, and I did enjoy playing it.  I hope there will be more.			"

												Though the humour is at times cliche and overdone, the story itself is awesome.  There's TONS of cut scenes and video footage to go along with the story.  The puzzles are nice - not too tricky, but not too easy either, and the use of ""casual mode"" makes it a bit easier to find key items in the game.  I would absolutely recommend this game to anybody looking for a fun adventure game to play.  But please be mindful of your internet bandwidth, as 16 gigs is pretty steep.[Edit]My only *real* gripe about the game is the points system.  It seems that dying takes away A LOT of points.  It could be debated that this adds to the challenge, but I've always been a fan of intentionally doing stupid things in adventure games to see how the programmers went about them.  This means intentionally falling off cliffs etc.  If I could make one suggestion, it would be to make the points system based on finding items, examining things, and solving puzzles; and not have points deducted for dying (or, lessen the blow of lost points during deaths)			"

												Tesla Effect is a faithful continuation of Tex Murphy’s adventures: Chandler Avenue, goofy humor, convoluted plot, cheesy FMV scenes, action/stealth sequences, piling of seemingly random names and facts in the beginning that gradually start making sense after the middle – it’s all in there.The graphics and FMVs look 2000-ish, although the movie resolution is quite high (and I played on a 3D display that added a bit of 2014-ness to the first-person parts ;-) ). The puzzles are neither too easy nor too difficult. Some objects are hard to find but in casual mode there is a way to highlight them. The acting is hit-and-miss. The music fits well. The UI could be better but both UI and character controls are much more convenient than in the previous games.The games from this series are entertaining in the same way as a good tongue-in-cheek B-movie. I think old fans that loved the previous installments for what they were are likely to enjoy this one. People expecting state-of-the-art graphics and movie-quality acting as given may be disappointed.			"

												A little disappointed.  While I enjoyed having the chance to revisit my earlier days of Tex Murphy and I did have a few chuckles, it just didn't have the same spark.  Image looked better, but the production value was poor.  Low video quality might have been better for this dated series as the poor makeup quality might not have been as noticeable.  Given the advancements in texturing, the texture quality was quite poor.  The acting reminded me of some high school preformances I had to sit through with a lot of redundant dialog visual descriptions.  I replayed the previous adventures for the different outcomes But will not with this latest installment.  There was nothing new here and I will just watch the alternate endings on youtube. I only paid $5 for it, so I guess it was worth that and play through only took about 16 hours.			"

												The best word I can use to describe the Tesla Effect is mediocre.  There are some things the game does really well and some things that were disappointing.The look of the game was overall good the cg backgrounds only sometimes clashing with the actors in front of a green screen.  There were some cut scenes that I wish they actually had real sets.The acting was good with the exception of a few characters.Where I take issue with the game is in the story.  Tesla Effect seems to want to ride the rails between serious noir detective story and goofy comedic game which was to its detriment.  One minute Tex has a bad pun and the next there's people getting violently murdered and heavy sexual innuendo.  I would have much prefered the game if they picked one direction and stuck with it.The gameplay is in the very traditional adventure game style of: use x on y and combine x with z, so if you like that it's fine.The puzzles with one exception were well done (if not a little easy) with the exception of one which requires the player to know of an ancient egyptian puzzle from outside the game to know what the goal of the puzzle is.As a new player to the Tex Murphy series, I found the game to be geared too much towards old players.  Several Items are strewn about the game that if you click on them it plays a clip from an old game.  I think these were supposed to be funny parts from the originals, but without their context i didn't find them funny at all, just stange and confusing.If you are a fan of the series you probably will like it, but if like me you are an adventure gamer new to Tex you'll probably be unimpressed.  Maybe buy it on sale.			"

(that you play) makes some laughts. i hope the make more games with this style! What L.A.Confidentail realy sucks on emotions are here very good. To bad it was on cost of graphic quality ingame, the game is not realy pretty.Some parts are realy anoying, for example some running again and again scenes, because you missed a clue and have to run all back. Another realy bad thing is that some puzzles are very unlogical and not to solve with thinking.I think it can be bought, but maybe at a cheap price 19,99€ (now) is to much.			"

												The old games were really enjoyable and this is clearly designed to be a throwback to those.In terms of graphics and experience, this stays true to the older games.  It's questionable whether or not that's a good thing.  For fans of the older games, no doubt it's a welcome gaming experience.The script is decent and most of the old actors are back.  The story is linked to older games so may not make total sense to anyone new coming into this.  The story is a little convoluted, but the game have a decent gaming engine.Where this game falls down are the almost pointless puzzles which crop up in every so often.  They seem to add nothing to the storyline or gameplay.  They're not even particularly challenging in terms of intelligence, seeming to require a mastery of the mouse which is uneccessary in any other game.Disappointing.			"

												For fans of the old games, this is probably amazing. As someone new to the series who's an active fan of adventure games, it's all right. The acting is goofy enough that you can usually get a few laughs out of each cutscene. The adventure game logic is actually pretty reasonable most of the time (stick + glue = stick with glue on it). The environments have a rendering quality somewhere between the donkey kong show and the jimmy neutron show. The story is subpar and has strange pacing, but that's typical. All in all, it was an all right experience and I'm glad I bought it on the humble bundle so I only paid like 64 cents for it. IF you get it cheap and you like adventure games, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, meh.			"

												Long, long, long time Tex Murphy fan here, one of the ones that was actively pining away for a new Tex after Overseer abruptly ended.  I have to sadly say, that at this time, I am not impressed.  I'll keep it simple...-The first person camera is poorly done, and leaves me with severe sea sickness like queezy feeling, even for hours after I save and close down the game session. (fiddling with the field of view in options helps but doesn't completely fix this problem)  I've played First person shooters for years, and I don't have this problem with AAA designed FPS titles that perfect the veiwing angle, which eliminates motion sickness for me-Opening game story/writing is very bad-dialog writing and acting delivery is extremely bad and lacking the charm of the old Tex games.  Tex was never known for great acting, but he was known to pull off bad acting and all sorts of hokiness with a fantastic endearing quality and I'm just not agreeing with it in this new release.-the early game puzzles are really lame (Spoiler' ' an overly complicated and obnoxious game of simon and running all over town without much aim or directive just to find a ladder and have some forced introductions with currently useless new characters who aren't very interesting ' ')-I cannot stand the Mystery Science Theatre sounding PDA voice that is constantly a part of the game, it's the voice of the personal electronic organizer.  I'd rather be alone with Tex's internal monologue and not annoying interuptions of MST voices popping in with awful one liners and insults.I only played through the first hour or so of the game + I finished the entire demo before the final game was released.  I found the demo to be a tad bit better than the intro of the new Tex game, so perhaps the game gets better as it goes on, but with nothing so far that I find endearing or appealing combined with the naseau inducing first person camera implementation, and I don't think I'll be back to find out if I'm missing out or not.Personally I'd rather replay UAKM or Pandora Directive or go replay Myst III, IV and V than try this again anytime soon.Sorry Tex, I still love ya, but please, try again.

												Warning: I have no nostalgia for older titles in this genre. I did not complete the game for reasons which are clarified below.What the game got right:This game is very cheesy. The cutscenes and character interactions, the one-liners from the PI you play as -- those are the strong points of this game. The FMV parts of the game are really well done: the resolution doesn't make you feel sick, the green screen is just viewable around the edges of the characters but not too distracting. The 2k resolution for the FMV sequences is probably nice for people who have the hardware to display that kind of thing. What it got wrong:However, I would not recommend this game. It just doesn't feel like a game. On top of that, the graphics of the main street you first walk around it sicken me. It feels like Deus Ex. Both games were set in the future, and both games look like they were made in 2000. Deus Ex WAS released in 2000, but Tesla Effect was released in 2014. There's a car I saw on Main street that looked almost exactly like a flattened blackened, car from DE. I know this is a game which is trying to appeal to older folks and older gamers by mimicking older games, but come on. It's hard to go from 1080p FMV sequences to crappy everything else. It's immersion breaking.So, as a game, I would not recommend this. It's like you're swimming in an ocean of outdated graphics and mediocre gameplay, and every FMV sequence is a breath of fresh air before you have to plunge your head back into the ocean to get to the next part so you can breath in the FMV again. Some people say, once you get immersed in the story, the graphics will become insignificant. Maybe. I did not get immersed in the story, and after quitting the game once, had little inclination to go back.			"

												I have a lot of problems with Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure, and I really really wish I didn’t. I want to make sure before I spill out all my complaints I make this very clear: games like this need support, dev teams who are willing to take the risk faithfully resurrecting the genres and characters many of us cherish from our childhood should be applauded. No matter how much I dislike this game I think that it was a competent remake of a classic game that has a strong cult following and a lot of loving support. I would be a hypocrite if I condemned this game for being itself simply because I’m not into the content while at the same time begging for developers to bring back Banjo Kazooie.With all my respect for the resurrection of the Full Motion Video (FMV) crime adventure on the table, I thought The Tesla Effect was not very good. Right from the beginning, inspecting objects around the opening area leads to a multitude of (what I presume to be) clips from the original Tex Murphy games. They are abysmally cheesy and for someone who never experience the franchise in the past, they feel like inside jokes that I’m completely left out of. The cheese I can absolutely forgive because the original games were from a very different time culturally and technologically, however the feeling of being left out as a new player is really disheartening. Next up is a very personal and subjective complaint with very little merit in a review of a game like this, but I find FMV cutscenes to be disturbingly unnerving. Every time a cutscene would trigger I was so uncomfortable. I’m not sure if it’s the clash of real people against digital backdrops or if it’s just that principal of the uncanny valley, either way I just could not stomach that art style. On to a very different issue; I’m not sure how the original game played, but not being able to walk while moving the mouse is absolutely ridiculous. I don’t care if that was part of the “charm” of the original game or not, having to walk forward, stop, look left with the mouse, and then be able to walk forward again is just inexcusable. Finally, I have never had a game run my rigs so hot before. On my brand new laptop (which I frequently use to play games like Space Engineers Civilization BE and Bioshock Infinite) after only 15 minutes of play I was unable to use the keyboard. I typically hit around 40-45C near the GPU but running Tesla Effect caused the majority of my keyboard to hit 50 degrees!I support the developers with all my heart and I think more risks like this need to be taken, but Tesla Effect was just not right. Between personal and mechanical issues, I would not recommend this game to anyone.			"

												i have mixed feelings about this game, it sort of relies a bit too much on clips from the old tex murphy games and the graphics are pretty outdated, some of the acting is obviously someone reading out their lines from a board and have pretty poor acting skills, now im thinking its sort of on purpose to keep the cheesy feel like previous games, but the poor acting is  a bit over the top from some of the actors ( not tex) . The graphics are rather low in detail and not too inspiring. Puzzles ; ive done some of the puzzles in the game, some of the first puzzles, really really got on my nerve, and is the biggest contributor to me disliking it somewhat, the other parts i sort of could live with, with no big impact, ...puzzle that got to me : the wheel puzzle above the electronics shop ; flashing lights on a wheel in different colors flashing by fast, repeat combination ; seriously... how am i supposed to repeat the last and second line when the flashing of the lights is 8 spots on a wheel... and it flashes 4-5 times a second . Sorry im not rainman...cant memorize that fast.  And secondly its not fun at all! Yes i moved past the puzzle... by using a walkthrough, and still missing the buttons at times... Sound : very spartan ... and alot of sound effects arent even synced up within a second(!) of the spot where it supposed to be there ( read : coit tower elevator) . The story so far aint all that bad, it has some humourous points now and then, but the game so far feels very rushed and unfinished in the finish.  (4 hours of playing), and yes i know this game was crowdfunded, but alot could be saved by some better sound effects and more, . the graphics ..dont know if its an hommage and purposly lofi to reflect under a killing moon, which i frankly remember as having better fitting graphics.Now ill play this game more , and possibly finish it; i dont know if i would recommend it to any yet, but as im somewhat dissapointed in the game so far, id have to say no, as there is no way to rank the game other than yes or no.  Also the game isnt the most stable software out there...well thats my two cents so far.			"

												From my point of view, this is a game that is showing more negative points than positive ones. As everybody likes bullet points, here you have my list:+ Sci-Fi story that seems somewhat reasonable as far as I got+ Interesting acting for FMV, although make-up is not great, probably intended- Bland 3D environments, where you spend most of the time. Some hard to find items if you play on ""gamer"" difficulty. I had to use a walkthrough for some sections.- Logic puzzles break inmersion, e.g. repeat sequence of lights a la Simon in order to open a secret door? Who secures a secret door like that? I prefer the puzzles as given by for example Technobabylon.- Too many flashbacks to previous games makes you feel disconnected- Different endings - I prefer a good single ending- Mazes with lurking danger - this is a deal breaker for me. There have been three as far as I have played.			"

""Oh, an anvil. I'm sure it'll come in handy later."" (actual game quote)What sinks this game, after all, is its inept game design: 95 percent of the gameplay consists ofA) tedious, sometimes frustrating pixel-hunting for silly objects that are employed in unprecedentedly obtuse ways: ""find all baseball cards to unlock safe"" / ""clean petri dish to open locker"" ..... game is from 2014 but more reminiscent of 1980s text adventures.B) an absurd mishmash of cobbled together logic puzzles, which feel hopelessly tacked-on and completely disrupt any stylistic, thematic, and gameplay cohesion. It's painfully embarrassing when the developers suddenly insert an entire Ancient Egypt section with puzzles like the river crossing problem and probably think this is a great idea.Your role is always confined to abstract, low-level problem solving that has nothing to do with the story itself. The story is neatly told through high quality FMV cutscenes while you are searching for screwdrivers, sausages and nose hair trimmers in low quality 3D environments.Tyrannosaurus Tex. It's one, huge dinosaur of a game with graphics from the early 2000s and gameplay from the early Pleistocene. Like Duke Nukem Forever, this is a game that came out 15 years too late and, maybe, should have never been made in the first place.			"

												Adventure games as a genre may be on life support, but FMV adventure games are dead and buried in an unmarked grave so it's amazing that Tesla Effect exists at all. What's more is that the FMV segments are actually the highlight of the game. Yeah, it's corny and low-budget but it revels in its corny low-budgetness. Chris Jones is great as Tex Murphy and has an innate knack for delivering groan-inducingly bad dialogue in a way that's actually funny and charming.That being said, as an adventure game Tesla Effect is sub-par. The puzzles are dull and aside from a few hard to spot items they're incredibly simple. The 3D environments are ugly as sin and travelling around them is slow and the movement is often buggy. Despite really liking the charm of the FMV segments I couldn't be bothered to finish this one.			"

												This review is was written on the 3rd of November 2016. At the time of writing, if you are over 40 years old and used to play the old Tex Murphy games, disregard this review and enjoy a game you'll love if not just for the nostalgia.Everyone who's still with me, if you have no idea who Tex Murphy is and have not played any of the other Tex Murphy games, then you'll be as disappointed with this as I was. It's a live action actors Sam & Max style game where you talk to people and explore the environment and analyse things, but it's so drawn out and boring, I couldn't have fun no matter how I tried. This is a nostalgia game and based on what old fans say it's probably good at that. If you're a newcomer like me though, disregard this game completely.			"

												This is more of a game of hide and seek than anything else, some items are hidden in the most stupid spots. The further into the game you go you end up with entire rooms dedicated to finding one item. Catastrophic audio bugs throughout the game, couldn't hear Tex's speech most the time, settings sliders did nothing. Previous comments on this bug by other players only led to devs saying 'we don't get this issue and we can't do anything about it' which is rather atrocious. Not much of the game made sense but that may just be me.Should you play it? If you enjoy these kinds of games then it's worth playing other wise just avoid it.			"

Introduction : Tesla Effect begins in 2050, seven years after Tex and his love interest, Chelsee Bando, were attacked at the end of Tex Murphy: Overseer. The story starts as Tex suddenly awakes disoriented in his office at the Ritz Hotel with strange markings and signs of violence on his body and no memory of the past seven years. He then discovers that Chelsee has been missing ever since the attack and is presumed dead. He sets out to find out what happened to him, what became of Chelsee, and to regain his past memories, and in so doing uncovers a web of intrigue involving murders, double crosses, and the lost inventions of Nikola Tesla.(+)Graphics : Graphics are great , the game can support graphics up to 2K to support live-action sequences .(-)Cutscenes / Story :  I know that most of you won't be agreeing with me , but the cutscenes are boring , acting is really below the charts and story looks nice but its executed terribly . Of course it changes from people to people but to me i don't like too long cutscenes with terrible acting .(+)Gameplay :  You can navigate 3D environments in first-person, search for clues, and use inventory items. The game also includes logic puzzles and a branching conversation system for interviewing characters. Like The Pandora Directive, it features ""narrative pathing"" where player choices affect the story and endingInteresting story , too long real-life cutscenes with terrible acting . It would have been better as a movie .5/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews   "

												This game wins the award for most frustrating game I've ever played, as well as the award for ugliest in-game aesthetics.I realize the graphics for the gameplay weren't too important, but it looks like they asked some 1st year 3D modelers to do this one for free (source: studied 3D for 1 college session and could do as well or better).As far as frustating gameplay; the entire game is an exercise in trail-and-error puzzling as well as pixel hunting (across the previously mentionned terrible aesthetically unpleasing graphics).  I have never been so annoyed nor gotten as angry at a game in my life, and I've played all the Souls games, among other games that have a tendency to make you lose your cool at some point or another.Some puzzles I thought I had figured out the logic behind, but when solving it didn't work I resorted to trial and error until it worked, and I still don't know the logic behind those puzzles.  I've seen others complete them on Youtube, and it only confused me more when, in 1 instance in particular, they solved a puzzle by doing what I had done.. except for me it didn't work.Puzzle and point-and-click games aren't my favorite genres so if you're a big fan of those you may get a better experience, especially if you're a Tex Murphy fan.On the other hand, I enjoyed the FMVs.. good cheesy fun.  The intro movie was the best part of the game.. got me pumped to be immersed in a movie I'd play in as the main character.. and then I got plopped into the gameplay and I barfed in my mouth a little.TL:DR - Great B-movie, terrible game.

												Bundle fodder is the appropriate resting place for this little nostalgia trip.  As much as I loved the Tex Murphy games of old this pales in comparison.  Tesla Effect is a semi-interactive movie with little in the way of actual puzzles and investigation short of tedious hidden object vignettes and overly simplistic logic games.  Go find an antiquated copy of Mean Streets and play that instead unless you're desperate for a charming B-movie fix.			"

I think I played some other tex murphy game as well but not sure which. Really wanted to like this game, and I even took the time to finish it. but bottom line: the jokes are lame, the acting terrible, don't get me started about the cast, and the plot was not belivable. an unfortunate thumbs down.

												I enjoyed TM in Under a killing Moon back in the 90's, but this seems like it hasn't budged an inch since then. The graohics were horrid, the environment limited, and most of the puzzles were either pointless or repetative. In the end I felt like I was just going through a cheap brain teasers paperback puzzle book from a dollar store.Good for 1 nostalgia run, but then it's junk.			"

												The graphic is in 90s, so as the content. It's boring, hardly logical and I'm not really interested in watching old man trying to be funny. Playing this game in causal mode is acceptable, but I can imagine how hard this game would be in gamer mode since the quest is mainly searching objects or something. And I can feel subtle discrimination against women and ""computer guy"", it's full of sterotype.			"

												Tesla Effect is bad in so many ways.Visually it looks like a game from 1999. The acting and actors' makeups in video scenes are horrible. The dialogues are super cheesy and the story consists mostly of cliches (the main hero has amnesia - wow, who'd expected this in a videogame!). The UI is absolute garbage and looks like it was designed by a hundred different people - everything falls apart.Overall, it doesn't feel like a new game about Tex Murphy. It feels like a game from 90s remade in 2010s. This will probably please the old fans of the series, but if you are not one of them, stay clear of Tesla Effect. "

												20 years ago FMV was a very new and cool concept in PC gaming.  It promised to bring ultra realism and a whole new level of immeration in gaming.  Unfortunately the games that came out with FMV were less than steller.   One game series that went all in on FMV was the Tex Murphy series of adventure games.  Tex 3, 4, and 5 (Under a killing moon, Pandora, Overseer) all featured this new technology.  The Tex series was an enjoyable if cheezy adventure game series that focused on an out of luck PI who was 2 parts buffon and 1 part saint.  The draw initially was the FMV but the series milked successfuly the humor and puzzle elements for all they were worth.  For the most part the Tex series enjoyed moderate success with gamers but not at the same level of a Monkey Island or a Sierra title.  Now we have yet another Kickstarter romp though an old game series that is long since dead.  Very dead in fact....   Its been 16 years since Overseer left Tex fans on a clifhanger.  As one of those fans I have to admit I was excited at the prospect of seeing the old Tex in action again and finally geting a proper send off for a beloved series.  Its painful for me to admit but I REALLY wanted to see another game in this series.  Enough for me to fork over 100 bucks 2 years before it was released. In this case I think it might have been better to have Tex stay dead.   While the game industry has moved on its clear the designers either havent or thought they had to stick to the old forumla because TeslaEffect is basicly a slight upgrade from their last outing.  The backgrounds are so pixulated that I think I am back playing in 1997.   Some of the actors are either not professionals or just mailing in their performances (similar to what we saw in UAKM).   The puzzles seem random and dont tie into the world and its story.  When playing as tex and choosing from a text bubble the options are so random it really doesnt matter what option you choose or to even bother to read them.  Clearly the skills of the storytelling and game design for these folks havent advanced a day from the late 90'sThe story itself is corny (what you would expect from the series) and at times hard to follow.  There are many many gems hidden for Tex fans to reminace about the past.   Its mostly overdone and in poor quality, which leaves this Tex fan disapointed.  As of this date (May 2014) there are many bugs still in the game, most are of the audio nature.  The game can get offsync with the audio and at times the audio will cut completely out for a few seconds.  Bottom line is that if you really really really must see a new tex game its probably worth it to you to spend the 15-20 bucks for the cost.  The other 99.999999% of the population however should stay away.   Literally this game is made for about 20-30 indiviudals who stayed true and talked tex in message boards (Unoffical Tex Murphy) all these years.  Me I thank Tex for the fun we had in the 90's but to me he died in that speeder in Overseer.  Happy trails Tex			"

												A bad effort.Some of the puzzles don't make sense, like I have to ask a guy about a ladder in order for a hotel to open, there is no logic there it's just forcing me to engage in some useless dialog with someone that I had to look up a walk through to find out. The areas are too big and you can spend a lot of time wandering around. It also keeps going back to some dated footage from the previous game. The odd clip might give some veterans of the series nostalgia but for me it's just anoying.  Given the ammount of money and hype around this game you'd expect it to be at least equal with some of the other adventure titles out there like technobabelon or gemini rue. Blah... I don't know if I'll finish this game, but if I do I want be loosing sleep about using walkthroughs to get through it a bit quicker.			"

												Pros:- beautiful full motion video sequences shot in high definition- good acting- first Tex Murphy adventure in 15 years- interesting story- humor- branching pathsCons:- story is hard to get into if you haven't played the previous Tex games- would have been better as a movie than as a game- horrible 3D graphics full of low-poly models and bad textures, game looks like it was made in 2001- bad sound design in 3D environments- uninspired and rehashed puzzles, including lots of kindergarten-level math- a lot of pixelhunting, tiny objects placed in locations you'd never look in- glitchy saving system that may wipe your progress- keys are not rebindable- no controller support- highly unstable framerate dispite low graphical fidelity, even on high-end systems- more of the same, because the game is dedicated to a small nostalgia-blinded fanbaseVerdict:Tesla Effect is designed for Kickstarter backers and that is its biggest flaw. It succeeds at catering to an existing fanbase, but falls flat on its face when trying to be a modern point-and-click. It's not going to win any new hearts and minds. Almost all other PnC adventures released in the past 5-6 years as part of a revival of the genre outshine this game in every aspect. If Tesla Effect does anything well, it's showing that movies should remain movies and games should remain games. Good game design and artistic vision is more important than fanservice.			"

												If you like playing games with long cutscenes and no way to skip them, this is the game for you. While watching the scenes, you can marvel at how well the CGI is coupled with the actors acting abilities. Got about 20 minutes into the game before I realized it wasn't even worth having on my harddrive because its 13.6 GB, probably because everything is practically a movie. 2/10, wouldn't do again.			"

												This games too cheesey to recogmend. If you are afan of the old games you may get a certain feeling of nastalgia from playing it. Having not played any of them beyond a demo for under a killing moon i cant comment to the accuracy to the old style.  Regardless, the world which you walk around in is graphicly below par for a game made this side of 2000. I realise this game was funded through crowd funding, but this doesn't excuse the old textures and graphic models used, not a slap dash approach to CGI rendered animations. Accepting that a substantial amount of the budget did go into making the cinematic cut scenes doesn't excuse them from being lazy elsewhere. The story though did have a certain amount of charm, even if it lacked in the complexity i normally enjoy. The puzzles for the most part were easy to solve and weren't really much of a challenge. The only exception being one which required you to have looked at something a lot more carefully then i did. Several were confusing only in the lack of instructions. Show me what appeared to be a drafts bored and then i find its actually a puzzle where i cant have more then 1 of each tile on each row. Solution was easy once i realised my goal. In some ways this is a hall mark of the style and not really something you can hold against the game, though it is nice when the items aren't limited to only one use. The cheeseyness of the acting though either makes or breaks this game...you will either love it for it, or you will find it distracting from the story telling. For me it was somewhat distracting, i could see what they were trying to do, but the actors just didn't feel up to it. To me it felt like they were overacting. The world felt empty, apart from a few roaming insta killers, there was no real interaction with anyone outside of their preset boxes. When it came up i had considered supporting the kickstarter. Having now played the game, i'm really glad i didn't.			"

I'd say grab it in a Humble Bundle or something and play it through with a walkthrough for the large areas of the game and its a nice nostalgic expereince that has the right amount of ""cheese"" and story to be ""okay""			"

												I'm a newcomer to this series and  had never before played any Tex Murphy adventure. I got it in a bundle. At first, this appeared to be a rather cheap adventure-style game with some kind of retro charm. However, as I went along with playing it, I started to enjoy the story and the cheesy characters.Gameplay-wise I found myself stuck several times with absolutely no clue how to progess. The searching and trying very quickly felt combersome and frustrating. While it *is* in the spirit of the adventure games of old, today I don't find the time anymore to come back and do the chores of what feels like hours of searching. Also, I had to use a walkthrough in a couple of places to proceed, only to find out that I either would never had realized the solution on my own (too confusing) or that I had all the right ideas but the game expected a very specific sequence of progression (which should be more open to similar solutions).All in all, I recommend this game, although I happened upon it as a free extra in a bundle. I very much doubt that I would have bought it on Steam or elsewhere. Then again, this is a game with a main audience of longtime Text Murphy fans for whom this game is obviously created. Throughout the game, I always felt a bit excluded, like standing on the sidelines and not getting all the jokes. I then turned that into archaelogical curiosity, exploring the pieces of a culture remembering itself. That was kind of special.Now that I know Tex Murphy exists, I would play a followup game. But then again, it felt lacking a little too much polish to be sold for 20 €.			"

												A fan of Under A Killing Moon through and through here (still own the original 4 CD's issue). So far just made it through Day 1 and have to tell you, if you ever enjoyed UAKM this is an instant hard on. A huge thank you to the whole team and actors.			"

												Never played the tex Murphy series, and now I feel like I was missing something glorious after playing this game.   I'm going to have to go back and find the others.   So far, it's amazing, and really hard to stop playing.   Who needs sleep anyway?			"

												Good old Tex Murphy. Ok so the 3d portions of game doesn't look the best for today's standards, but the videos and the rest of the game still has the Tex Murphy charm.			"

												Of note : I only recommend this game for the people who loved the old point&click adventures of the 1990s.This game has a lot to love for the old farts of us who played the old P&Cs.  The same branching dialogues, the same silly puzzles that usually aren't difficult, and the same questionable logic which determines which random objects go together to make functional objects to solve problems.Pros:~ The 4K camera work looks great.  The quality of the FMV portions look fantastic.~ Cheezy dialogue and acting.  It's a YMMV thing, but I love it.~ For those who have followed Tex through his recent adventures in the Pandora Directive and the Tex Murphy Radio Saga, it attempts to tie up all the loose ends and explain what has all happened.  It's a pretty well written story.~ Multiple endings based on dialogue decisions, and while some are better than others, Sapphyre's is great.~ The game is legitimately funny.~ All digital, so NO DISC SWAPPING HALLELUJAH! ~ Tons of references to the earlier games, especially Under a Killing Moon.Cons:~ The puzzles aren't really as difficult as you would think.  And the game follows a fairly predictable thread of 1.) Talk to people on the street 2.) Find items needed to get into a place  3.) Find items in place, and solve puzzles, 4.) Rinse, Lather, Repeat.~ The camera work is great, but the in game 3D world looks like it came right out of 2003, in a not good way.  The world is much more open than previous games, and there aren't the frequent, epic length loading screens, or disc swapping THANK GOD.~ If you didn't play the earlier Tex Murphy games, especially Overseer and Pandora Directive, it may be difficult to grasp the story.  Under A Killing Moon is suggested, because it's the best, but doesn't contribute as much to the story.Ultimately, if you're an oldschool Tex Murphy player, a fan of Point & Click games, interactive movies, or like comedies with a film noir setting, you may love this game.  If you're not into those, you could probably pass on it.			"

												finished the game in 20/22h. it's been so cool to see tex murhpy's adventures again.no bugs encoutered exept sound lvl problem during FPS sessions.my prefered one was under a killing moon.because of the translation and the text speed i may didn't understand everything in the story.videos are in well hd quality.it's a small budget developpment game so don't ask too much for this game. i congrats all the developpment team, actors and everyone who participated on that game. they worked well to produce another great tex murphy video game.puzzles are ok, sometimes it's been difficult to understand what to do. the helping process in the game was a good idea.aspects to improve at my eyes, for a next game should be :_a better lvl design, art design and game engine. so more interactive stages._more romance and femme fatal/ pin ups appearance during stories_more musics_a option to read again dialogues. they pass one time. so if you missed a information, you can't get it again. specialy when english isn't you mother'language.PS: i encoutered big sound lvl problem during the game. tex voices during FPS parts are so low lvl instead eveything else. even at the minimum lvl et voice at the maximum.hope to see a next adventure !

												Very fun game, quite well done. Funny dialogues, good atmosphere and music, a story that is somewhat coherent even if a bit ludicrous. The technical part is the worst in my opinion.			"

												I'd recommend the game to any adventure-loving gamer who's not afraid to die in a game!+ Visuals+ Acting+ Challenge - Too comic for my taste (given the circumstances)- Most ""logic"" puzzles are not well-integrated into the game, they're just there- Story-line didn't really inspire meDespite this, I'd recommend the game.

												It's really an amusing game. It harkens back to the days of FMV (Full Motion Video), where you basically get movies to go along with the gameplay. I had to resort to a Walkthrough guide to save myself some frustration, but it was still and enjoyable experience and game to play through. If you can get it for cheap, it'll provide hours of entertainment.			"
