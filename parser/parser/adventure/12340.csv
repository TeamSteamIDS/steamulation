												Can't complain much about the game that only cost $1.99. I don't play a lot of point-and-click adventure game, but this game is not too bad compare to some of same genre games that I have played. Funny story, decent graphic, smooth gameplay. Played the game none stop till the end. Since I had a great time, I gonna buy the sequel as well.			"

												A sprawling, humorous adventure in the old style, beset by enough problems that it's better to save yourself from the frustration and forget about it. Lots of pretty decent voice acting, even if it's all hammy and silly, but few of the belly laughs of the Monkey Island games they tried to emulate, only with too much heavy sarcasm and not enough absurdity. The graphics are bright and shiny, the characters even occasionally have a bit of real-life spark to them, and there are a hell of a lot of puzzles to solve (plus a few fetch quests). When the occasional hilarious moments clicked, it almost made it all worth it.My biggest problem with it was the utterly plodding pace everyone shuffled at, and with such a huge world, you could catch a nap walking between areas. With zero in-game tutorial, there was no way to know that a double-click made you run, until a puzzle near the end through was unsolvable if you didn't, so I had to go online and find out that the game screwed me. Combine that with terrible pathing, where you take the longest route and walk in circles to get to anything, and it was a dull, frustrating game. The horrible camera contributes significantly; they tried to make it as cinematic as possible with fixed cameras that turn with you, but half the time that just means you have to click every two seconds to keep walking. Some of the swooping effects are nice, but interfere with gameplay whenever you want to click on something while you're walking. The cinematic experience was kind of broken anyway, when everyone looks off into space while talking to each other and  uses the exact same hand gesture.Compared to that constant irritation, the occasional insane puzzle (or insane chapter, as Amanda's seemed to be), and the expected heaping bugs that every adventure game has weren't as bad. They just meant I ended up leaning on a walkthrough at times to figure out what one thing I'd missed somewhere, and occasionally rage quitting for a few days when it crashed again.I think I truly came to hate it when I found a good fix, and Jack said, ""No, that would be the obvious solution. I feel like some challenge. Let's try it another way....""Ultimately, I grimly finished it just because I'd already invested so much time, but it became an endurance that I wouldn't wish on anyone. A little polish would have taken the game into the timeless classic realm, but instead it ended up average and forgettable.			"

												Now this is kinda difficult to review. This game is practically the same as Ankh 3. There would be nothing wrong with that, IF Ankh 3 would not be exacty the same as Ankh 2 and Ankh 2 was any different from Ankh. This is just not funny anymore. To make long story short, buy this game only if You hadn't played anything else from Deck 13. You can enjoy like 5 hours of this humor. If You played all the Ankh games, you are likely to have spent 50 hours with Deck 13 and that is just too much.Graphics is terrible, there are MANY small bugs (especially comments of some objects that are obviously wrong, some labels are missing completely being replaced with some development debug macros and so on). The camera is horrible, in the menu I cannot see any cursor so it always takes quite a time before I guess it's position and highlight the option I want, and having multiple monitors adds some more problems like the cursor won't stop at the edge of the main screen and often you click out of the game's window making it minimized (from the technical perspective this is the worst game I have ever played) It also takes a really long time to go back to the game after this happens. And the worst of all: All the puzzles, if you can call it like that, are absolutely ilogical and just stupid and the obvious solutions to the situatation just do not work with no indication of explanation or whatever. Well you can call that funny only if it is your first game from Deck 13. The game is also pretty childish (you can't even hit a monkey, that the developers made sure you will learn to hate a great deal throughout the game, while it is tearing your airplane apart during the flight and you need to figure out a way to put it safely down while the very fate (of course) of the world is at stake). On the other hand there are quite a lot of erotic undertone and ambiguity - so you can't really tell which group do the developers really try to target.BUT even then I was somehow able to play the game till the end (although with some swearing and curses) and I must confess I kinda liked it so it was not all that bad. As I have already mentioned several times: I think You will like it depending on how many of Deck 13 game you have already played.			"

												I spent a lot of time playing this game. I initially purchased it because it was on sale and I had a lot of free time. The controls were kind of dodgy and the puzzles were challenging enough ( I remember having to look up a decent amount of them). The humor reminded me somewhat of a knock off of Monkey Island. It has some replayability for some hidden items, but once you found them there's no real reason as the story is kind of unoriginal for  If you're a fan of classic Point and Click adventures I would give it a try, but wait until it is on sale.

												This is tough for me to give this game a review. I enjoy it and look past it's obvious dated features such as the cheesy voiceovers, childish and slightly slow animations, however in a weird way it is quite charming. For a younger audience, such as your kids, this is a good title to play with them.			"

												Disappointing.That pretty much sums up my reaction to Jack Keane. Jack Keane has decent graphics, controls reasonably well, and even made me chuckle once or twice. Why do I not recommend it then?The puzzles are badly designed and I can not count the amount of times I found myself saying, ""What am I supposed to do?"" No, not wondering how to solve a puzzle. I found myself wondering what I should even be trying to solve. The problem is that the game does not clearly establish what the puzzles are. Jack rarely offers even the remotest clue about what he thinks of a puzzle and it is extremely easy to miss a key item just because you ran past it. I adore adventure games and love great puzzles, but this game was a misfire. I might even try the sequel just to see if they fixed the problems, but this one misses more than it hits and can not get  recommendation from me. I'd give it a 4/10.			"

Pros:+ If you like puzzles, its full of them.+ Bonus content.+ Colorful 3D art.+ It is fun and challanging after all.Cons:- If you hate puzzles, its full of them.- Controls...- The story wasnt that interesting and also reminded me Tales of Monkey Island.- Some scenes were heavily glitched.- One of the main characters, Amanda, is too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and have some weird facial expressions. Such a shame, she was hot :)- Sometimes cutscenes ending fast, cutting the dialoges but not a big problem.VERDICT: An adventure and a hot blonde chick waiting for you. You might buy it on discounts...			"

												A total classic that still holds up to current standards. A funny story, clever puzzels, enjoyable voice acting, and of absolute importance, speedy, although in a few certain areas, not always the easiest to control, walking movement. It's a long game. Doesn't have a hint system. You do get to see the main character's butt. Slightly annoying in the fact that you have to have the mouse on practically the exact right pixel to pick-up/use small items. But only minor complaints. I really liked this game. Buy it cheap. Play it long. Love it hard!			"

												This game was enjoyable, not too hard not too easy but following the golden line between fun and challenge. Only some of the problems caused serious disbelief of What Were THEY Thinking? Examples like, I need fire to reveal secret message written in citron juice and see a fireplace: NO. I need to get into a hotel room upstair and happen to see a rope hanging near its balcony: NO. I need water for my plant and have a glass of water: NO. I need a wooden plank to fix by boat and see many planks all over the place: NO... find the one that's not so visible. The praise:-nice brightly colored and cartoonish 3d graphics-story and setting is ok, kind of poor man's monkey island-mostly logical puzzles-long game, much content-very fluid animations-notebook telling the current objective (press TAB)The nag:-no quick travel map-character relative camera, diffucult to click anything if character isn't still-too many times couldn't use obvious solutions to a problem-lagging mouse when using items-mouse over doesn't recognize hotspots and exits very well-a bit unpolished, some tiny bugs			"

												I've only played 30 minutes and I already know it's awful. The controls are terrible, the characters are not memorable, the dialogue and story feel empty and there's absolutely nothing that makes you want to keep playing the game. It's basically the videogame version of B-movies. I was hoping to play the whole saga, but I think I'm going to pass.One of the reviewers dared to compare this with Monkey Island. I'm just going to assume this person was drunk when he/she played this game, because it has nothing to do with MI. Well, maybe just the fact that Jack Keane tries way too hard to be a copy of Guybrush Threepwood (faling tremendously in the process, I must add). Oh, and both games are about pirates. That's all.Do not buy, even if cheap.			"

												Well, this is a point & click adventure game about a british ""pirate"" (or so on), who actually happens to have a north-american accent for whatever reason. Actually, it's kinda hard not to think of Monkey Island while playing it, except that while one is based on the Caribbean, this one happens around India (Company of Merchants of London Trading to the East Indies, anyone?). Unlike other traditional adventures titles, this one actually allows the player to solve some puzzles through the use of different means, managing to break at least a lil' bit of the linearity. The screen orientation moves with the character and that's quite annoying, it takes a while to get used to it (I've finished the game and I'm still not used to it, for the record). Ah, you're gonna certainly bump into at least one glitch during your gameplay, so save it often to prevent rage attacks. Overall, it's an average game and I believe that you won't regret playing it.			"

												A GREAT low budget 3D Adventure but not much for a Hardcore Adventurer.This game is really good for its quality. When I finished it, I saw in the lines the names OGRE, cegui, opcode, and FMOD. Well I searched them a little bit and I was right from what I saw in game... a low budget game(German Studio). But the team has done great efforts to make this game as more real as it can be. It is a game that its style and music will get your mind to Indiana Jones movies, but this time the game has to show English and Indian themes in a pirate style. The game has some adult jokes so to those who track the kids ages I wouldn't suggest an age below 15 years old.The Story is good, still I was NOT amazed. It has much fun in it to keep you play it but not jokes they will drop you from your chair.It has a love story, especially after the middle point of the game that the difficulty increases a litle bit. The hardcore adventurer has nothing to fear. Even a normal person will not be frustrated by the game. It is an one-way adventure and the most times the riddles are obvious.The game is in FULL 3D graphics and the camera changes to the point you walk. Every video or action you make, even when you speak to another character the game goes in cinematic mode. If you activate ""Historical Mode"" under the Bonus material then all the game color changes under the classic OLD movie filter. It's relaxing and lovely for a while but I still prefer normal color. You'll see many good scenes. As the 3D graphics progressed through little time I wouldn't say you'll be amazed. But the quality is good. I liked much the water sceneries. I have some screenshots in my library.As much for the sound is OK. As I played the game in English, I really liked the Classic English accent of agent Motgomery and the voices of Jack and Amanda. I also liked Mr Gopesh that represented the Mafia and of course the pharmacist. The music is good and matches the game standards.As you go on the game you may find some BONUS objects that unlock the main  characters of the game under the Waxed Museum in Bonus features.So, I would say... A GREAT low budget 3D Adventure but not much for a Hardcore Adventurer. "

												I liked it. Was longer than I expected, but fun. Some items were very hard to click on though. I remember hovering over certain items several times and seeing no interact icon. I had to look up a walkthrough in certain parts because of this. For instance, the watering can, or the mud on the bench, very very small hitboxes for those items, you would think they are part of the scenery. Still, I enjoy adventure games, and this had a nice story, so I look forward to playing Jack Keane 2, when its on sale.			"

												I dont know why I bought this. I Didnt like Ankh and they are made by the same people...The graphics are ugly, the voice acting is horrible, the music is bland, and the sound design is laughable. The game seems to be filled with bugs. In my 15 minutes of play I found 2. My cursor wouldnt appear in the menus (main menu or choice selection in game) so I had to wiggle to mouse around until something highlighted. The other is it wouldn't let me interact with anything until I alt tabed a few times for some reason.I only had a brief glimpse of the humor but that was more than enough. I could instantly tell after the first cutscene that this would even make me crack a smile (on purpose anyway).My biggest issue with game this game and games like Ankh though is the non senseical puzzles. I hesitate to even call them puzzles. It resorts down to a trial and error rub everything on everything type puzzle. Often the solutions make no sense.There have been point and clicks (or games like Walking dead) which I actually really like. But there seems to be a whole sub section of this genre that follow the exact patterns listed above. I have yet to play Monkey Island but I am hoping it doesnt fall under this formula.....			"

Best game I've played in all 7.2353 years I've been alive.Compelling story, amazing graphics, and VR support make this the best game I've ever played.You play as a Methhead from 1960s Detroit named Jack Keane. When you are gangraped by My Little Pony characters you must fight them off with lots of awesome weapons. This is action packed shooter that keeps you on your toes, and has plenty of laughs. For example when you find out Jack's dad is actually Larry the Lobster. If you are looking for a fun Roblox style shooter Jack Keane is the way to go.This part is black like my dad. He left me when I was 5 years old. Said he was ""Finna get somma that ♥♥♥♥ed up blow yall cracka ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥."" "

												Since no major warning was given anywhere, I just thought to post this here. Some antivirus programs may (hopefully falsely) recognize the exe file as infected and can block/remove the file from your computer so that later steam will claim that the game file does not exist. All you will see is a black screen when you start the game. Make sure to tell your antivirus not to bother about the game file when you start the game first (when you get the black screen, press cntrl alt del, open the file manager, and when the antivirus message comes up, tell it to leave the file alone, if there is such an option). After that the game runs fine. Also, in the community hub many people (especially with Win 7) complain about buying the game and then not being able to play it. Requirements say Vista or XP. I run it on Win 7 though, but took me some time to deal with the antivirus block. Gameplay itself is fun.			"
