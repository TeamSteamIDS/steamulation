												Hamlet (or “the Last Game without MMORPG Features, Shaders and Product Placement”, which is likely one of the worst video game titles ever conceived), is a point in click adventure game loosely inspired by Shakespeare's classic play of the same name. Its goal is clearly to lend a more comedic angle to the tragedy, but the result is something that comes off as both underbaked, and exceedingly dumb.Aside from a few characters sharing names from the original Hamlet, and a few key parallel plot points, Hamlet the game is basically an entirely different, less involved story that on the whole is rather irrelevant and constrained to a few brief between act cutscenes.The rest of the game is a pure single screen adventure game, by which I mean every puzzle is contained within the one screen of the game it takes place on with no collecting of objects or backtracking of any sort. This isn’t an awful way to construct your puzzles as it makes it impossible to get lost or overwhelmed by having everything right in front of you at all times, but it also creates a very constricting spectrum of the sorts of puzzles you can create. Or at least that’s the case with Hamlet, whose puzzles range from tedious obscurity, frustrating clicking exercises, or downright stupidity. They aren’t challenging in any clever way, and mearily stand as obstacles between you and the next screen.And this is Hamlet’s ultimate issue: nothing in the game is smart, well designed, or the tiniest bit fun. It took me an hour and a half to complete and not once did I feel anything less than complacent boredom as I mundanely made my way through the game hoping it would soon be over, which thankfully was a wish soon answered.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Hamlet or the Last Game without MMORPG Features, Shaders, and Product Placement is a poor title for this game. Its proper title should be Hamlet or the Last Game without MMORPG Features, Shaders, Product Placement, and Fun. This is one of those adventure games that remind you of how the adventure games genre  committed suicide[www.oldmanmurray.com].  Let me give you an example of what is wrong with hamlet’s puzzles. There is a sequence where Hamlet is stuck in the cargo hold of the boat. You’ll click around the screen for awhile and eventually click a specific box to reveal a cannon. Click around some more and eventually you’ll click a barrel with a small hole at the bottom. This sends a mouse running at the cannon which aims the cannon at the ceiling. Now you can click on the cannon to blow a hole in the ceiling which a monkey falls through. After some more clicking you’ll discover that shooting at hamlet changes the images in the thought balloon in his head. So, you’ll have to shoot hamlet until he starts thinking 2x2 = 5. Obviously, that’s not right. So, you’ll need to alternate between clicking the monkey or yet another barrel to add or subtract from hamlet’s thought answer until it is correct. After that, you have to beat the monkey in a card game version of rock paper scissors before you can travel on to the next section full of inane stuff to click on. Just skip this one. There is nothing redeeming about it. "

												Well, Steam says I have 3.3 hours on record for this game, but that's mainly because I went afk for 2 hours with the game still running.The game is really short. It literally has 25 puzzles. Yes, you can actually count them. Is it good though? I found the artwork quite nice, but that really depends on what taste you have. The humour was okay, the premise was funny. Sound, however, is almost non-existent, and the few ""boink"" sounds get a bit annoying after a while.I wouldn't recommend it for full price, but if you get it in a bundle or on sale, it's kind of fun.

												Hamlet is a retelling of Shakespeare's Hamlet in a point-and-click environment, with a modern-day hero. I am a huge fan of point and click adventures, but sadly, this game fails on several levels. Several puzzles do not involve ""logic"" or rational thinking, but instead pixel hunting and random guesswork based on no clues or process of elimination.The game is incredibly short too, lasting only 1 hour, and the title itself is incredulously cheeky and facetious, mocking other games, when this game itself is really quite bad. Those in glass houses, etc.The game is currently £3.99, I would not recommend purchasing it, even when it's on sale, as it might spoil your enjoyment of ""Hamlet"" by William Shakespeare.Nilesy			"

												Hamlet isn't really a point and click adventure game in the traditional style, it's more of a hidden object / puzzle game, so ... tempered expectations if you are looking for a normal point and click.  That being said it has a cute art style and story, some of the puzzles are actually pretty good although a few were sort of pointlessly grinding.  It also has a pretty sweet soundtrack, although if you take a long time it just loops.  It's nice that the hint system is in the game, but honestly I would have preferred a hot spot detection system in addition, or instead of the hints, which are often about as confounding as the puzzles themselves.  I wouldn't pay a ton of money for Hamlet, but if you like point and click puzzles its worth a couple bucks and a couple hours of your time.			"

												In Hamlet you play the part of a time traveler who inadvertently squelches the real Hamlet with his time machine and thus decides to take his place as the hero of the story: you'll be solving puzzles in five different chapters made up of five levels each.While sporting some nice art and a quirky humour Hamlet can sadly quickly turn into an exercise in frustration due to its obtuse puzzles and somewhat useless hint system.PROS:-nice art style-quirky sense of humour permeates the whole game-some puzzles are interesting and offer a fair challengeCONS:-apart from the title and characters the Hamlet theme is basically never touched uponCONS:-most puzzles have an obtuse design and are very vague in how they function. Sometimes you have to click more than once, sometimes the clicking is timed, other times you have to memorize a quite lengthy sequence or just try and make sense of very vague ambiental clues...I honestly managed to solve a couple puzzles simply by randomly clicking all elements once I was frustrated enough-no way to know what you can actually interact with in each screen, leading to random clicking all over in every scene-the hint system is fairly bad, not only you have to wait five full minutes before you can get said single hint but its quality ranges from feeding you the solution to a drawing as vague as the puzzle itself-not much in the way of a story and the characters offer very little apart from their name-quite short, unless you get stuck on a puzzle you'd be done in 1,5/2 hours

I really appreciated Hamlet's tongue in cheek take on the genre, its quirky humour, nicely drawn art and first few puzzles: but things soon got frustrating when logic got thrown out of the window and I started facing puzzles that required me to decipher a few extremely vague hints and hopefully understand what I was supposed to do. A few puzzles also require you to very quickly click certain items before they disappear and the split second timing involved can get aggravating aswell. There's a fine line between a challenging puzzle and an obtuse, frustrating one and I often felt as if Hamlet crossed said line way too many times to stay enjoyable. All this is made worse by the hint system, waiting five minutes for the hint if you're already stuck on a puzzle is not fun and, once opened, the hint was sometimes as bad as the puzzle it was supposed to help with thus leaving me bashing my head on the problem or just trying to find an external guide.It honestly says alot about the puzzle design when, after finishing the game, I still have no idea of the logic behind three puzzles as I simply solved them randomly clicking their elements while waiting for the hint to appear. For its sale price of a dollar Hamlet wasn't a total waste of my time or money but its problematic puzzles and barebones story make it an hard game to recommend.			"

Short version: 71%Hamlet is a very short room-by-room puzzle adventure, more of an art showcase than a full video game. Still, the absurd humour splashed on the classic stage play may find its way to the appropriate audience.Long version:Hamlet or the Last Game without MMORPG Features, Shaders and Product Placement is a title that really should tell you what kind of game you are dealing with. It sounds pretentious, but if you look a little closer, it is more like self-parody. This game is teeming with absurd humour, starting right from the intro, where you essentially insert a meek little future man into the classic Shakespeare play, whose task is to save Ophelia from the metal-guitarist Claudius, Laertes the Giant, and two pirates: Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.To carry out this epic quest, our Hero must solve a series of puzzles, arranged in a format that would fit web-based games: you are presented with a single scene, and you need to manipulate objects to be able to leave the room. Some of the puzzles are straightforward, some need good reflexes, and some are really devilish in design by looking extremely difficult, yet having a painfully simple solution.The humour may not be for everyone, but this is not the greatest issue; it’s the play time. You can easily finish Hamlet under 30 minutes on the first try and in 10 after that. In my opinion the price is still worth it for the unique art and design, but I may be in minority with that.			"

												Hamlet or the last game without MMORPG features, shaders and product placement aka the worst game name I have ever heard in my entire life is a point and click game, where you play as little time traveler who disrupts the tale of Hamlet.As stated you play as a time traveler who accidentally disrupts the tale of Hamlet and now has to save Ophelia Hamlets bride to save time.In the game you don't actually don't control the small man, but you actually control the environment around you. Solving puzzles and stuff like that. The game has a somewhat decent art style and that's about all the good I actually have to say about the game. This game otherwise is rather boring and not even worth purchasing and let me explain you why.Now I absolutely love adventure games. It's my absolute favorite genre of games and the staple of this genre is cryptic puzzles, but in most adventure games there are only a few puzzles that are cryptic, but Hamlet and the rest of the name I won't even retype the entire game is cryptic. You won't be able to solve all of the puzzles without resorting to a guide. Now let me explain a bit why some of the puzzles are just way too hard. In one puzzle the little alien guy is knocked out and to wake him up you have to make him think 2x2=4 which is not explained anywhere and you only think of it logically and imagine now that the entire game is full of puzzles like that and you have yourself this game.The game is also incredibly short. With a guide (which you will definitely use by the end of act 1) will take you around an hour finish the entire game and after that there is next to no replay value what so ever.This game also sets up a sequel and since this game came out in 2012 and there's no sign of the sequel I highly doubt it will see the light of day. The developer of this game is also working on Franz Kafka The Game which is supposed to release in 2017 so hopefully his mistakes on Hamlet are fixed in that game.In the end this game is bad. It's only saving grace is the rather cute art style. Apart from that there's literally no reason to play this game as it's too cryptic. I suggest skipping this and picking something else.Final Rating:4/10Pros:+ The Art StyleCons:- Puzzles are way too cryptic - Short  "

												Good concept, artwork and sounds.Nothing more, because this game have so many flaws.Some puzzles doesn't make any sense at all, some are too easy and some others need you to click fast on tiny elements - sometimes moving at the screen, all a little glitched - a real pain. The hint system is equally bad, and considering the nonsensical and glitched puzzles, you'll probably wait the long time required to access the hint, just having to search an walkthrough after that. The story is awful, for kids at best. You see Hamlet's references, nothing more.Why is a good concept?It's a point and click adventure with action puzzles, most of them on boss battles - yes, boss battles in a P&C adventure. Also, it's a mock version of a literature classic with short comics between the acts. It will be great if it was not so poorly executed.			"

												It’s a very okay-ish game. If it were possible to leave neutral reviews this would probably be one of them. It’s not really “bad” but you can’t really say it’s “good” either.It’s a short point and click adventure game, not in the traditional point and click sense of you picking up items to use and talking a lot with characters, but maybe more so a child friendly version of just clicking things on screen that will move and interact so you can figure out how to get past that screen.I imagine if you were to see this as a simple game for kids or something it may be quite appropriate for that. As a point and click game, the kind that adults might enjoy, it’s not very engaging at all.A few of the puzzles are clever but there are an odd few that are a little harder to see what you’re supposed to be doing. Especially nearer to the end.It took around an hour to finish and really it’s nothing all that special. A childish re-hash of Shakespeare’s Hamlet.It’s alright but I’m in no hurry to convince you to try it. TL;DR : It’s okay, but maybe only bother with it if you have children you want to play with.

												I picked this up on sale for 50 cents so keep in mind that this review is based on it costing very little. Normally this game costs $5.  This game is not worth $5!  I say this because it is incredibly short. The entire game takes 1 - 2 hours and it has no replay value. The puzzles are quite unique so even if you haven't played the game in a few months you would remember how to solve the puzzles. That being said, the art style is lovely, music is nice and the puzzles are different. The one puzzle in this game was beyond frustrating. After 10 minutes I admitted defeat and asked for a clue. After staring at the clue for another 10 minutes I went onto google images. I like these point and click puzzle games and to be honest with you I would rather play a short game like this where the puzzles are clever instead of something a bit more long winded like Puzzle Agent where the puzzles are designed by flipper handed freak children that you play over and over again because the guys in the clever department took off early for lunch and never came back somehow...So... worth it if you pay under $1 or otherwise it's just too short to validate spending that amount of money. Doesn't come with cards or achievements but heck, kept me entertained for an hour and a half.6/10			"

												I love short games, and I love cheap games. I love short, cheap games that tell touching stories with impossibly deep characters. Conversely, I don't love short, cheap games that are unfortunately lacking in quality—games like the obnoxiously titled Hamlet (or the last game without MMORPG features, shaders and product placement). Although it does have an attractive, cute art style, Hamlet is rife with non-intuitive, often frustrating puzzles and a plot that is ridiculous in a way that far surpasses the tasteful.Hamlet starts out with the plot of Shakespeare's famous play, but within a couple panels of the first cutscene, it's transformed into a grotesque attempt at a modernly witty version of a classic. The main character, Hamlet, is quickly replaced by a time-traveling scientist from the future who, after crashing into Hamlet and incapacitating him, is required to rescue Ophelia from Cladius in Hamlet's place. This scientist is forced to follow a line of plot that is loosely based on Hamlet to return Ophelia to her proper place at Hamlet's side. While an intriguing idea for a storyline, the delivery of the oddly sci-fi events is done in such a way that the game goes from quirky to downright deplorably ludicrous.The gameplay of Hamlet is not a standard point and click adventure. The player is missing the typical inventory system and dialogue of such a game. Hamlet is instead played in silence, with the main character only communicating in brief, uninteresting thought bubbles. The short puzzles that the player is presented with are often incredibly nonlinear, to the point where I often found myself simply clicking all around the screen to see if I could simply stumble upon the answer to some of the more farfetched puzzles. The illogical solutions to the puzzles are made more frustrating by an interface that in no way highlights which objects on the screen allow for interaction.Hamlet's frustration-inspiring, nonsensical puzzles do very little favors for its equally nonsensical plot, and not even its somewhat attractive atmosphere can pull this game back from its failings. At only an hour or two of teeth-gritting, boredom-inspiring gameplay, this tiny indie game isn't worth a misplaced dose of hopeful curiosity or the irritation that comes with its small price tag—even if it's picked up in the middle of a Steam sale. I suppose, in this case, the old adage holds true: you get what you pay for.			"

												This is a very short point & click game with some humorous elements.  I liked the cutesy art and short Hamlet (sort of) story.  Unlike many games in this genre (fixed screen with no camera movement, limited character movement, point & click with no inventory), it has three distinct features:   First, there is no indication on what you can click and what you cannot.  Sometimes when you click on an area nothing happens since the click may have to correspond to an event somewhere else on the screen. An example of this is having to click notes in the air, once you realize to do that.  Second, the clicking (at times) requires a certain degree of timing to the point that it can be very difficult to do what it is necessary.  At times, it can be frustrating given the fine degree of movement required where the actual mouse movement may be very small.  At other times, it can require a fair degree of patience when you have to move the mouse very quickly and have a tiny window of time to accomplish your goal.  Some of these puzzles would be much better suited for a touch interface, since they can have a whack-a-mole flavor.   Third, the puzzle elements require a degree of non-linear thinking that exceeds what I consider to be average in this sort of game.  Usually non-linearity comes from when you have an inventory and need to think of weird combinations of items.  This game has none of that, but rather can be confounding when there is seemingly nothing to do, and you have to carefully considered what minute thing has or could change given the limited interactions presented. That all being said, it took me a little under 2 hours to complete from beginning to end.  The game gives you access to a hint if you spend more than a few minutes on a puzzle.   I would say over the half the puzzles are extremely obvious and do not even take a minute to solve.  There are a few that require more thought.  Most of the time it is just figuring out the rules of what the puzzle entails.  This game had a very 7th Guest type of feeling to me in that way.I was only stumped once in the entire game with the old man and his fishing rod, where the visual clue it gave was not very helpful.  I ended up having to refer to a walk through for this one puzzle.  The thing I was missing was pretty obvious once I understood what I was doing wrong, but not to me at the time.  I suspect most people would not even get stuck at this particular point in the game, since the thing to do is a fairly common requirement in other games involving fishing rods.I may have eventually got this particular puzzle on my own, but I had reached my frustration point with that one puzzle.  This rarely happens to me for point & click games, where even if I'm not making real progress I'm at least eliminating possibilities.  Here there was none of that.  There did not seem to be anything else I could do and no amount of random clicking was going to help.  I can see for some that might be extremely frustrating where you are costing along, and wham!  Suddenly you are stuck and nothing makes sense.  That is definitely one of the features of this game.  I would not say that makes this game bad, just challenging in a perverse way.Regarding why I actually do recommend this game:  Well for me I happen to like short games that I can play and finish within a few hours.  I have a ton of games and not enough time to play them all, so having a game I can actually complete from beginning to end, getting that small sense of accomplishment is nice.  There are very few point & click games that I would ever want to replay, but this might be one in say 10 years where I forgot all the solutions to the puzzles, since it was fun having to think in odd ways to solve the puzzles.I know that there are some that dislike this game because they claim the puzzles are ""totally illogical"".   I disagree.  All the puzzles have a logical solution, provided you think in a non-linear out-of-the-box fashion.  Several of the puzzles are making fun of other point & click games.  The puzzle where you having to enter the password given the abbreviations of the elements is a prime example.  This reminded me very much of the can puzzle in 7th Guest, but unlike that puzzle which was ridiculous in how long it could take to solve, this one was much easier once you stopped to think what the answer must be.  Overall I would say that a lot of clever thought went into making this game.  For the few hours of game play you get out of this game, I would say that it is an enjoyable experience for those well versed in point & click type puzzle logic.			"

												Hamlet or the Last Game without MMORPG Features, Shaders, and any kind of fun is a blemish on the adventure genre of gaming.While it pokes fun at the modern adventure games genre with some similar traits in all adventure games, it's almost equivalent in thought to ""Racing games are all about going fast nowadays hurrr"". In fact, the game can barely stand on it's own two deformed and aged legs while it talks♥♥♥♥♥♥about the adventure genre in a tone coming from what I can only imagine is a self-important soldier main hipster ""good old days"" game developer who listens to chiptune and thinks pixelated graphics far surpass any and all others. You know the kind.The gameplay is abominable. It's a point-and-click adventure puzzle game, already a genre associated with anger.At times there is literally, I mean literally no indication whatsoever of what you need to click on. When what you can click on is apparent, the puzzles often have solutions that are so abstract that they could only be found out of dumb luck and rapid clicking. There exists a hint you can activate once you've waited long enough (about the amount of time it took Shakespear to write Hamlet in real life), but the hints are also obtuse and incomprehensive.The only enjoyable puzzle was the first one.And don't think you can cheat your way through using a guide just to see the story, because the game is very short once you remove all the time spent punching your monitor in frustration. The """"""""""story"""""""""" seems like somthing a child could've written.The graphics are bare bones, and I mean less pleasing to the eye than pixel art in most cases.The cursor animation makes me want to puke.ConclusionIn an attempt to mock the modern adventure games genre, Hamlet or the Last Game without MMORPG Features, Shaders, or Product Placement (a rather pretentious title which already deserves to be ignored), fails to meet any basic criteria for being a video game and is void of any enjoyment. I am personally offended that such a title is being sold on steam. You don't even get to play as Hamlet, or be immersed into the mind of Shakespear. None of that. I made the mistake of buying this game, but I'll make damn sure you won't.0/10If you came to the store page you've already lost.			"

												Other than being extremely short (each of those '25 levels' is a single puzzle), the puzzles in this game often involve pixel hunting and/or simply waiting around for extended periods of time. Puzzles in this game are also pretty easy and any challenge tends to come from easily-missed clickable hotspots, from the game expecting the player to sit around and wait for something to happen with little to no indication, or from mandatory guess-and-test portions. While the game looks decent enough aesthetically, each level really is a single screen, meaning nearly half the game can already be seen in the screenshots on this very page.Quality can certainly trump quantity and a well-made game can certainly be worth paying for even if it's short.

												Hamlet is a small game with a big title, that's for sure. Except for 'Hamlet' the rest of the title doesn't make any sense. I guess it's an attempt to get attention. Good thing the game has a certain charm then. I would call the art of this game 'cute' and 'charming'. Also, there's no voice acting, just a few basic sounds. They get the job done. And I don't think it would be worth it to fully voice any of the characters anyway, especailly since the game can be finished in roughly 1 hour. You control the game like any other point-and-click adventure. The game has fairly logical puzzles and the boss battles are something I'd like to see more often in these sort of games, even if they are terribly easy, like the ones in this game.Anyway, considering the length of the game I'd say the price is reasonable enough.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												It may not have hours and hours of gameplay, it may not have hundreds of levels.. This game still is one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. The puzzles are quirky and sometimes downright silly, but you often have to do some real out of the box thinking to get the answer right. The storyline is kept simple but in a charming way that will without a doubt bring a smile to your face as you play through the game. The graphic style too is amazing and just right for a game like this. A real gem for indie puzzle lovers, although everyone else should give this game a try as well.			"

												I have mixed feeling about this game... The start is really great and there are cool puzzles throughout the game, but quite a few screens just feel 'forced' and are filed with cheap puzzles that might even annoy you. For under a Dollar/Euro I'd give it a try, but I won't spend more, as it's too short and simply too random. It should be 'puzzler' as the genre. There's very little that might count as actual adventure elements.			"

Overall: simple but amusing story, nice painted esque graphics, decent logic puzzles (there are a few thou that doesn't make quite much sense).

												My main feeling whilst playing this game was frustration.  Despite the quirky art style and plotline, its kind of an annoying game to play.  It gives you no indication of which items are clickable, and it seems to assume that you know what it wants you to do - which doesn't seem to follow any logical guidelines at all.  I spent a good chunk of my gameplay sitting around and waiting for the hints to become available.Some of the tasks involve very fast clicking - I dont have a mouse at the moment so that made some of the game practically unplayable!  Maybe that's less of an issue for people with a mouse (but even so - its not a very interesting problem solving situation)Luckily it is a very cheap game, probably due to it being very short - but I still wouldn't recommend it.  I do like the cute art and concept, but that isn't worth the frustraing nature of the game...			"

												Hamlet... first off has an odd and lengthy name. I assume it's making fun of the development of much larger studios, but ignoring that so many indie developers make games without MMORPG features, Shaders, and Product Placement.That aside, it's a short point-and-click adventure game that reminds me of Amanita titles like Samorost 2 and Machinarium. You play as a time traveler who accidentally incapacitates Hamlet. The fact that Hamlet is fiction, I'll assume the time traveler is within the universe of William Shakespeare and not our timeline. As a result, you must take his place and rescue Ophelia from the clutches of Claudius.The puzzles range from super easy to very challenging, and even a bit obscure. There is a hint system but it's not always the most helpful. (That's where Steam Guides come in handy)			"

												First things first. This game is short, very very short. So if you expect a 10 hour long story line don't buy it.Maybe it is like a 10 hour story line sqeezed into a 1 hour story line as the game switches scenes fast.Nevertheless I enjoyed the game as it had some kind of nostalgia in it.Childhood games like Freddy Fish, Putt Putt, Pajama Sam and Spy Fox are very similar to it.If you're not familiar with these games (You must have had bad childhood as these games were awesome) I can refer you to a more recent game, Machinarium.The adventures and thrilling story combined with a puzzle every scene made it quite enjoyable.Sometimes frustrating as some puzzles were hard to complete.But overal I would say you should buy this game if it's below 0.99 as it gives you an hour or two as enjoyment.

I guess it just didn't, for me, do the pleasurable things that some point-and-clicks, even short and silly ones, can.			"

												A fun 1.5 hour long old-school adventure game similar to Machinarium and Samorost.In most point & click adventure games, you're often tasked to blindly click every bit of pixel on the screen until something happens, then to make some absurd combination of objects, like making a fishing pole out of a rubber duck, but not in Hamlet or the Last Game without MMORPG Features, Shaders and Product Placement!The puzzles in HotLGwoMMORPGFSaPP are logical and require a good sense of observation. And since they're all so different from each other, it doesn't get repetitive.The artistic style and the animations are top notch. However, the ambient sound and music samples are too short and therefore can become rapidly annoying.It is a fun game, despite being excruciatingly short and lacking any replayability value.			"

												This was a fun game, but very short, with a story very, very loosely based on Shakespeare's Hamlet.It's a humorous puzzle game, where you solve problems in each scene by clicking on items in the scenery. Some of the puzzles were very funny, and require some serious out-of-the-box thinking. A built-in hint system unlocks if you take too long to solve a puzzle, so this kept it from getting too frustrating (I needed to use it twice).The story is 100% linear, so the fun of the game comes from the wacky puzzles and unconventional solutions. It took me about 90 minutes to play it through, and it doesn't really have any replay value, but if you can get it for cheap it's worth a spin.			"

												The only reason I can explain this game to myself is that someone thought he ought to make a game that loosly follows Hamlet, with a time traveler instead of the prince and lots of ""solve the puzzle in this room/screen to advance to the next room/screen"". Puzzle difficulty ranges from laughably easy to head-scratchingly difficult. Luckily the latter are only in the minority, and those tend to be those puzzles that try to actively deceive you by either supplying red herrings as hints or omit hints altogether. By that I mean the few you can find in slightly hidden notes on screen, not the actual hintsystem that you can only use after you spend a certain amount of time on a puzzle not solving it. And while they help, they nicely won't give away the whole solution.The subtitle makes me think that this game was made with some hipsterish intentions? Oh well, if it was, it didn't shine through to me. The visual style is remiscient of charming flash educatioal games, with each character having their own unique thing going on.I would recommend it if you can get it for 2 bucks or less. Nice to kill about 1 hour and a half. "

In comparison to what people are releasing through Greenlight right now, this is some A-class content right here.If you're a fan of adventure games, you should definitely pick this one up.

												If you're of the typical point-and-click type, know that Hamlet isn't that. Straightforward as a game can be, you only can click what you actually need to click. The puzzles range from obvious to clicking whatever until you advance, though most seemed fun to me, what with following the twisted game's logic to find out the right sequence. You can see a clue after some time in every stage, I personally tried to use it as little as possible (Three stages, if I recall correctly), but the clues themselves are symbolic and not too obvious to follow. I found it endearing in the storytelling and art departments, and overall, if you like frustrating puzzles like me, Hamlet can be a good investment if you have some leftover wallet money to even out or something, as it tends to be at less than a dollar.

And on some levels you just have to be quick! Great puzzles and keeps your attention while keeping you entertained.

YouTube™ Video: Hamlet Or The Last Game Without MMORPG Features, Shaders Or Product Placement (PC) Review 

			Views: 401		

			Don't be fooled by the charming presentation, Hamlet is an aggravating experience. Bottom Line: Cold		

I can’t quite figure out who the audience for Hamlet is. It’s hard to imagine any kid having the patience to solve the game’s puzzles, yet the simple interface and visual style suggest that it was not intended for adults. Maybe kids are just smarter than me, but I was completely lost and confused as I clicked on every little object, hoping to unearth some clues. The puzzles are supposed to be logical, but often the logic behind them is pretty twisted and obscure. This leads to long bouts of aimless clicking. The trial and error discovery involved in Hamlet is somewhat reminiscent of the Broderbund Living Books series. The major difference being that the Living Books were actually kind of fun. Perhaps the unique visual style is enough to mesmerize the intended audience. It is admittedly a very cute game, but don’t be fooled by the charming presentation. Hamlet is an aggravating experience, especially when it requires rapid, consecutive clicking. Save yourself the headache and pass on this one.			"

												I liked the artstyle. I thought the story was cute and its soundtrack complemented it well. I didn't like that some of the actions had to be done again and again and that the thought bubbles couldn't be cancelled. It makes it easy for one to get bored while playing the game since it required an ample amount of patience.  The game was a bit short though, but it isn't that expensive and I bought it while it was on sale, so I guess it was worth what I paid for it. Although it was a short game, it was fun while it lasted.			"

												I guess you could say my qualms with this game are more an issue with my over-consumption of puzzle/adven games than it is the actual state of this game.  I remember when I was driven by this urge to solve all puzzles in any game I played without using any clues.  Sadly, that zeal is gone.  And this game only confirmed why.  When people talk about a game having clever puzzles, I get why they are saying that.  The door puzzle in this game that requires you to “look” closely is a good example of such a clever contraption.  Yet I simply don’t care.  I don’t care about beating the monkey at the convoluted game of RPS just so I can continue the story.  Its seems to be a combination of investing a considerable amount of mental energy to a puzzle only to find out the solution does not match up with this energy and the use of puzzles as artificial walls I must scale to continue the story.  Narrative-heavy P&C adven games often fall victim to the former while games like this one are prone to the latter.  Indeed it could be impossible to expect a game that has puzzles that would satisfy the itch I personally want to scratch precisely because I may be the only person who has this particular itch.  I just want to play a puzzle/adven game where I don’t feel like the puzzles are being dangled in front of me like a carrot.  I would love to try a game that makes me want to solve the puzzle in the same way I want to experience the story.  Seems like a hard balance to strike.  Maybe I have to do it myself.			"

When the game isn't deliberately obfuscating the pieces of the puzzle the solutions are obvious. The art style is great, but further complicates the gameplay. The game is literally an hour long - I had to leave the game on in the background for two more hours just to get all of the cards.			"

												Where do I start? Right off the bat this is a ""click anywhere and hope for the best"" type ""adventure and not a very good one at that. I was enjoying it for the first few screens and then I was faced with what I thought were illogical puzzles with timing issues. Then I was faced with a puzzle of a padlock with the sun's ""face"" in the middle and I had to look up a walkthrough for this: you have to click the letter on the outer rim of the sun relating to it's ""emoticon"". I mean, seriously? So, I let this one pass and was faced with a boss where you have about two seconds to click the right notes he's playing from a sequence of 9 or 10, and if you make the wrong choice you're back to the first note. So, to sum up, if you like point and click adventures then steer clear as this is most certainly not. The only three redeeming features? I got it in a bundle, trading cards and had the joy of uninstalling it.			"

												Hoo boy. So, this game. I'm really not sure why I bothered purchasing it. Let's start with the title. Excessively long with an incredibly pretentious premise, as though there are no other games in the entire world anymore without MMORPG features, shaders, and product placement. That's certainly not the case, and I don't see why not having shaders is something to be pretentious about anyway (not to say that every game must have them, but it's not as though they're some sort of inherently bad thing either). But I guess I must have convinced myself I like adventure games too much, and so I bought this crap.The alleged logic puzzles contained within should not even be considered logic puzzles. They are more accurately described as some sort of pixel-hunting puzzles, or just ""clicking around randomly and finding out that somehow you were supposed to do that even though it makes 0% sense"" puzzles. There is no logic whatsoever in any part of the game I could stomach playing up to, and from what I've read from walkthroughs, there will continue to not be any logic. There's even some of those moments that I TOTALLY LOVE in adventure games where you can see the logical solution right in front of you, but you have to do some completely arbitrary thing before you're allowed to do it. Yay. How fun, apparently.Also, the game is apparently supposed to be funny, but I personally think it isn't. Maybe I'm just a grumpy old man.			"

												Hamlet or [insert words here] certainly lives up to its satire laden title. The game lampoons not only its Shakespearean source material, but also the expected conventions of adventure gaming. Reading scraps of paper will only provide false leads. Multiple interactable objects... sometimes whole areas of the screen... are useless in these lateral thinking-esque exercises. There are some ""normal"" puzzles, sure, appearing just frequently enough to lull you into believing that the zaniness has stopped, right before you run smack into the next inane situation. But, unfortunately, none of that is actually enjoyable.For most, the appeal of puzzle games is in solving puzzles. Here, however, there is no sense of accomplishment when the screen temporarily goes black, signifying the move to the next level. Oh, you might recognize the cleverness of the developer in constructing such an abstract solution, but you didn't actually solve anything. You just clicked on the part of the screen that was clickable... for one ""level"", you clicked on the exact same spot a few dozen times, just waiting for something wacky to happen.Hamlet or [etc] would make for an entertaining animated short. The character designs are cute, the movement is fluid, the sound effects surprisingly catchy. Most importantly, the surreal sense of humor would work perfectly in that medium, fitting into the mold of Chuck Jones cartoons. Take the existing assets, drop the forced clicking, and you've got something here. As a game, however, it's not worth playing at any price.			"

												Cute little puzzler - it's in this week's (30th Jan 2014) Flying Bundle, 5. A few of the moving components to the game are a little glitched, which will fill you with rage if you have the patience of nerds at a Batman premiére. Do be aware that some of these puzzles require a little lateral thinking (i.e. 'what? that makes no sense'), which will also fill you with rage, but it only lasts a second until the shame sets in because you are an idiot. The entire game will last you probably around an hour if you take rage breaks, maybe longer if you need more frequent rage breaks.All in all, a very sweet little game with well-designed environments and an interesting adaption of Hamlet in a new medium. If it's in a bundle, definitely get it, but not for Steam's full-price.			"

												Decent puzzler. Mouse-only. Really good game if a girl is nearby.Some games, if they're on-screen, give girls the excuse to hang out, stay over, eat & stay the night, and generally cause trouble. This is one of those games.I was disappointed in the lack of _thorough_ help in Hamlet. Some items represented in Help cannot be easily located, and for that, going online was necessary. Not the end of the world, though.However, I definitely give the game a good thumbs-up, if only for the fact there are few self-explanatory, non-text-driven games out there.I add it to Samorost 2, Windosill, Machinarium, and several other don't-miss-if-you're-in-bed-sick-with-the-flu and remembered-to-bring-the-mouse-with-you-to-bed-this-time games.

But if a game is really great and fun I wouldnt mind the length too much. However I really love Shakespeares Hamelt and personally I didnt like what they made off it - with an alien hero and an evil Polonius... That just wasnt for me.PRO- clear and well structured screens- help if needed- very different and unique challengesCON- extremly short- weird story line (sorry but an alien replacing Hamel?!)- easy tasks (password, etc.)- far far away from anything remotely related to Hamlet. Really its just using the names.Conclusion: Genreally, the idea of making Shakespearen classics into fun cute-art point and click games is great.

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively. Gameplay: Actually, let's not talk about the gameplay right off the bat. Let's be honest; the only reason why you're looking at this game is because of the title, so let's spend a paragraph talking about the title. Let's take it apart bit by bit. First is the usage of Hamlet. This story really has nothing at all to do with Hamlet, so that's already misleading. ""Without MMORPG features"" is a vague statement; Volgarr the Viking doesn't have MMORPG features, and you don't hear that game touting it in the title. As for shaders... what's so bad about shaders? They make things look good. You can't tell me that even a game like Minecraft looks better without shaders. Product placement is... well, okay, there isn't any in this game. Again, is that worth bragging about? The whole title screams of pandering to a crowd of jaded cynics. Again, this isn't really relevant to the gameplay, but it's something that I felt needed to be talked about before we go into the game itself.Looking at the Steam store description for this game, a key feature is that the game is ""in the best traditions of classic adventure games."" That throws some red flags for me, as I've always felt that ""old-school"" point-and-click adventures were not a game design choice to aspire to; rather, an unfortunate consequence of the system limitations of the time. The key features continue to describe this game as containing 25 levels (five puzzles per Act; five acts, so that's not a lie), boss battles (yes, they're there) and logic puzzles.Logic puzzles, eh? Where's Waldo is a logic puzzle? No, I'm not joking; there's a Where's Waldo level. There's also a level where if you don't memorize an exact path through a waypoint in the second or two it's displayed, it becomes a guessing game. There's also a simalcrum of Simon Says if you painted the buttons to the game beige and had to either memorize or write down the position's respective colors. There's also a fair few action sequences in the game, which are truly the low points of this game. In fact, there were a few instances in which I had the right solution to an area, but didn't do it fast enough the first time before the game wrenched control away from me, so I then assumed that solution was incorrect. It is worth noting that not all puzzles in this game are awful; there's a few pretty clever ones (a few personal favorites being 1-3, 2-1, and 3-2), but the ratio of clever puzzles to not-clever-puzzles/not-puzzles/action-sequences is too high to recommend this game for gameplay. 4/10.Story: As mentioned earlier, this game says it's based off of Hamlet, and it is... in the same way that Super Mario Bros. is based off of Hamlet. The writing can be pretty funny at times and really try-hard at others, so it's a mixed bag. It is still enjoyable, however, so I feel alright with giving the writing a 6/10, even though there really isn't much to talk about here, as the game is roughly an hour long.Graphics: The art style in this game really didn't do much for me, but that's more of a personal preference. As stated in the title, there are no shaders, although as stated as well, I don't find that to be a selling point. I can see that effort went into the art design, so some attention is worth drawing to it. An unfortunate drawback to the art style is that sometimes it is hard to see what to do in a room since the rooms can become very busy at times. Regarding optimization... well, if your computer can run steam, it should be able to run this. I'd run it in windowed mode, since it's locked at 1024x768, but that's your decision to make. 3/5.Music: Boss 2's track is pretty rad. Nothing else is very memorable, though. Voice acting, whenever present, is Sim-ese. I know I've had things to say about the prior three areas, but there really isn't much to talk about here. 2/5.Separate scores are 4/6/3/2; cumulative score of 5.0/10. I picked this game up in an IndieRoyale Bundle, so I don't feel like I've been janked, but I still feel like I'll never play this game again, hence why I erred on the thumbs down side of recommendation. Again, there are a few clever puzzles in the game, but there's just too many ""not-puzzles"" for me to recommend this to any fan of adventure games, or even a fan of puzzle games.			"

												A game in the same line as Machinarium, but with much less likeable characters, and a clear lack of polish.The irony is that it's based on a story by some famous author I never heard of before (William what?), but this Hamlet barely has anything to tell. It's just a parody that will make Hamlet readers uneasy, and completely confuse those who didn't read it.Not a bad game overall, but also not one that I could recommend, sorry.			"

												This isn't a good game, at least not for the price. The graphics and music are well made, and there aren't any bugs, but most of the puzzles (except for two that I liked) are boring and/or really frustrating. They don't make any sense or follow any logic, and you don't get any hints or clues, except if you wait a long time, so the only way to solve them is by trial and error, which is just not fun at all. If you, like me, get this in a bundle, have nothing else to play and is okay with being frustrated and annoyed, it might be worth it, otherwise not!			"

												Cute graphics.  A light game if you have a few minutes to kill as that is about as long as this game lasts.  A few minutes and I'm not exaggerating.  As far as the hints go - you can make a sandwich, take a bathroom break, return a few phone calls, and send a few texts before they are available.  Sometimes they aren't really that helpful which is a quality I really appreciate in hints. I just clicked on that hint for the fun of it not because I needed an actual hint. >.> Really, really not worth the money.  If it was $0.99 maybe. Disappointment :(			"

												Alright, real talk: I don't understand this game. Yeah, sure, it has a silly name, some pretty pictures, and some kind of ""homage"" to old school point and click adventures, but I don't understand why this game exists. The difficulty curve and ""clever"" gameplay literally goes from a nice medium starting puzzle to a series of the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ing click-fest ""puzzles"" towards the end. It's like they literally ran out of ideas after only 1.7 hours of gameplay it had in the first place. Why does this exist? WHY? WHY DO I EVEN OWN THIS!?

												This game is $5. The same price as binding of isaac. I finished this entire game in about an hour maybe a little bit over. It can be replayed but there's no point because there's nothing new. There are no achivements in this game. There is nothing to do after you finish it. Also the penguins mock you. I finished this all without a guide except the part with the penguins and the old man. There is nothing hard about this game. It's a cute idea and all but seriously. I paid full price for this game and I cry every time because I could've use the money on a game I would've much more enjoyed. This game sits in my library and everytime I look at it I am reminded of the  $5 I spent on this game and I cry. Binding of isaac on the other hand, is the same price but has 100x the replayability. There is actual dificulty. Basically, don't spend your $5 on this game unless you want to pay $5 for a game that you will play for one hour, get bored, and never touch ever again.			"

												While some of the puzzles are fun, others are infuriating and the 'clues' are frequently much less than helpful and take far too long to appear.  In addition there's a fair ammount of needing to click on things at exactly the right moment and if you don't, being sent back to the beginning of that particular 'puzzle'.  Even after looking up the walk through, I hit a point where I simply could not click fast enough or accurately enough to progress at all.			"
