												A Vita game from 2012, Liberation's low-rent roots are immediately clear. Visuals are basic and animation crude despite the HD spruce, and the featured setting - an 18th century Louisiana incorporating New Orleans and Chichen Itza - feels oddly familiar. A croc-infested bayou bridging the two locations is essentially a murky version of ACIII's wilderness. Granted, it's an interesting period for yet another spot of virtual tourism, Ubisoft casting their historical lens on the French and Indian War, the American Revolutionary War, and the horrors of slavery therein.You play Aveline de Grandpré, the enigmatic daughter of a wealthy white merchant and the slave he purchased. Hers is a unique perspective, able to slink through social classes in order to observe them from within and without. The Persona System is the key.This lets you dress Aveline in three different outfits. As The Lady, Aveline can spend coin to bribe her way into restricted areas and lure guards from patrol routes by turning on the charm.As The Slave, Aveline loses her combat strength but gains the ability to incite riots and blend in with other slaves. And as The Assassin, Aveline can do all that stabby stuff you're accustomed to.Trouble is, donning alternative outfits just isn't appealing.Besides a money-making minigame in which you send out ships loaded with spices and cotton by navigating a dull series of menus, there are no new marquee features. It feels stripped-down.Liberation works best when it gives you a strict set of rules and a large area to infiltrate. Sneaking into a governor's mansion, or disrupting some voodoo ritual in the deepest darkest bayou, are lent bite by strict fail states - get spotted and it's game over. The result is a game with a healthy dose of tension.For a multitude of reasons, Aveline is the kind of character I’d like to see more of in gaming, but Assassin’s Creed Liberation HD is just too lacking in too many areas to make it happen. There’s no one thing to point to as overtly broken; it simply dies by a thousand tiny cuts. Its craft is sloppy, its design remains shackled by ill-conceived new ideas, as well as the limitations of the platform it hails from. It’s the definitive version of a game that had very little going for it in the first place.Overall 6/10.			"

												Assassin's Creed Liberation centers around a character by the name of Aveline, a woman raised from childbirth as an Assassin whom now struggles to find her way and test her faith and loyalty to the Assassin Brotherhood and her mentor - all while keeping her business afloat.This game is a remastered version from the original PSVita release. It features MUCH higher resolution textures, some better music cues, and rebuilt lighting to go along with it all. It does, however, still look a tad blocky at times, as is the case with mobile adaptations. Aveline herself seemed to have been upgraded a bit and her animations are slightly better, but most everything around her looks fairly blocky and inconsistant, though this has almost always been the case with every single AC installation. I do have to give special mention to the lighting in this game though, as it gave a more impressive, visual look to the game that expanded upon the coloring and fidelity of the game that wasn't present in the rather monotone PSVita version, which had a more drab appearance and was less colorful.The gameplay, for better or for worse (definately for worse) is standard AC, but this particular game has a few issues additional to what's already dreary mechanics. Aveline has 3 different ""Personas"" which in concept should alter the game marginally - but to me, it doesn't and mainly adds ways to further monotonize the game. The ""Assassin"" Persona is your go-to - You can use every weapon in your arsenal, can ""freely"" (more on that later) climb up structures and buildings as well as have the added nuisance of ""Yellow Lighting"" enemies. The ""Slave"" Persona is a less glorified version of the Assassin Persona except you can use less weapons and is not as easy to ""Yellow Light"" guards and the ""Lady"" Persona, which removes climbing ENTIRELY and severely limits your combat options and of course adds the random nuisance of thugs pestering you. The Persona system in general just ended up being rather underused for me because it requires the need of ""Dressing Chambers"", and most of the time I would rather just make do with the outfit I had on (except for the lady persona) and just be on my merry way, additionally, it doesn't bring many gameplay alterations to really warrant using any of them except to maybe add or take away certain annoyances.As far as the standard AC mechanics go... I would dare to say some here are actually worse than they were in AC3. The combat is very random with very little indicators as to what may work or not. Until you actually pick up the ""Whip"" later on in the game - combat is still very ""Counter-centric"" except the game itself doesn't give you many options to varie what you do. Some enemies can counter your counters and there's no indicator as to who they may be, they just do - and is very annoying because it makes you keep guessing as to which one may work, only to find it that it suddenly doesn't work. Combat in this game I would say is by far it's weakest it's every been in an AC game, even compared to AC1. The actual climbing and free running mechanics here are fine - they certainly aren't the worst it's ever been, but there's a few issues I have to point out - one is the ""Sticky"" issue that also plagued AC3 - where your character tends to want to scale stuff you never even pointed to, making you lose time and another where if your camera is slightly off, you have a chance to make Aveline jump to somewhere you didn't want her to do so, even if you were pointing in the right direction. These two issues aren't particularly common, but they are definately present, and it can be VERY annoying. Another personal issue I had with the game was more of a limitation than anything, but I found that this game was more linear than other AC games - particularly having ""blocked off sections"" that look climbable and are not.Stealth. Well, not much to say here really. It's just as bad as it was in AC3. You can hide in certain bushes, but guard don't particularly respond well to alerts or are as dynamic. There are actual occasions where you're up in a tree and you can see the enemy looking UP at the tree, but doesn't trigger the alarm or Yellow Lights or anything, it's one of those occasions where the AI just latches on to where you are and it serves to severely break immersion. You have the option of using Poison Darts or Berserk Darts (given later in the game). Poison Darts make the enemy stumble about and eventually die, and Berserk darts make the enemy wild and prone to attacking his allies. Both of which are very helpful in situations where stealth is a must. The game also has a number of collectibles, which honestly serve next to no purpose. You can collect Diary Pages to uncover a hidden mini story behind Aveline and her Mother - you can collect Jewelry from charming certain people using the Lady Persona, and of course the usual chest hunt for money. There are also purchases available (via in game stores or ""Smugglers"") that allow you to purchase weapons and pocket watches (another form of collectible), aswell as a minigame in the form of management of trading/selling goods for Aveline's business found in her Headquarters - as well as the obligatory ""Abstergo"" or in this game ""Erudito"" hunt for truth - that have you hunting ""Citizen E"" for added cutscenes.All in all though, it's fairly hard for me to really recommend this game to non AC fans. It doesn't bring anything new to an already drab set of base mechanics, is, in my opinion one of the worst AC games in recent memory (Still better than AC3 due to an actual interesting character) due to the extremely limiting gameplay and linearity the story progresses at, as well as some odd bug here and there that make the entire package feel woefully underwhelming. As it stands, it's a decent entry in the AC franchise that is worth a look if you're a fan of the series or if you're looking for a different take on the series - otherwise I would honestly say skip this game, and get the much better Black Flag instead.Pros:-Very interesting Main Character, Aveline.-Amazing Lighting and texture effects bring out life in a drab setting.-The Whip. This needed to be used more.Cons:-Combat is weakest it's been in any AC game.-The 3 Persona system is nigh useless and serves as mere nuisances that any utility.-Purchases and Upgrades are fairly useless.-Weak Collectibles and endgame. No real reason to replay the game outside of story.-Very short. You can beat the story in around 5 - 7 hours depending on how experienced you are.-Enemies pop up contantly from out of nowhere.-Stealth is very weak.Additional Note: The PC Port seems to have a few issues pertaining to AA. AA in this game SHOULD be turned off if your CPU rating isn't above 3Ghz. It WILL cause heavy lag. Not sure why, but AA in this game isn't very well optimized. VSync locks the Framerate to 30.EDIT: I only put a ""Non Recommended"" because it fell right in the middle for me. It's not a terrible game either. Some people DO enjoy this game more than other AC's, that's entirely dependant on you and what you enjoy.			"

												I just played through the introduction and gotta admit that I'm positively surprised. I remember reading mostly bad reviews about Liberation when it came out for Vita, because many people thought that its linear design is kind of a breach of style for the Assassin's Creed franchise. After beating all the games in the main series I think that Liberation's lack of liberation (ha!) has its advantages and helps to keep the player's focus on the story. Storywise it is safe to say that Aveline's situation is very comparable to Connor's in Assassin's Creed 3, but her character seems more sympathic since she is not so mysterious and uncommunicative as Connor. The Soundtrack, as always, is brilliant and the graphics are nicely remastered.Update: Apparently some people are complaining about random crashes and framerate issues when Anti Aliasing is turned on. I'm running on a GTX770, an AMD FX 8350 and 8 Gigs of RAM without any problems.			"

												The Assassin's Creed marathon continues. This time it's Liberation, a story set in the same time era as Assassin's Creed 3, you don't need to have played number 3 to understand the story, it's completely stand alone.The game was initially released as an exclusive to the PlayStation Vita, but was released on Steam earlier this year renamed Assassin's Creed Liberation HD. Sadly the graphics are anything but HD, you can definitely tell that this is a port from a console since the graphical options are next to none.I failed to follow the story after reaching the halfway point, but the game play is pretty much as you'd expect from a Assassin's Creed game, the earlier stages are actually quite challenging, but once you get your hands on the whip, taking out swarms of enemies becomes as easy as taking candy from a baby.This is another that you'll need to play with a controller to fully get to grasps with, but the controls are simple enough to pick up once you start playing.Although this game is good, it is definitely the worst in the series, poor graphics, and the difficult to follow story line really drag it down. I would only recommend you playing this if you are huge fan of the series or have nothing else to play and want to fill ten hours.			"

												Assassin's Creed reached its zenith around the 2nd and 3rd games, and appears to have been sliding rapidly down into the muck ever since -- at least if this entry in the lore is anything to judge.  Liberation takes what should be a great character, and tosses her into an uninteresting story, in an uninteresting land, read to you by bored voice-over artists.  But it is more than that.It's the polish.  Ubisoft used to make these beautifully polished games, that were so complete in their inner consistency that after a few hours, you would begin to believe its history.  You could *feel* the swagger while you're walking down the dusty alleys of ancient cities.  You felt like you were part of a story that wanted you to be a part of it.This game is missing that.  In my mind, I imagine the money guy coming downstairs and saying, ""Make me another AC game. No, no... don't use our good people. Off-shore this. Give this to the interns.""  Because that's what this feels like:  A third party expansion to a fairly decent game, done by a team of outsiders who just don't love the material.This game is phoned-in and feels like it.  This hurts me. Gawd, I wanted this game to be good...			"

												A smaller Assassin's creed adapted from the PS Vita. It looks rather nice and play mostly like your usual one.You can also see the limitations in terms of smallers Levels (due to the PS Vita stuff) and some clunky controls (due to being handled at first).The graphics are now HD, and textures are okay.This one introduces a system of costumes which could be a lot more interesting if the 3 were actually useful. But you'll find yourself not having a real choice here.But with the okay story, a rather interesting character and a small price. It can be a good choice.			"

												Assassin's Creed Liberation was truly an experience. At points the story felt disjointed, unappealing, and repetitive, but the games overall story is pretty strong. The ending is truly good and the gameplay was the same as Assassin's Creed 3's. This game is good, but I would not go as far to say it is better than Assassin's Creed 3 or any of the other ones. All in all, this game was definitely a fun journey and an interesting plot.			"

												Originally, this game was made as an exclusive title for the Playstation Vita, but was later ported to other systems, like the PC. Yes, it's a port, and it shows.It's supposed to be a HD game, but don't get fooled by that. Though the graphics are not ugly, there's loads of examples of low res textures everywhere. But the worst part, is that the FPS seems to be locked at some very low value, which gets VERY straining on the eyes. And that's my #1 issue with this game, it's painful to play it.The new feature that makes this game different from other AC games, is that the main protaganist can change between 3 different ""roles"", each with a suitable outfit for that role. The roles are Lady, Slave and Assassin. When playing a certain role, there are restrictions to what you can do, or extra things that role can that no one else can. For example, as a Slave, you can pick up crates and walk past guards unnoticed, if you don't take too long.Sounds interesting? Well it isn't. It's a good idea that ends up being a barrier, and restricts you.Else it's just more of the same. This game is often considered as a standalone addition to AC3, so if you've played that one, you already know a lot about what you're getting. Though it isn't nowhere near the size of AC3.The low FPS is the main reason I'm not recommending the game. But apart from that, the rest is pretty much ""meh..."" and not really worth spending much money on. If you're still interested, pick it up on sale, do not buy it at full price.			"

												First off I will rate this game as it is, you will either LIKE this game or REALLY HATE due to the fact that it is just a port of the ps Vita hand held version with better graphics, if you play the game you will notice they did a really good job on this part, I will however start my review on the game itself. Remember this game is a  spinoff and isn't really a huge improvement over IV in any ways .The game itself features its first female protaganist of the series Aveline De Grandpre and she herself is an French African assassin. The story starts off with just starting off stopping naysayers who talk bad about her father's company and assassination contracts. The story itself unfold when her mentor agate told her to assassinate the templar prescence in New Orleans starting with the governer,  It was until her confrontation with the governer that she was told what was going to slaves, which is her main goal, to free them. One thing from here lead to the next. I thought the story to this game was not as strong as the other assassin's creed titles, it didn't really pick up until almost the last section of the game, other than that it really didn't have too many memorable characters in this game and I really only liked aveline.The graphics to the game is really well done since they really put effort into the HD rework it looks great on my monitor, the controller support and keyboard was fine.The musical score to this game is great and really well done, it is unfortunate that most of the gameplay and scene that accomidated just wasn't exciting enoughVoice acting is also nicely done in this gameI however wanted to beat this game as fast as I can so I rush through the story mode and completed it in  about 7 hours with a few deaths here and there. The gameplay is really easy for me and I just rushed the entire missions, I did do the important mission of killing Citizen E's, if you dont know what this is I wont spoil it for you.\I skipped the other things such as finding certain treasures here and there etc so I will go back to it sometimes and do a complete run. The ai in this game is even dumber than any assassin's creed titles combine, I was able to rush through mission by running right in front of thier faces, it wasn't until I touched them that I got detected, and the maps are smaller than previous assassin's creed, this is due to the limitation of the handheld I believe ?Overall I wish aveline storyline was much better than what it is since it didn't excite me too much and it was just so zzz for some odd reason it needed a zing to it, out of the entire franchise this has got to be my least favorite assassin creed title, but hey, what can I say it is a 20 dollar port with HD graphics and I am glad to have played it at all. If anything this game reminds me of an assassin's creed 1 or 2 than anything new and the interface for the ship network trading was just so meh.If anything if you play this game remember, go backwards and finish the rest before ACIV to see its glory. It was really hard for me to go back having played hours and hours of IV but I did it for the story to understand Aveline.+Great music+good voice acting+Environment is nice+Graphics in HD looks great+- you either will think 20 dollars is a good price or you can wait for a price drop up to you-Story was a lackluster-Ai is still stupid as hell-Water kills enemies if they fall in has returned! this wasn't featured until ACIV lol-no multiplayer of any sorts at all, not even something for itself but then again you could be playing it on ACIV			"

												Some concepts seemed interesting but not really well developed, like the disguises system, which could have been something great and turned out to be more of a hassle than a new and interesting gameplay addition.Playing as a female Assassin is also a welcome addition to the series.Sadly, after playing 6 hours I came back to find my savegame deleted and that the game doesn't even let me skip cutscenes. I can't recommend something that can make you lose progress for no reason.			"

												This isn't Black Flag but it's still a good addition to the Assassin's Creed series none the less, the visuals are great and the combat is really smooth and fluid and there are some nice touches to the gameplay such as the 'guises' and the charming mechanic.The downside is that the game doesn't have the same freedom as the stellar Black Flag or anywhere near the vast size but it is a HD conversion of a Playstation Vita game which you have to take into consideration. Ubisoft have done a great job on the conversion and the game visually looks fantastic and plays really well, Recommended!!			"

												Assassin's Creed: Liberation (AC:L) is a rather interesting entry in the AC franchise. It's clear that the developers tried to actually add some new things, and took some risks where the mainline entries play it safe. Ubisoft Bulgaria has been relatively successful too with these changes and additions. The persona system in particular is a welcome addition, as it makes the stealth elements of the game somewhat more sensible and adds some welcome diversity. If Aveline dresses as a lady, she has limited combat ability and no free running ability, but can be far more stealthy and can conduct actual assassinations from time to time. If she dresses as a slave, she has somewhat greater combat ability, can free run and can still slip into quite a few places unnoticed, but she is easily spotted if she does anything out of character and in open combat is noticeably inferior to the assassin persona. The assassin persona then is what people are used to from the AC franchise, with the exception that as an assassin, Aveline is always regarded as suspicious by guards, which makes a good deal of sense given the veritable smithy she carries around with her. Another positive aspect of the game is that the protagonist is a significant improvement over both Connor and Edward Kenway, who both were wasted opportunities. Aveline is a strong character with a clear independent streak, and who has sensible relations with other people in her life. Her voice actress also does a good job, which is especially noticeable in the short section of the game where she meets Connor. Her background is also used much better as a way to tell stories from the perspectives of slaves, where this opportunity was largely wasted for Native Americans in Assassin's Creed III. It is of course still not perfect - game developers still hesitate to show the full brutality and barbarity of slavery in the way that films now do - but it is a significant step ahead of other big budget games. The game is however not perfect. While Aveline is an interesting character, and they do showcase some interesting things, the story is on the whole not very interesting, and fails to feel like a cohesive whole. I suspect that much story content has been cut over development, perhaps in an effort to cut the game down to a suitable size for handhelds. I should also mention that with regards to story, the game does not have you leave the game world at any point, so for those who hate the present day sections in all the other Assassin's Creed titles, that might be a big plus.While I can only guess when it comes to the story, when it comes to other elements, it is undeniable that the game suffers from being originally developed for a handheld platform. Missions are generally too easy, with even the side objectives incredibly generous, so as to be more forgiving to compensate for poorer handheld controls. There is also noticeable cutting in missions, with what would normally be one mission cut into several smaller chunks to facilitate the start-stop nature of handheld gaming. While some might not mind, I found it reduced the flow of the game and on the whole made it feel like less of a 'grand' affair and more of a mundane experience where you complete small tasks. In presentation too the game suffers from being developed for handhelds, because while the HD port has unquestionably improved things massively, it has left the game with a rather inconsistent visual appearance. Some sections look excellent, but a terrible draw distance and the  sparse design of many parts of the game world make it all too clear that this was not a game initially developed for a capable platform.Overall, I would recommend AC:L to fans of the franchise. The game is generally a successful entry in the series, and I think most people who have played through the other AC games will appreciate some of the new mechanics and the other ways in which AC:L differs from its console counterparts. I also hope that those developing future Assassin's Creed titles will try to incorporate some of the things AC:L does well, rather than just discarding them, as has been the case with so many added mechanics and features throughout the series. 6.5/10			"

												Another day, another Assassin's Creed.. although this game is unlike the others... this time around the testosterone gets traded in for a little bit of estrogen.  Released along side Assassins Creed 3, Liberation was meant to be a PS vita game, it was later ported to the Xbox 360, PS 3 and then later the PC.   As a port of a vita game Liberation doesn't feel like a full fledged Assassin Creed title, it seems sort of bare bones, although with that said you can still fully expect all the same type of gameplay you've grown to love from previous AC games..Story  -  Liberation is an attempt by Abstergo Industries (yes that Abstergo) to commercially release interactive experiences to the general public.  Abstergo being all evil and sinister they censor the content to block out mentions of Templar's and Assassins, but fear not, thanks to hacktivist group you'll eventually discover the full story.  Unlike other previous Assassin Creed titles, the game has no alternate storyline set in the current age, you stay in the game (Animus) the entire time.   You will play the game as  Aveline de Grandpré.  Aveline is the daughter of a wealthy French trader and an African slave mother.  She'll set out on an adventure set in New Orleans in 1757's as a child, following your mother,  after being distracted by and chasing a chicken (Chicken Chaser...  oh wait that's Fable 1) Aveline finds herself lost and her mother missing, fast forward 13 years, a now grown Aveline lives with her father in his mansion.  Her father has since married a woman who cares for Aveline and treats her like a daughter.  It's from this starting point that Aveline starts on her grand adventure, to help free slaves, discover and stop the temper's grand schemes, potentially find love and discover a secret 13 years in the making. Gameplay - nothing much has changed from previous Assassin's Creed games except the size, being a port of a vita game Liberation is shorter, has fewer collectibles, and generally seems rather lacking of extra content.  The game is comprised of 3 main areas, New Orleans city, The Bayou and Chichén Itzá.  The major addition to the game that wasn't seen in previous games is the Blowgun, which in my opinion is a total game changer.  This allows you to use a a weapon which can quickly kill enemies from stealth.  This weapon alone makes every mission easy mode.  Hide in bushes, blow a few darts, loot more darts and move on..   Another addition is three alternate persona's, the slave, assassin and Lady.  Each of these has their advantages and disadvantages.  The Slave has a weapon restriction, no guns, no main weapon, only the hidden blades and blow gun, also notoriety is very fast to increase.     The Lady has the same weapon restrictions as the Slave, as well having jumping disabled.  notoriety increases the slowest of any persona.  Lastly is the Assassin, which has no weapon or jumping restrictions, but has a 1 notoriety at all times. Recommended  -  Liberation was your typical Assassin's Creed fair, it really isn't necessary to play this game, nor is it part of the Abstergo storyline the other games followed.  Aside from being software released by Abstergo this game is a total stand alone.  In future AC games you get some mentions of Liberation but they are rather limited from what I've seen.  While this game is good, it doesn't quite live up to the other games, it's still a pretty good game but just not quite up to the level of previous games.  Going forward to Black Flag Liberation will seem really dull..  With that said I'd still suggest you play the game, after all who wants to play a serious and skip out on one of the chapters, even if that Chapter isn't the best game in the series.			"

												Not really much to say about this game. The story is forgettable at best, full of predictable twists along the way, and doesn't add anything of consequence to the overarching plot of the series.The setting (18th century New Orleans) doesn't let you feel like this is a ""real"" Assassin's Creed game, which is something Assassin's Creed III also suffers from. In addition, the ""Bayou"" area is a pain to navigate through.There are some bugs and glitches, as well as overall subpar performance, likely resulting from the fact that this was originarily a PlayStation Vita title.But Liberations is not entirely bad. It introduces a very interesting gameplay mechanic to the series, the persona system. I also liked the protagonist, Aveline, and, for the most part, the dialogue, even though the voice acting here is not particularly good.Sadly these few qualities are not enough for me to recommend the game, though. Even if you're a die-hard Assassin's Creed fan, you can skip it and I guarantee you won't be missing out on much.			"

And that's not even based on the fact it was originally a portable title which received a much desired HD update that seems to be what all the cool kids are doing nowadays.There is very little I can actually praise in Liberation because it will feel like a letdown even, if not especially, if you're already a fan of the Assassin's Creed series considering how disjointed story-wise and obviously rushed in design it feels with even more pointless collectible gathering if you're foolish enough to give in to mindless scouring over that carefully pinpointed map and awkward trading interface because that's what people apparently want in Ubisoft's distorted mindset. Actually, scratch the first part - there are precisely TWO things I would like to single out as good ideas: the trio of personas you get to use (Assassin, Lady and Slave) which are distinct enough but sadly underutilized, and the credits ruse which genuinely got me at first. Shame the game didn't have more of that courage to do something with its story aside from bland predictability and stilted characters abound.Hey, at least the credits are skippable this time. "

												First af all, this is not a bad game but it's also not that good, it's not as good as the usual AC games, it's a spin-off, a very limited AC (it was originally developed for the PS VITA) and I can't suggest you to buy it, if not with a great discount.AC:L has the graphics of AC2 and a very ""short"" LOD; a story which is practically irrelevant to the main AC storyline and which isn't very well explained (you need to find and read many documents to understand it better); it's short, 16 hours to complete the campaign + many secondary missions + collectibles hunt, for comparison AC4 took me 66 hours to complete; the ""economy"" is vey limited, you can buy shops but you won't get money from them later on, there is no home\base to upgrade and the sea trades are missing the combat side present in AC4.On the plus side, it's the first AC to feature a woman as the main protagonist and it introduce a new mechanic (changing clothes to fool enemies).

												(I have played and finished Assassin's Creed 3 but is not connected with steam, i recommend playing that first.)If your here and love the Assassin's Creed series, well heres some more cool Assassin action.More stealth mechanics, a new set of different weapons and now a ""bad @ss"" female Assassin with different personas.Pace through the game as you get to explore, best your foes with smooth combat and new weapons as well as more cool parkour.What's New?:-Explore the 17th century New Orleans and Louisiana Bayou a danger filled swamp-Different costumes for each persona (optional Assassin's hood)-Buy upgrades and use the new blowpipe and blowpipe parasol-Troll guards with the new WhipA great game with another original story and same unique game mechanics for the other AC, another i would love to play again.

												This is the first AC game for me.  It was on sale, so I thought I'd try it out, and I was looking for something with a strong female protagonist.  I was really interested that it was set in New Orleans and in the time period.  Beautiful graphics, enjoyed dialogue and accents, had fun with running through the trees and across the rooftops.  Some people who've played the other AC games were pretty critical, but as a newcomer, I have no complaints.  And, it's made me really want to start at th beginning of the franchise and play the rest, and really get into the whole plot.			"

												To all the hardcore (or at the very least semi-hardcore) Assassin's Creed fans, I have but one thing to say: Assassin's Creed Liberation is certainly not as great as many of the other games in the franchise, but Aveline's adventure is without any doubt an enjoyable ride for all you stealthy killers out there. Personally, I am a huge fan of the (pre-) American Revolution setting of this and the previous AC game and the story is really not too bad as many other reviewers have said. Of course  the plot is not as convulted or rich as, let's say, AC III, but considering it's a PS Vita port, Ubisoft really did do a good job. The revamped graphics are also very pleasing to the eye. The combat and the freerun are as fluid as you'd expect from an AC game.So go on ahead, fellow Assassins! The Brotherhood -ehm, Sisterhood- is waiting!			"

												Well, as you can see I have 44 hours in this game.. Not sure how I got 44 hours in one playthrough but yeah... Anyway, I really enjoyed this game, if they didn't tell me it was a port from a hand-held I would've never realised, it looks decent.To be honest, the gameplay is much smoother than any AC game to date if you ask me(maybe not as flashy or cool), and the pathing, climbing and jumping is alot less annoying. It just seems smarter. Other than that It has a pretty good story with a twist at the end I didn't think was 100% obvious, I liked that^^ I also love the fact that the protagonist is female, as a hardcore tomb raider fan I love kicking♥♥♥♥♥with a badass female character >.>It just feels THAT much more satisfying, lol.I wish they would have taken the oppurtunity in AC:Unity to make atleast ONE of the FOUR characters in the story a female, but I guess ubisoft likes their sausagefests, oh well... Anyway that's a bit off-topic, this is a great game, definitely worth the price and a playthrough if you like AC in my oppinion.			"

												8/10+ an assassin's creed game with a cool female protagonist+ nice story as always in new orleans+ good combat, similar to ac3+ good presentation, loved the music, areas are smaller than in previous ac games though (and that's natural since it's a port from vita i think)+/- no side missions at all, can be good or bad, for me it' s good since those liberation misisons or feathers collecting etc in previous ones were very annoying- nothing new, the usual ac missions, meaning go there fetch that or kill the bad guys- short for an ac game, doing everything and im near the end after around 6 hoursbottom line: if you are an assassin's creed fan, don't hesitate, you will love it.

												I recommend the game but with a huge caveat: of all the Assassin's Creed games I've played, this is by far the most buggy.  Here's the bugs I spotted without even searching for them in my 31 hour play through:-Game controls locked up repeatedly when pressing the wrong button after B when being attacked by a wild cat.-Canoes about 30-50 feet floating in mid-air (unsuable).  Restart game required.-Mounting and dismounting canoes often is more difficult than it should be.-The mission where you are supposed to scout out the three camps, I was a slave and looted the chests without alerting the guards.  The subesequent mission where you are supposed to loot the chests therefore breaks because 2 out of 3 are still in looted condition.  I have yet to find a way to replay the mission to reset the chests.-Game will only accept input from keyboard+mouse or controller at once; it does not accept both; moreover, when my wireless controller turns off and I turn it back on, the game switches to and stays in keyboard+mouse mode instead of going back to controller.-I've had a flickery static effect that usually only happens on level transitions keep happening over and over again.  I had to restart the game because it was driving me batty.-When exiting combat and sometimes looting, the look controls often lock up while it is finishing a painstakingly long animation.  Very annoying.-Typo on Lady Persona page.-It takes too long to open/close map/menu.  When are developers going to learn to stop animating menu entry/exit?I also have one general complaint that applies to Assassin's Creed III as well: get rid of or automate the trade system.  It feels like work to use it which is a lot like Mass Effect 2's planet probing.Despite all of that, I still recommend the game and the reason why is simple: it's better than Assassin's Creed III.  Not as long, not as varied, and no manning the helm of a ship, but the story in this game was actually enjoyable and the new mechanic of personas and the addition of the whip was a nice change.  Granted, if you're tired of Assassin's Creed gameplay, especially Assassin's Creed III, avoid this game.  If you like Assassin's Creed despite this title's particularlly glaring shortcomings, by all means grab it, play it, and enjoy it.			"

												Potential slight spoilers, nothing major, but if you wanna go in blind to concepts don't read.This game was very meh whenever it comes to the AC series. It feels like Brotherhood and Revelations did to 2, but shorter and more rushed, with a much smaller area. The glitches are mostly graphical, but they can really break immersion.PRO's:-Really cool idea based on propoganda circulated by Abstergo.-Main character that breaks the mold as far as AC games go.-The whip is a really nice game exclusive weapon.-Persona system: This is a really cool system that allows for a deeper social stealth system that I really hope stays present in the series. It also added some sense of variability to missions as well!CON's:-Severely lackluster environment, the game took a really interesting area and massively copy and pasted the same elements over and over.-Tiny map. probably the smallest in the series.-Riddled with bugs and glitches: Since the game was programmed using the same engine as ACIII, a lot of the problems with Connor are present with Aveline (spoiler warning, the main charatcter's name) she is really sticky in freerun and somewhat unresponsive during combat. Graphical glitches run rampant in the game as well, which I can usually excuse, but it really breaks immersion here. -Shallow storytelling: This is a REALLY COOL CONCEPT done really poorly. The main premise of the game is as propoganda circulated by Abstergo to paint the Assassin's as unorganized and untrustworthy, and the templars as organnized and just. The main story takes around 5-6 hours to beat, the rest of the time in my playtime was side missions and such. By the time you start actually caring about the characters and what's going on, it's over. I would really like to see more of this in newer games (this is as far as I've played so I'm writing the review based on  no knowledge of newer games, so pardon if this happens in newer games without my knowledge.)-Not rewarding: Okay so this one was a major drawback. In other AC games there is usually some kind of useful reward for doing optional things. Here the rewards are completely cosmetic or useless. I never found myself using any of them because I couldn't find a way the ends justify the means to get them. All in all the game was, as I said in the opener, meh. Not necessarily bad, but not a strong entry in the series. It had a lot of the problems that its big brother ACIII had in it. I can't say one way or another whether to get it or not, I would definitely wait for a sale and not spend $20 on it. I personally didn't enjoy it enough to RECOMMEND it, but I'm not going to say a definite yes or no because a lot of my issues were with my personal tastes, and I know that not everyone shares those with me.

												Assassin's Creed Liberation HD this is the first game where the main character girl! It's nice!In this game only Single player. Story: at the beginning of the game we play for a little girl - this is the main character. After we show it as an adult, she grew up with a step-father and mother. But we can not tell how she got into the brotherhood of Assassins. On one quest we meet with Connor from Assassin Creed III.As a result, the main enemy of the Templars is the stepmother of the protagonist. (I will not tell you everything because you will not be fun to play).Weapons: choice of weapons is small, there is an interesting weapon: a gun with two barrels (you can buy in the shop shopping), whip (you get it at some point through the game), a tube for firing poison darts, tomahawk Connor, an umbrella from which you can shoot poisonous darts (you will not discover if you will stand at a distance).Gameplay: gameplay from Assassin's Creed III: running through the trees, combat style and other... But in this game to much bugs!!!! Bugs with audio, with combats, with textures, with items!New in gameplay: in the forest, where a lot of swamps you can control canoe, we can change into three types of costumes: assassin, hired worker (I do not remember the correct name) and the lady (in this dress, you can use an umbrella with poisonous darts). By default, any location in the assassin outfit you will be the first level of fame - the guards will notice you. Also, if you climb and jump in - you will raise the level of investigation. In previous games had no such problems with the search. New enemies in the forest - crocodiles, they can be found in nests in the forest, where they guard the eggs.Graphic: 50% of graphic looks like in Assassin's Creed III. other 50% graphic is bad, have much bugs (for example problems with the drawing of buildings on long distances). You can say that I have a weak computer, but in Assassin Creed III I had no problems with that.I don't recommend this game...You may ask why ?!Answer: a lot of bugs in the gameplay and graphics, a lot of inexplicable moments in history and this game was boring for me.P.S. Sorry for my English (:			"

												In many ways, Assassin's Creed Liberation could be just as well called ""Assassin's Creed 3 Lite Version"". It never feels quite like a complete Assassin's Creed game and doesn't really bring anything new to the table. That said, I still really enjoyed it for what it was, especially considering that it's technically a PSP Vita game.Speaking of, I don't know if would recommend the PC port over the console or handheld versions. This feels very much like a console port, and in my 20 hours of playtime I encountered several crashes.Liberation isn't the best Assassin's Creed, but I think most fans will still enjoy what it has to offer. Just don't expect it to match the quality of something ike AC2.			"

												I had hopes for Assassin's Creed Liberation. I saw the negative reviews and thought, ""Well, it can't be any worse than Assassin's Creed III."" Sadly, I was wrong. The game is littered with problems. The framer rate is noticeably jarring and the whole game has a weird, molasses-like feeling to it that a game involving flowing parkour should not have. The gameplay is unchanged from previous games. Enemy attacks. I press ""B"" on the Xbox 360 controller. I counter. I then press ""X"" to kill or I press ""A"", ""B"", or ""Y"" if the enemy is immune to kill counters. A lot of time, one has to experiment to find out whether or not an enemy is immune to kill counters, which makes getting some of the ""don't get damaged"" optional objectives fairly annoying. There are numerous tailing missions, probably as much as any other Assassin's Creed game which is definitely saying something as this game's about half as long. The tailing missions are just as enjoyable as they were in the previous games in that at best, they're boring time-wasters, and at worst, they're frustrating and not enjoyable. I encountered numerous glitches whilst playing. At one point, my character fell through the ground in the bayou area and I was stuck swimming in nothing. At another point, an alligator lunged at me to eat me, but ended up falling through the ground himself. Aveline then seemed to have an epileptic fit and I was desynchronized. Sometimes counters just won't register and enemies will attack without the big glowing emblem on their head -- and I'm not saying that they should always have that or else I wouldn't be able to counter them (I've played through the Arkham games with no problem on Hard where there are no emblem notifications), just that it is discouraging to see the game seemingly break its own rules. I also experienced a glitch with the ship trading system in the game. In order to make the money required to buy all the weapons and outfits, one has to send out ships to sell items. This is similar to the Brotherhood assignments in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and Revelations and to the Homestead missions in Assassin's Creed III. When a ship arrives and sells its materials, the player is notified and given the money. Sometimes when I would be playing a mission, I'd see a notification and receive money, and then desynchronize afterwards due to an error I made and start back at a checkpoint prior to when I received the money. I'd play for a few minutes and notice that the notification hasn't popped up again. That's right: Desynchronizing during a mission after receiving money for ship trading missions sometimes means not gaining money that money. It's something that's so broken that I honestly cannot comprehend how it got past play-testing.The side missions are all forgettable, as are most of the characters and the story. The game plays out like how one would imagine a smaller version of a normal Assassin's Creed game would play out, sadly. Everything feels compacted and not enough is expanded upon. Because of this, I had a hard time keeping up with the story until I was around halfway done with the game. There are plenty of collectables to find in the game, yet not much of a motivation to gather any of them. Switching between various personas is a novel concept, but only being able to do this in a changing room usually means (1) coming across an event that requires one persona then (2) running across the map to a changing room then (3) running back to the event so that one can actually play it and then finally (4) running back to the changing room to switch back to the persona one was before. It all becomes a slog without any form of quick travel. Some events are also only viewable on the map for certain personas and custom waypoints disappear when switching between personas for some godforsaken reason. I think that's enough problems I had with the game. As for the good things about the game, uhh... Aveline is more tolerable than Connor and she looked nice in a dress. Playing as different personas -- as I mentioned above -- is a novel idea and can be enjoyable at times due to the slight differences. There's also some modern day/conspiracy/Mayan weirdness in this game which I enjoy in the Assassin's Creed series (one of the only things that keeps me playing the series). If you REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY enjoy the Assassin's Creed gameplay, you should be able to enjoy this. If you just tolerate it, stay away. If you play the Assassin's Creed games for the story, you can skip over this one as it doesn't have much of a connection with the overarching storyline.			"

												Without doubt one of the best AC games I've ever played. Mock me if you want, but ACLHD takes you to awesome places, gives you awesome weapons, and the story goes beyond expectations of a $20 spinoff game. You play as Aveline, a female assassian who has 3 Persona's to swap. The ""lady"" persona can only use weapons such as the hidden blade and a parosel that shoots posion darts (best weapon ever) as well as charm guards and gentlemen, the slave persona can carry utility weapons like hatchets and long knives and start riots but has no armor, and the assassin persona has full access to the rather large weapon library including pistols, swords, daggers, hatchets, and some old favorites like the blowpipe and connor's hatchet (Uplay reward). The game also brings in new weapons like the whip (like rope darts but 10x better and cooler). The places you go in the 12 hours I've played is amazing. New orleans is a very interesting city that heavily changes physically as time goes on. When the spanish take over you can see little skirmishes in the streets with citizens fighting off soldiers and blockades imparing movement. Muggers begin to pop up everywhere as well and the lady persona will be robbed by them if you don't fight them off. You also spend alot of time in the Bayou, which is like 4x better than the frontier from ac3 and at least 60% of the size. There's gators, smugglers, small camps, forts, and alot of collectibles to find. You also travel to mexico twice and explore awesome landmarks there like chichen iza and underwater caves. Overall a great spinoff that feels like a whole ac game.			"

												This is the first Assassin's Creed in the series that has you playing as a female assassin, It is great to see that more female protagonists are being implemented into video games, especially a series as important as this. You play as Aveline De Grandpre who was raised by her stepmother and father after her mother was freed from slavery and forced to leave Aveline behind. The story for this game is actually really enjoyable with a few twists and turns here and there. It is the first game in the series to bring in two assassin's side by side from different games, even though it was only for one memory, but it was a fun one. Although the story is mainly about fighting for freedom from slavery, there is some interesting characters in this game and some funny moments. Aveline also is the first assassin to have 3 different personas for her character, each of them have their strengths and weaknesses, and they implement well into the story. There is also a few good side missions to do and collectibles to find.The game from a graphical point of view is actually nice, originally this game was made on the Playstation Vita system and there are massive improvements on the PC version when u compare the two of them together. The game is also well optimized and i had a constant 60FPS! at 1080p with all graphical settings maxed out. I had no weird bugs or glitches and the game performed quite well. If there is anything negative about this game, I suppose it has to be that the game is rather short, which being honest is expected since the game was ported from the PS VITA and if it was a bigger title it would have been on PC and other consoles at launch instead of being renamed HD.Overall i do recommend this game to you as it is rather interesting and it has for the first time a female assassin, and the game looks good enough too considering it was ported from a handheld console. The gameplay is smooth and it is also another good entry into the assassin's creed franchise.			"

												19 hours to the end. Liberation tells me, I am at 80 percent or so.I did not go straight for the main story or for all other things you can do.I just had 19 hours pure fun and did whatver I just wanted to do.The story is ok. Not as good as the one from the 3 AC2 games but not worse than the ACIII or ACIV stories.The hero is a black woman and she is very likeable. I like her much more than any other AC hero yet. (I played 1/2/3/4)You can play her as slave, as grand dame or as assassin and switch between these play styles very often if you are in a city. The playstyles differ very much because the lady can't climb or use large weapons, the assassin is always suspicious and the slave is kind of in the middle: not best at fighting, not best at climbing, but can be 0% suspiscious.You can get better weapons, have trade routes with up to 8 ships (which you never see in the real game) and getting better equipment is just a matter of main story progress + money. The game is just fun. Mostly because you like the girl.The story is kind of ok, the interplay between the characters is more interesting than the story in my opinion.Should you get this game?IF you like Assassins Creed games: yes, go for itIf you need the extras which were introduced in III and IV like killing animals and trading with ships with really bad interfaces and the totally cool way to steer you sailing ship, no, then don't get it. This is a very basic (but good) AC.If you never played an AC game, you could get this, it would be a good game, BUT I'd say:1. view the story of the first one as youtube video like 


YouTube™ Video: Assassin's Creed [2007 Game] (The Movie) 

			Views: 3,512,101		

			After a long wait, I've finally released my next game made into a feature film - Assassin's Creed. The Assassin's Creed series is one of my favorite series this generation, and with the recent AC3...		

2. get AC 2 and play it. It is the best. If you like it, get Brotherhood (Rome) and Relevations (Constantinopel).This is a good game. Get it and have fun!			"

												A nice little addition to the Assassin's Creed series. First off, the story jumps around a lot and you're given text which describes what happens in between the jumps.  Wasn't a huge fan of that, but it's understandable considering the game was made for PS Vita originally and wasn't intended to be as fleshed out as the bigger titles.I personally didn't think the ending was that incredible; it was cool but a bit predictable.  Also, the voice acting for most of the characters is terrible.  I think a small part of me died every time I listened to Elise's poorly executed French Accent.  Regardless, it's worth playing if you'd like an interesting Assassin's Creed Story with a Female Protagonist.  6.5/10.			"

												originally released as a tie-in for ACIII on Vita, this remastered edition of Liberation is pretty great, but not without it's flaws. it's ubisoft open-world formula at it's most restrained and very slimmed down. however, some things are too slimmed down. the biggest let down, in my opinion, is the story and characters. i imagine that because the game was originally designed for a portable system and the audience that comes with it (ie. pick up and play for 10 minutes at a time), the concept had to reflect that and so a LOT of plot points and characters aren't well-developed. that being said, it's still really cool to play AC with a rad as hell lady protag in a scenario that is often avoided by games. def recommanded on sale.

												Different controls from AC3 and 4, feels very clumsy - map layout and interaction is different (have to drag cursor around, can't just click on items), guard interactions are different (with regards to alertness). Having a hard time giving it any kind of positive review. Sure, I'm glad that it has come to PC, but it should have been put in the AC4 engine, complete with the way the maps work, etc.After just finishing AC4, I'm very disappointed, and wondering what I spent $30 on.-after playing more:There is sufficient room on my screen to display all menu items - why only show 5 out of 6 and make me scroll down to the 6th, and then flick back to the top when I go past? Makes quitting this abortion harder.Cannot remap controls. I CANNOT EMPHASISE THIS ENOUGH. In 2014, we have a game from an AAA publisher that you cannot remap controls in.Some of these make no sense after AC4. Hold Q to target with blowpipe, wait for it to shrink to nothing, then release to fire. What the ♥♥♥♥? After rightclick to aim then leftclick to shoot, this makes NO sense.			"

												It's rather good! Not as good as AC2 or AC4 - the only others I've played. You can see how it's been limited for the Vita and even with the HD improvement it still feels and looks rather sparse. Aveline herself is a great character and it would be nice to see her in a full game again.  The changing clothes function is interesting if not a little tedious at points. It's definitely worth the £12. If only there were more to it!			"

												This is when you realize that you play too much anything labelled as Assassin Creed series     5.0/10Pros:- New Orleans and the Lousianna swamp is nice to explore (but really small)- Aveline is lovely and the exchange between the 3 custume modes (assassin, slave and lady) is quite funCons:- Really short story- Really small open world- The story is really bad paced, you often forget what you are meant to do or why, and worse whether it relates to any higher purpose or just fills the storyVeredict: Worst AC game of the series, just for fanboys "

												I really would like to recommend this game, but I can't because of several reasons.The game starts well, with a great story about this girl, who changes appearances from lady, to slave and to assassin, which is great, because it gives the game some interesting posibilities in changing the persona in the game, but it just doesn't really take any advantage of it and the story is not exciting enough to really get you into it.All through the game, you are send from quest to quest and quite early it gets tiring, because the game has the feel of more being a bunch of sidequests than a complete game. The game has decent graphics and atmosphere, but if you have played some of the most recents AC games, I can't recommend you buying this.I have only played the game a few hours, but I am already almost half through the game, which is very unlike all of the other AC games.

												This is the least exciting entry in the series, but it's still fun, as long as you enjoy the Assassin's Creed gameplay formula.Now, the story is somewhat shallow, but there's still enough there to keep an AC fan interested. And Aveline, the titular assassin, is a fantastic character; the depth of the narrative lies mostly with her, she is very likeable.As a port from the Vita, I'd say the developers did a good job. The game looks good, the level design is constrictive and compact as befits a hand-hand game, but the assets they used for this port are all high quality, probably taken from AC 3 and 4, and so it looks on par with those games.If you've never played an Assassin's Creed game before I don't know if I can recommend this to you, but I do believe that any AC fan should definitely give this a go.

												Aveline is the first female assassin to be featured in the series. Her story is an interesting turn from the recent games; it takes place in the timeline of Assassin's Creed III, yet seperate of its own. Graphics are satisfying and other than certain draw distance latencies it is in fact good. Audio however seems lacking at times silence fills the ears however it is still quite well done. The mechanics are similar to Assassin's Creed III and perform well. The settings are well crafted and beautifuly displayed; each viewpoint feels unique making every climb feel different from the last. The game also loads quickly taking you straight into the action. The story develops seamlessly as it takes you into the mission area and lets you take control, the only thing slowing you down being the occasional mandatory changing of clothes before proceeding. Avelin takes up one of three personas: The lady, The Slave and the Assassin each having unique abilities. Overall this is a great installment to the Assassin's Creed series and if you missed out on this title on the PS Vita then this is a good buy.			"

 Assassin's Creed Liberation HD Review Assassin's Creed Liberation is an anomaly. A portable game ported to HD machines, like most portable franchises, the game proves to be a stripped version of the main game it's name sake takes after. The story itself also falls victim to this kind of second-hand treatment. While the main game usually has great writing, this game has poor writing conisistently throughout. Liberation's gameplay is very similar to previous Assassin games, in that you have chests to open, items to collect, viewpoints to sync, and people to assassinate. Unfourtantely this game takes after it's console brethen at the time, Assassin's Creed 3, which makes this game a poorer version of that one. There are plently of glitches abound in the gameplay, sometimes the guards mark doesn't appear over their ahead once they are about to attack and there is no way to see secondary objectives. The assassin gameplay is good enough, but other games in the series have already done it better.The enviorments in the game, New Orleans, The Bayou, and Mexico are well detailed like any Ubisoft game, but they are also the smallest enviorments. They are so small that it's hard to consider the game open-world. The graphics are also a bit of a mixed bag. If you play this game after Revelations and before 3, then you will appreciate the higher fidelity in the enviorments, however the character models are pretty bad all around. Their clothes and attire are detailed, but their faces are clearly of a lesser quality. Revelations itself has more expressive faces.Unfourtantely the story is hardly ever engaging or interesting, mainly due to the fact that the game itself covers such familiar ground. Aveline is after an artifact like other Assassin's and in this case it's a disk (At this point you might wonder if Ubisoft will eventually make a table a Piece of Eden at some point.) Although to the game's credit we do see Ubisoft cover different enough territory. I love the fact that we see the situations Aveline has to go through as a woman who used to be a slave. There is also a nice side excursion with Connor, however it does little then connect this game to that games universe, in other words Connor's appearance is little more than a glorified cameo that adds little to game. Eventually the game does veer off into a different enough story bits, but does so to mixed results. In the intrest of spoilers, I'll say this, Rogue, 3, and Black Flag cover the opposing idealogies and how they are different and better in some ways in a much clearer way. This is the time that I wish Steam had a middle ground, because while the game is decent, it definetly is not good enough for the casual fan. If you are a hardcore fan like me give the game a go, but know that in the end even as a harcore fan I was a bit dissapointed. It's a shame that story with potential with an interesting character is regulated to a game that comes across as mediocre for an Assassin's Creed game. Some notes I played this on a GTX 970, i7, Windows 10 computer I had some peformance issues. Random drops in FPS that I could never change. The game's Ultra setting for Anti-aliasing seems to be bugged as it easily halfed my framerate in half on my system. I got 68 % synchronization.  "

												Welcome to Assassin's Creed: Liberation, where the Templars have become a mere afterthought to the much more looming threat: game controls. The developers clearly wanted to break the mold of tight, fluid game controls and go in the polar opposite direction with design. Every spare moment between cut scenes and dialog is dedicated to combating Aveline's sense of direction and agility. Want to chase someone on the ground? Good luck not jumping into a tree 90 degrees from the angle you're trying to run. Want to race someone across the rooftops? ""Are you sure you didn't want to fall into a crowd of guards on the ground while making a simple, obvious, short-distance leap?"" asks the game, then takes its own advice with your character. And hey, that combat system, right? Most people would think improving the notoriously quirky combat system is the right direction for development, but Ubisoft is obviously thinking on a whole different level and decided to go meta, making the battle actually take place in the real world, against your game pad.The story is probably the most confusing and pointless in the Assassin's Creed universe, and that's saying something. There are several head-scratching moments where it appears the story editors either forgot a whole scene or accidentally cut the wrong segment. There are side missions missing dialog to make any sort of sense of them, and cut scenes irrelevant to the missions. Meanwhile, overlaid on all of this is the baffling notoriety system that doesn't follow a reasonable logic (accidentally climb on a box while running through the streets in the slave persona, suddenly wanted posters are plastered on all buildings across the Caribbean). The notoriety doesn't mesh with the fact that a well-known noble woman is hiding her activities from her father, a well-known business man, or from the rest of the city for that matter.All that being said, Aveline is a nice addition to the Assassin's Creed character lineup, even though no one else in the game, aside from a cameo from another important character, is interesting and all the rest border on annoying and/or excruciating (Gerald would have been vastly improved if his entire dialog was just removed from the game). She is the only compelling reason to play all the way through this otherwise frustrating, confusing, thin game.			"

												It's like ""My First Assassin's Creed"". On the plus side, it's a small self-contained Assassin's Creed game; it comes with nice environments, nice clothes, the usual mostly-suave locomotion, and some (but not all) fun missions. On the downside, the plot is gibberish, the port from the Vita leaves it looking super-ugly, and the gameplay is often parcelled out in lamentably small portions. Plus, the 'strategic' elements are utterly pointless. Overall, I felt a bit disappointed, but you don't often get to play a black French woman in a game, so it was interesting for that at least.			"

												The third Assassins Creed is the most troubled entry in a series known for attracting equal amounts of disdain and love. Listing all the flaws would require a separate article or two but it all came down to not being fun to play. Liberation was intended as a Vita-exclusive spin-off sister to III but turns out to be refreshing in a way the big brother never achieved despite all his hard work.Liberation is led by Aveline de Grandpre, an Assassin of mixed ethnicity and belonging to the upper classes of society by birth. From the very first moment she is welcome company: practical and resourceful, preferring accomplishment to analysis. Her driving motivation is the plight of slaves, based partly on the realisation that she could have been worked to death just as easily. Given how many game stories are based on homicidal vengeance this is downright humanitarian. Aveline has a no-nonsense dedication to the duties of her vocation but she is never the wooden locomotive Connor was and has a sense of adventure and is allowed moments of banter as well. She is given both understated style and human warmth by Amber Goldfarb who cannot help herself from shaming the gray, gray droning of Connor.Other characters make an impression as well, particularly the intelligence officer Gerald who plays Q to Avelines 007. Gerald is a highly amusing nerd gentleman who most likely keeps an emotionally intense journal of his unrequited passion for Aveline when not supporting her assassinations with information and resources. Given Avelines highly practical attitude towards life this turns out to be a clever pairing, not just reversing the expected for the sake of doing so. It is the clothes that make the man but based on Liberation they appear to have significance to women as well for Aveline has three distinct Personas with their own strengths and weaknesses. The Assassin is most familiar and allows full combat ability. The women of the period were not supposed to carry weapons so it is logical the guards will always investigate Aveline when in this guise, making stealth highly impractical. The polar opposite of The Assassin is The Lady, which lets Aveline assume the appearance of a noblewoman which maximises stealth but removes free running completely and makes attempting combat a foolish endeavour. Striking a compromise between the two already mentioned is The Slave. All in all I was very happy with this system for it manages to make a point about class and appearance without resorting to bullhorns and the various gameplay strengths and weaknesses also encourage creative problem solving.Liberation comes to PC with HD improvements. Of these, the visuals are comparable to the Ezio titles while the new persona-specific questlines added are some amusing gameplay and absolutely no fiction. The music on the other hand is absolutely beautiful, restrained and tasteful, adding greatly to the atmosphere. There is also no present-day gameplay proving yet again what a toxic cloud Desmond was and how relieving it is to be away from him. The story also begins with Aveline being a fully trained Assassin doing important work which also contributes to the sense of forward motion I always felt in Liberation. Some of the sequences also withstand comparison to the best ones in the whole series, particularly an undercover assignment to Chichen Itza. Many other features from combat tools to the trading map have been simplified in a healthy way as well, many of which Creed fans will definitely appreciate.The greatest flaw in Liberation is not what is in the game but what is not. Of all the games in the series this is the one where I constantly hoped more would have been done instead of less. From the highly atmospheric New Orleans setting to the story combining a sense of adventure with symphatetic characters and serious themses, to the slight but meaningful refinements to familiar things -- all the seeds of greatness are there, sometimes in hints and sometimes in something much more. I spent 20 hours in Liberation but this included very many collectibles and all the side quests because I did not want the game to end. To label Assassins Creed Liberation HD ""fans only"" is redundant because the entire series is for fans only. From that perspective I can say Liberation was a fresh drink of ones and zeroes and I am certainly appreciative of being finally able to play. Liberation is more adjustments and refinements to the familiar than the thrill of discovery and certain adjustments to the level of expectations had to be made as well. But once the illusion was allowed to take hold Liberation not only entertained for the duration but left behind some good gaming memories as well and I can recommend it on this basis alone.			"

												Before I make the review, I would like to mention that I do in fact like this game, but I don't recommend it to people who are just starting to get to the know the Assassin's Creed series and are playing it for the first time.This game is basically a remake of the PS Vita release with HD graphics, released for PC and consoles in 2012. Personally I though Aveline was a great character, really a great experience playing as a female Assassin with 3 different personas. However, you can really see that Ubisoft really didn't spend too much time perfecting this game as the visuals were basic, cinematics were short and boring, gameplay is a little glitchy and there are literally no facial expressions when you are in free roam mode, not to mention the faces were supposedly ""HD"".On the other hand, there are points where the game really stands out from the main story games from the AC series. You get to play as a female assassin rather than a male protagonist like the other AC games, storyline was overall quite strong with a good ending, gameplay is no different to AC3 but there is a special ""chain kill"" where Aveline gets to kill multiple opponents at the same time. You get to meet Connor again, nuff said.Overall, I would give this game a 5/10. Is this game one of the best in the AC franchise? Definitely not, but still nonetheless a good game for fanboys like myself who like to experience every game from the series.			"

												I believe Ubisoft is very clever... They probably had this game planned as a full-blown entry in the Assassin's Creed series and developed it as such, then stripped it down for a PSVita exclusive release. So later they decided to release the full as-intended version for everyone else. At any rate, I must say it is pretty much my new favorite of the franchise!All the usual quality and mechanics of AC games are here, it doesn't look or feel like a remade game at all. The 3 persona idea is brilliant, it really varies up the gameplay and makes things more interesting. The different locations are great, and all the usual AC things are in the game (collectibles, Tomb Raidering, etc.). Luckily, no annoying puzzles in this one. I have a penchant for games with a female protagonist, so with this AC game I say, ""finally!"" :)			"

												There are a lot of things I like about this AC. For one, the protagonist, who actually realizes that running around in a white hood isn't very subtle for an assassin. I think the persona mechanic (basically disguises) was a really intriguing idea, but its actual implementation falls flat. Certain personas are a requirement rather than a choice for each mission. I thought it would have been great if you could play through the entire game with any one of them.Sadly, the characters, story, and setting are all held back by the game's (former) mobile limitations. There is practically nothing to be done outside the story except for finding collectibles. While there are a handful of side quests, none of them contain cutscenes or even voice acting. A typical story mission takes probably less than 10 minutes to complete and they are often very linear. I also noted that it's practically impossible to die in this game, it's simply too easy. There's even a feature that lets you automatically kill multiple enemies just by pausing the game for a moment.I would have loved this game if it had been made with actual gaming consoles in mind but sadly it remains a half-baked mobile spinoff.

												Nice game, like almost every Assassin's Creed game. Story is nice but not very surprising. However, it's interesting because the main character seams to fit in almost every situation (a point that seams, in my opinion, to be missing from many Assassin's Creed characters - which is strange for assassins ...). It's a short game : didn't take me a lot of time to finish it. I think it's a good game even if I wouldn't say it's in the best of Assassin's Creed series.			"

												If your a fan of the original Assasins Creed, this is the best one. In this game you use disguises to sneak through areas (with perfection) instead of running in dressed as a superhero and stabbing everyone (although you still can if thats your thing). Idk it's my personal favorite and I'd recomend this over Assassins Creed 3 (which i hated).			"

												This is a game for which I wish there was third option for: not terribly bad, but not very well done either. Having to choose between Yes or No, all in all, such lazy♥♥♥♥♥ rushed unfinished business should not be encouraged, thus, sadly thumbs down.This is not to say that AC Liberation is entirely devoided of fun factor - it isn't and I'd rather played it through then not. But such a mess is just unacceptable. To sum it up:Pros:- Good story line- Nice looking locations, like swamps and Chichen Itza- Canoe- Chain kill option- Variety of weapons and outfits- New ""personas system"" which allows Evaline to switch between assassin, slave and lady.- Some very nicely developed characters (like Dominiquez) !Cons:- Game is poorly optimised. I know it's a port but it could at least be as good as AC III, no?- Evaline is on speed. Literally - she moves fast, which may be kind of nice when you get used to it, but when action begins (and bloody sync requirements), you just stop appreciating it, since operating Evaline becomes a hassle. - Movement: Evaline will often get stuck in canoe when you want to get out of it, will jump when you don't want her to (in slave persona it will often have unpleasant effect of rising notoriety), during mission in cave in canoe you'd swim too fast for mouse to rotate camera (and you cannot adjust mouse sensitivity), etc, etc.- OST sucks in comparison to other AC games.- NPCs are not convincing, often they'll repeat the same phrase, or just go through various variants of ""Hmmm?"" ""Hmmm!"", ""Hm?!"", ""Ahhh!"", ""Ahhh?!""... jis. - Lousy gain for completing contracts.- Quests often glitch out. Examples: had to get my companion through the city gate and protect him. Good luck with that when he and his oppressor entered beyond the wall indicating end of world map. Sometimes I got detected, though nobody was nearby. Sometimes guards screamed ""She's getting away!"" though they have not even detected me yet. During mission (with ridiculous synch requirement!) I got my target's dead body (which I had to loot for document) fell under a staircase when it became unreachable. - Too many ""take no damage"" requirements for full synch. They make you furious especially when you have Evaline on freakin speed.- Take this: the transition screen, although cool, is too long, so if I'm - for example - not to take damage, sometimes I took it before my transition screen faded away! Are you kidding me...- I usually like grinding in AC, but this Persona's grind (dressing up as lady to get gems, getting assassin's coin from guys who usually sit near guards who will then bring the whole city guard to go after you), these were unnecessary and tiresome. This was a fast cash grab by Ubisoft, and it shows. Game is full of glitches, is not optimised, steering is irritating at times, NPCs don't make city lively, rather generic and to add salt to injury, this game - if treated as it should - could be another awesome AC title. But it was rushed and it is clearly unfinished business. And there's no ""yes-ing"" that, no sir, not at all.  "

												I simply will not sit here and tell you the story, I won't spoiler, nor will sum up the game. I'll just say what I really thought of it.For some ♥♥♥♥ing reason that no one understood until today, Ubisoft remembered to spend a PS Vita game to other platforms. For me, they could continue to work were an upcoming Assassin's Creed, and ensure that it won't be a♥♥♥♥♥♥like III was(Connor fans will revolt..).● And let's start out there, they could have released for PC, PS3 and XBOX 360 Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines, which would complement the story of Altair, but no, they had to go put the continuation of the worst Assassin's Creed ever, which basically is the DLC Black Flags: Cry Freedom.● I know many people were bugging Ubisoft to make a game with a female character, I want it to happen. But I don't want a game made in months just to shut up the fans.● I just think it was ridiculous lauching a game so close after AC IV. After such a good game, people will play it and will think ""R.I.P. Assassin's Creed"".● Not that the story is that bad, because it's not, but it's monotonous. At no point you're gonna want to keep playing with that desire to know the story, if you have to go to sleep you will go, and you won't play the game for two or three days. And it makes me confused, being assumed fan of Assassin's Creed as I am, I did not understand the purpose.● I even like Avaline, I find her to be strong and warrior, demonstrates some times be stubborn and that she believes in herself. Aveline has as much skill as Edward, Connor, Ezio or Altair, and she can still shake her♥♥♥♥♥ huh? But, no one will remember it in a few months, no one will immortalize as they did with Ezio. No one will be crazy to get the game to go in search of collectibles, no. There is nothing attractive about it, not♥♥♥♥♥♥nor♥♥♥♥♥will save it.● The graphics are not the best in the world. At the beginning I hated it, but some settings resolve this. I did not expect them to be TOP, as if someone thought that paying 20€ for a game that came from PS Vita and have the most power overpowered graphs, right? I like the scenery, I think that diversity is even minimally acceptable.● The gameplay is typical of Assassin's Creed, it's fluid and at this level I don't think that I could criticize much. Being that came from a portable platform, the adaptation was very good. Just explain to me why that ""E"" does everything, but it's ok.I must confess that I was surprised with the game, it's not as bad as I was expecting. Initially I thought it would be about five hours of gameplay and bye, but I was wrong. However there are a lot of negative thing I have to point out, especially that the story is so boring. AC always scored in the story.. In addition to the circumstances in which it was launched in.For the fans, I recommend you play, but if you don't play, your not losing much, and neither will be happier because of it. Seriously, this somehow hurts to score an AC game like this, but after all that said I think they know that the classification is valid.★★★★★★☆☆☆☆ 6/10 "

												Well the game is significantly shorter that the main game that was out at the time (Assassin's Creed 3). That may be the case this one feels like it has more of an interesting story. You play as Aveline de Grandpré, the first female protaginist in the series. She is a half black, half french woman in Lousianna during 1765 to 1777. Her father layed with one of his slaves, and once he found out about her mother's pregnacy, gave Aveline and her mother their freedom; As well as allow them to live as nobles. So one day when they were out and nobling around the city Aveline's mother disappeared. So from now on she wonders why her mother left her. And for some reason she manage to one of the last Assassin trainer in Lousiana to train her to be the killer that she is today. The unique mechanic in this game revolves around her ""Personas"". She can look like an Assassin, a noble woman, or a slave. Each of them have their pluses and minuses. The assassin is the best fighter, using plenty of weapons and gadgets in the game. The noble woman charms men, and uses an umbrella that fires a poison dart (really cool and sneaky.) Finally, the slave, she can fight, just not well. She is better use for her free running and to disguise herself as a slave to get past guards. Personally I enjoyed this game a lot more than Connor's tale. It feels like if they focused on this one instead of AC3, it could of been an amazing title. My only regret is the lenth of the game, and the length of the missions. Since this was originally on the Vita, the missions are much shorter compared to one of the main series' missions. Also I'm still waiting for my ""Voodoo pack"" items to appear but I just don't have them. The preorder is a lie.			"

												It's a close call—I'd say only on sale and only if you're craving some AC between two big releases. A lot of what felt exciting about the game had worn off halfway through the main quest for me, and I was eager to get it over and done with. Still, the protagonist is convincing and the story was enough that it made me want to see it through to the end.I personally haven't experienced any crashes or difficulties in actually being able to access the game.Pros:Great to see a female lead in an AC game--shame it's not in one of the main games though;Aveline is a strong protagonist supported by a decent cast and a welcome friendly face;Interesting story and setting--which could have been explored a lot more however;Story is easier to follow thanks to Animus Memory Notes between sequences;Personas are an interesting twist and fit the context well;Using the whip is fun (although some animations aren't great, e.g. long jumps).Neutral:Updated graphics are okay;Average side-quests and trading system;Funny present day ""excuse"" for accessing Aveline's memories;New investigation mechanics are refreshing but ultimately feel a bit shallow;Having Dave Matthew's Band ""Louisiana Bayou"" song stuck in my head for most of the game.Cons:The bayou and voodoo are central elements that could have been explored a lot more;Some slightly annoying/unconvincing supporting characters (Spit it out, Gérald!);Notoriety is a bit too sensitive (e.g. getting penalised for climbing a fence);New chain kill mechanic breaks up the intensity of combat;Soundtrack leaves a bit to be desired;Some controls and frame rate issues;No fast-travel available via the map;Aveline can climb buildings but not go over road blocks;In-world prompts break immersion (e.g. long jump); Very obscure First Civ conclusion (even by the series' standard).

												After playing 16 hours of Assassin’s Creed Liberation, I must say that this game is very unique and I actually enjoyed it. Problem was it was waaaaayyyy to short :( Also, it has a lot of problems. The voice sucks, the story telling was missing a lot of key things that could have made more sense and there are  A LOT of bugs. But, if you have the patience for that, this game is unique and truly amazing. I recommend this to anyone with patience for broken games ^,^			"

												This game, in my opinion is very good!  The character that you play, Aveline, has a strong background about how she was left on her own by a child and has been raised by a her 'new' mother.  The map is very detailed and there are lots of different things to collect.  The fact that you have three personas is a great idea and more games should implament this into their games.  For each persona, there is a diffent wanted level, meaning that if you gathered a lot of noriety in the assassin persona, change to the lady persona and bride gueards.  Also, the fact that when you're in the slave persona, you can get into any plantation by picking up and carrying a crate is amazing!  It may not sound like much, but when you're in a lazy mood and need to get into a plantation, just change to the slave persona and walk straight passed the gueards.  There are many things I have seen in this game that were in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, like icons etc... For example, when you're looting someone, the icon is the same as Assassin's Creed: Black Flag!  This just makes the game look a lot smoother and polished.When I pre-ordered the game, I didn't know what to expect.  I thought the game mechanics where going to be incredibly bad (as this has just been re-ported - used to be a PS Vita game).  And to be honest, ubisoft have done really well.  There will be many moments in the game where you just want to throw your computer out of the window (as I wanted to while recording a walkthough) because some things are fairly glitchy. Also, the free running (like in all Assassins Creed game) is really frustraiting.  One more bad point, this game has quick time events.  These are really annoying!  I was trying to do a mission but couldn't until I took down this crocodile.  However, it was a quick time event.  If you pressed a button just a second out of time, you will have to restart all over again!  However, over all, ubisoft have done really well porting this game over to PC!  Even though the missions may be a little short, that's fine because they're packed full of information!  If you would like to see gameplay, feel free to check out my walkthrough over on YouTube!  www.youtube.com/tomthecubegaming "

												EDIT: Nominated for ""Nobody Gives A Damn"" AwardMy first review on Steam is actually a ramble.I bought this game mainly to complete the collection. It turns out to be the worst I've EVER played.It's a port from PS Vita; really obvious from the monotonous music.The first thing that frustrates me is the controls. Aveline, though slimmer than her male counterparts, is much more clumsier. Freerunning through the trees in the Bayou is a pain. Somehow the system can't detect another branch on the other side of the trunk unless you press left or right. The leaves can be hard like walls and nothing can get through. Some of the gaps can be slid under while other gaps, much higher, are simply see-through walls.Another really annoying thing about the game is the environment sounds and Aveline's sounds. Everytime she hops, or just getting onto a barrel, she grunts or groans. Freerunning through rooftops comes with a series of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ from her. The most irritating sound in the game is the questioning ""enh?"" from the passerbys. In the end I just stab them when they issue such a sound.The dialogue in this game is really illogical. No wait, they're ILL-logical. Take, for example, sequence 3. Aveline and Elise both crashed through the fort and ""wrecked"" the slaves' ""chance for work"" (more likely to be sold). But somehow the slaves had grudge only on Aveline, and Elise is able to take the slaves back, not to mention giving Aveline a sarcastic sneer of her ""incurring gratitude"" when she herself had a hand in this. The mentor Agate questions Aveline's loyalty when she came to him instantly upon receiving his message, and then he stole her idea to assassin the governor and gave her an order that apparently she was going to carry out, regardless the order.The quests themselves are just unreasonably difficult. Guards can detect you with their backs to you. Cutscenes are long, boring and unskippable, and the checkpoints are scarce. Don't even hope for the fast-travel: the ""fast-travels"" marked on the  map means ""ship from New Orleans to the Bayou"".The innovative aspect of this game is the personas. BUT don't get you hopes high about changing persona whenever you want in the quest - impossible.Don't waste your money on this. This is even worse than AC3. The only game in the series worse than this is AC3 DLCs.			"

												This game is an overlooked gem from the series. The story is nicely paced and the Erudito meta plot is a nice touch. The settings are beautiful, especially when they move away from the urban into the bayou and the Mayan ruins. The costume designs are beautiful and suit the characters well. Speaking of character, Aveline is such a badass while still retains femininity and gentility. Oh, and if you unlock Connor's Tomahawk in uplay and equip it, she's gonna have the same kickass fighting animation as he. Sweet times. The only con I can think of now, apart from those darn bugs, is that there's no famous historical figures here. Still, it's good fun and I really wish it was longer.			"

												Terrible excuse for an Assassin's Creed game.  It's an embarrassment to the entire franchise.  Plagued by bugs and glitches, terrible story, not very well explained.  Movement controls are some of the worst in the series.  Voice acting is atrocious.  To no surprise, the game is not optimised for PC.  The only good part of the PC version is that the textures have been redone to look nicer.  There is no fast travel in the entire game, the persona's are a neat idea but the lady persona is just annoying and pretty much irrelevant (you run slowly and cannot jump or climb).  Too much running around without any reason why, very repetitive missions, lack of side quests.  The Trade System is kind of fun.  Nothing more than glorified DLC.  Ubisoft Sofia really dropped the ball on this one.  If you're looking for a great Assassin's Creed title, I would recommend skipping this one and playing Black Flag, or Rogue.			"

												Assassin's Creed Liberation HD feels like any other AC game. You can definitely tell that it's a port because of the way missions are set up. There seem to be more checkpoints, and missions overall are shorter in comparison to other AC games.The game also uses less areas and the story can be roughly completed in 8-9 hours. That doesn't mean you finished the game, however, there's still tons of stuff to do, like finding secrets, buying different types of properties, stuff like that.Liberation allows you do stuff that you can't do in other AC games and vice versa. For example, there's no hunting this time. Is it sorely missed ? Not at all. That's all just mindless, but enjoyable filler. But I still missed it. Same goes for naval combat, which is not included. Liberation allows your female assassin to charm people, and switch between different outfits. It's a fun idea that's poorly executed, because it basically limits your freedom. The assassin outfit allows you to move freely, the slave outfit allows you to blend in with slaves and the lady persona allows you to be a lady that can be harrased by smugglers, which is absolutely useless. Ok, that's not exactly what it's used for, but come one, it doesn't even allow you to kill someone while wearing it. As I said, the idea is good but it needs better implementation.Other fun new additions to the AC formula are the whip which is great for combat and also for traversing certain areas. Chain kills are also great and are very handy at times.The graphics are hit and miss. First of all, the game doesn't run at 60fps, but around 35-45fps, which is already frustrating, because a port like this should definitely run at 60fps solid. And while most of the graphics have been improved, the faces of some of these characters are still terrible. I also missed a lot of fine detail in many scenes. But considering the price they're asking for it, I can't complain I guess.Voice acting is pretty solid, and exactly what've come to expect from an AC game. The story isn't as interesting as many of the other AC games but still managed to impress me, with its slave theme and female lead.Liberation is a flawed but interesting AC game that's still very much enjoyable if you can look past these flaws. You might be disappointed because it's probably not what you've come to expect from the series, but as a game it's all good fun. Is it better/more fun than ACIII ? Absolutely ![Rating: 78/100]			"

												Is it me or has Ubisoft completely forgotten the title to their own series? The last three Assassin's Creed games (AC3, AC3:L, and AC4) have almost completely gotten rid of the idea of a guild or Creed. The premises have comprised of the main characters story and nothing more. Though we see the Creed amongst the natives in AC4, we do next to nothing with them for a big portion of the game. Though it looks like Unity will be bringing back that Creed feel, I can definitely say I am tired of feeling like I am only playing a character that is only an assassin because they ""knew a guy who knew a guy.""As far as Liberation goes, it is one of the worst Assassin's Creed games yet. First off, the story was atrocious. I was getting pretty freakin bored when there were entire sequences devoted to helping the fathers company. The story telling felt chopped up and your only real motivation was because you were being told to. I cared very little for the characters in this game. Even with Aveline, her character was not very rounded and I could have cared less as to what happened to her in the end. Practically the whole story was told by you going from point A to point B and pressing activate on something, that is seriously about 90% of this game. Liberation was probably the worst yet about this, but something has got to give with Assassin's Creed games when it comes to gameplay. I can only do tailing and eaves-dropping missions so many times, its getting insanely old Ubisoft! And whats up with this thing in Assassin""s Creed games where they will spawn you in after a cut-scene only 10 feet away from where you need to run to in order to trigger the next cut-scene, I mean why bother? Though a lot of people claim the climbing was awful in this one, I found that it was acceptable, with one exception being a cave area near the end that frustrated the ever-living sh*t out of me. Oh and MY goodness the voice acting in this game... It had some of the worst voice acting for a decent budget game that I have heard in a long time. As far as the graphics go, they were okay. Though you could tell it was a port from the Vita, the graphics were not really all that bad, but it does not quite compare to any of the other Assassin's Creed games. Overall this game sucked. It just simply was not fun. I would only recommend getting it if it went on a huge sell and you happen to be a big fan of Assassin's Creed games, otherwise spare yourself.			"

												In this game you play a simulator provided by abstergo as an entertainment product. Someone has hacked into the code to highlight some of the inconsistencies with what Abstergo has provided as the truth in their VR experience. You end up doing a lot more Assassin work and a bit of Detective work in this game. The Collection and commerce is still there on the side but there is not the same amount of character costume customisation (Much like AC 3). One of the best stories since Brotherhood and the trading mechanics were better than the AC3 (Thank goodness they removed the horrendous crafting ui). Overall, despite the obvious technical floors here and there and the absence of ships this is quite a solid Assassins Game.The layout and size of New Orleans is just right for an ""on foot game"" and the different guises make the game a little more interesting to play. The Bayou is horrible in contrast with the swamp and water slowing your movement if you don't happen upon treeline routes here and there.Would have liked a map that showed all the guise collectibles. It was too hard to track these as they only showed on proximity and some required different guises, I just ended up giving up on those.			"

												So far I'm really enjoying this game. It has quite a bit more variety than I expected, as you get to switch between the three ""personas"" Aveline has. Each one has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and you have to keep those in mind when going through the objectives. Some other reviewers complained about the persona system, but I think it allows you to play with your style a bit more, since you can choose whether you want to prioritize combat, stealth, etc. The graphics are pretty, though the resolution is still lower than AC4, but I enjoy it just fine when it's not full screen. Aveline is an interesting character, and it's great to see a female poc as a lead character in any video game, especially in the kickass AC series. (You screwed up with Unity, Ubisoft, and I will be actively pushing everyone I know away from that game)			"

												Assassin's Creed Liberation provides an interesting new angle on the AC universe, a strong lead in the series' first female assassin, and a great mechanic in the personas (which I would love to see explored further in a main-series game), but it squanders its opportunities and ends up sub-par in pretty much every other aspect. Even though I greatly enjoyed Aveline and her personas, Liberation is easily the worst Assassin's Creed I've played yet. Though to be fair, that doesn't make it a bad game by any means - just not up to series expectations.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2015/06/assassins-creed-liberation-hd.html "

												This is one of those games, I never thought I'll see on PC; furthermore, in this installment of the Assassin's Creed game series you relive the memories of Aveline an Assassin from New Orleans in North America living her part of the American Revolution.This game pretty much has the same engine as Assassin's Creed III, almost all of the features were taken from the previous game. (i.e.: parkour and combat mechanics, etc). There are some new features included, such as:- The persona feature, which is pretty much using 3 different versions or disguises for Aveline; all of them have their use and advantages in some zones while you progress the story- The whip as a new weapon, because introduces more types of combos you can do while in combatWhile the story is quite short (of course, the original games comes from the Playstation Vita, no wonder why is short) it can be quite interesting going through all the events in the game as there are some part where the game shows you and alternate version of the events you did, something they call ""seeing the truth"". As for the controls are quite simple, if not the same as Assassin's Creed III. There are 3 main locations where the story takes place, quite big maps though.Unlike the previous Assassin's Creed games on PC, this one doesn't have a multiplayer mode, just single player mode.All in all, it is an entertaining game and if you probably will enjoy it if you played the rest of games in the series. so, pick it up and let's get those templars!...

												So is AC Liberation worth buying?  That depends.  This is more Assassin’s Creed.  There are tons of things to collect, a solid world to explore, and plenty of reasons to kill the badness.  It’s all competently arranged and the Vita heritage doesn’t appear to have hurt the graphics overmuch.  AC Liberation is capable of satisfying your Assassin’s Creed urge if you have one.  If not, wait till next year.Check out my full review at: http://minddecline.wordpress.com/ "

												If you love the AC games you'll play this regardless of the reviews.that being said its a nice side game, and surprisingly much longer than I expected. The ""persona"" system is a bit annoying but does serve a well placed purpose, but I get the sneaking suspicion it was implemented in a sort of ""we'll hook the girl gamers with these dresses"" sort of marketing executive decision.A few bugs, dont engage the jaguar's in the bayou first, let them attack then get them off you and shoot them. Otherwise you'll have to exit and reload the game.Other then a few swamp areas I had no other issues, especially not more than any other AC game. Its a nice return to the AC3 engine too, and while not as polished, Aveline fights just like Conner. In my opinion the AC3 engine had the best combat fluidity and brutality since the first game. A shame that in AC4 they really dumbed down melee combat and stuck you with those two swords, no real disarm combat, and a complete lack of daggers.If you havent played yet, its not important but introduces the series to the abstergo entertainment theme you see in 4 and Unity, and I assume rogue (Not out at the time of this review), so again if you are a fan it serves an important section of lore to the games.

												This game is a port from the Vita. You have to know it before buying. It's not AC5, it's not even really AC3.5. It's a spin-off game that comes from a portable console.And once you know it, you can appreciate a very good game. There's less to do than in any other AC game, but it's not the same price either. And apart from the quantity, the usual quality is there, no problem. Ok, the story isn't very good, but the story never was the strong point of any Assassin's Creed.The setting is nice, the main character is nice and the game itself feels nice.If you like Assassin's Creed, you'll like Assassin's Creed Liberation. If you only liked previous games because of caricatural characters like Ezio or Edward, you may wish to avoid Liberation though.Il faut savoir une chose sur ce jeu : c'est un portage d'un jeu Vita. Ce n'est pas AC5, ce n'est même pas AC3.5. C'est juste un jeu à part qui nous vient tout droit d'une console portable.Et une fois qu'on est au courant, on peut apprécier un très bon jeu. Il y a moins de choses à faire que dans les autres AC, mais ce n'est pas le même prix non plus. Et à part la durée de vie, la qualité est bien là. L'histoire est un peu bidon, mais avouons-le, l'histoire n'a jamais été le point fort des Assassin's Creed.L'ambiance est super, l'héroïne est super et jouer au jeu est tout simplement super.Si vous aimez les autres Assassins Creed, vous aimerez celui-là. Si vous n'avez apprécié les précédents qu'à cause de héros caricaturaux comme Ezio ou Edward, vous pouvez passer votre chemin.			"

												Not good, not bad game. It has almost nothing to do with AC theme (same as AC3 and Black Flag and Black Flag:Freedom Cry), but it has simmilar gaming mechanics. Oh and yes, it has Assassins Creed in name.Overall a bit ""dead"" game, same as was AC3 for me. Cold, raw and unpleasant, seems like some cold machines did it, not by humans.Pros:- less AI blindness (it depends ;)), but overall less than in AC3 and BF- Avelin (main character) is a bit interesting character- runs fast due to port from PS Vita (overall quality stands somewhere about AC1 - lot of poping geometry and shadows due to lack of power on genuine PSV platform)- possibility to change personas, every persona has different abilitiesCons:- possibility to change personas is a bit cripled, when on mission game pushes you to pick ""right"" persona by disabling other personas- quicktime-event keys not visible when turned pupetteer off (i love clean hud as much as possible)- bit foggy AC related story which again pretends ""hey i am AC game""- alot of missions looks like that: cutscene, few minutes of gameplay, cutscene, go there, cutscene, few minutes of gameplay, cutscene, go alsewhere, cutscene, mission ends- i love stealth so i have no problem spend a long time hiding and waiting for right moment - during some mission game decided itself that i am playing it so long so it just jumped to the end of mission. I presume it was not a bug but a feature, because i had same issue in AC3/BF/BF:FC- stealth mechanics come inspired by AC3 and BF, so i love hide somewhere and whistle to get an enemy attention. Avelin can whistle too, but not from bushes :D- same killdozer as as Connor in AC3, nothing pushes you to do stealth, you just can run int enemy area holding your parry key and doing counterattacks- in strictly stealth you are pushed just rules in missions, not by gameplay itself :/Overall disappointmen againt, somehow i was believing to this sidestory it could be AC game, but it is not. It is just some game with AC game mechanics with cripled AC-pretending story. Anyway for fan a must play to see how far and bad AC series got.5/10			"

												I'm playing the series in order of release date, so this is the newest game I've played, and I've played the previous six games (plus The Tyranny of King Washington). Of those, unfortunately I think Assassin's Creed Liberation is one of the weaker entries-Bloodlines is the only other one I might put at the bottom so far. Even still, I mostly had a lot of fun with it.There are really two problem areas here-the story needs some work. I like the basics, but it's clunky in places compared to the other entries in the series, and leaves some things (some relationships in particular) unexplored that seem like they should be. The storytelling in the previous games feels much stronger. My other complaint is that it feels like it needs months if not a year of polish. I didn't run into anything game breaking, and the rapid release schedule has left many of the games with some unpolished elements, but things feel worse here than in 'III'. Mostly it just feels like they needed more time to run through the game and make sure everything executed properly-you've got some fights and various elements of animation that (sometimes) just don't look half as cool as they should...it's difficult to describe, and not game breaking, but it just clearly needed more time.Really both elements I have issue with come down to that-it needed more time for polish, in storytelling and other elements.Obviously that's the fault of the publisher, not the people who worked on it, and again, I never ran into anything gamebreaking.I'm a bit disappointed that the first outing for a female assassin, and (as usual) quite an interesting character, couldn't have been a bit better executed. I wouldn't start here if you're new to the series, but if you love it like I do, I think you'll get enjoyment out of it too.I suppose it's worth noting that the areas in the game feel smaller than in pervious entries-I'd imagine that's because of it's origins on Vita. Vita may not have the CPU or GPU power to pull off areas as large as in the previous games, or it may be entirely down to the smaller storage size of cartriges. Regardless I really don't mind. There's still variety, still quite a few interesting locations, and I don't see it as a big deal one way or the other...in fact I don't want Ubisoft to feel restricted in telling stories set in smaller towns or the like.

												I was really torn between the thumbs up and the thumbs down on this one so take the thumbs up with a grain of salt.This is assassins creed light... but that is not a bad thing. It is less cluttered and overwhelming than some of the other titles and feels somewhat nice and refreshing. It is also nice to play a female character and the 3 persona thing was kind of cool.There are some problems though. The noteriety system is garbage. If I run into some soldiers in the middle of nowhere and kill all of them with no witnesses, my notoriety should not go up. However that is not how it works. If you earn noteriety, it sticks with you until you complete the mechanic for dispelling it (different for the 3 different personas).The game was actually shaping up to be one of my favorite AC titles but then the real reason I am struggling to give it a thumbs up started occuring.  Horrible bugs everywhere. These occurences started happening around 3/4 of the way through the game like the devs just gave up or something. It was quite good until then. Characters that were supposed to follow me just stood there. Notoriety mechanics glitched out and got stuck. Combat indicators started disapearing. Perhaps worst of all, my whip decided to just disapear to where I could not use it for the remainder of the game (Which was a complete pain in the butt).All in all I am going to cautiously thumbs up this because I do think it is worth a play. However, The bugs are absurd and obviously are not going to be patched at this point so be prepared for some frustrations.			"

												I'll keep this review short since, well this is a short game compared to the others and theres really not much i have to say about it and there isnt anything that special about this game.This is a decent addition to the francise, its a bit small and theres not much to do compared to the other games in the francise, theres barley anything new other than the persona system(which is kinda nice), good graphics, the music is okay, the story is good, the combat is fun as always and Aveline is a good protagonist.7/10For what it is its certainly worth buying on sale at least if your like me an AC fan and never get tired of the games.

												Comparing this game to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is a bit unfair, being that this is a HD remaster of a PlayStation Vita game released in 2012. I'd like to think of Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD as Assassin's Creed III's little brother (sister?) in terms of graphics, gameplay, story, and everything else. Don't expect too much though; the game still has the trappings of a Vita port (e.g. shorter missions, smaller locations, not that many side quests compared to games in the main series) and there's a good chance your PC won't run it smoothly due to stability issues. Though fixes are usually easy, I suggest holding off until Ubisoft releases a patch addressing this and other issues. Otherwise, this is a fun little adventure through 18th Century Louisiana and a great complement to Assassin's Creed III.			"

The mechainics of the game are interesting but not used correctly. I had to fight boredom to complete this title. Because this game originated on the ps vita and a different development studio from the main stream AC series I wont let this game effect my views on them. Dont waste your time.4/10			"

												While Assassin's Creed Liberation doesn't amount to much as a standalone game, it still serves as a nice extension to AC3.This is the first game in the franchise that features a female protagonist, which leads to one of the major changes: this time you are allowed to change between three different personas (lady, assassin, slave), each one of them having their own specialities. Also, this time you are given a whip, which is like having an infinite number of rope darts. Other than that, there are not many differences compared to AC3.The downside of this game for me definitely was a scenario. The story itself is not bad at all, but the way it's being portrayed is quite poor and gives me a feeling that the developers haven't put a lot of effort into making of the game. I understand perfectly that this game is cheaper than Assassin's Creed 3, but still one expects more from the addition to the series.All in all, if you are a fan of Assassin's Creed or have some money to spare, you should spend a couple of evenings with Liberation and help young Aveline in her efforts.

												Don't let this be your first Assassin's creed game. If you're a fan of the series and absolutely must play every AC game for the whole story, then I'm not going to stop you. It's why I got it. But let me warn you, this is not a good representative of the series. The game is boggy, the controls feel soft and floaty. The action will slow to a crawl from a memory leak or just an overambitious engine. The story is told in bursts, that I assume fit when it was on the Vita, but now just jerk you out of the experience. The cut scenes are out of sync, sometimes by several seconds. The combat can be unresponsive, so when the mission says don't get hit, and you're mashing the smoke bombs before the heavy starts swinging... yeah, good luck.What's good... If it matters or not, you are the first female lead in an Assassin's Creed game. They have an interesting mechanic regarding your Personas, diguises you wear to infiltrate different levels of society. But a lot more could have been done with that than what was used. The business is a nice optional diversion, managing shipping lanes to gather the cash for more weapons. If you need it for the collection, get it on sale. If your interest was piqued from references in AC4, just know that this is a step back and down in gameplay.			"

												I LOVE the Assassin's Creed series and I was so excited to see a female assassin! IF ONLY I COULD PLAY IT. I started it up and went to the options because it was extremely laggy and the speech didnt match up with the audio (it was so behind), but the options menu didn't show up. I had to ctrl alt delete to get out and close the game. I restarted my computer, Started up the game a few  times and nothing worked. Every time I tried to go to the options menu nothing showed up and I kept getting stuck. I would recommend this game if they fixed these problems and could play it myself. The story of this game is great and is a must play if you're into the AC series, but like many of the other AC games, it's glitchy.			"

												very slow, i've been playing for 5 hours and am already 20% done the gamplay so very short too. I had to turn aa and vsync off and it's still slow. the gamplay is a little confusing and the plot is pretty vague. it seemed to have started out good and then just... poof, there goes all your hopes of this thing being exciting. it fall flat so fast it makes 3 day old pepsi seem appealing. i wouldn't have been interested in the first place if it didn't a female poc as the protagonist and even then it just feels hazy. like if the game was a food it would be one of those flavorless sandwhiches you get on american airlines. i find it incredably sad that the quality is so low compared to the other ac games and i bet that if it was a male protagonist it would get far more care put into making sure that it acually works properlly. it's incredably halfa**ed and has gameplay that gives me a headache.how can ubisoft put so much care and effort into making the other ac games to have such amazing plot and characters all with male protagonists and then just slap on a name tag saying ""assassin's creed"" to a halfas**ed game with a chick on it and call it feminism? no no no no no.i recomend this game for one purpose, to show ubisoft how people actually give af about female poc protagonists and that they should continue to do them but with more effort. send a complaint to ubisoft if you don't want to actually buy it, just spam them because this is unacceptable. every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ assassin's creed game is great and not slower than teenager in the morning and the one that's not just ""happens"" to be the only one with a woman as the protagonist? if you're going to buy this game only for it's assassin, do your wallet a favor and concious a favor and just tweet @ubisoft a couple of times to get your message but if you have $20 you're willing to toss around, it's a mediocre game by normal standards "

												First of all, this isn't a review, this is more like first impressions blog. So I wanted my yearly fix of AC and got this game on winter sale, since AC unity is broken right now and I've mastered all the other entries. And I regret spending each cent on this tittle. Why ? I'll explain down below.First of all textures and modeling looks ok, something between AC2 and AC3. However environment looks empty, it lacks additional decorations, stuff like bushes, grass, flowers etc. Animations are also weird and glitchy. Aveline  moves a bit weird, lip-sinking often is off, in a fight weapons go past enemies and so on. Also there are reasonable number of bugs in general which often will make you stuck in environment or not allow you to progress the current mission, so you must restart the game all over. Autosaves sometimes don't work even if the icon shows that they happened, and there is just so much more I could mention. And the sound design ? It's a mess as well, voice acting is nothing impressive with over the top french accent and unmemorable music.Last thing i didn't cover, is the game-play. Game is really easy with free run being  just too forgiving. However it filled with bugs as well, especially in wilderness. Combat is the same AC stuff, but here guards are more less likely to detect you and i found they are not that much around in environment as well.  There are some new mechanics, which are poorly implemented and are waste of time. So to sum it up. You should avoid this tittle even if you are die-hard AC fan like I am. Game is glitchy and buggy. Gameplay is boring. World and characters are poorly designed. the list just continuous. From what I played, I won't give it more than 4.5/10 !!!Thanks for reading.  "

												I can understand why many players are frustrated by this game simply because it is not as rich or detailed as one of the major Assassin's Creed games. For what it is though, I find it very satisfying. Being a port the game is very much playable and I was able to run it without encountering any bugs or lag. The story is a bit mediocre, but gains some tention towards the end and the characters are a quite stock, but non the less interesting. I really like the idea of the personas, especialy the way notoriety works which makes it feel more like an assassin game, and makes possible for different ways to tackle missions. The quality of the graphics is also very good, considering it is a port. The voice acting on the other hand has some troubles on certain occasions. Most missions are also mediocre, but not as repetitive as the ones in Black Flag, and there is a familiar array of weapons. Overall, I think that this game is worth a play, especialy for an Assassin's Creed fan, as it does fine as such a game.			"

												This is pretty much the shortest time I've ever taken to just...'nope' right out of a full game. I mean, if you can really call it full? Graphics are basically pretty textures slapped and cobbled over janky♥♥♥♥♥objects that constantly clip and jiggle and the awkward controls make it worse - any sort of immersion to the game was GONE within 20 minutes. It's sad because it felt like there'd be an interesting story in there, and while Aveline's setup felt awkwardly paced the tutorial didn't take almost an hour coughcough3cough.  Like, if there were more effort put into the game, and just. I don't know, a little more care for the mechanics so it didn't just feel like railroading through, and if it even just looked a bit less sloppy, I'd probably suck it up and keep going because...well, heck! Aveline's badass, and could be a complex character, and also...actually a lady assassin? And I like a girl that can stab the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything. Instead, I'm just gonna probably redownload Dishonored for my assassin kick and pretend I didn't just lose 50 minutes of my precious, ticking lifespan to this digital abortion.			"

												Considering it's just a PSP Vita port, the game isn't as in-depth as others of the franchise which leaves the price questionable, however it's still an overly good addition for assassins creed. It doesn't take that long to finish the main plot and the side missions aren't nescessary nor overly time consuming. The games most appealing quality is the only female assassin protagonist to date, 'Aveline'. She is an in-depth character working to abolish slavery, once being a slave herself. Through the game you can switch between her three personas, 'slave', 'lady' and 'assassin'. Each comes with different 'skills' if you will, and some missions are only completable as a certain persona. The combat and free-running feel very familiar to other titles. The graphics are above average but not as good as later releases, and the story is rather simplified. But once again reminding that this is just a port, it was done pretty damn well in my opinion and I really enjoyed it.			"

												Really nice ""Lite"" Assassin's Creed Game. Now I have all the AC releases for PC and this one is a nice addition. There aren't as many world (Cities) as the other ones, and the story is very linear, but it's a satisfying adventure. Aveline is one of the most likeable if not the most likeable Asssassin yet, she is lovely, and you want to take care of her and make sure nothing bad happens to her, similar to Lara Croft in the recent Tomb Raider Reboot, you feel attached. Her three modes: Lady, Assassin, and Slave, add a nice dimension that is not present in the other AC games. The Graphics are pretty good, but a slight step down from a recent release like Black Flag. They look less detailed more akin to what you see in the other games Multiplayer levels. Mentioning Multiplayer, there isn't any for this. It definitely looks better than a straight PSVita port, and It was money well spent. I'd reccomend it.			"

												Uninspired. That's pretty much how AC: Liberation was after beating the last mission.Don't get me wrong, the animators, modelers, artists, and programmers did a splendid job, especially with the HD upgrade from the Vita version. It's the story that's largely uninspired. It's boring, it never drew me in and it almost felt like a chore just to continue playing. The only thing that kept me going is my necessity to complete an Assassin's story as I do find myself enamored in the AC universe.Aveline is an interesting Assassin, and the first playable female one in the series, despite not being part of the main canon. Her goals and ambitions are there, although they're generic as fudge, but her story never had a 'wow factor' either. There wasn't anything remotely interesting about it, and there wasn't anything surprising either. The intro has just about no context as far as Aveline's mother disappearing. And then suddenly you go from child to full on Assassin. It's like, where's the training, or mentorship? Where's the self discovery? Basically there wasn't any character development because of the significant time jump in character.The story itself is predictable. Actually, no, it's not. It jumps all over the place concerning locations, and which character's you'll be interacting with, but the whole ""The slavers are Templars, you're the liberator uncovering a plot"" was just so typical and there wasn't any interesting spin to draw you in. Plus the dialogue was laughable and the cutscenes were overacted. I feel like I shouldn't have to continue, basically, the plot wasn't that great. There's a good story in there somewhere, but the approach wasn't good.I will continue though, the gameplay and everything else was pretty good, but there are also parts towards the end of the game where Aveline bugs out while climbing or will randomly get stuck at the edge of dock while an enemy attempts to flail their weapon at you. You'll find instances of being randomly stuck, or the level design in one-off areas are kind of poor, you could just tell that the devs were being rushed to push this game out. Soundtrack was a bit random at points, music from the bayou still playing in New Orleans and is African influenced even though the main character was raised in a French family, like wtf. The sound design seemed empty too, like crowd chatter in New Orleans was kept to a minimum. The ambient sounds in the bayou weren't prominent enough. New Orleans itself was designed well enough. I'd imagine that over 200 hundred years ago, it was as small as it was in this game, but none of the buildings were interesting.Even the historical context in the game is kept to a bare minimum, like there's in game codex appearances when seeing historical buildings or people, you just see them and maybe they're in the data aspect in the main menu. Maybe.Overall, it wasn't a bad game, but not a great one either. Just an okay one.6.5/10Overall, I wouldn't recommend this unless it's uber cheap or if you're a hardcore AC fan.			"

WOW I really enjoy it and while sure it may have crisper graphics but nothing you havent seen from a well funded 2011-2012 game in the year 2014.... its affordable and the story is gripping and quite deep... Aveline is a crazy great character to play and has possibly the most intriguing back story i have witnessed in a long time of gaming! The fighting and climbing is slightly slower and grittier as Aveline is tall and solid but slender, still only a 70-80kg woman which they totally take into account! The climbing and fighting rely on finnesse and her ability to misdirect and avoid taking damage instead of the usual counter then become unstoppable i hear about in other creeds games.... Its political, smooth, gritty, realistic, quite beautiful, mature and frankly alot more fun than driving a pirate ship like its a formula one car in the pinnacle of unrealism that is the ""latest"" creed to date.... Liberation offers alot more for alot less money and wont♥♥♥♥♥♥you off with complete and utter pirate nonsense....Upon killing all CitezenE characters and unlocking the true story.... which isnt hard.... this game was a 9.5/10 for me... considering this games background and history that is a perfect score for any creed game i am not really fans of... this is refreshing, smooth and an incredibly interesting story that will keep you wanting to play just to find out the truth! Legendary Game...			"

												This particular iteration of the Assassin's Creed franchise is based off a once exclusive Playstation Vita release, but has been enhanced and expanded for the PC. A much welcomed surprise, Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD (also referred to as Assassin's Creed III: Liberation) is a game that feels and controls like any other triple A title. It introduces a new and unique character that is easily more lovable than the original protagonist from the third game. In terms of gameplay, the game roughly revolves around the same mechanics found in the universe, but offers a new twist in the form of changeable personas. The main lead in the game, Aveline de Grandpré, can alter her attire fulfilling the roles of an Assassin, Lady or Slave - each providing their own incentives. Assassin’s Creed: Liberation HD shouldn't be passed up by gamers especially by those who know and love the franchise. The game's price point does draw attention since it is less than regular releases, but it's certainly not something disproportionate. It'll offer you roughly 10 hours or so of gameplay!			"

												Although this doesn't provide anything new to the franchise (save for the only female protagonist), it's still an enjoyable romp through colonial Louisiana. The ability to take on three different personas gives a bit more change, but otherwise it's still a good addition to the Assassin's Creed line. The HD graphics look gorgeous, although I had to turn off anti-aliasing to get a smooth frame rate on a GTX 560ti. It's not without its problems, such as glitchy side quests, short draw distance for some things, and (unfortunately) the desire for your character to run up walls and trees that you don't want just like what plagued the Ezio trilogy. You'll get maybe 15-20 hours if you try to do everything, which is great for a $20 game.If you love the AC series but aren't looking for anything particularly new, this game is worth the $20.			"

Getting behind the blades of a female assassin for the first time is fun, and Aveline is certainly a compelling character, but it's unfortunately not enough to save the experience from coming across as decidely average. Although, to the game's credit, mowing down guards like a ballerina of death in a poofy 1700s dress is 100% badass.			"

												The opening moments of the game, much like most every title in the series, begins with the display of the virtual world being constructed in front of the player. As soon as the first civilian is rendered he immediately walks into a giant wooden pole right in front of him, stumbling back slightly and then tries to figure out how to walk around it. I'd say this sets the stage for the rest of the game pretty well.While not as pointless and forgettable as Brotherhood's campaign, I'm glad I skipped the Vita version because even with the improvements it's still a glitchy, boring game. I've fallen into bottomless pits and just landed on my feet to walk around down there, I've had missions break thanks to AI groups that were supposed to stay together who then split up because they got caught on each other and couldn't walk forward, I've had the battle icons just vanish entirely making counterattacks and such literally impossible, there's typos in the text, and so on. It's nowhere near the mess that ACIII was at launch but even overhauled it's still pretty janky. The three guises that can be donned are probably the most interesting part, although they feel almost completely ignored as a gameplay element for most of the missions.The compatively small areas for the series are also a drawback, and combined with the same lackluster low vertical height for climbing that ACIII had ends up with the game feeling more like a rushed cash-in instead of a major entry. The interesting additions and okay campaign put it somewhere in the middle-to-low range of this series, better than the original to actually play but well below ACII and Revelations. However, just like Brotherhood, it adds nothing to the series as a whole and can be completely ignored until one has finished all the other main titles, and even then only if they're still hunting for more.

												Being a fan of the AC series, I was thrilled when this was released on Steam, as I don't have a Vita. I knew it wouldn't be quite as good as ""actual"" AC titles, but I never expected it to be THAT bland. First of all, the story is a disjointed mess. It just doesn't flow well enough like the others, nor does it really capture your attention. The voice acting sounds uninterested half the time, too. Liberation can't decide on where it wants to take place. You're constantly switching back and forth between New Orleans, the Bayou, and other locations best kept secret for plot purposes. It's mainly the first two, though. There's barely anything interesting about them, with little ambient noise happening, making each place feel emptier. This game's gimmick seems to be the ""persona changes."" With three personas to pick (Assassin, Slave, Lady), each has their own look and gameplay style. The game cannot decide on this, either. You're switching between these way too much, as it's mandatory. Assassin is what you'd expect. Slave doesn't carry weapons, and can blend-in with real slaves. Lady can barely run, cannot climb anything, and also has no weapons. Each persona less fun than the last. You'll be jumping for joy when the game lets you use the Assassin persona every single time. I will give credit to the visuals .They did a great job porting this over from a handheld device. Obviously, it won't look as good as something like Black Flag, but the graphics still hold their own. So, they actually did something right in that regard.While there are a few actual cool parts in the game, they are not enough to justify the current price of $20. Even AC3 is a better title, and that used to be my 2nd least favorite AC. If you're still curious enough, I'd wait for a sale. You're really not missing much.			"

												I find Assassin’s Creed® Liberation HD lacking so much from what the other Assassin's Creed game has. Not alot activities around the map and also the map is small but I understand it's a PS Vita converted to PC with better graphics so those can be overlook. As for the story, just wish it was *alittle* bit deeper like who's the descendant for Aveline it can't be Desmond, right? Assassin’s Creed® Liberation HD also brought up a new gameplay mechanic call persona, some sort of disguist. And it's also something new to see, a female protagonist in the Assassin's Creed franchise. I hope to see more of female protagonist for the future Assassin's Creed games. Overall Assassin’s Creed® Liberation HD is an ok game, not alot of new features other then the persona mechanic but other then that it pales in comparison to the other Assassin's Creed but since it's a convert from PS Vita I'll close one eye.

												It's alright for an Assassin's Creed spin-off. It functions fine and feels like an AC game, specifically AC III, so if you enjoy AC games then this is perfectly serviceable for no more than the $5-$7.50 sweet spot. If you like AC multiplayer then you're SOL with this game, but me personally I always enjoyed the single player aspect over the multiplayer so that didn't bother me too much. The story is kind of interesting for the first half of the game but then falls apart toward the end before finishing with a completely unsatisfying ending. The worst part is since this is a spin-off you're left with the feeling that Aveline's story didn't mean much of anything in the grand scheme of things regarding the overall AC mythos, but I still need to play Black Flag, Rogue and Unity so perhaps they reference it in any of those games. This is a spin-off, though, and much like Altair's PSP sidestory was lost in the ether I get the feeling this is the last we'll ever hear of Aveline and the First Civilization mystery disc that this game is about. I thought the graphics were fine considering this is just an upscaled Vita game. The graphics and resolution options are barebones so look elsewhere if you're looking for a game to make your rig purr. As it is, it's a serviceable spin-off or ""expansion pack"" to AC III.I'll recommend this to only people that enjoy the Assassin's Creed games and only if you get this for $7.50 or less. It's a decent time-waster if you're waiting on the next AC release.			"

												I don't get why this game has mixed reviews and Freedom Cry has a higher average user review status because I actually think that this is the superior game. I think the main character here (Aveline) is much more memorable and has more character than the guy from Freedom Cry. For their first female lead in a AC game, I think they did a good job choosing her.It's basically the same controls, combat, and overall gameplay as AC3, 4, and FC so of course it is gonna be fun if you are a AC fan. The story is okay, not one of the better storylines, but still not bad. Aveline basically carries the whole game story-wise because it feels like she really cares about what she is doing. The parkouring is of course iffy at times like past AC games, making you jump from places you didn't want to, or miss jumps completely, or parkour up something you didn't want to, and so on. The parkouring in this game is at times agonizingly frustrating, seemingly more so than past games.The game runs perfectly smooth after some tweaking, which is no surprise because no AC game has ever ran without stuttering and slowdown without messing around with the video options because Ubisoft is still learning how to code for pc. Although they are still light years ahead of Capcom and Square, two companies that will never learn, especially Square with their constantly god awful performing pc ports.It is pretty short so catch it on sale for around $5.

  Score 6 / 10 Does it contain massive plot points needed for future games? no.The game is not really that good or that bad, but it's definitely not a good standalone game. Which means that if AC was not a franchise and this was the only game, it would probably be rated a little lower and it would not sell that well. It doesn't include any important plot lines to further the overall story, so the only reason to really buy this game is if you're a huge fan of the franchise. And you want to have played them all.

												Sadly, I cannot recommend this game.  Aveline is an important part of the AC storyline, IMAO.  However, the developers of this First Lead Woman failed to deliver any good gameplay of any interests whatsoever.  The controls are absolutley excruciating to deal with and the overall gameplay is boring as hell.  I really wanted to at least finish this game, but I just couldn't put myself somewhere after 50% of the game through.  So, now I'm off to the next chapter of AC.  I would say that this is THE VERY WORST AC GAME EVER, up to this point in the AC franchise!!!... Oh, and I already played Black Flag 4 & Freedom Cry (both are excellent) this far into the series.

												Some would say this would be a port of the PS Vita version of the game. If you're a true fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise you'll pick this title up. People say it's ""Assassin's Creed 3.5"" but it isn't. This game spins the tale of a French African American woman named Aveline deGrandpre who is looking for answers. What I like about this game that is different from the others, is that Aveline is a true master of disguise. Utilizing her 3 different personas -Slave , Lady, and of course Assassin, is really well done. Certain missions require different guises. Each guise has it's own notoriety. Really well done and looks amazing on PC. This gives the franchise that ""fresh"" feeling and it's a great example of things to come in future Assasin's Creed games. I would highly recommend this game to people.			"

												Right away, I noticed that the graphics were a breath of fresh air after black flag socked my machine in the gut. Smooth and clean without mucking up performance. The gameplay is very tightly constructed, which means that the storyline is quite linear with a few scattered side activities. While this does give it less of a sandboxy time-waster feel, it's important to remember that the original release of this game wasn't designed for the fully-fledged Assassin's Creed experience, and what is important is that it manages to be a stellar release nonetheless. The controls are a step backward from AC4, though, and as you'll play you'll feel the clunky weapon selector and naval trading interfaces weighing you down like a ball and chain. I know, I know, it was developed on the AC3 template, but how much effort does it really take to update the layout instead of chucking all the work that occured based on fan feedback out the window? Overall, though, this game is a great experience. I would pay 35 for it as it stands now, and when you consider how many leagues it is above the vita version, the choice is clear.			"

												Assassin's Creed Liberation is a historical action-adventure open world stealth video game developed and published by Ubisoft, initially as an exclusive title for PlayStation Vita. The story is set between 1765 and 1777, and it primarily features series' first female protagonist, Aveline de Grandpré, an African-French Assassin around the end of the French and Indian War, in 18th century New Orleans. The game takes place in Louisiana around the end of the French and Indian War, where France's defeat caused the city of New Orleans to be taken over by the Spanish government.This vial plot was later uncovered by the Assassin Aveline de Grandpré, who infiltrated the governor's mansion and assassinated him. In 1766, the Templar Antonio de Ulloa arrived in New Orleans, to serve as the Spanish governor. However, he left the control of the area to some French officials and allowed the French flag to remain over the city. Two years afterwards, he made strict trade restrictions and set up a covert slave-trading operation to transport some slaves to a Templar worksite in Mexico, creating big rebellions among French officials and most of the citizens of New Orleans. Assassin's Creed Liberation uses the same engine that runs Assassin's Creed III, allowing for the same gameplay experience as a console release. Aveline also has her own new set of animations as well as you having the ability to dual-wield weapons, such as the new blowpipe as well as lots of familiar swords, knives, pistols and a hidden blade. Overall I will give Assassin's Creed Liberation a solid 10/10 it is just fantastic they have really improved it so much that it feels like a completely new game rather than just a port of the PlayStation Vita version. So I really really recommend you go get this game because I am just absolutely 100% sure that Assassin's Creed Liberation will definitely without even the tiniest doubt blow you away!.			"

Semua cerita ada di masa lalu (masa awal kemerdekaan AS), tidak ada Animus, Abstergo, dll, seolah membuat kita sebagai pelaku utama yang memasuki animus itu sendiri hingga selesai permainan.Cerita Aveline terbilang cukup membosankan karena semua cerita ada di masa lalu, tak ada hubungan dengan masa kini apalagi tujuan utama kita memasuki ingatan Aveline.Kuil ala peradapan pertama yang sudah jadi ciri khas AC memang dapat kita temui sepanjang cerita, namun artefak yang diperoleh tidak dijelaskan sama sekali untuk apa tujuannya.Connor Kenway (AC III) muncul sebentar membantu Aveline, namun keberadaannya seakan cuma numpang lewat beberapa menit.Salah satu yang menarik mungkin adalah plot twist yang muncul di akhir cerita. Biarpun sudah bisa ditebak sih.Gameplay (7/10)Dalam menjalankan misinya, Aveline bisa berganti kostum yang mempunyai fungsi khas di setiap kondisi. Lady Persona memiliki tingkat notoriety yang rendah di mata pasukan dan bisa mengakses banyak tempat namun pergerakan dan senjatanya terbatas. Slave Persona memiliki memiliki notoriety yang cepat naik di mata pasukan namun memiliki pergerakan dan senjata yang lebih baik dari Lady Persona. Yang terkhir adalah Assassin Persona yang memiliki noriety yang selalu tinggi (dan mewajibkan kita menghindari pasukan) dengan pergerakan dan senjata terbaik selayaknya seorang assassin.Aveline dapat menggunakan senjata unik yang tidak dipakai sebelumnya, seperti pecut untuk menarik musuh dan menghabisinya sekaligus bisa dipakai untuk mengayun di dahan pohon ala Tarzan. Selain itu Lady Persona Aveline dipersenjatai dengan payung yang dapat dipakai untuk menembakkan poison darts secara tersembunyi.Grafis (7/10)Bila dibanding dengan game terbaru Ubisoft yang lain, ACL mungkin memiliki tingkat grafis yang pas2an tapi mengingat ini adalah port dari PSVita yg notabene adalah handheld game, grafis yang ditawarkan tergolong baik apalagi melihat ukurannya yang cuma 3,2 GB.Ubisoft membuat ACL HD dengan menambahkan graphic setting dan kualitas yang kalau saya bilang di antara AC Brothehood dengan AC III, ini membuktikan kalo Ubisoft tidak setengah2 dalam mengerjakan versi HD ini.

												Well this was somewhat refreshing. After the downer of Assassins Creed III this game is more of a movie than an open world game.You are Aveline, which is, unlike its predecessors, not a modern times character, but an assassin during american revolution. The lack of the hours of finding collectibles, the farming for a certain necessary upgrade and sidemissions are what makes it so refreshing for me. And what makes the game much shorter.On the downside I had many crashes, one time even a bluescreen, which ocurred at no other game before.			"

I had to restart my computer because ""Press Any Key"" Seems to require you to either have a key with Any written on it, or it just doesn't work properly.The controls are really awkward, Hold right click to run? What? I move my mouse a few centimeters and my character spins around completely. The voices are pretty poor, quiet and out of sync. the cutscenes are hideous. Good bits about this game? Maybe I'd find some if I played it longer, but I can't find myself getting used to the controls. I don't think it's worth it.			"

												For a multitude of reasons, Aveline is the kind of character I’d like to see more of in gaming, and watching her flounder through this game all over again hurt. I wanted to see her tale succeed, but Assassin’s Creed Liberation HD is just too lacking in too many areas to make it happen. There’s no one thing to point to as overtly broken; it simply dies by a thousand tiny cuts. Its craft is sloppy, its design remains shackled by ill-conceived new ideas, as well as the limitations of the platform it hails from. It’s the definitive version of a game that had very little going for it in the first place.			"

The only part of this game that got me seriously excited was the citizen E parts, so I fully exptected some sort of big scene explaining who it was at the end. Although I found the ending entertaining, i found the game so flipping glitchy that my housemates had to keep telling me to stop swearing.			"

												I did have a few problems with the game. For one, the feel of the game was much more like ACIII than its newer compatriote ACIV, though this might have been intentional. In fact the style of ranged weapons worked more like the ACII system, while other combat systems and graphics looked like ACIII. The worst thing, I would say is the dialogue, the voice actors pretty much feel flat to me. Other than those few minor discrepencies, I actually like Liberation. It might be takin better as a move from revelations to ACIII, instead of a game after ACIV. I did really like the changing costumes part of gameplay and it seemed to add a little more realism, just a little, to the wanted level. "

I also appreciated the fact that they chose not to sweep the realities of slavery underneath the rug (*cough cough* Part 3 ).  While the tale is not as epic as the main line story I like the fact that it is smaller in scale.  Not every game needs to save the whole world... small peices need saving to.

It may appear weak because it is a PS Vita port which was released around the same time as AC IV: Black Flag, but it cannot be held to the same gameplay standards as the game. You can blend into the public with the multiple personas that Aveline utilizes during her Assassin career. This is a full AC title worth every penny.			"

I wouldnt say its any worse than AC2 I REALLY enjoy the combat in this title. the way you can chain attacks together, the enemy reactions and the varied sync kills you can achieve are very nicely put to gether. Aveline's combat style is far better than Ezio ever was, I dont know how else to describe it other than it feels far more... Viceral... not in the extent that Revelations was but more... efficient, flowing. its a nice change of pace to the other AC titles in my opinion and I am enjoying it far more than Revelations.  "

												Don't expect much out of this game. It's practically a port-over from the PlayStation Vita version. It's a decent game at best. Not quite on par as any of the other Assassin's Creed games of the past with questionable designs, lackluster combat abilities, and noticeable bugs that come by every now and then, all of which diminishes the game's quality. The areas avaliable to you open-world generally is not that big as any of the other Assassin's Creed games, with only a minor spruce-up with graphics to compensate for the PC port, but it's good enough to entertain you for a few hours. I wouldn't recommend getting this game full-price considering it's not exactly on-par with other Assassin's Creed games with similar pricing, although with sales it'll be worth the few hours spent wandering this small but decent world for a few bucks.

												If there's one thing to be said about this game, it's that Liberation is underwhelming. Sure, I didn't expect much from a port of a PS Vita game, but damn is this game flat. The story is absolute bare minimal, and the characters are all two dimmensional and it's hard to give a damn about any of them. The gameplay is alright, your basic Assassin's Creed gameplay, nothing special, but nothing bad either. Also, the game runs like absolute garbage. I am currently using a 660ti, and I'm getting ridiculous amounts of frame drops. It's usually fine, but if there's more than five people or ten buildings on screen at one time, the frame rate dips below 40. And it isn't the power of my graphics card, either. It ran Assassin's Creed 4 far, far better than it runs Liberation, and AC4 is a much more graphic intensive game.If you are a die hard Assassin's Creed fan and need to play every installment, you'll probably get some enjoyment out of this, but it's nothing special. Otherwise, I do recommend staying away. It's not a bad game, it's just underwhelming as all else and really isn't worth the time or effort to play.			"

												A good game, but I hate how Ubisoft keeps changing the key combinations and how fighting works. It seems like they change it just to change it, not for improvement's sake.Also, this one is pretty short comparted to the others in the series. I know it's essentially an add-on, but I only got about 19 hours of play out of it, compared to 40-60 hours from the other titles in the Assassin's Creed series.All-in-all, its a good game, but not as great as its predecessors.

												This game is a true Assassin's Creed title. It may appear weak because it is a PS Vita port which was released around the same time as AC IV: Black Flag, but it cannot be held to the same gameplay standards as the game. You can blend into the public with the multiple personas that Aveline utilizes during her Assassin career. This is a full AC title worth every penny.			"

												Part of me feels like they only made this to make sure assassins creed had one female charater that you could actally play, which really gets on my nerves first off, but now to the game. The only part of this game that got me seriously excited was the citizen E parts, so I fully exptected some sort of big scene explaining who it was at the end. Although I found the ending entertaining, i found the game so flipping glitchy that my housemates had to keep telling me to stop swearing.			"

												As with all the other Assassin's Creed games I've played, I thoroughly enjoyed this one.You play as Aveline, a female assassin.  What makes Aveline really cool is that she can change her appearance.  She can be a lady, assassin or slave.  This is a very nice feature in the game.This game is fun to play and the graphics are really great.  The controls are easy to master and some of the enemies in the game are quite tough to beat - which will test your skills.On the down side:  The game is smaller than the other Assassin Creed games.Overall I had a great time playing it and Aveline is really cool.

												I think this game was released just to fill the void of there not being a new AC game every 6 months, and it really shows it. From my game experience it was really buggy and just unsatisfying to play. The story wasn't really that great either, but I guess it showed some insight to the time from a POV of a woman, that could be part of both the free people and the slaves, as it's a mechanic in the game. And finishing the game didn't give any satisfaction as well, or the feeling that it should continue forever like I had with Ezio trilogy, but I guess that we will never encounter that feeling playing an Assassin's Creed ever again. Or maybe Ubisoft has finally changed?If I could go to the past with my present knowlage, I wouldn't buy this game. For really cheap maybe, but not really worth it. From 1 to 10 I would give it a meh!			"

												Thus far a very poor conversion indeed.  I have the Vita version and it chugs a little on it, but you'd expect that for a handheld.  You don't expect that on a modern powerful PC.  I have had many issues with performance (disabling AA did help somewhat, but this is meant to be HD so why can't I use all the graphical bells and whistles?!) and I've also had crashing issues randomally.  Hopefully this can all be patched, but at 50% of the cost of a full on AAA title, this is NOT currently worth the price of admission.  Sorry Ubisoft.  I love Assassins creed, just this one needs some definiate work before I can recommend it.			"

												Originally released for the Vita, finally got a release on PC! I was waiting because as a fan of the series I like to have this one under my belt. To compare it to a full price release would not be a fair. It's about a good 7-9 hour side story during Assassin Creed 3's timeline/era. For what it has to offer it does it well. As like all other Assassin Creeds it sets out to tell you a great story and it accomplishes that, gameplay and mechanics stay true. I can only really recommend this to die hard assassin creed fans, looking for a fix between mainstream releases. It's brings a couple new ideas to the table, but nothing absolutely amazing. The story like always is great, but as a change of pace it features a female lead. All in all give it shot and show Aveline the spotlight she deserves			"

												Heyyo, As much as I want to love this game? The bugs ruin it at the worst possible moments. The Graphics are great but it runs like crap (compared to AC3 or Black Flag for example), the voice overs and the sound effects are also fantastic... music is very mediocre though...BUT THE DAMN BUGS!!! Most of the time it's not so bad, it's ok dealing with the AI most of the time... but wow, this one mission? ""The Secret of the Cenote""?? It makes me want to uninstall this game. Fighting De Ferrer and trying to get the ""Take no damage"" constraint wouldn't be so bad... IF THE AI WASN'T SO MESSED UP! Half the time I try to do it? The AI bugs out and goes into ""chase"" mode where they disengage from combat.. and all 5 of them rush to a signle point on the combat zone and then start shooting or throwing rocks at me... and if I try to fight them? One of them attacks without the option to block and I take damage. Great. Restart... Next? There's the tougher guard and De Ferrier... Both can't be killed with counter-attacks. You can disarm the one guard on counter attack and follow up with normal attacks until he dies.. but De Ferrier will attack usually half ways through it and YOU CAN'T COUNTER-ANYTHING TO HIM OR HE PUNCHES YOU AND YOU FAIL THE TAKE NO DAMAGE!!  Needless to say? after about an hour of some of the most furstrating experiences of mine in recent times since Quake 4 multiplayer online? I gave up and skipped the Full Sync.Same mission, now I'm jumping along and it shows the ""W + SPACEBAR + Right-Click"" so I do that... she jumps to her death! WTF!? The prompts right on the damn screen!!!Skip this game. If it goes on sale? Be warned... It has the formula of a good Assassin's Creed game should.. but the damn bugs. :(			"

												6.7/10The first thing you need to understand is that this is a port of a vita game, so there is a reason it is cheaper and oyu get what you pay for.With that being said, my opinion is based on this solely as a PC game in general.AC: Liberation is a lot like AC2, it does lot bring any of the new freshness of any of the newer games such as Black Flag did, it re-uses a lot of the older aspects of previous AC games. It tries to innovate in a few ways however they can often be a hindernace more than a boon. The porting from a vita comes at a price. The visuals are just below that of X-box 360 standards, envrioments sometimes appear bare, there is quirky animation or quirky animations, and in general is not as fleshed out as the normal console coutnerparts are. Pros:-Play as a female assassin for once-Full HD Textures it seems-New story in the AC universe, even if it is not fleshed out, fans of the series will enjoy it.-Affordable price point-A few unique to avaline combat moves and weapons-Kill ChainsCons-Not fleshed out fully as a port-Repeats a lot of what we played form previous AC games-Forces you to play as your other ""personas"" that are usually just following people around or exist only for story progression.-Robotic AI at timesOther notes:-Slave persona's eye's are HUGE, seriously, just look at them directly up close in game sometime...The can see into your very soul.....

												As a Assassin's Creed Fan (I've played every AC game that was released on PC except the most recent one Assassin's Creed Syndicate and AC Chronicles), I have to say I think this one is definitly the worst. You can tell that it wasn't made for the PC but instead is a port of a PlayStation Vita title. The game uses the same engine as the Main title AC3 that was released at around the same time. But it is inferior in every way. Wether it's animations, graphics, the design of the city or the world in general.But the biggest complaint for me are the characters, the story telling and the story just in general.The characters are not very interesting compared to the ones in other AC games.The story telling is inferior, simular to how the Star Wars pre-quels may have had fancy early 2000s special effects, but other than explosions and lots and lots of light saber fights there wasn't much going on in terms of actual story telling.Basicly if you like Assassin's Creed Games and you are looking for a new one to play, get any other one, they are all better. Doesnt matter which one of these (AC1, AC2, AC:Brotherhood, AC:Revelations, AC3, AC4, AC:Rogue, AC:Unity).I suppose the only selling point there is, is that you get a female protagonist.But let's be real, while there are very few games with female main characters, in comparison to male main characters, if you are looking for a game with a female main character that is actually good, then look else where. For example the Tomb Raider game from 2013 or Rise of the Tomb Raider.Both of these are excellent games, unlike Assassins Creed Liberation, which is a mediocre game at best.			"

												I am enjoying the game. Glad to have a female to play, the story so far seems simple but the graphics are lovely. There are other goals besides the story so keep looking at the maps for treasure and other side missions. My only issue at this point is the combat sequence with alligators...it's a rather complex combo of keyboard keys and if not timed right you can spend a long time trying to win the battle. I guess it will take time to learn that. However really this is a pretty fun game, not as massive as the Main AC games but for me it's a little treat.			"

												Assassin's Creed being my favourite francise, I can give my honest opinion about this. They did introduce some neat new concepts and brought back some things from Assassin's Creed III.It was a visual upgrade from the PSP portable version, so graphics aren't amazing and cutscenes are a bit fast and jumpy. It had lots of AC3 aspects to it, so if you enjoyed AC3, I highly recommend this game.Otherwise, I do not recommend it, after the release of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, this (in my opinion) was a huge step back down, keeping in mind that it was originally a PSP game, so not much hate can be given.I have only one hour into Assassin's Creed Liberation, so you may not take my word for this, but I just could not get into it.

												What makes Assassin's Creed Liberation HD so different from the other Assassin's Creed games I have played (played all of them). Is not only are you a female named Aveline, but darn, does she know how to fight. She's a beast, and It's just a joy to kill people in this game. I know, it makes me sound like a lunatic but I'm being completely honest with you, Aveline knows how to kick some male butt! So I would recommend it, the only downside I have experienced so far is that it doesnt seem completely smooth all the time, and that's not very commen for me. Even Unity runs smoothly when I game it, but I would probably rate it somewhere around 8/10.			"

												While the game certainly isn't on the level that the other PC games are on, this game does a reasonably good job for what it is, a vita port. Though there are some problems that are to be expected in a game ported from a portable console. Lip-sync issues, multiple time the character clips through the environment, and occasionally the game locks up when entering the pause menu. It's is still well worth the price and you will certainly get hours of enjoyment out of it. The game's take on a female protagonist is very good, not overly focusing on her gender (for the most part she could be a male), however not ignoring it either, she uses her feminine charm in a way only a female could.Overall, 7/10. Take from that what you will though, I'm easily impressed.			"

												Okay, it has a lot of the elements that make AC a lot of fun.  But they skimped on the story, so that leaves gameplay as the sole draw.  AND IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THEY FINISHED IT.  I just spent 5 minutes trying to QT kill an alligator, which needed 5 correct button presses.  After the first 2, some were insta-fails no matter how quick I pressed.  Obviously the keyboard-mouse doesn't get the same love in a console port.  Also, despite far exceeding every requirement, anti-aliasing comletely crashes my framerate.  There is so much good about this game, but QA wasn't the top priority. One of your ""personas"" cannot parkour, yet she is capable of falling into the water but not able to climb out---must be lead weights in her dress.  At one point I was mugged while dressed as the ""Lady,"" and as I was blocking the town guard comes running up and starts bayonneting ME, leading to an enormous WTF moment.  And finally, in a game that really revolves finding all the little guffins and bawbles, there is no Quick Travel within the maps.  Add in that each of the 3 personas highlight a different set of doodads, and it means you will be running.  A lot.  I officially give up on 100% synch.  I will finish the game, but they could have had a home run here instead of a limp first base hit.			"

												If you are a big Assassin's Creed fan (AC) you should play this (wait until it's on sale).  If not, you should probably skip it.  The fact that this is a port from a portable game is evident.  The...production value is not as high as it is in other AC games.  The voice acting and cutscenes are not great.  The framerate also seems to be deliverately capped in some areas as 30 FPS and many of the missions are less than inspired.  After the first hour, however, I thought the game really takes off.  I found Aveline to be the most likeable AC protagonist outside of Ezio (haven't played Unity or Syndicate).  It's also nice to see a great, awesome female protagonist that isn't a sex object.This game is much shorter than other AC games, which might actually be a good thing.			"

												In a nutshell: Assassin's Creed Lite. Gameplay is decent, and what you would be accustomed to if you played AC3 since it uses the same engine. Graphics are passable for a handheld conversion, though there are occasional glitches to be found. The biggest single weakness of this entry in the series would be the story. It moves quickly, with very little character development. This is either due to lazy writing, the constraints of it being handheld in origin, or both. If you're a fan of the series, I recommend it. If you're a fan of strong female characters, I recommend it. If you haven't played an Assassin's Creed before, start elsewhere.			"

												If you are a big Assassin's Creed fan (AC) you should play this (wait until it's on sale).  If not, you should probably skip it.  The fact that this is a port from a portable game is evident.  The...production value is not as high as it is in other AC games.  The voice acting and cutscenes are not great.  The framerate also seems to be deliverately capped in some areas as 30 FPS and many of the missions are less than inspired.  After the first hour, however, I thought the game really takes off.  I found Aveline to be the most likeable AC protagonist outside of Ezio (haven't played Unity or Syndicate).  It's also nice to see a great, awesome female protagonist that isn't a sex object.This game is much shorter than other AC games, which might actually be a good thing.			"

												Quite a few bugs here and there; entering local supply won't allow you to exit the menu of it and leave with only the cursor and background with no buttons -- Solution exit game through the task bar. In a mission where you have to do a lot jumping and such you would fell off the edge instead making the usual look down at the very edge instead of falling down.To the story! I didn't really get in to the story as when I played the regular parts or the Assassins Creed. I think I missed some sort introduction -- anyhow, the DLC in my opinion isn't worth 19,99 due to the bugs (it's quite frusttrating.)			"

												I'm normally a great Fan and played all of the Assasins Creed Titles so far.I really enjoy to play a female Assassin and the mississippi Setting is actually a nice change, but everywhere i look i see lots and lots of unused potential. The Sound assests and the Voices are in comparison to the AC Standard really dull. The Story fells like one cutscene after another. The Fighting System is the same thing as in every other AC and theres never this feel of danger or the need to go ""stealth"" because i could take 50 dudes head on without any major problem. The Characters dont really have the depht and the parkour system glitches on every tree. Its really kinda sad, because the Setting could have been really unique and great....			"

												If you can somehow ignore the bad frame rates, out of sync audio, and countless dozens of glitches, it is a fun game. The graphics are about on par with Assassin's Creed III, but not up to Assassin's Creed IV standards. There are some unique changes to gameplay, such as Personas, that make it a unique experience. The setting, acting, and story are all top-notch, although the ending has the same cop-out feel that Assassin's Creed III left you with. Although the graphics were updated in this HD port from the Vita, the very same annoying bugs persist from the original version. Just as Ubisoft never saw fit to fix the game on the Vita, apparently they didn't see much point in fixing it for the HD version either.  If you are an Assassin's Creed fan and can tolerate glitches and are able to be flexibile enough to go with missions that never work quite as intended due to a bad port on top of sloppy programming, then it is worth the price of admission...if, however, you don't think you have the stomach for mild to moderate frustration, then do yourself a favor and skip this game.

												No one likes to pay more than the price of an espresso for a game they wind up being unable to play after hours of troubleshooting. Be aware, even if you have a relatively recent, relatively decent system like mine, you are not garuanteed to be able to play this game right out of the box.If you notice in the title at the top of this post, it lists my time played on this game as 1hour... that's one hour of sitting in a completely lagged-to-a-halt loading screen and nearly frozen main menu.I would love to offer a reveiw of the gameplay, story, characterization -- all the actual game content. However, my Asus RoG G55VW-DH71, with its i7-3630QM Quad-Core, 8gb DDR3, GeForce GTX 660M, Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit on a 7200rpm Hard Drive, is apparently -- and mysteriously -- insufficient to run this particular installment of Assassin's Creed. The game has such a poor framerate on my system that it's effectively unplayable, while I can fire up AC4 or ACB and crank the settings a bit higher than default, THIS game chokes so hard I can barely escape the main menu. Actual gameplay is impossible, and having devoted the better part of a Sunday, I have little desire to throw away more time trying to figure out why this is the only game on my system that won't work.Despite being able to run every other AC game on higher than ""normal"" settings (and most other recently released games) without impact on performance, somehow, this game can't manage to run better than 3fps on the lowest settings -- and this they call their ""completely new experience""? So far, this selling point is starting to sound more like famous last words. If this happened with any of my other currently installed games, I'd be more likely to figure out what is wrong with my hardware or drivers/software. My system runs all my other games just fine. I get that this is ""HD"", and is supposed to be all suped-up graphics intensive awesomeness -- but the recommended specs are below the specs on my system -- so what gives?From the opening logo screens and menu, the framerate is so abysmal that it takes no less than 2 minutes simply to select ""exit game"" from the menu options. Having spent a day searching various nvidia, microsoft, ubisoft, and steam forums for hints and clues as to what might be making this game behave so poorly, I have decided it's not worth the effort. I've never asked steam for a refund under such circumstances, but after reinsstalling multiple drivers, and even reinstalling Steam after running out of all other ideas, I've decided that I bought a lemon of a game, and it's not worth my precious little free time to go through this much trouble just to experience a title that might not turn out to be worth the headache.Hopefully they release a patch sometime in the future to remedy these issues. Its not worth my time or frustration to haggle with Steam's billing reps over an unlikely refund for the $20 I paid, on top of the day I wasted. I'll accept the loss and chalk it up to getting burned, but I no longer think of Ubisoft or Steam with the same kind of trust. This is a big name title, and shouldn't ship in such poor shape to the user. Such fail, very disappoint. 0/10.			"

												Based on the same gameplay mechanics as AC3, this game achieves more good than it predecessor. Even though it is a ported game.Disguises are really what makes the game more stylish, diverse and stealthy. Having played Hitman for the first time just recently, I realised how much a disguise can mean. And here, to be able to change is what the game really needs. Each disguise has different tailor variant, different weapons (sometimes not ownable by other personas), different blending, different notoriety. It’s a pity that by now this was only implemented in this game.Fixed convoys and trade system. Now it calls for investments and regular check ups.Underwater missions are really good and if you play the games chronologically, this will come before marvelous diving missions from AC4BF (technically, here they tested it out, the same they did woth Aquila in AC3).Of course, since the game was small, the city is smaller, the ‘Frontier’ (here – Bayou) is smaller, the gameplay time is less, but it good since you don’t grow tired of it.One of the most correct games in all the franchise, totally recommend it.

												It is like Assassin Creed game was made by amateurs with low budget. It has the same mechanics but with worse graphics and everything seems more simplistic. Of course it is conversion from PS Vita, but they remade it for PC so it should be valuated as PC game. New Orleans in this period is not particularly attractive sight. I must say that new gimmick of changing clothes which change your playstyle is nice little add-on, but the whole game still feel not polished. Assassin Creed fans will play it anyway.			"

												Title: ""Assassin's Creed: Liberation""Developer(s)/producer(s): Ubisoft Sofia/Ubisoft MilanUbisoftWriter(s): Richard FarreseJill MurrayGenre(s): Action-adventure, StealthMode(s): Single-playerGeneral info: Assassin's Creed III: Liberation is a historical action-adventure open world stealth video game, initially released as an exclusive title for PlayStation Vita. It is an independent installment in the Assassin's Creed-franchise and primarily features the series' first female protagonist, Aveline de Grandpré. Gameplay: The game uses the same engine that runs ""Assassin's Creed III"", allowing for basically the same gameplay experience. The player also has a new set of animations - exclussively introduced for the protagonist Aveline- as well as have the ability to dual-wield weapons, such as the new blowpipe as well as the familiar swords, knives, pistols and hidden blade. Like it's predecessors, the game set in an open world in which the player uses a combination of stealth, parkour, and combat to complete various missions. Like in Assassin's Creed III, freerunning been simplified to allow for more fluid parkour in the cities and wilderness, such as climbing and running on trees, cliffs, houses etc. Players no longer need to manage the lock-on mechanic from previous games. Human shields can be used against firing lines of enemies. Medicine is no longer used as health recovers automatically. Stealth is also revamped, allowing players to use natural elements such as tall grass and trees to hide, along with the ability to blend between any two people.Since the game is a port from a Vita-game, it lacks a few of the qualities that for example games originally released for PC has. Story: Unlike most of the Assassin's Creed-franchise, this game does not feature the normal present day protagonist Desmond Miles, but focuses on Aveline de Grandpré, an Assassin of French and African heritage, who lived during the 18th century. Born in 1747, to a wealthy French merchant and an African slave, Aveline de Grandpré is raised in a comfortable and privileged environment. At the age of 12 she is rescued from slavers who tries to kidnap her, by an Assassin called Agaté. Agaté recruits Aveline into the Assassin Brotherhood and thus becomes her Mentor. Liberation is set six years after this event, near the end of the French and Indian War, where France's defeat causes the city of New Orleans to be taken over by the Spanish government. The citizens are upset over the transition from French to Spanish control and Spain's new occupation within the city. However, in 1765, the French governor Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie makes a negotiation with Templar Rafael Joaquín de Ferrer to stay as governor of New Orleans. This plot is uncovered by the young Assassin Aveline, who infiltrates the governor's mansion and assassinates him. She also discovers their deal to ensure d'Abaddie remains as governor, provided he smoothes the hand-over of the colony to the Templars and supply de Ferrer with workers for a secret Templar operation. Together with her loyal and trusted friend Gérald Blanc, Aveline delves into a sinister Templar conspiracy and discovers a statespanning slave trafficking operation... My opinions: Assassin's Creed: Liberation fulfilled most of my expectations. When I bought the game, I suspected it to be a bit buggy or unstable since it was ported from the Vita, but it functioned surprisingly well. The graphics are basically what you can expect from a ""HD-version"" of a game previously solely released for consoles; they look good, but not AS good as other games in the series. The world in the game is rather small, which I had also expected, but took a fair amount of time to explore in order to get all collectibles. Don't expect any major animation wonders, though - it's ok, but not fantastic. As for the story, I am a little disappointed. Not that the HD-version of an already released game could have another story, but I felt it to be both uninteresting and rather boring. It mostly felt like the ""go-here-kill-him-go-back""-kind of story. A lot of running and killing without much variation in terms of objectives. The characters were, likewise, quite uninteresting and the only character I actually cared for at all was the protagonist herself. Voice-acting is clearly not the strongest side of this game, but it was not all bad either. Finally, one thing that surprised me in a positive way: the combat. The fighting mechanics in the game - as mentioned above driven by the same engine as the one in Assassin's Creed III - were a lot better than I had expected. The combat flow, counter-attacks and parrying looked better than I had expected. Although it has some flaws, I decided to put a thumbs up on this game. It isn't the best game in the series, but it is a surprisingly good port. I mainly recommend it to fans of the Assassin's Creed-franchise, but it is also unusually playable for people not yet introduced to the series. If I were you, I would do like I did; buy this game on a sale. It is not a bad game, but it deserves a discount to be worth buying.			"

												After such a dissappointment with AC 3 I was amazed at how good this game was compared to the others. there are some interesting mechanics and the whole changing cloths is a interesting way to gain different abilities. It's a lot of fun for any fan of Assassin's creed.The characters are very interesting and i love Aveline, but there was no roundup of what happened at the end if she got married, if they both continued to fight the prejudice together and what finally became of her and her mother.

												As a PC port, Liberation HD is actually well done. The game works very well with the controller, plays just fine with the keyboard and mouse, and the graphics are actually HD! Be warned though: Some people have reported having trouble with the anti aliasing, myself included (though my issue was minor); others claim to have performance issues.The thing that separates Liberation HD from the other Assassin's Creed PC games, gameplay wise, is the persona mechanic. You are able to switch between disguises: Assassin, noble and slave. You have different properties/abilities and wanted levels while wearing each of those different disguises, which gives us a nice break from the usual gameplay (from AC 1 - 2.3) that was becoming stale. Final verdict: Worth it!			"

												I've been hating AC series' interface b/c of 3rd person only w/ few use of keyboard keys, which results in undesired actions when too many commands are input. Ubi intrroduced yet again changed interface in Liberation HD from Black Flag, which is much much WORSE than its precedecers.I've loved them b/c of impressive storylines based on the history. As a spin-off, there's little history to see, or what I've already seen in Black Flag, now I see everything that disappoints me in AC series.The only good thing in this game is ""HD"", and Ubi has set its marketing point well; in other words, I feel like gotten ripped off.

												It is a bit clunky, and after playing Black Flag I can see how far they have come with what they have kept and discarded from ACIII. I can see what they tried to do with the 3 personas, varying up the game play but some of the choices didn't sit well with me e.g. can only blend in a crowd as a slave, if you so much as climb on a box accidently while running as a slave = reputation hit and the worst so far has been that if you are getting mugged as a lady, the guards attack YOU if they spy the combat. No ability to move bodies takes some changes to tactics. And not being able to just shoot the damn crocodile is a bit silly.THAT SAID, the story is enjoyable and devoid of Desmond and co (which may be a pro or con, depending on how you like the meta plot) yet is still engaging. I would suggest getting it on sale for sure.EDIT: A random crash (one of the many that happen with this game) has caused my save file to become damaged and apparently unrecoverable. So that is 20 hours wasted. As you can't choose to make hard saves, I only have the ONE save file, now trashed			"

												As an avid Assassin's Creed fan I purchased the game right off the bat, having deliberatly avoided all form av spoilers of AC:Liberation. Granted, I had no objective mindset regarding the game. This proved too be both a positive, as well as a negative experience, as I shall explain below.First off, for those of us having played AC3 and the more recent AC4 the intro of Liberations lands between the two, quality wise. It's not dragged out like 3, but it's not so much of an intro in the sense of giving the player a sense of going forward. With that said, it could've been pulled off better had they chosen to have an intro where we as the players are more curious as of giving that ""what-happens-next""-feeling, which was the case of the excellent intro of Black Flag. As we progress through the game, we are introduced to several new game modes, unique to Liberations: the three different types of ""clothes"" Aveline can wear, each ""unique"" in their own way. Without going into too much details, this idea was a good one, but I happened to find it somewhat tedious and not that much of ""change"", gameplay wise. It felt more like disguising in the different clothes for the sake of appearance. Once again, I want to emphasize, the idea is GOOD, but fails to deliver gameplay-wise, making it almost irrelevant and only important for those missions where you've to change in order to progress in the story. And now for perhaps the most characteristic feature of Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD: the HD part. Yes, the game is ""only"" a port, and a GOOD one at that, which Ubisoft cleverly mentioned in several of their ads throughout the release of the game, which could've turned out ugly if they tried to ""fool"" us gamers. Nevertheless, the graphics has its own share of graphical problem. It's worth to mention that I ran this game on the highest settings possible with a GTX 770, still there were notable stutter, the occasional water turning into extacy-rainbow-colored water instead, important side-characters making faces like they're having a diarrhea and the constant failure of the game to render thing from a long distance. Furthermore the voice acting has to be one THE WORST I've ever witnessed in gaming, let alone how bad the combination is with several of the charachters, ""speaking"" but with their mouthes barely open. It's really sad, but the few moments the game shines is the alliance with the french smugglers, and Avelines colonial Brother Connor in the side-mission.So APART from all of this, what good comes out of this games? Well, for one, it has definitely a more cohesive story than AC3 managed to achieve, the story of Aveline is intriguing and interesting, the FEW moments the ""HD"" part really lives up to the name doesn't pop up until later segments of the game (no spoilers!). I feel like Liberations as a game per say, is NOT a good game at all (read above), as an overall AC-experience is not a bad one, but not a solid one either, making it only ""OK"". The game is recommended for all of those Die-Hard AC-fans, itching to know more of the Assassin's Creed Universe.I'll give this game a solid 2 out of 5!			"

												This has to be my favorite Assassin's Creed game so far. Aveline is the most interesting and likable protagonist in the series so far. There aren't many strong female protagonists in video games but Aveline stand amongst the best including the new Lara Croft( Tomb Raider 2013), Heather Mason( Silent Hill 3) and Ellie( The Last of Us). The three persona system works well and improves as the game goes on. The parasol dart gun is a really nice touch; nothing quite as satisfying as dressing as a lady and assassinate your targets with your cute little umbrella( giving that Hitman vibe to it) There's also quite a number of puzzles and mini games littered throughout the main storyline and side quests. They range from fairly challenging to downright annoying( I'm looking at you, fragile canoe with health bar!) The updated textures looks really amazing up-close and the color feels richer than the Vita version making New Orleans look beautiful and lively. On the negative side, the water animation is so flat that it breaks the immersion a little. More sound effects could have been great during cutscenes. Controls are quite fluid and on par with the recent Black Flag. At this time of writing the review, my pre-order bonus is having some issues( happens to quite a number of people especially those who bought from Steam) and not showing up even after registering them in Uplay so i don't recommend anyone getting the Voodoo Pack DLC until the issue is fixed. The vanilla game itself will provide many hours of entertainment for fans of the series and newcomers alike. For the low price it's offering now, you're getting a fairly large game with many hours of content. One could almost forget this is a Vita port. Highly recommended! 8.5 out of 10			"

												All things considered, this port could've been ALOT worse.I didn't expect this game to blow me away, it IS, after all, originally a PS Vita game, but I have to say that I can appreciate the work that's been done to bring this game nearly up to par with AC3, and overall, for a game that's 1/3 the price of an AC game, this game is still pretty decent.This isn't the kind of AC game that is meant to impress, or win you over back to the series, but this is definitely worth playing if you're a fan of the AC series and don't have a PS Vita - this is the definitive version of the game, and I found myself enjoying it from time to time, so there's that.I don't recommend this game, however, if you're not into the AC series.This game should by no means be experienced and considered as a stand-alone.Only play this game if you care for the franchise.

												I wanted to love this game. I wanted this game to be great. For the price it is a complete rip off. No way this should have been a $19.99 PC game. Also the Vodoo pack (HD pack) DLC does not work with Steam accounts right now, so that is also another wasted $1.99. You can tell it is a game not designed for a PC. The controls, even with a gamepad, or an xbox controller in my case, were bad. There is not enough content to justify the price it has. You can finish the game in under  a few hours and that is well above the normal sync level. It, in my opinon, is the worst installment of the AC series. The character is there, the plot is there, but the game aimed and missed the target completly. I will drag myself through it to get 100% sync like I have in all the other Assassin's Creed games, only to complete it and never look at it again.			"

												TL;DR - Watered down version of AC3 gameplay with a very shallow story which makes no sense.The game tries to introduce a NEW exciting system of gameplay by breaking down the assassin persona from AC3 into three different personas: assassin, slave and upper class lady. Each persona should possess unique abilities, advantages and disadvantages, which makes one or the other better suited for certain missions, in theory. As cool as it sounds it just creates more problems in practice. The game basically punishes you for playing as an assassin (which IMHO can do any mission with ease) by adjusting your notoriety bar from basically anonymous to maximum notoriety. The whole notoriety system is a clusterf*ck. Enemies will only see you when you're basically in front of their nose but will also immediately forget about you when they turn around or you take a turn. Redefines the whole concept of ""stealthy gameplay"" by making you hide behind a f*cking lamp post in order to be invisible. The other two personas have mainly reduced abilities with a lower notoriety penalty.Other than that, it features familiar aspects of AC games like a big weapon and equipment repertoire, a trading system to gain ridiculous amounts of money, pointless sidequests to unlock that one SPECIAL HAT or other wardrobe pieces, collecting neverending amounts of pages (WHICH ARE STATIONARY HERE, THANK GOD) and other useless trinkets which should expand on the actual story missions. The latter make up the story as much as a few bread crumbs make up an entire loaf of bread. You are left with countless open questions which are just ignored as the game restarts and you are allowed to freely go and collect those 3 crocodile eggs you skipped because what else is there to do.This game comes with its own set of glitches and bugs, yay! You will see things like citizens floating off into air, gravestones and other random objects floating above ground, entire houses leaving gaping bottomless holes in the environment and of course endless exiting and restarting to get to get unstuck from somewhere because just F U.

												Probably the most boring part of the series, featuring New Orleans as enlarged village with nothing interesting to do in it. Shallow dialogues full of annoying pauses in speech (er... um... eh... how-do-you-say...), narrated in frenglish are definitely not helping the story.The missions themselves do not make sense sometimes. Eg. mission objective 1 - Infiltrate the base and find someone. Do not get detected. Mission objective 2 - OK, now that you've found the guy, kill him using the freaking powder keg explosion. Why exactly did I have to be stealthy before?The added actions and game mechanics not present in other ACs are a bit weird as well, and nicely complement the overall twisted thinking and sloppiness of the game producers. Here I’m referring mainly to beating down a fevered people in order to administer an antidote, murdering civilians to get extended cutscenes, and the ridiculous tank-like handling of canoes.Only part of game mechanic which is kind of interesting is the concept of personas – various outfits enabling different gameplay style and exploiting different opportunities. Unfortunately there are not enough moments in the game which would actually require thinking about which one would be best for the job, so you can finish the game using just one of them. To add insult to injury, the game from time to time forces you to use different persona as a mission objective or even directly changes you to one without any warning, just to fit the upcoming mission or cutscene. A good idea, but rather poorly executed.Do not buy unless you’re a die-hard fan of the AC series, in which case I also advise buying a pillow which you can bite down on, to help you overcome the awkwardness of the jokes an clichés present throughout the game.

												All in all, it's a fun Assassin's Creed game. Aside from the cutscenes and soundwork, it's difficult to tell that this was originally a handheld game; the gameplay is nearly identical to Assassin's Creed III and IV, though the mission structure seems like it was instead pulled from the Assassin's Creed II trilogy. The story is okay, though it would be much, much better if it weren't so fragmented, as it feels like there are a lot of cutscenes missing in-between memory sequences. If you enjoyed previous games in the series, then you'll most likely enjoy this one.			"

												Just another Assassin's Creed. Nothing special here.The setting and the protagonist are different, but not different/original enough. The Lousiana bayou was definitely an interesting setting but other settings such as New Orleans felt somewhat like Boston from ACIII. Aveline has character- but not enough. The Templar baddies are rather generic. There are a few interesting mechanics such as the three personas (assassin, lady, and slave) and a very confusing chain kill mechanic but none of them were well implimented. This game just felt like a filler and was rather boring. I couldn't even finish this one.Save your money and give Assassin's Creed Liberation a pass.			"

												Assassins Creed Liberation HD is a really fun game with a rather unique setting with enough tall buildings to keep people who prefer the older assassins creeds wall climbing and what not. It has also got the usual combat system and countering is as overpowered as ever although this is an issue with many games and would be pretty hard to balance out. The graphics aren't exactly ground-breaking but considering the fact this is also on the older consoles this should be no real suprise. This is still a spin-off game. I can say however that it bridges the gap between the old and newer assassins creed games. One thing that took me suprise was that the games install is less than 4GB which considering the content is rther suprising even though New Orleans is realitivly small when compared to the other cities found within the franchise but thats most likely due to the constraints the Vita version had.Also the loading screens are nice.8.75/10			"

												Yes i will recommend people to buy this game.Mainly due to a few reasons:)1. DUH OPEN WORLD ASSASSIN'S CREED=AWESOME2.Very different gameplay,and many different problems have a myriad of different solutions3.It is actuallly surprisingly well optimised for PC(For me,anyway)4.FIRST FEMALE ASSASSIN EVAAAAHowever,1.Honestly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ texturing(Doesn't even seem like it has current gen textures)2.♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting(melodramatic and monotonous)3.Like on the vita,sometimes freerunning may be troublesome and unwieldy(NO SPOILERS SORRY...HAVEN'T SPENT THAT MUCH TIME ON THE STORY YET CUZ IM PLAYING BLACK FLAG=D)			"

												Honestly i like the vita version a lot better. Its was made and built for the vita so i dont understand why it got ported in the first place. Before you fan boys go up and arms on me i will list the good stuff pros- decent port plays well with a controller i wouldnt reccomend using a keyboard unless you are used to it. - they up resed it pretty well but it could be better.- so far it seems they got rid of most of the bugs that where in the vita version which is a good thing. Cons - If you have a vita just play that version after all the game was built for it. - Uplay isnt my thing most people will like it and thats fine but i like having just one client on my pc. Though it has change a lot since i last used it.-not really true hd  it seems blurry in a lot of area and i have a high end pc. think of this like most hd collections on the ps3.  "

												I recommend this because it does offer some new features, something the AC franchise has done quite well. However, while Aveline is a very unique character, I feel Ubisoft squandered their first female assassin with this half-done game. It just doesn't feel like they put as much effort into this as they did the others. The story is okay, but it's not very engaging. I also notice some of the animations are poor compared to the previous games. For example, when Avenline slows down from sprinting to walking, there doesn't appear to be an animation that shows her actually slowing down like Edward or Connor. Instead, it seems as though she's just walking, but her slowing movement speed doesn't match the animation. As well, when she is sprinting and she moves left and right, the animation is just not right. Connor and Edward's animations showed their pivot foot push them in the direction they are strafing in, and the upper-body twist responding accordingly. Aveline just turns the direction she is strafing towards. It looks awkward and unrealistic compared to Ubisoft's beautiful animation work in Black Flag and AC:III.I have not beaten the game yet, but again, the story also doesn't appear to be well-invested. I do enjoy the features like the chain kill feature that I am still getting used to, and I think a female assassin like Aveline offers new gameplay options, such as Aveline's ability to change personas. That's a great feature, and I hope to see that be expanded into a male assassin in future games. I can only hope that where Liberation's shortcomings begin, make for a great experience in the next AC; I hope that perhaps we will see another female assassin (personally, I want to see Shao Jun's story in an AC title), and Liberation was more or less an introduction to it, like naval combat in AC:III to Black Flag. Liberation is a nice addition to the Assassin's Creed Franchise, but it seems like Ubisoft just got lazy in this title and put only half effort into it.			"

The parkour and Combat is exactly the same as AC3 and 4.

												its a pretty good game. it plays alot like ac 3. however there seams to be a messed up shadow thing on screen while i play that makes things annoying but still playable. the controlls are a bit funky. in other words its not as smooth as one would want compared to ac 3. and for some reason idk why it has crashed on me a few times. i like the story ok.but the music is not really that moveing for it. other than all these details its a pretty good game. sure they need to work on a few things to make it p[lay right.

												Probably the worst Assassin's Creed so far. The narrative jumps all over the place, none of the characters are properly established, and the freerunning mechanic is glitchy, not helped by the annoyingly designed environments especially around the Bayou sections of the game.Despite the ""HD"" monicker the game is also ugly as a sin, the most essential character models have been updated but something as simple as the Level of Detail on distance, climb up to a tall building (A series staple) and the houses benath your feet will look like folded cardboard. There is no setting to alter this, and it is clearly a remnant from the Vita version			"

After clocking in a few entertaining hours of gameplay on Black Flag including the small ""Aveline""-part included there ( wich I liked ), I couldn't wait to try Liberation. But everything about the gameplay from Black Flag that made it a good and rewarding experience is removed from Liberation - the main character is completely useless and without the traits and tools I've fell in love with from Black Flag, and every scene seems to be staged and scripted to the millimetre. Liberation is in other words a huge ""Back To The Future""-thing, probably loved by everyone that doesn't like the gameplay progress from Assassins Creed 1....			"

												As an avid fan of the Assassin's Creed series, I have to say I've experienced nothing but disappointment, to the extent that I can't even bring myself to finish the game, a rare occurrence. The true strength of the Assassin's Creed franchise has been their ability to meld well thought out stories with a gameplay that makes it exciting, dynamic and fun. I experienced nothing of the sort in this game. The quests and segments were merely a series of banal and pointless tasks strung together by a dialog so oversimplified and cartoonish I could only assume it was designed to cater to the 4 year old demographic. There was no sense of character development or plot, the gameplay was dull at best and the implementation of the wardrobe system was a desperate, derived grab to add a new dynamic to the game which ultimately did nothing but annoy. I've sincerely tried to find something good to say about this game and I honestly can't, I've played more entertaining games made by elementary school kids on a sprite game builder. I'd very much like my money back.			"

												Game is quite fun; it's actually the only Assassin's Creed I've ever been even remotely interested in. Love that the main character is a woman of color, which is a rarity in gaming nowadays.However, don't buy this game on Steam and be forced to engage the nonsense UPlay 3rd party DRM if you can at all avoid it. You'll get an equally entertaining experience on a PS3 or 360.			"

												so this game gets off to a shaky start narrative-wise. they tried to up the mystery by not revealing key details about the main character, which makes abstergo seem devious, but it made Avaline really flat, bland, and unrelatable at first. it's cool that they made a lady assassin who actually looked like a woman from a less progressive time period, rather than just a reskinned man, but they did the usual thing where tough girls are completely opposed to anything fun. she never had the moments of just messing around having a good time that Ezzio proved could be in an AC game. by the end of the game lots of my complaints were cleared up, but it really felt flat near the beginning.anyway, like i said, they executed her demographic representation pretty well, not just through story, but also mechanics. the personas (assassin, lady, and slave) added a lot of depth to gameplay and playstyle, especially in conjunction with the muskets and pistols, which deterred me from my usual AC tomfoolery. basically long story short, worth playing, the ending got a great emotional reaction from me, could have used some better narrative, but i never regretted buying it.

												And now, my Assassin's Creed gaming spree stops at AC Liberation HD since this one is not a revisit! So what's to say about this game, that was made as a Portable version (PlayStation Vita) and then ported towards XB360, PS3 and then PC?Well first of all, you won't miss much, in fact, at all if you don't play this game. It doesn't add much in the storyline of the AC plot and in that area alone, it was very lacking. Secondly, the gameplay mechanics, albeit being very similar to previous AC games, was very clunky and unresponsive very often. Maybe a strange transition from PS Vita to PC? What's very annoying with the clunky controls is especially on The Bayou area, where tight controls are a must, but still feels laggish (and I played this game with the XBONE Controller).Aside from those gripes, the main character, Aveline de Grandpré, is an interesting character. Her abilities are, again, similar to previous AC protagonists. The only notable variation is the ""persona system (lady, assassin, slave)"", where you change clothes and ""impersonate"" one of the three roles, mainly used for secondary missions. This persona system adds a new dynamic in the game but most of the time, it is just annoying to switch roles and especially that this game has so little if not fast travel system.PROS:+Cool main character and I gotta admit, Aveline de Grandpré is way more interesting than AC 3 Connor! Just sad she was under developed in Liberation.+Decent story but it lacks depth though.+New Orleans area is fun to explore.+For a portable game ported to PC, the graphics and visuals are very decent... mostly!+Aveline and Connor doing a mission together... sadly, it doesn't last long.CONS:-Even if good looking, AC Liberation has lots of inconsistent graphical glitches, faulty draw distance (enemies popping right in front of you when running).-Must be the weakest soundtrack of all AC games... it is excellent for sleeping use though!-NPCS are very forgettable.-Boring missions (same old investigate here and there and tail this guy, don't be seen... ohh, you missed an objective! There, a big red cross on that pointless optional objective from that checklist! At times, these optional objectives don't even appear at a mission start. You are only reminded that they're present when you either fail the mission completely or a optional objective. Clearly, I really hated this integration in AC: Revelations and I'm quite irritated that it is still being used in further AC games... ).-Persona system (each has different abilities and restrictions... and the restrictions are often the cause of frustration!).-Not enough fast travel system.-The Bayou area is a real B*I*T*C*H* to navigate.-Gaining money in this game can be tedious for a while until the trading system opens up more ports for your ships.-Limited replay value. Unless you seek 100% achievements? Still, this ain't a game that you will replay someday. I had invested lots of playtime in this game (22 hours) since I did wanted to explore the most I could and wanted until I finished the main story and many side-missions) but honestly, you can finish this game under 10 hours of playtime!OVERALL:If you haven't played the Vita version, well now's your chance to pick Liberation up and give it a shot. Although, do it only when the game is on sale! I'm having mixed feelings on this game and clearly, this game has a lot more CONS than PROS and it is hard to recommend such a weak game.RECOMMENDATION:For Assassin's Creed fans only. This is clearly not the game to start the AC franchise so if you haven't played any AC games before, skip this one and do your homework and backtrack to the main AC games!But if you're an AC fan like I am, you should definately give this game a shotRATING:6.0 / 10And now, AC 4: Black Flag... here I come! AArrrrrrr!			"

												For the most part, I like AC Liberation.  I really like the storyline, which is the main thing for me.  It's really complex, more than just going about in a straightforward way.  However, the gameplay itself isn't the best.  I know this was originally made for a PS Vita game so the standards will have to be a lower.  I've seen a few glitches in movement, but doesn't really affect the game that much.  My biggest gripe is the controls.  I can run through roofs and treetops fine, but I don't like how the game shoots long range weapons.  I liked the way it was done in AC3 when you could just aim with Q and let go to fire.  Here, I have to click F to focus on the person, aim at the target, and do some Q tap or double tap to execute the movement.  It just about never cooperates with me the first time I want it done.  Fortunately, a lot of the times I want to use darts, the target has not discovered me so I could take my time trying to shoot them.  The other thing I didn't like is the alligator fighting combat.  There's never enough time for me to see and press the button to kill it.  I had better luck in AC3 so in that game, fighting wolves was a piece of cake.  The only way I made it through the first alligator killing mission was to spam every possible key they could ask of me, which I spent 20 minutes on.Overall, I like Liberation.  I don't know if those are actual historical people she killed, since I haven't checked yet, but the process Aveline used to find each target was very logical, not unreasonably sudden.  The business sending goods overseas was a nice touch, a break from the usual sending Assassins to secure areas from Templar influence.			"

												Although this is just supposed to be a non-main AC game that ties into ACIII, I think it can hold its own.

The core game mechanics are what you expect from an AC game, the graphics are decent for an HD port and the best thing of all: no freaking eavesdropping missions.			"

												If you have played other versions of Assassin Creed franchises..Then you would need A LOT OF PATIENCE for this game.Most players would feel bored while using non-combat gear.Cool main character (Aveline)Aveline offers a different approach with a great atmosphere.She has a unique ability to change her appearance and, thus, how people react to her. She has three available disguises, or personas: the Assassin, the Lady, and the Slave. Each changes her navigational skills, strength, speed, and blending options.Unique features of Assassin Creed Liberation1) Canoe within swampsThis game suffers from the graphical power and gameplay Assassin Creed Black Flag had, but it's far from a bad game.For $20, its not expensive.

												It seems like Ubisoft went out of their way to sabotage this game at every point. Things are constantly going wrong in the gameplay with bugs and movement problems (it seems like they took the movement from Assassins Creed 1 and put it in here). There are also many incomplete ideas and it takes way too long to get interesting.THAT BEING SAID.It's, overall, still a pretty good game. Assassins Creed was never 100% terrible, so every main game has been at least okay (if inconsequentional like Brotherhood and Revelations). The story is really what got me interested, and it features a protagonist we're probably never going to see again in an even vaguely AAA game. The bayou is a super-interesting new environment (if a little frustrating to navigate).If you want to experience something that will probably never be seen anywhere near the AAA game space ever again, get this game. If you just want to experience Assassins Creed as it always was and always will be, then skip it. This is only going to go appreciated by people who want something different, not by those who want something familiar.Also, I am colonial-era whipmaster.			"

												#1 Priority BEFORE Launching:Right-click on AC: Liberation HD in your Steam Library. Go to Properties>Local Files>Browse Local Files or you can navigate manually to where you have installed AC: Liberation HD. Left-click once then right-click ac3lhd_32.exe (in your main AC: Liberation HD folder) and select ""Properties"". Go to the ""Compatibility"" tab and at the bottom of it, ""Change settings for all users"". Make sure ""Run this program as an administrator"" is checked, then click on Apply, followed by OK. For an extra precaution, go to the Security tab (still under ""Properties"" of ac3lhd_32.exe) and allow ""Full control"" for all of the ""Group or user names"". Double-check to see that they are all checked for ""Full control"".If you did not do this, your progress will NOT save!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The real review is this game is alright. It'll keep you entertained. It's worth the money (full price, $20) if you like Assassin's Creed games. If you are not sure, pick it up for under $15.			"

												As a long time fan of the Assassin's Creed series, I have had mixed feelings about some of the games. Liberation is a mobile port so the graphics are not quite as sharp as others, but the story and gameplay are fun. Liberation is riddled with bugs and can sometimes be hard to make it do what you are trying to do, but it's gripping enough that can't stay away for long.The division of personalities was a brilliant, if somewhat underused concept. Sometimes you are locked into one personality, or you randomly change from wanted status. Switching to Lady mode, you can finally run around the city without fear of accidently climbing on top of a crate or lamppost. Each personality has collectables and mini missions hidden around the different zones, encouraging you to explore in all roles. But the game often prevents you from having the freedom it needs you to have. This leaves you frequently frustrated, trying to please the game rather than have assassins creed style fun.At the end of the day, with the multiple zones, personalities, story and collectables, this was a very good addition to the series and I recommend it. Just try not to let the bugs get to you and keep going!			"

												Anyone thinking this is more AC 4 Black Flag  should avoid this one entirely. I don't know the history, but there's a reference at the start of AC4 during the tour of Aspergo where Liberation is described as the first game in the series. I suspect this is just a very old AC game updated with higher-res graphics (thus the HD on the end), and it really really shows.  It certainly feels like pre-AC1 quality, awkward, stiffly-scripted mission segments that seem to suddenly get interrupted just as you're getting into it, horrible restrictions on movement (i.e. terrain) and none of the polish and finesse of AC 3 or 4.  And a very strange and creepy sexist vibe to much of it.  It is not a sibling to Freedom Cry at all.I've given it a good try but won't bother playing it any more.  It is not a pleasurable experience, and I find it frustrating to play.  I consider it a complete waste of my $20.  At $1.99 on GOG, I might be able to give it a thumbs up, but at $20 on Steam, it's just the AC brand cow being milked and users not being properly warned it's old content being regurgitated.I have learned to be much more careful in assuming quality in purchases now, even in the same brand.  The developer needs to recognize that this kind of release damages the branding, even if it grabs a few extra bucks.			"

												A very poor entry into the Assassin's Creed series. The original was bland, and the port doesn't do the game any kind of justice. It uses the same engine for AC: III, which is not as fine-tuned as it's successor (AC: IV), meaning the gameplay sucks. Aveline de Grandpre was a character of massive potential, but due to the constraints of the original system the game was made for, the story fails to impress, and it's characters don't make it any better. She was also very slippery to control compared to Altair, and Ezio. The costume changing felt more like a pointless gimmick rather than a meaningful endeavor to add some sort of flavor to the story. The game also doesn't add a whole lot to the Assassin's Creed lore either, so it's really not worth checking out.			"

You don't always have to go swords a blazing4. Unique setting.  How many games are set in French Louisiana? probably only this one.5.  If you pay attention you can pick up the threads from the Freedom Cry DLC.The not so good:1.  Story is convoluted and ultimately forgettable2. The primary city can be a pain to traverse and looks rather bland.  No grand visuals like we come to expect from AC,3.  Graphics, ok I know its a port from a mobile game, but just be aware this is not next gen.4.  The swamp, while new and interesting, was more hassle than the wilderness from AC4.Bottom line, if you like Assassins creed games get it.  It has more of everything we love.

												Totally worth the money! Fun Fun Fun! I love playing a female character, I wish there was a bit more of a stealth mode, but sticking to rooftops suites me fine. Its awesome!  If you love to dress up, play cloak and dagger, you can do that too.  I enjoy going around doing the scenarios on one save and on the other I go around and just steal money and collect loot.  Its a blast after a long day of work.			"

I love the game, but these technical problems make it impossible to play. Believe me. I tried playing AC Unity with mouse and keyboard. The mass amount of lag and crashes, plus the terrible mouse and keyborad controls, destroyed the experience. This game, might be tolerable because of the lack of lag. Not for me though.			"

												This game did not port over well from the Vita.  Compared to AC 3, the gameplay is weak and overly streamlined.  The positioning of the contextual free-running surfaces felt like they were frequently misalligned, causing a lot of missed jumps and frustration.  The side-plots and optional objectives also feel much more like chores in this entry than in others.The character of Aveline is quite intriguing, in fact she had a great deal of potential and was nearly this game's saving grace.  The character arcs she shares with her step mother and her steward also had the potential to be very powerful and affecting.  However, I feel she was poorly served by the game's underdeveloped plot and thin script.			"

												Maybe I am biased in writing this review, being a big fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise.But I really believe this is a truly fun game to play, even for someone who ""accidentally"" stumbles upon this game, never having played an earlier iteration of the game.It takes about 20 hours to complete the game with 100% syncronization, which is more than adequate for the price required.The graphics are better than would be expected for a Vita port.The ambience is not so engaging as previous games, due to the game being a conversion from the console, and the music is quite repetitive.Still, as stated above, it is fun to play and it is a fine addition to your library of games.

												As a long time fan of the Assassin's Creed series, I have had mixed feelings about some of the games. Liberation is a mobile port so the graphics are not quite as sharp as others, but the story and gameplay are fun. Liberation is riddled with bugs and can sometimes be hard to make it do what you are trying to do, but it's gripping enough that can't stay away for long.The division of personalities was a brilliant, if somewhat underused concept. Sometimes you are locked into one personality, or you randomly change from wanted status. Switching to Lady mode, you can finally run around the city without fear of accidently climbing on top of a crate or lamppost. Each personality has collectables and mini missions hidden around the different zones, encouraging you to explore in all roles. But the game often prevents you from having the freedom it needs you to have. This leaves you frequently frustrated, trying to please the game rather than have assassins creed style fun.At the end of the day, with the multiple zones, personalities, story and collectables, this was a very good addition to the series and I recommend it. Just try not to let the bugs get to you and keep going!			"

												I guess it's a good thing that the developers finally realised that walking around all in white and red wearing the insignia of your top secret assassin order as a giant belt buckle was not the stealthiest way to go about things. But you have to change clothes so many times that the game feels like little more than a Barbie dress up game. It's like the game doesn't just involve changing clothes as a mechanic, that's what the game is about.The dialogues are awful, the flirting dialogues doubly so, I wonder if whoever wrote them has actually ever flirted with someone because it feels like they learned about it from a children's cartoon. Also somehow just because the character's female everyone's willing to spill up their secrets after being flirted with for two and a half seconds.The slave outfit looks too stylish, she looks more like a hippie college pagan than a slave when all the real slaves are in actual tattered rags. It's just the entire point of the slave outfit is that she gets to blend in, which she doesn't. So really it's back to AC2 where we would pretend that a guy in full assassin uniform surrounded by four escorts was ""blending"".It's almost impossible to kill the alligators, I don't know if it's because the game was ported and the controls aren't responding quickly enough but it's just really difficult to perform a randomly assigned combination of keys every time, in the speed that the keys show up on the screen.""Restart checkpoint"" doesn't exist and is sorely missed.The ""lady persona"" can swim when she falls into water (in a dress that looks like it would get VERY heavy when soaked) but she can't climb back up. Climbing buildings is one thing, but she can't even hoist herself out of the water. It would be more realistic if some of the people watching came to her rescue or something at least.Your notoriety increases for no reason at all, and it's a hassle to walk around the map chasing posters to tear down.I did like the design of the memory corridor/loading screen. I also like how fast and fluid the parkour is. The wetlands were cool even though I prefer city parkour.			"

Now that it's out on other platforms I'm even more convinced it should have been released like this at the start. Liberation is a great addition to the franchise. Aveline's story is great and compelling and pretty nifty how it ties in with Assassin's Creed 3. I believe it should be considered a part of the series among the rest, not just an add-on.			"

												For the most part, I like AC Liberation.  I really like the storyline, which is the main thing for me.  It's really complex, more than just going about in a straightforward way.  However, the gameplay itself isn't the best.  I know this was originally made for a PS Vita game so the standards will have to be a lower.  I've seen a few glitches in movement, but doesn't really affect the game that much.  My biggest gripe is the controls.  I can run through roofs and treetops fine, but I don't like how the game shoots long range weapons.  I liked the way it was done in AC3 when you could just aim with Q and let go to fire.  Here, I have to click F to focus on the person, aim at the target, and do some Q tap or double tap to execute the movement.  It just about never cooperates with me the first time I want it done.  Fortunately, a lot of the times I want to use darts, the target has not discovered me so I could take my time trying to shoot them.  The other thing I didn't like is the alligator fighting combat.  There's never enough time for me to see and press the button to kill it.  I had better luck in AC3 so in that game, fighting wolves was a piece of cake.  The only way I made it through the first alligator killing mission was to spam every possible key they could ask of me, which I spent 20 minutes on.Overall, I like Liberation.  I don't know if those are actual historical people she killed, since I haven't checked yet, but the process Aveline used to find each target was very logical, not unreasonably sudden.  The business sending goods overseas was a nice touch, a break from the usual sending Assassins to secure areas from Templar influence.			"

												so this game gets off to a shaky start narrative-wise. they tried to up the mystery by not revealing key details about the main character, which makes abstergo seem devious, but it made Avaline really flat, bland, and unrelatable at first. it's cool that they made a lady assassin who actually looked like a woman from a less progressive time period, rather than just a reskinned man, but they did the usual thing where tough girls are completely opposed to anything fun. she never had the moments of just messing around having a good time that Ezzio proved could be in an AC game. by the end of the game lots of my complaints were cleared up, but it really felt flat near the beginning.anyway, like i said, they executed her demographic representation pretty well, not just through story, but also mechanics. the personas (assassin, lady, and slave) added a lot of depth to gameplay and playstyle, especially in conjunction with the muskets and pistols, which deterred me from my usual AC tomfoolery. basically long story short, worth playing, the ending got a great emotional reaction from me, could have used some better narrative, but i never regretted buying it.

												Originally made for Sony's handheld Vita (not PSP as some other reviewers mistakenly claim here) this upconverted port to PC shows it's handheld background unfortunatly obvious to well.  You can tell they made the whole game super streamlined to play on a handheld that you pick up and play in quick bursts instead of one long sitting like on a pc. Unfortunatly on the PC that streamlinedness comes across as empty and a little boring.   This AC is really just following the story beats to the next story icon.  Sure there was a couple side things to do, but they all seemed pointless time wasters so I ended up skipping most of them.  You could tell they had a lot of cool interesting ideas that they put in here, but with the game so overly simplified they did not really have time to fully see them realized.  With that said, I do recommend it for AC lovers like me.  It's great to play a female lead for once, and her dialogue and story kept me going and are what ultimatly make me recommend this game.... especially if you can find it for under $10 like I did on sale.I will say, I have a top end system, and this game sometimes made it chug.  I had to lower my graphics to 1080p to be acceptable, and I also had to reset that graphics setting upon each restart as it would not save it properly.   Also one of the few games that more than a couple times completly froze my Win 7 machine needing a reboot.Also realize that you need to also use Uplay, so if that system is down, you can't play.  (also turn off you cloud sync saves, that seems to accidentally delete your saves randomly).			"

												I have never played an Assassin's Creed game before, but this came up in the steam sale so I thought I'd give it a go.This is quite possibly the worst game I have ever played. The controls are clumsy and I never felt totally in control of the character. I tried using both mouse and keyboard, and xbox controller but neither felt right. The story is so incredibly boring, the voice acting is terrible and the missions seem repetitive. All I've done so far in the game is walk around, and now I've been sent to some mansion to kill some guy. I haven't even killed anyone in the game so far and now I'm expected to kill 8 guards with muskets. I don't even know what the controls are to attack, and because the stupid game doesn't even have a proper ""controls"" section I can't find out.... so I can no longer play this game. After 15 mins of button bashing and dieing I am giving up.Waste of time. I would say waste of money but I only paid about 2 pounds GBP for it, which is more than it's worth.I'm not going to give up on the franchise though, I'll give black flag a go.... when it's on sale again			"

												I have to admit, that I like Assassin's Creed series and enjoy each AC game. The same was with Liberation, which is not a 'normal' game as e.g. Black Flag, but a port of a PSP's version. However I have enjoyed the time spent with Aveline. Liberation offers the same as the other games, but everything is just smaller. There are the same pros and cons as in other AC games. It offers us canonical for series: story similar to the previous ones; impressive fights, parkour great as always. There are also three different locations, which I prefered more than the ones in ACIII. On the other hand we find here a very  stupid ending, sporadic camera problems and a few frustrating missions. Also the visual side of this game could be better - it is clearly seen, that the game was not made to work on the powerful computers. The items collectors will also have fun - there are many chests to be looted and diary pages or alligator eggs to be found.The game is smaller by all means. You should include the time needed to complete it - it took me 6,5 hours to complete 86% of Liberation (including the items, mini missions etc).I recommend this game as much as I recommend any other AC game. Even if it is not perfect, it still makes fun and does not cost a fortune.			"

Freerun path handling was mediocre, I found myself failing to catch ledges or leaping to the wrong one. The notoriety system for the slave is a little frustrating, if you bump into a box or wall while running you generate notoriety. High profile kill a lone guard in a secluded area and you still somehow generate notoriety.Story was a little confusing. Citizen E didn't really help. I don't know exactly what happened at the end there when the artifact was correctly activated.I did find the persona mechanic interesting though.

												I wish Aveline had been the main character of a better game.I beat this game and was disappointed that there was no plot. The game throws a bunch of plot hooks all over the place, but none find purchase. Things just happen and Aveline has no real agancy, which for a large part of the game I thought would be the theme. One gets a vague sense that interesting things might be happening in-between playable segments, but nothing is resolved. The game even throws in a meta story element by framing itself as an entertainment product developed by the Assassins' enemies, Abstergo. At three or four points in the game, you are told to kill game abstractions to unlock cinematic sequences Abstergo removed from the narrative. These sequences add nothing to the plot or explain character motivations. One is inclined to ask, ""Why would Abstergo cut these segments where people advocate more action against the slave trade?"" In addition to these cinematics, your sparse journal entries on some of the characters you encounter are changed, but not in any surprising or meaningful ways.tl;dr - What would have saved this game for me would be if it had Shaun or some Shaun analoge to give context to this mess of a story.

												HORRIBLE! go ahead and get this game if you love black screens and crashing on start up, ive googled my problem with this game and theres about 29+ pages full of people with the same issues, I just got a brand new Alienware m17x r3  with NVIDIA Geforce GTX 880m video card from the dell website, got to about 29% through the game and now all i get is crashing and black screens, this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Once again U-Play fails us as a company, yea im a fan of the AC series, but this one is off the charts low grade gaming. you pay for a game thats not even close to ""HD"", the story line is from the same time as assasins creed 3, and the story line makes no sence at times, they did a poor job with this one and on top of everything i havent mentioned about this piece of a game you tend to mime invisible walls that are everywhere i will not be paying 20$ for another game if it has to deal with U-Play, they dont care about customers that pay hard earned money for games they have. and they wont even update the issues that come with the game.

The blowpipe is cool and you get to be 3 differnt personas, assassin, lady, or slave which makes it different gameplay througout the game. I like how you can freeze time and do some cinematic kills.

												While none of the AC games have lived up to the story of the first, I still enjoy the series. Or I did, until I experienced Assassin's Creed Liberation. The game-play was even more repetitive and unimaginative than previous games (if you can believe it), and the story might as well have not even be there - it was so uninteresting and uneventful. It's the first AC game that I won't even bother finishing.What happened, Ubisoft? The first game was great because you got to roleplay in a very distant historical time and place, not the ♥♥♥♥ing pre-industrialized, deep South. The story of the first game was enthralling because it surrounded the mystique of the Nizari Assassins and was heavily driven by science fiction and deep conspiracy. This has all since been replaced by tree-jumping, guns, politics, and social justice.			"

												assassin's creed liberation was the first assassin's creed game i ever played (and am still playing) and it was phenomenal. the storyline is excellent, the characters are interesting, and the music is just spectacular. it may have it's own set of problems, but doesn't just about every console to pc port? especially since liberation was released for the playstation vita of all consoles. liberation is a gem that is often overlooked, and that's really quite unfortunate.i have already recommended this game to others, and i will continue to do so into the foreseeable future, it's just that good.

												I have enjoyed every installment of the Assassin's Creed franchise up until Liberation, but this HD PC version just seems superfluous. The controls are not as tight as previous games, the storytelling is confusing and disjointed, and obviously the graphics are not up to par when compared to the other PC games.There are some memorable sequences, but they are few and far between. My recommendation is to buy it on sale, and play it if you are a diehard fan of the franchise or if, like me, you are a completionist when it comes to story (and want every scrap that the series will throw you). Otherwise I would skip this entry.			"

												Well - I must say I was a little scared at first - mostly because this game is a port from mobile devices. I tried such game before - unfamous ""Deus Ex: The Fall"" which... let's just say wasn't good. So this time I didn't expect to much from the beginning. But - I was positively suprised. The game is very nice. It is somewhat simplified comparing to AC 3 for example, but still pack a ton of fun. I liked the idea of persona changing especially, which allows the player to turn into three very different persons, with different skill and abilities - almost at will. And three different personas means at least three different ways to handle some quests (some, as the others are reserved for one persona only). Also - making the main character a female gives this game some different, unique feel... Finally, the lengh of the game is just all right - not to much (it is not a ""main line"" game after all) and not to little (again comparing to only 2-3 hours long ""Deus Ex: The Fall""...).Definately something worth playing !

												I have heard many negative comments about the Story of the game. I must disagree to this. Liberation is a ""must play"" for all AC fans out there.It is a perfect match in the ac3 timeline (you will meet familiar faces like Connor) and tells the story from a female assassin Aveliine during the pre-revolution time in new orleans. Starting there our heroin is traveling to different places including south america to solve errands and fight the templar. The ingame depth is not the same like ac3 but it is for sure worth his money.You will have a lot of fun with aveline and the other chars in this PC version of this former console  (Vita) game.

												Got about 16 hours of gameplay out of this. It was OK, but rather buggy. Most of the whip swings I tried had her dive into the water below rather than using her whip. Freerun path handling was mediocre, I found myself failing to catch ledges or leaping to the wrong one. The notoriety system for the slave is a little frustrating, if you bump into a box or wall while running you generate notoriety. High profile kill a lone guard in a secluded area and you still somehow generate notoriety.Story was a little confusing. Citizen E didn't really help. I don't know exactly what happened at the end there when the artifact was correctly activated.I did find the persona mechanic interesting though. Also it was fun playing as a strong independant black woman who don't need no templar.			"

It takes awhile to fall into a comfortable stride but when it does it relaxes into  a much more interesting game and the plot begins to come together, I think it should have been a bit longer I think, to tie up some other aspects of the story but otherwise it was a pretty fun game with a nice rendition of the city of new orlean and the bayou. 7,5/10			"

												Basically a game which can get you stuck on a single axe-swinging dude because there are no way the ""break defense"" button and ""counter"" button will work (I guess those only works for engaging the default guards). And the AI are too stupid that even if they saw you (and the detection bar turned yellow), they can just look at you and continue patrolling like you were invisible. On the bright side though, this game's graphic is quite good. But because of the countless bugs and glitches, I guess this is just slightly better than Assassin's Creed Unity.  Therefore, not quite recommended if you are not an Assassin's Creed Die-hard fans.			"

												And now, my Assassin's Creed gaming spree stops at AC Liberation HD since this one is not a revisit! So what's to say about this game, that was made as a Portable version (PlayStation Vita) and then ported towards XB360, PS3 and then PC?Well first of all, you won't miss much, in fact, at all if you don't play this game. It doesn't add much in the storyline of the AC plot and in that area alone, it was very lacking. Secondly, the gameplay mechanics, albeit being very similar to previous AC games, was very clunky and unresponsive very often. Maybe a strange transition from PS Vita to PC? What's very annoying with the clunky controls is especially on The Bayou area, where tight controls are a must, but still feels laggish (and I played this game with the XBONE Controller).Aside from those gripes, the main character, Aveline de Grandpré, is an interesting character. Her abilities are, again, similar to previous AC protagonists. The only notable variation is the ""persona system (lady, assassin, slave)"", where you change clothes and ""impersonate"" one of the three roles, mainly used for secondary missions. This persona system adds a new dynamic in the game but most of the time, it is just annoying to switch roles and especially that this game has so little if not fast travel system.PROS:+Cool main character and I gotta admit, Aveline de Grandpré is way more interesting than AC 3 Connor! Just sad she was under developed in Liberation.+Decent story but it lacks depth though.+New Orleans area is fun to explore.+For a portable game ported to PC, the graphics and visuals are very decent... mostly!+Aveline and Connor doing a mission together... sadly, it doesn't last long.CONS:-Even if good looking, AC Liberation has lots of inconsistent graphical glitches, faulty draw distance (enemies popping right in front of you when running).-Must be the weakest soundtrack of all AC games... it is excellent for sleeping use though!-NPCS are very forgettable.-Boring missions (same old investigate here and there and tail this guy, don't be seen... ohh, you missed an objective! There, a big red cross on that pointless optional objective from that checklist! At times, these optional objectives don't even appear at a mission start. You are only reminded that they're present when you either fail the mission completely or a optional objective. Clearly, I really hated this integration in AC: Revelations and I'm quite irritated that it is still being used in further AC games... ).-Persona system (each has different abilities and restrictions... and the restrictions are often the cause of frustration!).-Not enough fast travel system.-The Bayou area is a real B*I*T*C*H* to navigate.-Gaining money in this game can be tedious for a while until the trading system opens up more ports for your ships.-Limited replay value. Unless you seek 100% achievements? Still, this ain't a game that you will replay someday. I had invested lots of playtime in this game (22 hours) since I did wanted to explore the most I could and wanted until I finished the main story and many side-missions) but honestly, you can finish this game under 10 hours of playtime!OVERALL:If you haven't played the Vita version, well now's your chance to pick Liberation up and give it a shot. Although, do it only when the game is on sale! I'm having mixed feelings on this game and clearly, this game has a lot more CONS than PROS and it is hard to recommend such a weak game.RECOMMENDATION:For Assassin's Creed fans only. This is clearly not the game to start the AC franchise so if you haven't played any AC games before, skip this one and do your homework and backtrack to the main AC games!But if you're an AC fan like I am, you should definately give this game a shotRATING:6.0 / 10And now, AC 4: Black Flag... here I come!

												When I first found out about Liberation, I was upset that it wasn't going to be available on anything but the PS Vita. Now that it's out on other platforms I'm even more convinced it should have been released like this at the start. Liberation is a great addition to the franchise. Aveline's story is great and compelling and pretty nifty how it ties in with Assassin's Creed 3. I believe it should be considered a part of the series among the rest, not just an add-on.			"

No assasinations, just the same idea from far cry 3. Not only does it feel ripped off but holy sht, nothing works, you can't counter, you cant break their defenses, the only thing u can do is shoot them, or knock them against a wall. Oh and good luck with the 100% sync, you have to do it while taking no damage. Have fun!			"

												This is the best Assassin's Creed since Brotherhood.I stand by that statement despite the various shortcomings other reviews have already mentioned. The story sometimes feels conjointed (mainly due to timejumps) and inconsequential which doesn't bother me so much though. The game does not portray world shaking events or an artifact that can bring nations to their knees, because of that the story can focus on the work of an Assassin who still does assassiny things. Aveline is conflicted between following the creed, serving her mentor, who has largely become self absorbed and self righteous, and the Templars whose ideas are presented as tempting but extreme. Aveline is a well rounded character who is likeable, relatable and badass. The fact that she is a woman, a perfect opportunity for showcasing Ubisoft completely feministic and open mindset, is not showcased at all, which I think is the strongest argument for feminism you can make. It presents the facts without agenda.And lastly the reason I would have recommended this game no matter the story is the persona system. While it requires a bit of time until you fully get the hang of it (I think the tutorial didn't do a great job) it is worth it. It allows for actual infiltration and secrecy (something both Unity and Syndicate tried and failed at) As well as a certain amount of planning for your missions. There are unique equipments for every persona that you can use to upgrade their capabilities like a hidden pistol or a parasol with a dartlauncher build in.Equipment for the Assassin persona is fun as well, I especially like the whip both for it's capabilities and the symbolism.Lastly worth mentioning is that future you is not working for the Assassins or the Templars you are literally just a bloke who plays a videogame but get interrupted by some ominous voice that doesn't try to convince you to do anything (or ask you to press A to join the Assassins) but simply chimes in after a cutscene and says ""Yeah that's nice but just take a look at the uncut version and make up your own mind"". It gives you perspective on how the perception of history changes how we view both it and the present.Definitely worthy of your attention and the direction Ubisoft should have taken the franchise.Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.			"

												Quite possibly the least fun game in the entire AC series up to this point.Is it the inferior graphics? The poor writing? The buggy programming?Whatever it is, Ubisoft is just going through the motions at this point. No love has been put into this game, and the result is a bore.			"

												A short and fun game with few flaws, Liberation is one of the most enjoyable entries in the AC series and well worth playing. The lead character, Aveline, is written and performed well. The plot is interesting, but the storytelling is at times weak. Interesting and relevant parts of Aveline's life (such as why and how she became an Assassin) are not covered in any detail. Unlike earlier games in the series, I sometimes ended up killing a large number of people purely because it was the objective, without really knowing why. I didn't connect as emotionally with the story as I did in ACII and Brotherhood.The voice acting was generally strong, but a few of the minor characters were a little overdone. The soundtrack is brilliant and well worth listening to on its own.A couple of the bosses (first swamp boss and tower) were pretty tough if you tried to kill them using conventional means, but all were entirely trivial if using a smoke bomb or a chain kill.I'd reccomend this game if you like the AC series, but not as an introduction to it.

												Maybe I am biased in writing this review, being a big fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise.But I really believe this is a truly fun game to play, even for someone who ""accidentally"" stumbles upon this game, never having played an earlier iteration of the game.It takes about 20 hours to complete the game with 100% syncronization, which is more than adequate for the price required.The graphics are better than would be expected for a Vita port.The ambience is not so engaging as previous games, due to the game being a conversion from the console, and the music is quite repetitive.Still, as stated above, it is fun to play and it is a fine addition to your library of games.

												I've been playing the game on and off for over a year. Every time I start playing it I just wanted to get it over with. I find the story to be more boring than the one in Assassin's Creed III. The whip was one of the things I really liked along with the trading/economy mechanic. Other than that didn't like it a lot. I pushed through just to get to the end and finish with the story, wont be coming back to collect the stuff I've missed.			"

												So I am playing the assassin's creed games in order, I have played all of them up until Liberation.  All in all, it's a fun game to play.  It's short and fairly easy to play.  The story line is horrible though, the character development is rushed so you don't really get to like the main characters like you do in the other games.  The game play is fun and unique.  I really like how you can change personas, like you can assassinate people in a nice dress with your dart-umbrella and no one suspects a thing.  You can also seduce people you intend on assassinating.  So I'd recommend playing through this game if you're an Assassin's Creed fan.			"

												Cannot recommend this game, this is due to quicktime events we saw in AC3, but here its worse. Second problem is pathing. In that for instance lack of pathing routes, or rather the developers have decided thst psthing routes should be singular to ""provide a challang for the player,"" it gets frustrating. "

												After completing the game almost to 100%, I would say it seems solid, besides the constant ctd's. Turns out it is not very stable with many fps overlay programs. Thats ok, i can play with them off.Visuals are up to par, if not better than AC1, graphic textures look sharp in most areas, sometimes noticably tiled,  but it seems to run very smooth fully maxed out at 1080p.  The voice acting is average, a lot of times off-sync, some alright accents, music seems to mix well in most areas. Story does not relate much to the other games but without spoling much, it ties in a slight bit into AC3, I feel also in more ways than the obvious but also visiting a similar setting in the Mayan ruins, and time-frame.  The basic gameplay mechanics are the same as the previous titles, run climb jump work pretty good. Fighting and blocking is almost the same as in AC3. You get a good assortion of weapons and gadgets, and many brutal kill-scenes. Please take into consideration this is still a port of a PSP game, even so, it still feels very much like a normal assassins creed game. It includes plenty of side missions, collectables, trade import and export, treasures, character outfits per persona, notiroity system, stealing, stealth, eagle vision, open world, various open environments, viewpoints, its almost all there. Some cut-scenes could have felt much more epic and grand with a replaced soundtracks, better lipsynch and voice acting, but hey, i got this on sale for $5. There's really not much to complain for the amount of content at that price. The dlc was worth it as well, it contains some good weapons. Was it worth the $5? Hell yeah, 10$? Yeah why not. Do i recommend it? If you are a fan of the series and have been following, yes. It should take you a good 18 to 20 hours to complete, i idled a lot but I found the city of New Orleans to be nicely detailed and fun to explore, like many AC players, i spent a lot of time reading DNA entries and comparing them to the real life counter parts and googling alot of names, I think thats my favorite part of this series!

												I guess it's a good thing that the developers finally realised that walking around all in white and red wearing the insignia of your top secret assassin order as a giant belt buckle was not the stealthiest way to go about things. But you have to change clothes so many times that the game feels like little more than a Barbie dress up game. It's like the game doesn't just involve changing clothes as a mechanic, that's what the game is about.The dialogues are awful, the flirting dialogues doubly so, I wonder if whoever wrote them has actually ever flirted with someone because it feels like they learned about it from a children's cartoon. Also somehow just because the character's female everyone's willing to spill up their secrets after being flirted with for two and a half seconds.The slave outfit looks too stylish, she looks more like a hippie college pagan than a slave when all the real slaves are in actual tattered rags. It's just the entire point of the slave outfit is that she gets to blend in, which she doesn't. So really it's back to AC2 where we would pretend that a guy in full assassin uniform surrounded by four escorts was ""blending"".It's almost impossible to kill the alligators, I don't know if it's because the game was ported and the controls aren't responding quickly enough but it's just really difficult to perform a randomly assigned combination of keys every time, in the speed that the keys show up on the screen.""Restart checkpoint"" doesn't exist and is sorely missed.The ""lady persona"" can swim when she falls into water (in a dress that looks like it would get VERY heavy when soaked) but she can't climb back up. Climbing buildings is one thing, but she can't even hoist herself out of the water. It would be more realistic if some of the people watching came to her rescue or something at least.Your notoriety increases for no reason at all, and it's a hassle to walk around the map chasing posters to tear down.I did like the design of the memory corridor/loading screen. I also like how fast and fluid the parkour is. The wetlands were cool even though I prefer city parkour.			"

												I love Assassin's Creed games, but had my doubts about this game. I never really heard about it and didn't know it was a FULL game. It has surpased my expectations... There are a few buggy parts, but nothing that has stopped me from playing.I love the option to switch your female character's wardrobe to complete certain missions. If you plan on getting 100% it might take you a while. There is a lot to do in this game.			"

You get thrown into some swamp wich i really want to love! But i just can't. It's so boring. New Orleans is very small. And i just quit playing because i just didn't want to play anymore.

												The controls on the game can be very clunky and cause you to play several parts over and over until you get it right, can be frustrating. The game just isnt up to par with the other Creed games. The graphics here are superub though, better than Black Flag. THere are some sound gliches but the game is quite stable and never crashed once on me.Overall I got about 16 hours play out of this game. I think if you are a big Assasin's Creed fan like I have become then you should probably pick this up if it is cheap, but you dont miss a lot if you skip it.The story is ok and the voice acting is quite good here.

												The recommend I have is if you've played most other Assassin games at this point, as the 60-70% rating Liberation has from many rating sites is fair in my opinion. The graphics are 'HD' in that they are better than when they were on the hand-held playstation vita, however the improvement simply appears to have been to smooth out the game so it doesn't look blocky with a larger screen size. I'd put the graphics some where around assassin creed 1 and 2, which you can see in the one and only mission involving Connor from Assassin Creed 3, where you can clearly see the lower graphics on him. The positives is that it has the same satisfactoy Assassin combat, but is missing in-game conviences such as the lack of maps within certain areas, and the absences of purchasable collectaible items. Overall as said it has earned a 60-70% rating simply for the fact that it is an Assassin game and the price helps makes up for its short comings, so go in expecting not everything to have the polish or touch of detail you'd expect in main platform Assassin Games.

												In all honesty, this game doesn't deserve its somewhat bad ratings. It's a good game, and I got plenty of fun out of it. It was much better optimized than ACIII, and I liked the female assassin. In that aspect, the view was a lot nicer, hehehe. The only parts of the game I really didn't care for was the 1/3 of the game where you're swimming in bogue water, and the lacking ""Brotherhood"" (a similar problem to ACIII. I miss the days of Ezio leading a team of assassins, but at least AC4 eventually made up for it with the ability to command an armada of ships flying the Assassin Black Flag). Otherwise, the story was good, the setting seemed authentic, and yeh.  The Connor crossover was cool too, even if he isn't my favorite assassin -- as I've said before, I would've rather kept playing as Haythem in ACIII, but I guess it was a good underdog story.    Also, the whip was a pretty cool new weapon, and really fit the whole antislavery dealio.  In summary, it was a good game, worth the $6. Would I spend $20 on it? Probably not. But nonetheless, it's a much welcomed addition to the AC franchise, in my eyes.			"

												NOTE: expect the usual AC-Ubisoft BS, if you can't handle that, DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAMEGame Mechanics:It's an Assassin's Creed game, it's got every game mechanics you've gotten used to in the previous ones. It does add a little variety by allowing you to switch between 3 different personas (with no real use except for persona-specific missions and collectibles), each with a slightly tweaked playstyle. On top of that it adds the exotic, game-breaking sport of land swimming; the comic relief of twitchy corpse physics; the inscrutable delights of broken cinematics; disappearing character models; the rushing sensation fo falling through the world; inescapable canoes; the return of jerky and wonky tree-based freerunning; and instant-death, nearly-impossible to predict alligator attacks in the water.Plot:The plot is pretty decent, mostly because I tend to forget what the hell is actually going on after doing all the available side stuff (which for some reason doesn't always register for your achievements by the way). There's a half-decent twist at the end, so long as you don't read the massive spoiler you get by reading the redacted Database entries after doing some Citizen E-missions (seriously, didn't ANYONE catch that during development?).Presentation:I've fallen through the world only once, but regularly found myself climbing vertically up 45 degree angle slopes; seen people move in an escalator-like trajectory through thin air; witnessed rats scurry off several meters above the water as if they had mini-jetpacks; had to restart the game a couple of times because my character decided it was still swimming, even though I'd left the water for 30 seconds; so yeah, it's usual Assassin's Creed Ubisoft ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Disregarding that most of the alternate outfits are just recolours, though the unlockable Assassin costume is pretty cool (but completely wrecks any and all cut-scenes in which you wear it).Completion:The completion is pretty alright for this game, just collect the McGuffins (mushrooms, coins, brooches, voodoo dolls and more!) and follow the set guidelines for full synch. Then if you're lucky maybe the game won't bug out (like it did for me when clearing out the enemy camps in the bayou) or fail to register the missions you've done (like my Free Slaves and Ship Crew ones).

												This is a short AC game (For me, it took about 18 hours). That said, what it does is done well. For people who've played other AC games:It is much more stealth focused than the other AC games and has less attention towards combat. This is largely done through the persona system, essentially three identities to build and reduce notoriety on. While recruitment of assassins is done away with, I personally didn't notice the absence of it. The engine feels like that of AC:3, allowing for climbing of trees and less micromanagement. However, on PC it runs much better. Honestly, I feel like this is the kind of game that the creators of AC:3 wanted to make, but failed to produce. The fast travel is limited, with single-destination portals at the edges of the map, to the three locations in the game: the bayou, New Orleans, and Chichen Itza. As always, there are collectibles and side-quests, although the side-quests are slightly lacking. There is little coverage of the ""present-day"" story.For everyoneThe narrative was well done. There's a good connection between the mechanics and the story. AC:Liberation goes over topics like racism and slavery, and the roles of women in the 18th century, but not overtly. None of the characters feel like charicatures or two-dimensional. It's a decent introduction to the AC genre, but I'd definitely reccommend AC:2 or AC:4 over this for that purpose.			"

												 Well, this is obviously outter story of the series but even for that I can only say, ""Huh?!?!"" However I wanted to finish it so I'm going to put my thumbs up. +) Loot is as fast as III. +) Loot amount gives the looting actual meaning. +) Before III there were this thing called renovating. It was one of the content in Assassin's Creed that I liked. Here it has come back in a much more light form. Shame it's also ineffective than before but I still enjoyed it. +) Treasure boxes were easy to find and they were very effective means of looting. Not like Revelations and III. There chests became a joke, especially III. +) Bribe system was incredibly developed. One bribe would solve the notoriety problem. You just need to pay more as your gage goes high. +) No severe twitches. I could see tiny twitches here and there sometimes but I wouldn't mind. This one is obviously off series kind of game so I can relate to some tiny tiny little technical issues. +) Shopping became effective just like previous series, series before III. They also added good motion that came from III: going into the shop. Here you go into the shop and then the shop menu just pops up. YOu don't need to go in and then wait for the shop to load and then walk towards the owner and interact with him and wait for the menu. +-) Much more effective parkour until you start this race mission. Then it gets back to irritting parkour that makes you speak out vulgar languages that you never thought you would. This horrible game making made me spit this horrible H word to Aveline, the character taht I play! I hate the person who created this race mission and all those agitating moments that follows afterwards. +-) Battle was smooth and thrilling. It actually made you feel like you're playing a character that has gotten this special training of Assassin but only until this race quest. After that the battles become frustrating and all. Enemies block almost every single attack you give them, even space and counters, they don't die easily all of a sudden as well. It was so irritating. +-) It was powerfully story focused but ever since that richid racing quest everything started to fall apart. The story also got really screwd up. It didn't make any sense and it was idiotic. Characters were shallow as well. +-) They didn't put too much side quests which was there major problem since they butchered the main story because of that: stupid, but they still messed up the main quest story so back to square -1. +-) When you wonder too long it shows you tutorial to solve that place but not when it's really needed. There is this one side quest where what you need to find is out of the search area. It was really irritating since it made me waste quite some time for just a side quest. -) Leg tripping still didn't work properly. There were times in which I had to trip enemies twice in order to make them fall down. -) The most horrible part of this game was the personality of men. I mean what kind of men have you met in your life? Is it just that you hate men? It was so disturbing to see every men in this character act weaker and smaller than women. Not just in the outside but inside as well. This was just insulting. F*ck you. Seriously. You deserve it. "
