												This is a wonderful game. This was my first game I ever owned back when I was a child, so I have a nostalgic bias. To the review; this game from the get-go is aesthetically 200% better. It looks like any indie FPS you can buy nowadays minus a tutorial and immediate plot. I put countless hours into this game as a child and never beat it. That was back before there was internet walkthroughs and developers who thought that you (the gamer) barely passed the second grade. I recommend this game to anyone who wants an relaxing, in-depth story told to them through puzzles, journal entries, and a non-hostile environment. Good things to say about this game:-Beautiful-Flashlight feature is helpful-Easy conversion from classic point-'n'-click to real-time first person.-Story remains intact if not more immerse-More brainpower and problem-solving required than any game on the modern marketBad things to say about this game:-Suffers from massive framerate drops in real time first person. I drop from 60+ FPS to around 15-20 frequently; it's not a hardware issue either, it's a frame cap. -First person controls are different and take some getting use to (Letting off WASD brings up a cursor)-Not a casual adventure game; requires hours upon hours to reveal the entire story, get through each puzzle (if you're new to the game), and navigate each area. This is a time-consuming masterpiece. Mozart is to the Classical genre of music, as Myst is to Adventure games. Very few games deserve such artistic praise, this ranks number 1 on my list.			"

												As I've read the other reviews of this game, I've noticed that this is a ""nostalgia game"" for most people. I, however, have just played it for the first time (RealMyst Masterpiece, not the original). It has a lot of good points, but I gotta tell ya, there were some major gameplay issues that had me tearing my hair out at times. I'm sure some of that comes from trying to optimize an old game for new systems, but I was hoping for better. Still, I really enjoyed it and I'm glad I played it.GOOD POINTS (as determined by a newbie to the series):- Like everyone else has said, it's visually beautiful and imaginative.- Soundtrack is lovely and very atmospheric.- It was nice to know through the in-game ""Hints"" menu (which, yes, I had to check, for reasons described below) that this was a non-hostile environment! No waiting for something evil to jump out at me from the shadows, even though there are a few ominous things to see/hear. But nothing explicit - still family-friendly, I would say.- The puzzles are truly creative, and that kept me interested. Every Age has a specific ""theme"" or ""conceit"" for how its puzzles work, but knowing the ""theme"" don't make 'em easy! As someone who grew up playing online Flash room escape games (and some point-and-click adventure games like The Neverhood), I was really impressed with the varied methods you had to use to solve them. Pro tip: don't try playing with the sound off. Ask me how I found that out. (Plus you'll miss the music and audio messages!)- The story (which is why I play games) was tantalizing and left me wanting more.- Having 2 options for navigation controls was handy.- The day/night cycles for each age were cool and added to the immersive aspect.- The flashlight was a HUGE help! I mean, you could probably get by without it,  but I found it indispensable. I hate not knowing if I'm missing something because I'm in a dark area!- The live acting wasn't half bad.- Unfortunately, after finishing it, there isn't really anything ""to do"" in the different Ages, but I liked that you're able to go back and explore more if you want.THINGS I DISLIKED:- Oh. My. Gosh. The ""clicking"" mechanics absolutely drove me UP THE WALL! I usually had to click on a certain supposed-to-be-clickable area in 20 different places before it would work. And the ""sweet spots,"" when I finally found them, were inconsistent.- The other ""clicking"" problem was that I frequently would stop being able to click on anything all of a sudden. I'd try to click a button that I'd pressed a hundred times and nothing would happen, and then I'd discover I couldn't click anything else either (though the game didn't freeze). I usually had to reload a save, which was frustrating, although on rare occasions the problem went away after I visited the game menu and waited a few minutes. Still, VERY exasperating. I was never able to tell, the first time I tried to click on a new object, if it was truly clickable or if I was having another glitch. I had to resort to the Hints frequently just because of that.- Sometimes I would get ""stuck"" navigationally: I wouldn't be able to leave/move away from a particular position or vantage point, though there was nothing obstructing me. Sometimes I could fix it by reloading, but sometimes I had to work my way back from an earlier save :/ I particularly had this problem while facing the battery in the Stoneship Age and while facing the ceiling above the elevator in the Mechanical Age.- The game did crash on me - once, I think.- There are certain times when you're supposed to be able to hear an audio message, but the music never muted or decreased its volume, so I could rarely hear what was said. I had to look up the transcripts online. Subtitles would've been a huge help.- I had an issue with the red/blue pages where I could collect them both in each Age, but could only give away the one that I had collected last. This meant that I didn't get to hear some of the audio messages from the brothers.- You kind of have to do the Selenitic Age first, though the game doesn't require you to (and I didn't). Certain puzzles in other Ages are extremely hard to beat without having been introduced to a particular puzzle from the Selenitic.- Having only five available save-game slots was annoying to someone who's used to infinite saves :D Also, some of the saves actually took me back a little ways before where the save-point actually was - I couldn't really save while a puzzle was in progress.In short, it's a great game, and it's fun to get to experience the great-granddaddy of all the point-and-click games I grew up with. That said, you definitely need to approach it with the knowledge that it's still an old game, despite its remastering. It has plenty of major bugs, but it's still good. I liked it enough that if they remade Riven and etc. I'd probably play them.			"

												A beautiful recreation of a timeless classic, realMyst: Masterpiece Edition brings a piece of gaming history to modern times.  While the graphics and sounds are completely revamped to match modern-day standards, the gameplay stays true to its original and does not fail to deliver the nostalgic Myst-feeling.It is, admittingly, a rather peculiar game, a slow paced and thoughtful puzzler in a surrealistic setting. Its puzzles can be overwhelming at times, especially for those unfamiliar with the genre, but they always have a logical (sometimes surprisingly straightforward) solution that makes you feel really smart if you solve them on your own. But even for those non-hardcore adventure gamers among you, the game offers a built in (optional) hint system that gives you little advices without spoiling too much. There are only few negative points that should be mentioned; The controls and movement feel a bit wonky at times and you might occasionally get stuck on objects on the ground (nothing game-breaking though), however Cyan is working on a fix for that at the point of this review. The in-game cinematics still have the low resolution from previous renditions of Myst, which seems a bit out of place considering the otherwise beautiful graphics. And the missing inventory (you can only pick up and carry one item at a time) is a rather annoying remnant from the original Myst game, often requiring an unnecessary amount of backtracking.In summary, realMyst: Masterpiece Edition is a game that wants you to immerse yourself, absorb the scenery and use your logical thinking. If you are a fan of the Myst series to begin with, this is almost a must-have, but any other adventure fan might take a look at this as well, to get a chance to enjoy a game that wrote history in a new and stunning visual design.

												RealMyst was a great step forward in rendering the world of Myst, using an early version of the engine later put to work in Uru and Myst 5. It was rough around the edges, the view distance was a little short, but it maintained Myst's atmosphere, and gave you the bonus of being fully present in the world.RealMyst Masterpiece is not that. This is a port to the Unity engine, along with all the baggage of modern graphical realism. Bloom, motion blur, specular textures, all the things that make games look ""real"", utterly fail in this edition. The architecture of Myst no longer has that surreal appeal in the original slideshow or Plasma engine versions, but rather a horrible out of place look. There are points in RealMyst Masterpiece where iconic structures look like the worst examples of bad-CGI-inserted-into-live-action-film you can imagine. Gone is the sense that this is a real place you can let your brain fill in the blanks for; instead Unity brings all the trappings of photorealism, and ruins the look entirely. The remaining prerendered videos (the red/blue/green books, Atrus) are the same as they were in RealMyst, and their encoding artifacts stick out even more under Unity's shiny patina.Pick up the original RealMyst, it still works fine on modern OSes. Support Cyan by purchasing Myst, or Riven, or Uru, or donate to Myst Online, or throw your hat in for Obduction. But don't let them feel this slapdash engine port was a good idea.			"

												Pretty true to the classic Myst as best as I can remember, though it has been long enough I had to resolve much of the puzzles.  The 3D work in the 'common' areas is really nice, but in other areas it feels very crude.  For example the ending of the maze, you can see the textures tiling as you go by.  Same on the fortress.  They also did not remake the videos, especially the 'bad' endings.A bit choppy on max settings with a very strong gaming machine.  Definitely not warranted for the quality being rendered, but it didn't really affect the gameplay.  Effects that seem to be from the engine (ie. water/lava) look really good.I played it through and only had a single crash while alt tabbing to check e-mail.  The 3D controls were pretty good, if a bit awkward at first.  Going up and down a spiral staircase in a certain realm was actually rather odd.  Moving around in 3D does, imho, make the game easier as things are much easier to find and figure out than in the traditional navigation.I also found a typo in one of the journals.  The journals are worth reading, as a kid playing the game I didn't really read for the story, just the clues and missed the whole plot and meaning of the red/blue books.The 'final' realm is also a bit dependent on your audible skills.  I am a bit tone deaf, which made that realm a challenge.  *You definitely need sound to finish that portion of the game.*Overall, having had played the original Myst many years (decades?) ago, this was an enjoyable second play through.

												Vanilla Myst had two major issues, and with this game one of them has been fixed.The first issue is the nature of the puzzles themselves. Although they are deliciously challenging at times, there is quite a bit of 'find solution, write down solution, walk across map, apply solution'. This will never be fixed, but it certainly doesn't make the game anything less than spectacular.The other issue, and by far the most severe issue, was how old the damn game was. Assuming you could even get it to start, you had to find a legacy version of Quicktime and were playing the game in 320x240 which some monitors don't even support anymore. A side effect of it's age was the graphics quality being garbage. Usually I can overlook graphics in a well-crafted game, but when a game relies so heavily on immersion and observation, and is prerendered with zero fluidity of movement, having visuals as poor as Myst's simply detracts from the overall experience.It is for these two reasons that I had trouble getting people into the Myst series. Riven, which is quite possibly the greatest game of all time, relies on players having experienced Myst's universe and story. So you were left with two choices: Wrestle Myst into submission and persuade yourself to beat it, where the only redeeming factor at this point is it's imperfect puzzles, or play the also-ugly and also-buggy realMyst.With the release of realMyst Masterpiece, I can finally say that Myst is fixed. While the graphics aren't quite perfect, and there are still a few cosmetic bugs, and the puzzles are the same puzzles as ever, I feel like this game actually deserves to be Riven's prequel.In short, there is no longer any reason why you should not play through realMyst Masterpiece and then play Riven.

												My Dad introduced me to this game when I asked him what games he used to play. We got Myst so I could experience it the way he did but it crashed whenever we solved the clock tower puzzle to get to the Mechanical Age, so we got this. We have completed all but the Channelwood Age and I have to say, I'm really impressed with it. It's not the most well optimized game, but it runs fine most of the time. (Seriously, it looks good not amazing. I can run Shadow of Mordor on high and this lags. What?) I still can't it was done by 2 guys. The atmosphere is surreal and the music, oh my god, the music. The puzzles are really clever and most of them are difficult, but solveable. (I say most. I'm looking at you Spaceship Piano). The answers are usually in plain sight, you just have to explore and have the thinking capacity to connect two seemingly unrelated things. I also like how each age has a 'theme'. The flashlight was a godsend, as you may as well be blind during the night. You can't see ANYTHING at night time, so that helped a lot. Overall, a solid 8.5/10.			"

												This is a very good remake so far. It took all the good things from RealMyst and Myst and combined the two.I love the fact that they added not only the classic movement mode, but that it actually moves for you, rather than flashing the screen and showing the next image like in the original. Very nice touch.I never got into realMyst in order to see the additional content, so I'm glad that they made it worth exploring all over again in order to get to the new content.The textures are also much, much better than in realMyst. I was almost expecting something similar with only some compatibility tweaks here and there.Pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth picking up!			"

												realMyst is a very simple yet sometimes complex puzzle game that was made back when home computers were just starting to find their way into households. In other words, don't expect there to be a huge amount amount of gameplay here. If you buckle down, you can beat this game in one sitting. That's not to say that there's no challenge to it as there certainly can be at times.For the most part, you're playing to find out about the unfolding story. This game used to be a point and click adventure. It seems to have upgraded to being a free roam First-Person which can ultimately betray any new comers to the game leading you to believe there's more to the puzzle than what there really is. You can now roam in unchecked corners and behind bookshelves which you could never do in the first place so if you're stumped on a puzzle, it's best not to start checking every nook and cranny. To be safe, they've added a feature so that you can use the point and click system which at times can be pretty difficult to use since there's multiple things to click on so you have to be pretty precise about what you want to inspect.The puzzles themselves aren't terribly difficult although a couple of times I will admit I was so stumped I had to use the hint system and in those cases, I feel that you have to have had accidentally stumbled upon the answer rather than using your own intellect as there is no clue to how that could've been solved. Also there seems to be a number of objects you can interact with that add no value to the gameplay or story itself. I have to imagine these were added in simply for the novelty back then but today, they're unnecessary and merely serve to distract.The story tries its best to layout a path for you to follow, but it doesn't seem to matter in the end which order you decide to do the levels in just so long as you bring back something important from each level. In the end, the story sort of leaves you hanging. It has a resolve, but leaves you with ""come back for the sequel if you want the whole story."" Not to mention a lot of the writing within the game details a lot more history to the Island, yet none of those elements are anywhere to be found or mentioned ever again and it's hard to imagine everything that's being described happening in such a small place since the levels themselves are fairly small with not a lot of scenery to back up the writings.This game definitely has it's own charm though and I would recommend it. It's pretty unique and as long as you can get past the first couple puzzles, you'll probably have no problem finishing the game. Except the tram part. That part sucks.			"

												There have been many versions of Myst over the years, but this is truly the best. Myst Island has never looked so beautiful before, full of more lush vegetation and gorgeous water. The heights on Channelwood, the eerie blasted landscape of Selenitic, are beautifully rendered in the new engine. I've spent time just walking around admiring the improvements in some of my favorite video game locations of all time.The puzzles all have an internal logic, focused on you understand what the environment is telling you. The key to solving the puzzles of Myst is to remember that everything on the island and Ages were created and reshaped by people, and the traces of their presence they leave behind gives insights to their past actions, their outlook on the world, and what they might yet do. What someone displays in their room is important, as is what they conceal and how they do so. The story is meant to be uncovered via exploration and careful reading, of putting together what it means that a symbol from one Age is repeated in a more sinister context elsewhere. Only by this understanding can you make your decision about who to trust.			"

												As a kid (we're talking around 5 or 6) I remember playing the original Myst for Windows 3.1/95 and being two things:1. I was terrified that at any second I was going to be attacked by some unknown foe.2. I was absolutely enthralled with how good the game was.Now, I didn't beat the game until I was probably 9 or 10 because it was difficult at that age, but ever since then I've revisited it from time to time. I've played the original, Masterpiece Edition, and now realMyst: ME. I love that it now runs properly on Windows 8 and it fills my screen. As others have said I was surprised at how choppy the graphics are, but I'd say they've done a very good job updating the original graphics while still  very much feeling like Myst. I wish they could have remastered the sound a bit better, as that alone was one of the best parts of Myst.All in all, I'm happy I bought it, but then I've played every game in the series. If you weren't a huge fan of the original, then it's probably not for you, but if you somehow have never played Myst, this is a must-buy, as you can't call yourself a gamer if you've never played (and beaten it without guides!) Myst.			"

												Unlike regular realMyst, this version actually works on modern machines. Noting this is the primary reason for my ""review.""Overall, this version seems to be faithful to the original, quite attractive, and definitely worth it for anyone who has ""the itch"" but doesn't have any version besides the original. There's an inexplicable lack of rebindable hotkeys and the anti-aliasing isn't the best, but for the most part the rough edges contribute to the ""old school"" feel. Fair warning, though: there are also a few dumb glitches, particularly with the ""free roam"" mode. None are show-stoppers, and they seem to be the sort of thing you need a certain number of unique testers to catch. For example, an elevator in the tree age reset after loading a save wherein I was on the second level of platforms. I was able to safely fall through the hole where the elevator should have been, and the game ""snapped"" me onto the platform without incident. More immersion-breaking than problematic.			"

												And so we have another edition of the best-selling game of the 90s. I must say I like the fact that 20 years after initial release of Myst, we can play it again as a new, fresh game (kind of). But can we call it a good, modern game, up to today's standards? Let's find out.Notably, realMyst from 2004 got rather low ratings, so let's also compare the Masterpiece Edition with its predecessor.When you look at the Myst Island, first impression is very good. Textures have been updated. Water looks great, which makes for amazing landscapes, not only on Myst. When you go into other Ages, however, they seem much less polished.Probably the worst thing are in-game videos, which are very low-res (they are just the old ones). Models are also dated, prepare to see lots of simple polyhedrons - probably that's why the game's description only mentiones updated textures. But, well, you'll also find low-res textures.All that is to say - realMyst: ME is still an old, refreshed game, not a completely new one. It doesn't look bad, I enjoyed the views, but don't expect miracles. Also, lack of edge smoothing is disturbing.I dare to say, there are no new games like Myst. People spent a lot of time here, trying to figure out how stuff works. It could be fascinating in the 90s to explore the Ages for months (I wish I was playing back then). Nowadays people just want quick gameplays. Frustration could be a source of realMyst's low ratings.In this edition, some puzzles got much easier. Hard to say if it's good - they say almost nobody completed the original Myst. So maybe now people will have a chance. (Wish I didn't look at spoilers so early playing Myst for the first time, duh!) For those who know the game well (spoiler alert):Scheme showing how to turn fortress in Mechanical is now in the journal on Myst. Receivers in Selenitic are much easier to set now, and they only have to be set roughly.Finally, what stands between us and the Myst Ages: the interface. People were saying that realMyst's 3D environment made stuff just more annyoing. The solution came in this edition - we can now choose Free Roam mode, or classic point-and-click. I must say, clicking to walk in 3D is annoying for me, so I went free. Controls are not perfect, but I got used to them after a while.Overally, realMyst: Masterpiece Edition is not a miracle, but definitely worth playing. If you don't know Myst yet, this edition is great for finding out what's so special about the old bestseller. If you've already been there, this visit will certainly be great.And if such a game would be released now as a new title, without its predecessors... Nah, that couldn't happen. Nobody makes such games nowadays. Maybe that's why I love Myst so much.			"

												realMyst: Masterpiece Edition is a complete overhaul of the original Myst game from 1993, porting it to a modern 3D engine that allows for free-exploration as opposed to clicking on still, 2D images. It's actually done suprisingly well and stays true to the original through-out, even including the original scenes that had used real actors. I did find the performance a little choppy in some sections but never to a point where the game was unplayable. The new graphics engine brings a new life to Myst, while my elitist self prefers the original, this looks absolutely amazing and they pretty much nailed the aesthetics of the original re-imagined in 3D.Myst is the first entry into the series and gave birth to one of the most incredible puzzle/adventure games of all time, it has some really clever puzzles that will tap into parts of your brain that are covered with cobwebs and will force you to think not 'outside the box' but 'without the box'. The plot is one extremely immersive trip that you have to uncover yourself and there are a few Myst novels that go into it with a lot more detail.Myst starts you off glaring at a book with a moving image of an island which sends you to the island, Myst, upon interaction with it and thats where this mind numbingly fascinating adventure begins. You soon discover that there are two books placed in a library and with exploration and interactions you discover that there are two people trapped inside them, one within each book. You'll need to collect pages of the two books to free them, which are scattered around the 'Ages' (different worlds within the game) and you'll need to solve a series of complicated, yet extremely logical puzzles to progress through these diverse and unique worlds in order to find the pages and uncover more of the plot.Myst features some amazingly designed puzzles, you'll need to write down notes, memorize figures, find clues and memorize sounds to solve them, the levels are abstract and beautiful, each completely different from the last and you'll be able to explore and solve puzzles in which ever order of world you please. This is trully an amazing adventure which has been brought back from obscurity by Cyan and would recommend anyone interested in puzzle games or interested in trying something different to invest in it.

												I'm so disappointed in this rework that I could cry. I am super sad about this.The textures are flat, the lighting is stark. The original sounds are pumped jarringly straight into your ears with no remastering, mixing, or accounting for environmental effects. The pages on the books you read are razor-edged polygons, when these books are supposed to be old and weathered and dog-eared. The models are low-poly and the bump-maps are just the original textures made black and white. The screws on the marker switches are warped and shiny blobs. Textures collide and intersect as they hit seams. The pillars in the library are models with repeating textures on them—with no wear on the corners, no dust, no visible seam! They are sterile and stock-photo perfect. Not a single moment has been spent trying to make the environment textures match the models they're on.I don't know what to think. This is heartbreaking.Please, if anyone from the realMyst team reads this, I'm a highly competent artist, as well as an amateur sound designer. Please let me help you.			"

												Disclaimer:  I definitely have a nostalgia bias when playing this game.Played the original on PC when it came out, and loved it.  This game is beautifully redone and ran smoothly on my laptop.  Once you know what do do, most of the puzzles come easy enough.  The main reason I enjoy this game so much is getting into the back story and lore of the entire Myst series.  The sequel (Riven) is my favorite game in the series, but I always enjoy going back to where the story begins.Side note:  If you enjoy the story as much as I do, I highly recommend the novelizations that can reveal even more of the wonderfully detailed world that is the Myst series.

												Myst is pretty much the definition of a classic point-and-click game, and to an extent not much really needs to be said about it. It's the sort of game that just drops you into a strange new world without any explanation, and lets you figure out how its various mechanisms work on your own. This version is an enhanced version of the original realMyst, which itself was a 3D remake of the original Myst, allowing you to walk around like a standard first-person game instead of being locked into the usual 360 swivel-cam. The Masterpiece edition greatly improves the graphics, but at the expense of having pretty strange performance; despite my GTX 970 and overclocked i5, I barely managed 30 fps when the preset was set to Very High, but when setting the preset to Medium High (turning it to anything lower than that decreases the mouse speed, for some reason) and turning on all of the settings in the Advanced options it ran at around 70 to 100+ depending on the area. The ability to move freely increases immersion, but also makes the puzzles a bit more difficult in my opinion by making it less obvious what you can and can't interact with, which is further increased by the better graphics of this version, but I consider that to be more of a plus. realMyst might not be the version of the game that the original developer prefers, but it's the one I'd rather play.

												Hmmmm The Blue pages or the Red Pages That is the Question.Well What does realMyst: Masterpiece Edition have to offer. The masterpiece edition does a great job of upgrading the textured Quality and the lighting effect of Myst. The masterpiece edition also Features the First person Gameplay Mode (From the Original realMyst) and for the purist the point click Gameplay (From the Original Myst: Masterpiece Edition) is there has well.Now Were in 2015 the game was originally released in 1993 (21 year ago)The realQuestion is should you play realMyst: Masterpiece Edition? The Answer is Hell Yes you should !!!!!!!!!!!!Whether you have never played Myst before or you have this nostalgic hich, then it's a great way of revisiting the 1993 Masterpiece in its full gloryVerdict: 9.8/10 Unforgettable realMasterpieceIt's a brilliantly crafted Atmospherique Puzzler that still passes the test of time and should not be Myst			"

												Yes, it's beautiful, but the controls and sound settings make the price of this game unforgivable.There are no subtitles. There's no option to lower the music whilst maintaining dialogue/ambient sounds. If it weren't for previous knowledge of the game and the internet, this version would be almost unplayable unless you held industrial sized speakers next to your ears in the hope that you would manage to catch a word or two of dialogue over the immense sound of the background music...If I'm completely off here, or I'm doing something wrong, please tell me. It'd be a huge help. For the moment, I can NOT recommend this game for the sale price of €10~, let alone the retail price of €15~			"

												This is a cautious recommendation from someone who grew up with Myst. A lot of this will be similar to a review for realMyst's original release.This is just as awkward to control as realMyst was, and having to move the mouse to slide a Marker Switch up and down or move the flow controls in Channelwood from side to side is not an easy experience if you are using free movement.This game uses the same movie files from realMyst (the brothers' library videos are the same as the original release, other videos are newer and less-well-acted). Myst: Masterpiece Edition runs like garbage on modern systems--if it runs at all--but at least when you play that you believe that Atrus believes what he's saying and isn't just reciting old dialogue.Having the original gameplay images for Myst pop up when you press Shift (while not using free movement) is a nice touch, though if you are running this on a modern resolution you'll barely be able to see the images in the center of your screen.The sound is as great as it ever was, although just like with realMyst, this version of the game does not completely mute the music at appropriate times (as in the fore-chamber).The music itself is not changed from classic Myst and that's a huge point in this release's favor.I guess there's a flashlight now but having just finished the game I never used it. Not sure what the point of it is unless you're too lazy to turn the crank on the battery in Stoneship. I can't think of any other locations that are very dark and also have something worth seeing. I don't even know what button it is bound to. Probably F.At the end of the day, this is still Myst, and one of the first games to tell a deep story purely by observations of one's environment (Gone Home also does this very well). Modern systems don't have many other ways to play other releases of Myst without jumping through compatibility hoops so having this on Steam is cool---BUT the original release is on iOS in untouched, fully compatible glory.If you own realMyst, this game is 12 bucks instead of 18. Maybe that will help sway you.			"

												I have been a Myst fan for almost ten years now - ever since I was a freshman in high school - and walking onto the Unity-created Myst Island in this re-remake of the remake of the original was just like coming home for me. My first thoughts upon first walking onto the new Myst Island in full 3D motion was a single word - ""Wow"". Granted, the graphics here aren't perfect either, and there's a lot of improvement that needs to be done - but from the original point-and-click classic to this is a huge leap forward. Simply breathtaking work has been done on this!On the game itself... Myst was considered the game that really cinched the idea of CD-ROM drives in computers. If it weren't for this classic game by Cyan (now Cyan Worlds), the concept of computer gaming might not have caught on as readily as it has. Myst sets the standard for point and click adventure puzzle games, and many of the puzzle adventure games we have today owe a great deal to it. It is a great puzzle game with tough challenges that will make you think in different ways, from spatial relations to simple addition, logical leaps to sound-based puzzles and even a maze or two. Despite its difficulty and brain-teasing nature, Myst greatly rewards exploration, not with pickups or special items, but with amazing graphical design and a relaxing atmosphere that makes the game ideal for playing as a way to unwind after a long, stressful day. I could literally watch the sun rise and set over Myst Island for hours, or listen to the frogsong in Channelwood for ages (pun not intended). The story is simple - a great wrong has happened in the family of a man named Atrus, and his two sons Sirrus and Achenar are the only sources you have on the issue. Atrus himself is AWOL, and the brothers refuse to speak to you unless you bring them pages for the books they are trapped in - and so begins the journey into a tale of intrigue, injustice, and a terrible secret...That said, this game is not for everyone. Those that are not fans of Hunt-The-Pixel puzzles or puzzle games in general will not find much to like here. Those who prefer action are not going to find it here. Those who have no interest in taking the time to apreciate the beauty of little details are not going to enjoy this game. But for those of you who like a good mental challenge, enjoy taking your time, and love puzzle games, this is a must-have. Seriously, every puzzle or point-and-click fan out there OWES it to themselves to obtain either this copy of the game or another copy of realMYST. Just start it up, put on some headphones, and immerse yourself in the beauty of the game's worlds. Newcomers to the series will find a lot to enjoy here - and old friends will find it a wonderful welcome back.			"

												If you were a fan of the original or a new comer, the latest patches have made realMyst: Masterpiece Edition a gem to play again.  One thing to note as of 6/14 the achievements still do not work from what I can tell.  Developer Cyan has stated that they are still in testing and will update further whe they are ready for general public.  The game has classic point and click controls as well as wasd/mouse first person controls.  I personally used the classic controls and instead of shifting panes like it used to do many years ago, now you get a nice walking simulation to the next area of interest. This walk movement simulation can also be scaled faster or slower.  In classic Myst fashion the game is extremely hard with puzzles that stretch across the environments. You have to use memory, sounds, and quickness to complete many puzzles in this fantastic setting.  If you are looking for a new challenge or haven't visited the original myst since the 90's you will be in for a treat with some of the toughest puzzles in any adventure game.			"

												To those of you who have not played Myst before: GET IT. It's an important piece of gaming history, and is a joy to explore. The plot isn't just handed to you - you have to find it, but it's more interesting that way. The music and visuals work well together to create an intriguing ambiance that makes you simply want to learn just what happened to these now-abandoned places.If you have played through it before, consider the following:All the puzzles are the same, the WASD controls can be a little weird at times, and Rime doesn't really add too much.However, it WORKS on modern operating systems, so you don't have to go through a huge rigamarole just to get it working in the first place. Consider the monetary value of your time and, if you don't consider the hassle of finding the proper old Windows emulator just another puzzle, you'll probably come out ahead to just buy this latest version.

												Games were simpler in 1993, and some times they made you think, without going for a game guide. Myst was one such example it was a first person adventure game in a time in which the big names used a third, and were relased on floppy disks. why did this and Journeyman project get the attention? they were as photorealistic as both the Mac and CGI could get on a game budget. so what is realMyst then? It added something that would get ignored untill the term ""Walking Simulator"" began getting used. free roaming players and the passage of time on the Main Age. So that just leasve us as to why this one has such a long title. this is not a straight port to new hard ware as realMyst was originally made in 2002. It is instead a reabuikld with better graphics, outside of the fmv actors, because the original vids are not the best recording hardware. Still is fun after 20+. Also when can Riven get the same tratment?			"

The puzzles aren't insanely hard in and of themselves; but rather: No one tells you 1) that you are looking for something, 2) how to operate that something and 3) whether what you just did had any effect at all.Especially that lack of positive and negative feedback drove me nuts and - even though it got better later on - I could not have played the game without the hint system.But the atmosphere and story really appealed to me in the strongest sense. I loved exploring the worlds and I am glad I was stubborn enough to play this all the way through.			"

It is so beautiful in its setting, visuals, and soundtrack.  The premise is intriguing, the exploration is marvelous with stunning environments.  It's a mesmerizing, alien world, I was absolutely enthralled while playing.  It can be annoying that the player can only hold one page at a time though.  An annoying synthetic limitation.Regarding performance, it actually does run better if you first set it to minimum settings and then to maximum or whatever it is you want to run.

But it's a nice bit of nostalgic gameplay (though it seems much easier than it did years ago!). I do think there needs to be an option to turn off the day-night cycles, I don't feel it adds too much, and the game wasn't really designed with it in mind, sometimes making it a bit hard to orientate oneself.

												Great game, a classic.  I first played back in 1995 on CD-ROM, but this newer version is much more immersive given todays graphics capabilities.The puzzles are still a challenge if you're not familiar with the game, and I mean that in a good way.  However, after playing Riven they can seem a bit tame in comparison.Runs great on Windows 10.  Windows 10 is actually more compatible with some classic games than Vista or 7 were.If you enjoy this, also check out Riven, Myst III, Myst IV, Myst V, and Obduction.  Obduciton is a new release by Rand Miller, one of the creators of Myst.  It's meant to be in the Myst spirt, but it's a whole new story, a different world, etc.			"

												I've always been anxious to begin playing any of the Myst games but my apprehension soon dissolved once I'd realised that Myst contains some of the most sensible and logical puzzles I'd ever experienced. There is no ""moon logic"" here and that's perfect. Like with Dark Souls, in a sense, if I'm not winning it's because I'm playing the wrong way and there's no point in trying to brute force my way through as I will never succeed. I'm immediately thrust into a position where the game will never hold my hand (apart from the hint system, which still goes so far as to not spoil each solution). It's quite refreshing to play something that just clicks and gives me those ""oh, of course!"" moments.My only grip with realMyst is that it was quite a short journey once I fell into the right mindset. The graphic overhaul also suffers from a sluggish framerate even though my PC can more than handle it. Full-screen mode is not respected, as the mouse cursor would often wander over to my second monitor and minimise the game. The free-roaming controls are unwieldy and can become unresponsive in certain areas.I hope to discover and play more modern games that take the same approach to puzzle solving as with realMyst.			"

												Oh god the nostalgia...the nostalgia man.Myst was one of the first games I ever played as a child.  It helped shape the future of adventure games, and became the definitive PC game of the early to mid '90s, only being outsold by the Sims as late as 2002.  Myst is a timeless tale of a mysterious island filled with books that transport you to new and fantastic locales.  Ever played a game where you point and click through different scenes?  Myst probably inspired it.It wasn't until the last few years or so before I realized just how much Myst really affected me as a gamer.  I believe that everyone's gamer identity is in part defined by the games you are first exposed to.  So it makes sense to me why I have such a love of atmosphere and immersion, because Myst had that in spades.  There's nothing quite like standing on the shores of the island, listening to the wind and the waves.The game is primarily puzzle based, and that's where most people take issue with Myst.  The puzzles are often complicated and convuluted.  This remake edition solves some of it, but there's still a lot of head scratching.  Myst operates by its own set of rules that you have to figure out as you go along.  The game doesn't have a tutorial, or a compass, or anything telling you where to go or what to do (although this edition comes with a hint guide in case you're truly lost).  It is really a game about exploration and discovery.  And believe me, solving a puzzle on your own is a fantastic sensation.realMyst: Masterpiece Edition may be a little pricey at nearly twenty bucks, but it all depends on your viewpoint.  For me, it was worth it.  For some just coming into the series, it might seem a little like price gouging.  But if you're interested, I highly recommend checking out this standout title from gaming's youth.  This new edition enhances the graphics and includes the free form movement from the original realMyst, making it (in my opinion) the definitive edition of Myst.  So whether you're just an old fan looking for a trip down nostalgia lane, or a new arrival, Myst welcomes you to an adventure of mystery.  Because, after all, perhaps the ending has not yet been written.EDIT: I neglected to mention in my original review that this version of the game is sometimes janky.  It's not optimized very well at times, which might just be due to the Unity engine itself, but I can't be sure.  In any case, it's something you should be aware of if you are thinking of buying it.  I never had slowdown so bad it made the game unplayable, but it did come close in the Selenitic age.  I still consider it the definitive modern edition of the game, but it is certainly not without its faults.			"

												The year was 1993. The CD-ROM format was expected to fail by analysts. There was no reason for most consumers to even purchase a CD-ROM Drive. Nearly every computer game was still being published and sold on floppy discs. Consumers NEVER had any files large than a few megabytes to store. Video on computers weren't really a thing. Nobody had digital camers or camcorders. There were no vast amounts of photos to store. Heck, the average hard drive at the time was smaller than a CD-ROM's 700 MB. Usually half that size. There were virtualy no reasons at all why a consumer would ever need a CD reader in their computer, unless they wanted to play music over their PC speakers. And who would want to do that? Most experts expected the CD-ROM to die as a format.And then Myst was released.Looking back at the original game, it looks primitive. It's barely anything more than a bunch of pictures you click through and interact with to solve puzzles. There were a few videos and the audio was ever present, but that was it.However, at the time, this was amazing. There weren't many games that offered a beautiful first person view like this. Even though the game consisted entirely of pre-rendered pictures, the game really made you feel like you were there. The developers were forced to create wonderful ambient sounds and a deep enthralling theme and story to really suck you in. The game was met by critical reception and acclaim.And it saved the CD-ROM format. After Myst, EVERYONE was releasing their game on CD. It was a truly successful game, even netting it it's own parody game in the form of Pyst, developed by Parrotty Interactive, starring John Goodman.The year was 1997.I was eight years old and my dad had purchase our first computer. I can still remember watching him play. He LOVED the game. I think he spent hours reading the in-game books, pouring over puzzles, and making notes in his little Myst notebook. I grew up playing the original Myst and all of it's remakes. However, it's been around 14 years since I last played the game.realMyst: Masterpiece Edition is an excellent modern interpretation of the original realMyst that was an excellent then-modern interpretation of the original Myst. Unfortunately the original realMyst lags horribly on Windows 7 and the other Myst remakes crash a lot, so this is your only bet.It's a beautiful game, with all of the original depth, originality, and puzzly goodness of the original Myst and realMyst. Except this games has Anisotropy! And grass!Truly, the graphics are stunningly beautiful, I can't say that enough. And the day/night cycle really makes the island feel more alive than it did before. Now, if they'd just patch in some weather effects.However, the optimization of the graphics and performance is a bit poor. My laptop is by no means a powerhorse, however I have no problem running Skyrim or GTA IV at medium graphics. realMyst ME doesn't do so well on my computer. Anything mid-range or higher causes my FPS to drop pretty quickly. However, the game is still beautiful and an improvement at the lower settings.The story to this game is basic, as it is a product of it's time. There was only so much room on CD-ROMs! Speaking of which, the game is also a bit short. Your hour will vary depending on how clever you are or if you've played Myst before. I, surprisingly, remembered a lot more than I thought I would and I finished the game shortly under ten hours. But your mileage really may vary. It takes a while to really learn what to do when starting out. You have to read the in-game books and really get inside your head a bit to figure it out. Don't rush in and give up on each puzzle after a minute if the solution isn't apparent. Think about what you've seen or read and see where it might fit into the world or on each level.This game is a classic and monstrously fun. If you enjoy it, make sure to look out for the Starry Expanse Project who are currently making realRiven, the sequel to Myst. Also, the original Riven is on Steam and doesn't seem to share the compatibility issues the other Myst titles do.Really, it's not a bad deal for the price, especially if you own the original realMyst, giving you the 33 % discount. Enjoy the game!			"

												My son and I played the original Myst game last night for about 4 hours. The last time he played this game was 20 years ago when he was only 13 years old. We both got hooked on the game and have played every subsequent game. I am really glad that Cyan is coming out with a new game next year (Obduction).The reason I am writing is to inform players of built-in controls that are not listed in the contol menus for ""Free Roam"" mode that will help make the game play much smoother. In general we found that free roam mode is much smoother and more pleasurable to watch than ""Classic Myst"" mode.* If you hold down the left mouse button when you move the mouse, only the hand cursor moves and not the player.* If you hold down the right mouse button when you move the mouse, then the player moves with it.* If you hold down the shift key when you move side to side or forward and backwards, then you will travel much faster and get to your destination much sooner (like the difference between walking and running).*If you have trouble maneuvering to a particular spot like we did last night when we tried to go down a ladder, switch to ""Classic Myst"" mode and let the automatic locator do it for you.We are running the game in the ""Max Quality"" setting and have very few lag problems. I do however have a beefy computer that I built for video editing:* Intel 6 core running at 4.6GHz* 32 GB Ram* EVGA 560GTX video card* Combination SSD and Hard drives			"

												RealMyst is an interesting beast; it exists partly as a proof of concept for later 3d Myst games, while also slightly furthering the details and connections between the earlier games. The traditional world building is all there, with the added flexibility of more recent full 3d games. It's perhaps the most accessible way to experience a classic game, while improving much of the rigidity of the original.The new visual improvements also help with replayability, though the atmosphere is still there from the original game the less detailed textures have been replaced by much more realistic ones and more environmental elements have been added to give a sense of immersion that the hyper card and quicktime event original could not achieve.For those that preferred the original click interaction, the game provides a way to setup the old style navigation. I personally liked free movement after years fo click through mavigation systems.			"

												MYST does not appear to work with windows 8.1, 64 bit systems.  The problems experienced are the following: 1: when in the cabin by the tree, match will not ignite the boiler whether or not the red control wheel is turned all the way to the right or anywhere in between.  2: After setting the power generators to 59, the two towere with the switches have the switches in the up position and will not transfer to the down position.  The rocketship door will not open.  3: A MYST book is available in the ship by the dock and transfers to the ship in the rock where the following issues occur: 1. Water drained from stateroom, but two map globes remain blurry and do not clear up.  The white paper in the dresser cannot be read.  2: water drained from the lighthouse, but key will not allow itself to be picked up and cannot open box in basement or  open loft in lighthouse lock.  3:when looking through the spyglass on vision is blurred and will not clear up.  These problems were reported to the MYST support group but after 4 days there was no response from them nor was there even an acknowledgement of problem received.  I recommend that if your pc is working with win 8.1 that you do not purchase this game because it will probably not work and you will lose your money.  bill82438@aol.com "

												Fall of 1993 saw the release of two video games that were as different as night and day but shared two things: they both had four-letter names and they would both absolutely dominate the field until Half-Life came along a half-decade later. Of those two games, Doom was unmistakably the night, Myst the day. Doom coursed with motion. Myst held the gaze with its clarity.This clunky 3d port is a sad echo of that original and does practically nothing to convey the shocking sharpness of the 1993 version. Whereas the old slideshow version was confined to a now inconceivably small window, it did push the limits for its time and rarely overplayed its hand. This one is full of bad texture-mapping and barely passable lighting. Compared to the loving upkeep the Half-Life series has received in recent years, this hackneyed conversion is just painful to witness.(Regarding the gameplay—it's almost inevitable that the puzzles in a game so far ahead of its time would age badly, but generally Myst has done better than could be expected on that front. Compared to its first sequel, Riven, the structure feels more than a little contrived, but the puzzles are reasonably well balanced between codes, mazes, and mechanical mysteries.)			"

												I gotta say, this is a challenging game that would challenge even the most observant of people. That being said the game includes a VERY good guide that can break down tasks for you without giving the answer away. It gives the option of giving you little hints, and you can request more all the way up to them giving you the flat out answer if you get tired of it. This allows for puzzle-solving on all levels and gives anyone a chance. I didn't want to flat out bash this game without mentioning the parts they did do well. However, the game mechanics can be very hindering and not smooth. So much to the point that if you are under a structure (such as a stairwell), and the game glitches you will find yourself stuck there and without frequent saving you are fuc*d. This happened to me and caused me a lot of stress. I only save when im done playing due to the fact that you cannot die in this game since it is solely puzzle-solving. I did not expect a simple enviromental bug to ruin my quest, and I am considering laying it down as I may not have the patience to recall and redo all my work only to find another bug down the road. Because of the unstability even after their ""patch"", I cannot recommend this game.UPDATE:After re-loading the game it finally allowed me to escape, I was able to make it to the end of the game. Although SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!-----------------I didn't like how they made you finish the same age in order to get both pages, rather than allowing you to carry both. While it was rewarding getting through the ages, I did not want to go through them again, but also the allowed hints and this not being tied to the ""correct ending"" was enough for me to change my vote to recommended!

												Really great remake of Myst!  Well, a remake of a remake...If you're confused about the differences between the different versions of Myst on steam, then get this one!This if the only version with Achievements AND Trading Cards!Also, the Rime Age (only on Realmyst and Realmyst Masterwork) is kinda neat!WARNING!  WARNING!  I have no idea why, but this game... either wipes its individual achievements occasionally, or they pinged in-game but not on Steam itself for some weird reason... I had to redo my achievements up to the end of Channelwood (first age I explored).Also, the Perfect ATU achievement was weird, and didn't ping in-game for me, but when I alt-tabbed to Steam, it showed up.  Also, somehow fell into the water in Stoneship Age somehow and it respawned me at the beginning of the age.All in all, a few glitches, but nothing too gamebreaking, and pretty easy to 100%.Definitely get this if you want another game for trading cards and more 100% games achievement-wise.NOTE:  I say this game is easy, but I remember all the puzzles from doing it as a kid... most people will probably want to consult a strategy guide or a walkthrough unless they want to toggle the same few switches on the first island for a few hours, wondering what in the world they have to do...  This game is not very self-explanatory puzzle-wise.			"

												I specifically remember playing Myst back when I was 5 or 6, didn't realize what I was doing at the time, but I thought it was really cool how the game looked and played. This was basically the game that made me really like computer games.Fast forward 20+ years and we have this, realMyst, completely rebuilt from the ground up using a modern engine and graphics.  For the first time, you are able to walk around the island and the Ages, able to take in every detal. The only things that were kept from the original Myst were the sound files and the original actor videos. I'm very happy to finally play Myst the way I believe it was meant to be. Not only has this pretty much been a nostalgia trip for me, it also brings Myst to the modern age where high graphics and the ""first person"" dominates so today's generation can appreciate the game.I really hope that a Riven version is being worked on, but I can imagine the difficulty in that due to the size of it compared to Myst.I highly recommend anyone get this, whether you traveled to Myst 20 years ago, or are looking to get into the series now, this is the perfect way to bring yourself into the world of Myst.

												This is it. The classic point&click adventure game that was the best selling game until the 2000s. I mean really, not much has to be said. Once you set the graphics to stop being dynamic and start being fantastic the game really gives the old gal new life. The framerate will be terrible, but it doesn't need to be 60fps for this genre (in classic mode). Stoneship looks phenomenal; Selentic looks fantastic; and Mechanical is blue crystal eye-candy. My only gripe is Channelwood isn't misty and rainy, but more a cheerfully clear rainforest type of place (needs more grunge). Take a walk down Myst Island in glorious HD--it really is something. *Just remember to play the Mechanical Age before the Selenitic Age so you know what to do.*			"

												TERRIBLY wonderful game running on a TERRIBLE game engine. I really wish they had used UE3 or Source or something else for this masterpiece of a game. Unity is the biggest pile of crap game engine I have seen in a long time.THe game itself, however, looks great. Great use of shadows and shaders. Models looks wonderful, and much more lifelike than realMYST or anything you'd expect in the Myst universe, hoever; as my brother Lance says, ""something is lost from the original"". It certainly does feel a bit different from the original 8-bit release, but that's not to say it's bad.Just...buy it. If you haven't played or heard of Myst, you owe it to yourself to experience this original storyline.			"

												A year or so ago I was feeling nostalgic, and I attempted to load up my old copy of the original realMyst (from disc). Sadly, the game simply won't run on a modern machine without constantly crashing, and I gave up hope of experiencing the game again. So I was all the more delighted when I found out about realMyst: Masterpiece Edition, which I picked up the day it was quietly released on Steam. I'm glad to say that this game has all the greatness of the original, with the added bonus of better graphics and the inclusion of the original game's artwork.For the uninitiated, realMyst is the 3D recreation of the original Myst game, which was released all the way back in 1993. Once an adventure created through still images and small inset videos, the world is fully eplorable and features all the neat things one expects to see in modern 3D game worlds, thanks to the Unity game engine. Added ambient effects include a day/night cycle and weather on Myst and many of the Ages, motion blur, depth of field, and a toggleable flashlight. It's also possible to set the game to jump between all the camera angles from the original game, but transition in 3D between clicks. It's a little bit bumpy at times, but helps strike a good balance between the new graphics and the underlying game of the past.All the familiar sound effects and music from the original game are here as well, only in higher fidelity.I have only minor complaints with realMyst: ME - mostly surrounding disparities between the control mechanics of certain puzzles, but none of which are really worth mentioning here. I also feel like some of the textures and 3D models could have been created at a higher resolution in places, but overall, things look pretty good.I definitely recommend realMyst: Masterpiece Edition. It's a mostly faithful remake of Myst, and a great way to see the game realized on modern hardware, for fans of the series and newcomers alike.			"

												Myst is an old, classic adventure game from 1993 that casts you on the mysterious island of Myst. You will have to visit different worlds (or,better said, ages) on the behalf of two brothers, Sirrus and Achenar, who are trapped inside their own books and need your help to be released. To this end, you must collect magic pages that are scattered around the various ages.Myst is a pretty non-linear game: you can access every level from Myst in any order you choose (provided you found the way in) and can decide to return to areas you've already explored later. Myst's puzzles remain fair from the most part, with only some rare exceptions. One could argue that the game could have used an inventory system for the pages: you can carry only one page at a time and, should you find another one and pick it up, the previous one will be returned to its own location. The level's design was Myst's strongest suit at the time of its release and is still noticeable to this day. It's worth mentioning however that the tile is rather short, clocking about five or six hours.This updated release introduces full 3D navigation for the whole game's world, updated graphics and a bonus (albeit short) age, Rime. The new controls are comfortable enough, although a little unresponsive during some transictions, and the new models give Myst much more life			"

Now, thanks to steam, I can start replaying all the worlds I got a mere taste of as a kid. Myst, the first game that introduces me to all the characters I love...Atrus and Catherine and Ti'Anna. His two insane sons. Gameplay wise, the graphics and controls are super improved. There's very little video in the game, although sometimes the sound can be off at those times. But the music and the puzzles are fantastic, and the lore is rich and detailed. Great way to feel super smart and awed at the same time!

												Reminds me of the young days where I was clicking around the Island of myst, knowing nothing about what I was doing, just taking in the weird and mystic scenery.I have played it many times since and it never dissappoints and the graphic update doesn't destroy the feeling of Myst. Recommended to all curious types who doesn't need constant action and no-brainer difficulty level.Only problem is the ""Hint"" section which practically is a walkthrough – the game shouldn't support such an easy play through: If you never yourself overcome the problems and frustrations you meet in the game, you will never feel the achievement of overcomming them. So the possibility to plainly see the answers to riddles in-game can potentially be game breaking for lazy players.Though it will indeed be worthwhile to put some hours into exploring the Island of Myst and it still holds as one of my favorite games here more than 20 years later.PS make the rest of the series for MAC! Otherwise I will have to by a second windows computer.			"

												Myst was my first computer game, ever. Played it on Windows 3.1. This is the only version of the game I've had no issues with running on modern PCs (Win 7). Both Myst:Masterpiece and realMyst Original had crashing or other issues. This one worked perfectly for me.I highly recommend it to almost anyone, if only just to try it out; there are few games like it, it's an exploration, puzzle, story-driven game. Don't play it like an 'objective', just relax, explore, and be curious. Puzzles are clever, and the controls, while taking a bit of getting used to, offer both a WASD and 'Classic' mode. The hint system is very nice as well, offering just that: hints. Not complete solutions, so you don't feel bad if you need them. It's accessible to all levels of gamers, IMO.It's a faithful recreation, with most of the original textures, sounds, and models (in a few places) while generally updating it... to a point. Admittedly, it could look a LOT better. But I appreciate the old, timey feel to it. It was very refreshing to play the free roam mode in a game I'd always traditionally had as point-n-click. Overall, a good blend of old and new. Highly recommended.			"

												I'm playing this right now and I'm very impressed.The Myst games are still to this day very unique games. These games have always been about discovery, exploring very well crafted and believable alien worlds, and figuring out how the environments, natural and man-made structures in these worlds work. Learning the backstory and lore of each world also adds a lot to the experience (in the games this is usually done by reading journals). For me, they are a great and relaxing experience of discovery, and I wish there were more games like this.So far I've explored Channelwood, Stoneship age and Myst Island, and I believe this game is to date the best representation of the worlds of Myst 1. The game has greatly enhanced textures, lighting, shadows and water compared to the original Real Myst, and the fact that you can move freely and that the worlds are much more dynamic compared to the original Myst adds a lot to the experience. The worlds are now more believable than ever, with great attention to detail: the day/night cycles are amazing to watch, the sky, moon, clouds, lighting, water, dense vegetation, and several nice touches like different elements appearing at night... the flashlight is also a nice touch.The main negative aspect of the game for me has already been pointed out by others, and that is the bad performance. The game indeed seems to be poorly optimized, and sometimes it stutters briefly. But it is not so bad as I have everything maxed out at 1920x1200 and in general it runs fairly well on my computer. I seem to get an average of 30fps, which is perfectly playable for this kind of game. I have an i7-2600k@4.4GHz and a GTX 560Ti (I don't know if the game is more cpu bound or gpu bound, and from what I've read others seem to be getting a worse experience). I haven't experienced any bugs or crashes.All in all, I think this game is well worth it for any fan of Myst. "

												Nostalgia... nostalgia all over the place.Takes me back to my first exposure of computer games from when my dad and sister would play the Myst series. I was too young then to actually understand, but I always watched. Now I have a chance to play it myself in an up to date version of this classic that makes the experience much more engaging and exciting.			"

												This review was negative when the game launched, due to several issues with game optimization.  A patch on February 27 corrected most of these errors, and the game behind them is the same MYST as always.  Now that this game is far more likely to run on your system, the question left is whether or not you should buy this instead of the first RealMYST. I believe it is a matter of preference. RealMYST runs almost perfectly fluid and costs less than half the price of the masterpiece edition.  On the other hand, this modern update boasts new textures, lighting effects and post processing effects that can make the gameworld seem more alive. Despite these improvements, the masterpiece edition's textures are still noticeably bad by modern standards (particularly the leaves on trees). The game still appears to require more resources than one might think necessary to run smoothly.Ultimately I think whether these improvements are worth the cost is a question best left to you. The game is playable now, and I will honor my original statement and recommend it.			"

												Great game.  I see people having problems with lockups, bad images, poor framerates, etc., etc.  I don't.  We're all playing the same game; only difference is the computers we're using.  The game is playing flawlessly for me.  I love it.  Some complain there is a need to walk through an age several times to retrieve all the information.  For me, that is an opportunity to see things I've not noticed and to enjoy the environment yet again.  Some complain about the balance of music, environment sound, and character voices.  For some reason I hear all of this very clearly; one does not overwhelm the other.  At least for me, no problems at all.  Personal preferences for how game controles should work; I have none.  Others seem to attribute their preferences to game flaws.  I have, and still enjoy the leasurly pace, great artwork, and thoughtful puzzles. I hope you do also.			"

												The same game as realMyst only it seems half the graphics were upgraded, while half were downgraded or not changed at all. The movement is not as intuitive or smooth as the original realMyst. A sad release that could've been awesome had a bit more time and polish been put into it. Lighting effects and a flashlight are added and add to the game, but still if you've never played Myst buy the Masterpiece edition or the original realMyst.			"

												really good classic sandbox puzzle game.  this version is okay; it gives the player a new playstyle (WASD or arrow key movement which will feel more comfortable for a modern PC player).  the graphic transition to 3d is sometimes not that great.  this version comes with an additional age to explore.this remastering of myst is decent, and it is basically the only way to play without crashes or virtual box with an early version of windows.  I recommend to buy this on sale.			"

												So...I gave this a ""yes"" vote mainly because there isn't a ""maybe"".  The orignal Myst was one of the all-time greats, but it has to be taken in the context of the time when it appeared.  21 years have passed since then and it certainly wouldn't do so well today, when people expect full 3D accelerated graphics, full motion video, etc.  realMyst is an attempt to remake the game with these expectations in mind, perhaps to introduce the game to a new audience, to draw back folks like me who played it when it was new, and of course, to make a few bucks.  By the way, this is the third time they've updated the game and re-released it (not counting ports of the original game to many platforms).So how well does it work?  Well, it's not great - pretty good maybe.  The 3D engine seems poorly optimized.  Even on decent hardware it runs slowly, especially with the graphics cranked up.  The controls are clumsy, especially the mouse-look functions.  For some reason the game is very dark - they added day/night cycles and it seems to be perpetually night, and indoor locations are often so dark as to be unplayable.  For this reason, a flashlight has been added to the game, which is a necessity most of the time, but it really takes away from the game's visuals to only be able to see well in the spotlight.On the other hand, everything from the original game is here, you can move around somewhat unrestricted compared to the static screens in the original game, and when the lights are on it looks pretty nice.  The story is somewhat timeless and still ""plays"" well today.Here are a few notes on what I had to do to make the game playable (on a system with a 3.4 Ghz core i7 processor, 16 gigs of ram and a Radeon HD 6970M graphics chipset with another gig of ram).  1. Turn down the resolution2. Turn down some of the effects3. Learn to ALWAYS mouse-look with the right mouse button - you don't have to do this while walking, but you do have to do this while standing still, and switching back and forth between methods is too confusing4. Keep the flashlight on at all times except when the glare obscures something on the screen5. Press shift while walking to speed up - otherwise movement is very slowA couple of other notes - there are a ton of hint guides for this game.  Try not to use them.  It's not a long game, the puzzles are meant to be challenging, and if you buzz through it with a lot of hints it will definitely not be worth $18.  Some of the hint guides may even be wrong in some particulars (correction, ARE wrong in some particulars).  Look at everything.  READ everything.  Take notes.  Relax and play at an easy pace.  Despite being 21 years old, Myst still has a great story, some neat moments, some fun puzzles - it CAN be worth the $18.			"

												Don't have a whole lot of time in it just yet but from the time spent I'd say that graphically the game is much better than the original.  You feel immersed in the landscape and the different worlds more than ever, however they aren't really up to spec with modern day game graphics.  Still, if you are into the casual point and click mystery/puzzle games then Myst is pretty much the grand-daddy of them all. The controls for the 3D Roaming are a bit awkward at first especially if you've played it before.  The good thing though is that there is a Point and Click option that mimics the original while still maintaining the updated graphics.  I would give it a solid 80/100.   Sound is great.  Music is great.  Brings back fond memories.Bottom line: for $12.05 or less (Summer Sale) the game is a must buy if you're into these types of games or if you just want to revisit your childhood days of playing the original Myst series.

												I have all the myst variations and this is the only one that works without me needing to tinkle with my settings etc. Though there is a dynamic change in visuals, some graphical short cuts are pretty apparent and lack that milestone reputation it claims to have. The 3D rendering is quite sluggish and lacks smoothness at times, however the 3d side of it does still compliment a gamer who has a lets explore the island mentality. The added Rime Age is brilliant and compliments the game so much that you would swear it was always there and was meant to be. Also found the walkthrough added to be enjoyable, as it allowed me to understand the complexity of some of the puzzles which I failed to fully understand when I first played this as a child. Disappointed that no achievements were added and that no further easter eggs were created for this game, so in some respects it being labelled as a simple cashin is somewhat warranted. Thought the developers could have provided that little bit more for a cult generation of hardcore fans. With that placed aside this version of Myst is clearly the best yet to date.			"

												MYST is truely a beautiful recreation of a timeless classic masterpiece. The game its self is very overwelming with puzzles and colds that are intended to make you use the power of thinking. Playing the myst serise as kid was bit of a challange but as i got older the game seems to make more sense when your figuring out the puzzles and sequences that the game will throw at you. let me note this when playing the game try using the help commands to get you through otherwise you will be stuck at the same part for hrs. their is no same in help guides or searching on youtube			"

 Back to the Future Want to know why point and click games became really popular? This game is one of the reasons. It is definitely a classic that holds up really well, up to the point I sometimes forget this game debuted in 1993. It seems as if since then most puzzle games have walked in its footsteps. I do recommend that you get the Masterpiece Edition because the 3D modeling makes the game play more like a modern open-world sandbox rather than a cheap slideshow style that is the default format for more recent point and click games. This edition definitely has more polish to it as well with more detailing. Two minor nitpicks though: the controls are unresponsive at times and the day-night cycle is annoying, particually if you are trying to see puzzles in the middle of the night. Yes, there is a torch, but the dim light it emits is more suited for a horror film. But otherwise this is a really cool game.P.S. I got to this game not because of my father, but because I was looking for alternatives to this other game, which I really love. It is like a more modern version of Myst. "

												realMyst is a graphically updated of the 1993 Cyan game Myst.  Myst is a puzzle game where you play as a character whom we don't know the name of, and we are given virtually no backstory.  But by going to different 'ages' through books and solving puzzles, more and more of the truth is revealed.  I won't give any major plot spoilers for those who want to really want to invest themselves in finding out the story, but for those who want just a bit of backstory, here you go:  The background of your own character is unknown and there is no way of finding out who you are immediately.  You stumble upon a note from a man named Atrus.  Atrus writes ""linking books,"" which are books used to travel between different ages.  Atrus has a wife, Catherine, whom we don't meet, and two sons, Sirrus and Achenar.  Sirrus and Achenar are each trapped in linking books, and they want your help to get out, but there is a catch:  They each say that the other brother is not to be trusted.  They each say that Atrus met a terrible fate at the hands of the other brother.  It is up to the player to uncover the truth.   Overall, this game gets a 10/10 from me, it excells in every single aspect that puzzle games should have.  Everyone will love this game, even though it can be frustrating at times.  Enjoy!			"

												This is my first time back into Myst since I was 7 and I never knew how much I had missed. The puzzles in the game, while not hard, are pretty clever and make you a little paranoid about missing clues.   This version in particular looks pretty good as a whole. Being able to play in a proper resolution in 16:9 is great and the journal entries are much easier to read then in previous versions.    The biggest issue is very poor optimization. On the highest graphic settings the frame rate makes it completely unplayable. Even at lower settings the FPS will drop often. At the lowest settings the game runs fine but then it looks like the original MYST so what is the point.  This game is still great but if you don't have a beefy gaming rig I suggest waiting until this version gets some TLC from the Devs. to fix the frame rate issues.			"

												I heard a lot about Myst and reallly wanted to play it, but this game has so many technical issues, I had to stop playing.The controls are horrible! Being the second remake of the same game, you would expect this to be the least of a problem. The game suffers from mouse acceleration problems and the combination of free mouse (standing) and mouse lock (walking) really takes some getting used to. Also the controls can not be remapped and a XBox controller isn't supported either.The graphics is good but the screen resolution can not be changed and the game suffers from micro stuttering. What is worse, the FOV can not be changed either. So people with large screens will probably suffer from simulation sickness. At least I did.All this is not acceptable for a game which was released in 2014. At least controller support should have been added so people can play from a greater distance and don't get sick all the time. As it is, the game is not worth your money.			"

After around ten minutes of playing, I had to turn the game off because I was so dizzy. I'm sure it can be adjusted, but the mouse controls were pretty janky, and despite playing with a pretty good GPU, it felt like there was stuttering in the graphics.I did notice some motion-sickness related options in the graphics settings, but they were all already turned off (ex: motion blur). I can only imagine how terrible my experience would have been if they'd been turned on by default.Overall, it's probably a decent remake, but I can't recommend it for people who have issues with motion sickness in games.

NOTE: MY TRUE REVIEW IS MIXED, BUT STEAM DOES NOT OFFER THAT OPTION. SINCE IT TENDS MORE TO THE NEGATIVE SIDE, I OPTED FOR NOT RECOMMENDING ITUnderwhelming gem of the pastMyst is one of those games I played years ago when I was a child, and would wander around for hours without even knowing what to do. But after many years, here was I, greeted by a remastered version of the game (on a 50% sale during summer sale)I was surprised with the new movement option - you can choose either the original ""hold mouse button"" to move or WASD -, but this enjoyment turned into frustration after struggling with the keyboard mode: it's clunky at best. You can only look around with the mouse while moving your character, or if you press RMB to unlock it (making the cursor disappear until you press it again)There are many graphics options, and, for whatever reason, max settings makes the game run poorly. That could be understandable if it looked beautiful, but it does not; max settings is average at best and the optimization is poorNow for the game itself: there is a certain barrier at the start, as you are presented with a whole island to explore (not that big, but there's enough to do to make you wonder how things work). If you don't skip something on the way, things will start to make sense. And after you figure out how to solve the puzzles in the Myst Island, the sense of challenge disappearsEach Age has a few puzzles to solve so you can go back to Myst Island. Most of them are really straightforward, to the point you spend more time walking around to activate something than thinking on a solution. Not only that, but you have to collect the red and blue pages, but you can only carry one item each time; so get ready to explore everything at least twice (if you don't miss any of them in the first time you go to an Age)At least there are a few different endings, the best one being somehow hidden (the bad ones are simple to do, while the good one requires you to find a few tips to know what to do to unlock it); not only that, but the good ending allows you to play the last Age, exclusive to realMyst (which is really short and the only puzzle is unimpressive)The only pluses of this version are that you can save anywhere (I don't recall this being possible in the original version) and there is a help system with multiple tips (so the answer is not thrown at your face, you can keep trying and checking the help for more tips if needed)In the end, I feel a bit of regret buying this game, even for 50% off. It's not terrible, but there are better puzzle games on Steam (and for lower prices as well)			"

												This is the best remake of Myst out there at the moment, and the definitive playable rendition of the game by my reckoning.  Myst is one of the most accessible classics in the point-and-click adventure genre, emphasizing with its sheer simplicity the joy of the exploration and puzzle-solving without ever coming off as overly contrived or campy.  The visuals are striking, the worlds are rich with lore and characterization, the central murder mystery is compelling and subtle, and the puzzles are never so abstruse as to be unsolvable (as Riven, Myst's sequel, sometimes errs).  For those familiar with the Myst games, realMyst: Masterpiece combines the HD graphic quality of Myst: Masterpiece edition with the full 3D world offered by realMyst (including Rime, the extra age, and day/night progression in all the ages), and does so quite successfully.  The game gives you the option whether to play in full 3D (which is pretty well-executed, though it can be glitchy in places), or according to the game's original advance-by-clicking controls, offering hard-core Myst fans an experience more true to the original game.  The visuals are updated across the board, and many nice touches have been included in this edition that enhance (in my opinion) the Myst experience.  In short, this is the new Gold Standard for Myst, and I highly recommend the game to everyone: gamers, non-gamers, and Myst fans alike.			"

												I mostly enjoyed Myst (realMyst: Masterpiece Edition). It has a lot of interesting puzzles (some much more difficult than others), and doesn't explicitly tell you how to solve any of them (or even really give you hints unless you consult an ingame advice book). This is both a good thing and a bad thing, in my opinion. It allows the player to feel a sense of accomplishment when they make progress, but can occasionally cause the player to feel frustrated and lost - then again, I imagine that's the sense the developers wanted to portray at points in the game. Despite this being the remastered version of Myst, I still feel like parts of the game haven't really aged well. For example, many of the clicking mechanics feel off, some of the cutscenes are extremely low-quality, and the free-roam mode doesn't always control well (but is still much better than the point-and-click mode). Overall, there were some parts of the story that I didn't like, but the different worlds and puzzles made the game pretty interesting.			"

												As someone who played Myst back when it was released in 1993, this is a glorious nostalgia trip! We actually still have the original guide book in mint condition (long since oop).If you're in your 30s and remember the original like I do, pick it up today.If you're younger than that and like open world puzzle games, pick it up now! You will not regret it.I for one hope Cyan decides to release an updated Riven and Exile, I have the 10th Anniversary edition, but that was just the original versions of the first three games and not a true rebuild like realMyst Masterpiece is.

												Finally, after 6 years, I have beaten this game. I swear, the puzzle in order to get to the Selenetic Age was the ♥♥♥♥ing devil for me. Now, after finishing it in this remastered version, I couldn't be happier. A few framerate issues and the lighting is a bit too dim, but aside from that, this is pretty much the best version of the game you can get.EDIT: I fund out that it was actually the fact that I was using an HDMI cable on my moniter instead of a VGA that was causing my brightness to be so dim. After playing it with a VGA cable, everything looks significantly brighter.			"

												It runs fine on my Windows 10 machine, and I was really enjoying it. But I keep getting warnings about my core temperature. I've never seen this with any other game. A little investigation showed that my system started to get hotter than I'd like when running the game, even for a few minutes, and cooled down immediately on exiting. Pity. I've been playing the rather more demanding Obduction for hours at a time: no problems at all. FWIW I have an i7 system with a GeForce GTX 760. The mobo is a Sabre X79. I never overclock. Nothing special for gaming, I guess, but should be more than up to this game. I gather this has been a problem for others in the past. I want to recommend it for the puzzles and whatnot, but this issue makes it unusable.			"

												Well, I've made it about a fifth of the way through the game or so, and I'm not sure whether or not I really want to put in the necessary effort to finish playing through. Going from what I've played so far (Selenitic Age and part of Channelwood Age) a large proportion of the puzzle solving simply seems to be the grunt work of walking around to get to levers and switches that need turning off/on with the actual working out of the puzzles taking less of the effort. So, having walked around a lot and been unavoidably beeped at by one puzzle over thirty times (urgh!) I don't really know that I want to go on.The controls aren't anything to write home about either. For moving around you have the choice of either Classic Myst or Free Roam modes. Classic Myst just means moving around on rails and clicking to either move forward or turn, and it just felt clunky and restrictive and didn't always go where I wanted it to. As for Free Roam, well, as on the tin it's a lot more freeing and you can move around a lot more smoothly, but it's also a bit harder to interact with the environment and I'd often find myself trying to flick a switch from just a little too far away and having to readjust my distance and try again. Never mind that I've already had the game glitch on me once already switching between the two modes!...And now I have a great nostalgic urge to find a copy of Zork: Grand Inquisitor (which I would recommend playing instead) so I can wash the taste of this clunky game and it's clunky interface out of my brain, but that might just be the boredom and exasperation talking.EDIT: Well, I managed to finish it... and I guess I'm mostly ambivalent. It does probably have a nice feel in places, but I found the controls a bit lacking; the puzzles solving to be about 90% drudgery and about 10% thinking (some of them you can even solve almost by accident); some of the sound effects to be a little grating; and the hammed up poor quality FMV acting to be a bit underwhelming and jarring.As a puzzle game (and I guess as a game in general) I'd probably fail it, and I don't know that it's worth the asking price, but maybe you can just enjoy wandering around the levels? If not there are plenty of free 'room escape' type games online or you could pick up a copy of 'Zork: Grand Inquisitor' or 'The Room' instead and get better value for money.			"

												I can't handle playing first-person games without an inverted mouse option, so I had been hoping that an update would fix the initial release's lack of such an option. I was elated to learn that the 2.0 patch added just such an option, so I eagerly booted up the game, only to discover that the newly-added ""invert mouse"" option inverts not just the vertical axis but also the horizontal! The traditional WSAD-style controls have also been altered so that left and right are pan controls rather than strafe options. This makes the game pretty much unplayable.I honestly cannot understand how such monumental design errors can make it out into the public's hands without someone somewhere in the process saying ""hang on a minute here, this is now a totally different control scheme from just about every single first-person game on PC that's ever been released, maybe we should stick to the norm?"". If you want to introduce a dearly-loved classic such as Myst to a new generation of gamers who've grown up with mouselook and WSAD controls, this isn't the way to do it.			"

All I get is a stretched 1080p image with bad gamma because it doesn't detect the correct resolution.I can't actually play the game and try to enjoy it. I hope the developers see this. One simple update to support more resolutions would do the trick.Take this with a grain of salt. I don't recommend it because it displays poorly on a modern hardware setup setup like mine. If you don't have a 21:9 monitor, ignore me. :) Enjoy the game.			"

												Who the hell designed the interface? I already read about the weird thing, not rotating if not moving, having to press right key. Another thing that annoys me in games is when they don't have invert mouse. I am used to inverted Y, I can get motion sickness or play badly with non-inverted, I am not going to get used to it. So,. I was looking at the settings and said ""Wow, at least they seem to have an invert mouse option"". And it gets even more crazy. The Invert option is only for traditional look (Wat?!) not for FPS controls. And when I put it, it automatically inverts both Y and X (Wtf?). It's two times impractical, I mean not only the FPS control is the one that should have invert, but just Invert Y not also X. Was the person who designed the controls drunk? It totally doesn't make sense. Even the options menu, minor, but the ""X"" at the left, intuitively I think it should be to escape from menu, not quit game. It's totally random and fail. Thank god it's just an adventure game, not needing crazy refleces and might try to play again, to see if I can finish Myst this time (I never liked the originals, never understood the dull world, random levers that you don't know what they do, and I do play traditional adventures. I thought with 3D immersion, maybe I can stay more in it's world and actually solve something).			"

												Let's start off by saying that this game is great. It's got great HD textures and Camera mobility. You can use the classic Myst point and click option. Also, you can use the Free Roam mode, just like in realMyst. The game is pretty much the same as far as story mode goes, including adding Rime from realMyst. However, I was slighty disappointed when I had to do only 1 puzzle to unlock Rime and do 2 puzzles in that age. The real question is, ""Should I buy it?"". This is only a good purchase, if you're a big fan of the Myst series or you want to experience a more High Definition look to realMyst. Cyan, Inc. are making a new game called Obduction, which was a Kickstarter game that they sucessfully funded just a few months ago. I'm assuming that all the purchases from this game will be put towards that game. Overall, this game is not really worth the buy. If you want a more high playing performance and great graphics gameplay from realMyst, then I would suggest on buying it to help support Cyan, Inc and add it to your collection of Myst games.			"

												I grew up playing the original and the ability to walk around myst island with improved graphics is just amazing.  Cyan did a fantastic job with this remake of the realmyst game from 2001 or so. If you love myst then you should fall in love with this version.Summary:In Myst you play an unknown traveller that finds a book somewhere (you don't find this out until you read the Myst novel's.)  Once you open its cover, you are transported to Myst Island.  Once there, the player discovers the lore of the D'ni and how they created links to worlds that already existed in other dimensions through the use of ""The Art.""  The Art is a way of creating linking books to other worlds.  You, the player, are in one of those worlds.  Myst Island is a refuge for Atrus and his family.  Through reading the books in the Myst library, you discover everything about Atrus' sons and gain some insight into his travels in other worlds.  in Myst, you must solve a way to get back to your world.  From reading certain notes spread thoughout the island and in other worlds, you discover a plot to imprison Atrus and leave him for dead by his wicked sons, Sirrus and Achenar.  Conclusion:For its day, Myst was an amazing game and truly the first of its kind on CD-ROM.  Each indidual screen was created on a mac and each time the player clicked forward, they would move to the next pre-rendered screen.  Now, you can move all around freely.  realMyst ME is the definitive edition for the original Myst game.  Keep an eye out for the starry expanse project too.  It's a small dev team remaking RIven in Unreal 4.  Riven is the sequel to Myst.  If you've never tried it, at least play the original Riven.  You will feel immersed in both games because there is just so much lore to be found in both.			"

												Save your money.  I played this game in the past and it is a great game, but this version does not run properly on the Surface Pro tablet.  I see from the comments in the community page that others have the same problem that I have.  The island is very dark, the inside of the buildings are even darker, and the flashlight only works on the bushes.  It is so dark, that objects can't be manipulated.  While I understand that the game might have been optimized for Apple hardware, I wish that realMyst had not been advertised to work on Windows 8 or 8.1 OR at least that there was no guarantee that it would work on the Surface tablet.  Cyan paid no attention to the game's compatibility with Surface but judging from the sales of Surface Pro 2, they will have to pay attention in the future.  A waste of money for now (and it is terrible that STEAM does not give refunds), but hopefully Cyan will have another update.  This experience will also make me try to avoid using STEAM in the future.  As for Cyan, they need more support staff.  They don't respond unless you contact them twice.			"

												Full Review: http://bossdungeon.com/review-realmyst-masterpiece-edition/""Beneath it all is a game with great interactive storytelling and puzzles that will boggle your mind to no end, but it's an experience that can be made better by playing the game in basically any other form that's available on PC. You can do without the lifeless visuals, bad optimization and tedious waiting. A flashlight and the option to finally play in window mode is not worth 15,99€. Just get Myst: Masterpiece Edition or realMyst instead. - 4/10""			"

												So after playing this for a few minutes everything was great the island of Myst really does look real in a way that no prior version of Myst has matched. But the longer I played the more I looked back at the classic pictures (accessable in game via the shift key in classic mode) and it dawned on me that many locations especially the bottom level of channelwood look far worse then the original graphics. Primarily in the lighting and shadows. I was hoping this could be the version of Myst that I would repeatedly come back to and replace the unstable original Masterpiece edition as my favorite, and while this is a good version of Myst. The original Masterpiece Edition still is and will continue to be my favorite version.			"

												This game is a joke.I bought this 'thing', not knowing that it was just a ♥♥♥♥♥ier version of Exile. I thought it would be this cool, patched up reboot of Myst with some great new features to it. God was I wrong.Little backstory: when I was eleven or so, I had this Myst collection with every single Myst game in it and boy did I play the living crap out of that (even Uru live, like, can you believe?). Especially Exile, never had I seen a game like that in my life. It had nice graphics, beautiful colours and challenging puzzles. So a few weeks ago, I wanted to pick it up again after six/seven years. And of course the CD didn't work, so I decided to buy it on Steam instead for a prize I thought it would be worth. No. If this is ever on sale for €0,02, it's still a waste of money. You'd better spend it on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5.Here's why: the 'game' is broken and outdated. It's extremely laggy, and I'm pretty sure that's not my computer's fault, as all other games run just fine. This 'game' is ONE enormous lag-glitch-mistake-monstrosity. And then the controls! The person who thought: ""you know what? Wouldn't it be a GREAT idea to make have the mouse control the camera angle AND the actions, but not at the same time? We could just have them left-click to freeze the camera, before they can select things."" DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW GAMES WORK? And the interface is so slow and broken that you can't even change the controls because that literally takes 5 years and then the game crashes.So even if you magically manage to fix all of that, welcome to the vaguest gameplay ever. Oh, and you can barely walk anywhere, so good luck with that.There's a lot of decisions I regret, but buying this piece of nuclear waste has been the worst mistake of my life. -1/100000000000000			"

Posted: October 10, 2016
												Myst was the very first game that I felt truly immersed in.  Twenty years ago, I completely lost myself in the graphics, soundtrack, and puzzles of the game.  For whatever reason, Myst recently came to mind, and I thought that it would be amazing if there were a modern, up-to-date version of the same game.  The title, realMyst, is enticing and gives you the impression that it's been remastered for the modern era.  I was sorely disappointed.  The game gives the option of running a classic mode (where you click around the map and the images fade from one to another) and a modern version where you can use WASD and the mouse to explore the world as it was (probably) originally meant to be explored.Unfortunately, this does not work as a modern gamer would expect.  Instead of linking the camera to the movement of the mouse, you have to push the pointer to the edge of the screen in order to pan the camera in any particular direction.  It's truly mind-blowing that such an out-of-touch interface would exist in 2016.  What's worse is that I run a dual monitor setup, and since I have to push the pointer to the edge of the screen to look to the right, and my desktop extends to the right onto the second monitor, the game is completely unplayable.  Instead of looking right when I push my pointer to the edge of the screen (and it's absolutely ridiculous that any game in 2016 would work this way), my mouse floats off to the other monitor.I even tried Windows+P to duplicate the image to the second monitor, but since my monitors are different sizes, the game crashed because it was unable to mirror the image to both screens.If you're looking to relive the wonder and awe of the original Myst, you're better off playing the soundtrack on YouTube and imagining it in your head.  This game is unplayable for the modern gamer.			"

												Ok. Where to start. I'm going to approach this in chronological order of my thorough dissapointment with this title. My first wave of frustration eminated from the lack of an options menu right at the beginning. I like to set my resolution at least before starting a new game, so I had to watch the nice intro in an eye wrenching 1280x720, which was a little annoying but overall not a huge deal. After spawning in the world a menu comes up and tells you that you have a choice between free roam and and classic mode, awesome. Naturally, I pick free roam, because nostalgia's great and everything but classic mode really defeats the purpose of playing a real time version of Myst. Walking around in free roam was terribly confusing at first and didnt seem to make any sense, but what I figured out is that if you're standing still you have to hold down the right mouse button to look. But you can look freely without doing that while moving. This is a terribly unintuitive control mechanic that makes free roam into a kind of mental gymnastic constantly trying to remember to hold down the mouse button every time you stop for half a second. It is the most pointlessy alien and baffling first person mechanic I've ever played. It's like Cyan has been sealed away in a glass dome for the last 20 years and essentially invented their own control mechanic based on what they knew from developing the orginal Myst and didnt bother at all to take an example from literally any other well designed first person game. It's also worth noting that when holding down the right mouse button, not only is it uncomfortable to hold it down while moving the mouse, the sensitivity is inexplicably lower which adds a new variable of unnessecary awkwardness into this madman's equation. In line with my frustration with the controls is the fact that there seems to be mouse acceleration that cant be disabled. I personally view mouse acceleration with the same burning hostility that I would normally reserve for someone who had just burned my house down and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on my dog. And I can't be the only one who feels this way so it would be nice to have a little checkbox or something like all of the FPS's ever that have a mouse-acceleration feature. You know, just a thought. Now, that that's out of the way let's talk about the engine. I've never been overly impressed with the Unity engine, and personally would not choose to develop in it myself, but I really want to believe it can be used more efficiently than this. The fan for my decent graphics card that can run Crysis 2 with no real problems was screaming at full speed after about 2 minutes. I don't know if Cyan develops their real time titles in house but theyve never seemed to reflect a firm grasp on how to develop assets for a games engine. Theyve always seemed to approach it with the same technique you would use for production rendering, in the 90's no less, going completely off the chain with texel density and poly count for example, yet making no use of masking or layering or anything of the sort that a modern node based shader editor can do to hide atrociously tiling textures. Foliage density is unneseccarily higher than a crack head fresh out of rehab, and I noticed a couple instances of vertex normals being softened when they clearly didnt need to be which is just plain sloppy. I also have a sneaking suspicion that they took some of the textures from the 2000 version of realmyst and hastily ran them through crazy bump. I love the original Myst. It is a masterpiece, but this just seems like a sloppy insult to the original, which is exactly what I thought of the original realMyst from 2000. I hate to say this, because Myst is so close to my heart, but I cannot reccomend dropping 17 dollars on this mess of a game. If you're going to remake a classic for a 20th anniversary, have the decency to do it right.			"

												v2.0 is a great improvement - the right-click mouselook option solves the biggest issue I had with the game, making navigation as smooth as it should be. Thank you!There are still a couple of rough edges - most notably, changing the color of the crystals in Ryme requires click-and-hold rather than simply hovering as in the original realMyst, and there's no intuitive way to discover that. I had to look it up after assuming the game was bugged. Speaking of original-flavor realMyst, I also miss the day-night cycle in Selentic. The new skybox is cool, but I'm not sure it's worth losing that beautiful red-to-purple-to-black twilight.All that said, this is an absolutely beautiful game, superior to the original realMyst in pretty much every way not mentioned above, and should now be considered the definitive version of the game.

												An old, but not dated puzzle game that really holds its own despite the test of time. It still lives up to today's standards, and the lore of this whole series is incredibly deep and rich. Especially nowadays, where games aren't meant to be difficult, MYST is a welcome challenge, as it will keep you thinking and struggling, and the struggle only makes solving the puzzles even more gratifying. Rarely will you find the solution to something simply written down, and if you're playing through it for the first time, you could spend months just exploring the beautiful worlds in MYST. The only thing I can say is keep a journal while playing, you'll want to write down what you're doing and planning on doing so you don't lose your train of thought, and sometimes simply writing down what you've done will spark a thought on what to do next you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. Plus, there are plenty of things you'll want to have recorded for later, such as number sequences and such. Believe me, this game is difficult, if I hadn't kept a journal while playing, I wouldn't have completed it, but that difficulty could hardly be called a con. If you like puzzle games, good story, or are simply tired of multiplayer and simple games, you should definitely give MYST a try. The updated graphics in this version are worth the extra money (plus there's some extra content that I won't spoil here), trust me.			"

												I'm a fan of the Myst series going back to the original release and am even a proud backer of Obduction, the recent successful Kickstarter by Cyan, but I must confess I'm rather disappointed by this latest remastered version of their original blockbuster. Sure, the game replicates the fundamental details of Myst, but the new graphics are quite shoddy in my opinion. When the first edition of realMyst arrived many years ago, it genuinely pushed the limits of the 3D hardware available at the time. Initially it was heavily criticized for poor optimization, yet paired with the right hardware and with subsequent patches, looked quite excellent for its day. The presentation with realMyst: Masterpiece Edition, however, might have been passable 5 years ago, but it's distinctly behind the pack for what's acceptable today, even factoring in that Cyan is a sort of indie developer lately. Textures and other details are soft, while the lighting is harsh and unrealistic. Perhaps this approach was taken to make the title easily adaptable for portable devices and low-end systems. In any case, the dated and simple graphics don't warrant the cost on PC if you've already played any of the previous versions. It's also a shame in my opinion that Cyan continues to use their one mega-hit as a crutch, when perhaps their time might have been better spent creating a real-time 3D version of Riven or possibly remastering one or more of the other sequels. Given these results it might have been better still if they'd simply remastered the original game using pre-rendered graphics, but possibly at 2k or 4k resolution. It surely would be more impressive visually than what we have here. If nothing else it was lush graphics that consistently defined the Myst series. This rendition sadly fails to live up to that legacy.			"

												Pick this up if you're feeling nostalgic, or if you've never played MYST it's still a great game. The graphics are fairly good, but still look dated and of course the live action parts are still in their original low resolution. The free roam control scheme is a little clunky but it lets you get around a lot faster than the classic point and click. You can use WASD and shift to sprint, but if you're standing still you have to right click and drag to look around. You'll have to do a lot of running back and forth so you'll appreciate it. The flashlight is great to have because it gets REALLY dark at night. The clues for the puzzles are fairly out in the open but some of them take some really out of the box thinking. There is a really great help library, it starts off giving vague hints but you can dig deeper if you're really stumped until it eventually outright tells you what to do, so you'll never get stuck (unless you refuse to use it). It tries very hard to minimize spoilers. You will also have to obsessively screenshot every clue and keep a pad and paper nearby. Read all of the books, there's important stuff in them. One of the ages you'll have to rely on your auditory memory a lot so WARNING if you're tone deaf you will not have fun with this one. The funny thing about the puzzles is they all seem pretty obvious in hindsight. There is never anything that's completely unfair or left to guessing or chance, though some of the logic is a little convoluted. Overall if you're good at these types of games or you're not ashamed to take a hint here and there this will be a fairly fast playthrough. I'd say pick this up when it's on sale.			"

It's a nice touch to have a choice as to the kind of movement mode you'd like to use. Some of the puzzles are easy, some challenging, but all are fun.  One thing I would like is some sort of confirmation of completion of important parts of the game.  I don't need a star to appear above my head, but some kind of indicator that I had finished the game would have been nice.  Then again, I am quite literal and maybe it just wasn't clear to me.			"

												realMyst-Masterpiece is the game Myst wanted to be 20 years ago, but runs happily on Windows 8!  I'm happy there's a point-and-click mode (in addition to the free-walk mode), and that the point-and-click fully animates transitions.  I'm ecstatic that the world now has solar cycles, and that you get a flashlight, and that the puzzles are unchanged.I'm less excited that the graphics are not as eye-popping as the original graphics appeared to be 20 years ago.  Granted, the original graphics by today's standards are crap; still, realMyst uses rendered textures in a typical 3D engine, so it looks ""good"" but not ""great"".  (Though, I'm a bit of graphics nerd, so I notice things like the lack of volume rendering and specular highlights.  It's still good though.)Curiously, the added age (Rime) has no actual point.  It has three puzzles (a stove, an elevator, and some crystals).  It has places you can go to, things you can look at, and switches to flip that have nothing to do with any puzzle.  It feels like they stopped halfway developing it.  But, getting to it was a very well-done extension to the classical Myst game.			"

I have the original Myst Masterpiece from way way back when it first came out, and it is too old to work on my latest pc. This version is really an improvement on the original Myst :))) It works great on my Acer Win8 64bit.What is especially nice about this updated version, are the night and day sequences with added sky features.

Trying to move in 3D gets very clunky, and there are frequent moments of black-screen that are a bit annoying. Otherwise, I think the quality of texturing was sub-par and a bit sloppy. The last thing I'll mention is sloppy sound quality as well.  Overall, This game is a sub-par remake compared to the care and attention that went into the original.			"

												Myst - An absolute classic in the first person adventure and exploration genre. The background music is haunting and for some strange reason absolutely a fundamental basis to the enjoyment of this game. The pinnacle of the genre of which other first person adventures were/are still judged today.Love the new graphics. Playing at screen resolution of 2560x1440. The free roaming and interactive breathes new life into this old time classic. And since I played this eons ago I forgot all the puzzles so I'm like a newbie,lol. "

												If you ejoyed Portal or Antichamber, I must say you have to try this game. I did play the original a bit, but didn't get far. I dare say nostalgia didn't cloud too much my judgement since I had so little experience (for you afraid other reviewers might have played the original). The 3D graphics seems to free from the constraint of having to examine each of a series of screens meticulously, and instead you get more focused on solving the puzzles themselves as they come up.This really is a masterpiece, even more in this format and beautiful graphics. I don't think there's anything quite like it out there.			"

												While this game is a classic there are many things that need to be put in consideration. As it was written in 1993, there are only a few hours gameplay until you are finished. Most of those scant hours will be spent wondering ""What am I supposed to do?"" instead of playing the game itself. Using a walkthrough or similar will reduce that to even a shorter amount of time and you will look at about 5 hours worth of playing.Also since all puzzles are fixed the replay value is rather low. There is not much you can find that you didn't see on the first playthrough.Would I recommend it? I am not sure. I am somewhere in between, with a very short game on one hand and a nice weird story on the other hand. But, in the end, yes, I will recommend this game but with a strong BUT...!			"

												I never got to play Myst when it was originally released so it was nice to get the oppurtunity now. For a 20 year old game they've done a nice job of making it look good. This game just drops you onto Myst island with no hand holding advice about what to do. You need to explore and figure things out. I really liked the puzzles in this game. Theres no obscure ridiculous ones. They all felt intuitive and if you explore your surroundings enough you'll eventually figure out the solution. The game really does a great job of giving subtle hints and clues. ( Thats not to say i didn't need to google a hint every now and again).Good points:- Nice remastered graphics- The islands in the game make for a very memorable setting. They seem so unique and unusual that it fits the game perfectly- Brilliant puzzles that are intuitive enough that they dont frustrate.Bad points:- The free roam controls felt a bit fiddly when walking aboutOverall this is a great game that im glad i finally got to play. If you havent ever played this game it's worth picking up this edition. Also worth mentioning if your completely stuck on a puzzle, try the Myst guide on Universal Hints System instead of just googling the answers. It'll give you useful hints without spoiling the answer as solving the puzzles yourself, even with a hint or two, is more enjoyable then just getting the direct solution.			"

												Being a console gamer, I was mostly oblivious to PC games. Most of the computer games I've played were board games, Solitaire, ""push-the-block"" puzzle games, and Space Cadet Pinball. It wasn't until recent years, where I found out about the world of early PC games, particularly LucasArts point n' click adventures, such as the Monkey Island series, but chose to stick with my N64 and PS2. As I continued gaming, I became more and more accustomed to the newer generations, but as gaming morphed into a soulless machine spewing out nothing but meatheads in power-armor teabagging endless n00bs, boring brown enviroments, gun and ragdoll physics, etc, I started exploring the realms the more cerebral games of yore just to keep my interest in the hobby alive. One of the games in particular that peaked my interest in the adventure genre is, Myst. Myst is a graphic adventure game from 1993. The game thrived on the PC back then and was remade and ported several times on many systems, including the Playstation, Sega Saturn, the Jaguar CD of all things, and Nintendo DS & 3DS (Both are regarded as the worst ports of the game) I did prior research in the game and checked out a bunch of reviews. Almost all of them kept yapping about how they loved this game as a kid, all this nostalgia-gushing, how the reviewers kept kissing the game's♥♥♥♥♥ I kept thinking, ""Is there ANY reviewer sees this game for what it is, other than from childhood significance?"" I decided to give the game a shot on my PS3, via PSOne Classics. I played it and I hated it...at firstIn the game, you take the role of the stranger. Some random stumble-♥♥♥♥ who happens upon a book that transports him/her to the island of Myst. The Stranger is left with no choice, but to explore the island. The island holds a library, a rocket, an observatory, a cabin, and a power room. All of which contain puzzles for the Stranger to solve. These puzzles reveal four different books that transport the Stranger to different worlds, called ""Ages"". Upon entering the library, the Stranger finds two standalone books, the red and blue book. Both contain a message shrouded in static as both books have missing pages. The pages have been scattered through the different Ages located on Myst Island. The Stranger is now tasked to piece together why he/she is there by putting together the books and deciphering the messages. The main detractor of the game is the whole graphic adventure aspect. As soon as you start the game, it places you on a picture of the island, and a cursor. You start clicking around and realize your means of locomotion are through pointing and clicking, suffering screen-by-screen. I've been spoiled by 3D-games like Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, even first-person games like Perfect Dark. The screen-by-screen felt really strange and slow. It took time to get used to it and I eventually stopped noticing. As soon as I got used to it, I was in for a cerebral, and sometimes obtuse ride. The game averts several gaming mechanics. There is no combat system, no enemies to fight, no risk of dying, no time limit, and no hands to hold. Myst Island is your oyster! Also, be prepared to take notes. Seriously, you're going to have to write a whole bunch of stuff down. Many of the puzzles involve memorizing numbers, symbols, safe combinations, some of them are visual puzzles, some are auditory (One involves deciphering sounds to distinguish between north, south, east, and west) This isn't a game that you play, but one that you experience. It's solely about piecing together the story of how you got there and how you're supposed to leave.Myst is quite a unique experience. I'd liken it to those ""escape the Room"" puzzles, but on a much bigger scale. The puzzles are challenging, if not a bit obtuse, the settings look nice, given the old graphics (I'd recommend the Masterpiece Edition, an HD remastering) and story seems interesting, (Though, I'll have to play the other 4 to get the whole story). If you're tired of teabagging n00bs and wish to experience a game that involves your grey matter, rather than an itchy trigger finger, then step up and see what you've been missing.			"

												I still remember this game when it came out in 1993. It was such a great looking game and created such a buzz that there was even an hour long program discussing the game and showing some of the gameplay and features. It was the first game I got when I bought my first computer in 1995. It has been 17 years since I last played the game.Now, here is realMYST. Much has changed from the original game. You can now play in free roam mode (classic mode still available for those who prefer, but if you are trying to get the achievements, you must play in free roam mode or you won't get many of them) which lets you look and move in 360 degrees. Graphically, it's not the revelation it was in 1993, but still looks solid. The music and sound effects are still the same with a few extra things thrown in. Still brings up the great nostalgic feeling I had back then. It has been awhile, so I don't remember much, so this game remains a solid challenge.The music and atmopshere of the game are what sill amaze me along with a strange and somewhat creepy story and adventure that you are lead on. Upon completion the game, you are now granted acces to another age called Rime. This is a very short and quite easy age, but the setting and a couple of smale things you can do are pretty cool, but pretty much a useless age. Pretty much a short part just before the Age of Riven. Only good if you wanna get the last 3 achievements done.Anyways, still a solid game for the right price and a good 10-12 hours of gameplay, as long as you can solve the puzzles and figure out what to do next. Good luck and good clicking.			"

												v2.0 is a great improvement - the right-click mouselook option solves the biggest issue I had with the game, making navigation as smooth as it should be. Thank you!There are still a couple of rough edges - most notably, changing the color of the crystals in Ryme requires click-and-hold rather than simply hovering as in the original realMyst, and there's no intuitive way to discover that. I had to look it up after assuming the game was bugged. Speaking of original-flavor realMyst, I also miss the day-night cycle in Selentic. The new skybox is cool, but I'm not sure it's worth losing that beautiful red-to-purple-to-black twilight.All that said, this is an absolutely beautiful game, superior to the original realMyst in pretty much every way not mentioned above, and should now be considered the definitive version of the game.

												As a girl that grew up and watched her father playing this game, it was a real treat to be able to play an updated version of Myst.  I remember not understanding how my dad figured out the clues and it didn't seems like there was ever an end goal.  As I grew up, I tended to gravitate more towards puzzle games and solving room puzzles to continue on.  I was always intrigued by this game and this remake is everything and more.  They enhanced the ability to navigate on more of a free will basis instead of moving at predetermined intervals.  The graphic quality is enhanced but the overall game is the same, which I think is perfect.  I only hope that they continue on with the reboots of the sequels, starting with Riven of course.  Once, they do.  I will definitely buy it the second it is released.			"

												As a player of the Original MYST, MYST Masterpiece Edition, and now this edition, I can say that this version lives up to the predecessor versions in addition to having some wonderful graphics for screenshots and nostalgia whatnot. The fact that this version has a little overlay to compare to the original is very nice and allows one to appreciate how the look has improved. There is also now surround sound and higher sound quality to compliment the upgrade. The price is a touch high if you've already played the game, as vets will be able to go through the full game in a couple hours or so unless you get stuck in the Selentic underground (again). I did not notice any bugs playing through this.If you have never played Myst, try this. Getting older versions of MYST can be painful and time consuming, and likely not worth it unless you're going for nostalgia of an earlier time. If you do need help with an earlier version of MYST message me/leave a comment and I'll help you. I wrestled with MYST Masterpiece Edition for 4 hours to get it working.			"

												What to say about this version of Myst?  Apart from ""it's better than the 3DS version"" -First of all, unless you've literally never played any version of this game before, the puzzles are not going to surprise you because THEY ARE STILL EXACTLY THE SAME. You can literally dig out your old notes from twenty years ago and use them to get through to the endgame.  This is probably my only real complaint with the re-releases of Myst, at least as far as the gameplay is concerned; would it have been so hard to add a random element to the puzzles?  Or maybe change a couple of them a little?  (Well, okay, there's a new Rime age and all, but even that one has been recycled from the original RealMyst.)So I guess nostalgia rules in the realm of Myst... but the main appeal of this game has always been its appearance, and I'm happy to say that has improved.  This version updates the original RealMyst to bring it in line with what modern hardware can produce, and the full 3D movement makes navigating the islands much easier (Channelwood treetops, I'm loking at you).The Steam version brings Myst up to date with Achievements, because that's what the kids are into these days (okay, I had fun trying to get them all too).If you're into the quiet, cerebral and immersive type of game, why not go for the one that made itself a landmark and give this game a try?  If you're an old fan of the game, there won't be too much in the way of new content to bring you back, but you'll have already made up your mind on this game by now anyway!			"

												MYST- A classic game who’s fresh coat of paint elegantly brings it into the modern game library.Playing through MYST is quite an experience - you’re really playing an element of PC gaming history.  Every component feels intentional, from the puzzle design to the graphics to the soundscape, this game is jut overall beautiful.  I would call this a fun game, the puzzles were inventive and challenging, many of them requiring a pencil and paper to work out.  I appreciated the obvious effort into the gameplay, as nothing felt repetitive (which is an issue many puzzle games suffer) or boring.  Overall, great gameplay accented with an amazing new graphical style makes for a nice play through experience in MYST.However, some elements of this game did detract from my experience in playing it.  I am going to break these into two groups: the things that were added as part of realMYST or realMYST: Masterpiece Edition and the things that were present in the original game.As far as added elements, the fist item of complaint is the free roam controls.  The default free camera perspective was not intuitive, and the setting to modify the player perspective from unlocked to locked was convoluted and confusing.  Also, the added “Rime Age” did not fit well with the story, or if it did, I didn’t figure it out.  This point, of having to ‘figure out’ the story nicely transitions to the major design flaw in the original game that I would like to discuss - the lack of a compelling and integrated storyline.Throughout the game, one issue persisted that really detracted from my personal play experience.  This is the lack of a compelling storyline.  Right from the get go, you are given no context, besides a confusing narration, and poof, you’re on Myst.  Your character has no name, and there is no explanation of your place in the story.  Things only get worse from here, with the disconnected feeling persisting through the Ages.  The Ages have no context to the world of Myst (except through the many books in the library area on Myst Island, but let’s be honest, nobody wants to read all those.) and the puzzles within are not related to the story at all.  By this, I mean that taking the time to learn about the story does not help you at all in the game play - you could completely finish the game with no knowledge of the story whatsoever.  In short, the story felt very secondary and generally disconnected for other elements of the game.In spite of these issues, MYST was still a great play.  Start to finish (all achievements) took me a little under 8 hours.  I enjoyed playing the game, and would recommend it as a weekend game for retro fans.Overall rating: 8/10			"

Update June 2015:Over a year has passed since my initial review, which in hindsight I realize was pretty harsh. As a 3D artist who was inspired by Myst to work in the games industry, I have high expectations of Cyan. While I was grateful for an update of Myst, I mainly focused on the negatives, intending for the heavy critique to stand in contrast as tough love.When news came to me that the game had been updated, I reinstalled because I believed RMME deserved another shot. It is difficult to express what a massive difference the latest update made for me, but I will try to express it in few words.The spark is back.Upon loading up the game and wandering the various Ages, all I could focus on was what felt right. The controls felt right (especially Free Roam). Day and night felt right. I am charmed by the chunky new rock formations and lovely handcrafted textures on almost every surface. Visually, every Age feels far more cohesive, which goes a long way to selling the whole. These are real places.It's an entirely different game and I'm excited to revisit it again, hopefully with some VR goodness down the line. I have changed my review to now recommend the game. Thank you, Cyan.--March 3, 2014 Review:I purchased the new realMyst on Steam for the sole purpose of having a copy of Myst that will actually run on modern hardware. Revisiting Myst is a tradition for me. The feeling of ""standing"" on Myst Island is akin to building a warm fire in my brain. It is a deep, nostalgic trip to my childhood; dreamlike, mesmerizing, and incredibly familiar. I return to Myst to remind myself of who I was when I was younger, and reflect on the person I am now. I was optimistic when purchasing the new Unity-based realMyst, despite some disappointing pre-release screenshots. Unfortunately, my fears were well-founded.realMyst: Masterpiece Edition (RMME) suffers from dramatic inconsistency. It is often sloppy and unoptimized, but can be, at times, staggeringly beautiful.I feel the consistency in art direction which made the original realMyst [which also suffered from poor optimization] look good for its time was lost to accommodate for shaders and surface normals in the Unity engine. I suspect most of the normal maps from the game were generated from the original diffuse textures in CrazyBump, and not much care was put into the nooks and crannies to make things look right. The original Myst gave attention to every detail, with every bolt and screw painstakingly rendered. RMME is plagued with glaring texture seams and poor texel density distribution across the various Ages. Things are not made to look lived in, but are clean with poorly tiled textures. Comparing the foliage on Myst Island to Channelwood, I can't help but think how some level-of-detail work could have really paid off while showcasing some of Unity's best features, or would have at least made these choices less apparent.When the game gets dark, it gets really dark. I imagine the flashlight was included to combat this, but it only serves as a painful reminder that the artists neglected to put proper spec maps on models. Everything I shine the flashlight on turns a blinding white, even with bloom disabled.*The control scheme has also taken a misstep from the original realMyst. In Free-Roam mode, you are unable to stand in one place and look around without holding right-click, and the cursor reacts awkwardly as you look around. Moving up and down ladders is a chore, and having to rely on my meta-game first-person camera instincts to navigate breaks all immersion the game tries to render. Classic Mode completely locks your camera view, disabling the ability to appreciate various angles in realtime without accessing the menu again to disable it. I believe while trying to simplify the control scheme that the designers have in fact created a more cumbersome system that alienates and punishes users who are already familiar with playing first person games on the PC.I hold out hope that Cyan plans to release future updates to refine RMME, for I would really appreciate having it be my go-to Myst game in the future. The fact that Myst, Myst: ME, and realMyst cannot be made to work on modern hardware without breaking your computer is tragic.[Edit: I stated before that there was no hot-key for the flashlight, which somehow I recall the F key being unresponsive in-game. I tried again and it works. I've edited my review to reflect this. Thanks, Vec! *I also realize that the flashlight brightness may just seem a tad high rather than the spec maps being wacky. Sorry for that.] "

												I played the original version of myst as a kid on my PS1. I never finished it because I had no idea what I was doing at the time and never got a chance to play it again because we had to sell it. While browsing the store one day, I found this little gem and it stays true to the original Myst, even including some old animations found in the original. This is a beautifully remastered version of the orignal Myst and anyone that enjoys a good puzzle game should definitely pick this up.			"

I didn't particularly like the click to move option then, so I am glad this version came out with the option for ""w/a/s/d"" for movement. The graphics are way better, definitely on par with some of the more modern games. It would be awesome if the other games were redone too. I bought Riven also which has a major jump in complexity from Myst. Hope to get Myst V and Uru before the summer sale ends, just wondering why Myst III exile is not on here.			"

The story of Atrus and Catherine and the fall of D'ni is one of the best ever told. Being able to visit the resting place of Ti'ana was a nice surprise but, the addition of one book in the library was the highlight of the game. It makes me feel hopeful...I still have my journals...I still hear D'ni calling.			"

												I originally played Myst after playing through its sequel Riven back in 1997 (17 years ago!)  realMyst was such a delightful bit of nostalgia and is definitely an improvement over the old game.  If you've never played a Myst franchise game, you may have difficulty adjusting to this playstyle.  There are no enemies, no time limits, no experience points, no health bar, and no quest log.  These games are visual art where puzzles must be solved to progress the story.This is definitely a game that needs to be played.  The graphics are improved, even if the polygon count is low.  The ambience is spectacular (which is a requirement for Myst series games).

I also remember that the original real myst had a bug that it was eventually crashing whwn loading a level. And, do you know, what? This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t crashed on my first lauch. The didn't fixed this, i guess, very known bug, so i consider they didn't use a new engine. They just took the old game, modified it a bit and want money for this. Definetely not recommended.

												If you ejoyed Portal or Antichamber, I must say you have to try this game. I did play the original a bit, but didn't get far. I dare say nostalgia didn't cloud too much my judgement since I had so little experience (for you afraid other reviewers might have played the original). The 3D graphics seems to free from the constraint of having to examine each of a series of screens meticulously, and instead you get more focused on solving the puzzles themselves as they come up.This really is a masterpiece, even more in this format and beautiful graphics. I don't think there's anything quite like it out there.			"

												As a player of the Original MYST, MYST Masterpiece Edition, and now this edition, I can say that this version lives up to the predecessor versions in addition to having some wonderful graphics for screenshots and nostalgia whatnot. The fact that this version has a little overlay to compare to the original is very nice and allows one to appreciate how the look has improved. There is also now surround sound and higher sound quality to compliment the upgrade. The price is a touch high if you've already played the game, as vets will be able to go through the full game in a couple hours or so unless you get stuck in the Selentic underground (again). I did not notice any bugs playing through this.If you have never played Myst, try this. Getting older versions of MYST can be painful and time consuming, and likely not worth it unless you're going for nostalgia of an earlier time. If you do need help with an earlier version of MYST message me/leave a comment and I'll help you. I wrestled with MYST Masterpiece Edition for 4 hours to get it working.			"

												As a girl that grew up and watched her father playing this game, it was a real treat to be able to play an updated version of Myst.  I remember not understanding how my dad figured out the clues and it didn't seems like there was ever an end goal.  As I grew up, I tended to gravitate more towards puzzle games and solving room puzzles to continue on.  I was always intrigued by this game and this remake is everything and more.  They enhanced the ability to navigate on more of a free will basis instead of moving at predetermined intervals.  The graphic quality is enhanced but the overall game is the same, which I think is perfect.  I only hope that they continue on with the reboots of the sequels, starting with Riven of course.  Once, they do.  I will definitely buy it the second it is released.			"

												I played the original in college 20 years ago and absolutely loved it.  Before then, nobody had really taken on such a graphically beautiful (for the day) point-and-click puzzler.  With the new updates, I found that although I solved it back then, the challenges were still fun and twenty years of separation had dulled memory enough that I didn't have all the answers immediately so it was a fun replay.  Taking it to the first-person space gave it a whole new feel and the updated graphics though not photo-realistic were still enjoyable.  If the devs are reading, please do this for Riven and the rest of the series too!			"

												A walk down memory lane. I remember playing the original MYST a good 20 years ago back when I had my first CD-Rom computer. The game intrigued me with its photo realistic settings and complex puzzle solving. A classic through and through. Now with today's technology, we can finally explore the worlds of MYST in full 3D movement; something many have pined for since the game's advent. It is well worth it with Day/Night cycles, some weather effects, and improved visuals. Some may be turned off by the controls, but there is an option to play it oldschool style by just clicking where you want to go. Fans are more likely to enjoy this, but newcomers should enjoy it too. Let's hope the other games in the MYST series get this treatment. Would totally buy a realRiven if it existed.			"

How they tell the story, designed the puzzles and the world is something I've never seen before nor will likely see again.			"

One of my favourite things about it is how the Endgame is literally staring you in the face from the very beginning, and how the game doesn't force you do do anything in any particular order. Instead progression is directed by how much information you have on the worlds. If traditional FPS games aren't your thing this is well worth a try!			"

												tl;dr version: Highly recommended if you like adventure games and/or puzzles, and if you don't rage on non-major technical issues.--------------------------------Since I'm mostly used to point-and-click or modern adventure games, Myst was a new experience for me. It's a great concept- the player has to rely on visual and auditory observations to solve some large-scale puzzles, which are all completely logical and range in difficulty from easy to medium-hard (but I've played quite a lot of adventure games and am used to them; newcomers to adventure gaming may find the puzzles harder, but still doable). There is no pixel-hunting and no inventory system, which automatically dispenses with inventory item combination puzzles found in most adventure games.The developers suggest playing the game as if the players were actually present in the Myst universe, for a fully immersive experience and to better appreciate the story. Therefore I recommend playing Myst when you have quite a bit of spare time and are mentally relaxed. This is not the sort of game you'd want to play to take a break from your hectic activities or in the midst of a busy time to relieve stress. I made that mistake and my general attitude was just to plough through all the puzzles. Nevertheless, even though I didn't pay much attention to the story (or the environmental story-related clues), I found it fairly intriguing.The environments are simultaneously strange and beautiful, and have certain mystic feel to them (probably why the game is called Myst?). There are not a whole lot of things to interact with, which I think is very good, because that means there's very little noise in terms of puzzle-solving; most of the things the player can interact with are related to some puzzle or the other. The music and soundscapes are soothing and appropriate to the environments, especially in Rime age.Now for some technical issues- first of all, realMyst: Masterpiece Edition is a remastered edition (graphics/interface overhaul) of realMyst, which itself was a remastered edition of Myst. The masterpiece edition also has a free roam feature. In the previous versions, the player had to click on a place the go there and the field of view was quite limited, which may have been restrictive but was not necessarily a bad thing. However, mouse movement in free roam view is very clunky. There are no subtitles, which makes it hard to listen to the characters' monologues, and there are no options to adjust the music level. The graphics aren't -that- good and the game suffers from poor optimization.Still, I highly recommend it for adventure gaming or puzzle aficionados who don't mind the above-mentioned issues (plus RMME supports achievements and trading cards, and has additional puzzles to Myst or realMyst).

												This game is fantastic! I remember playing it so long ago and this really brought back the memories! I recomend this game to anybody looking for a challenge or to anybody who, like me, has the old CD-ROM disc that won't work on anything newer and definetly not Mac OSx. The only thing I did not like was the bit of color change that they did. I used the shift key a lot (It shows the old picture) to see things from a different ""angle."" However, this is a must get! When looking for the sequel of this game, ""Riven: The Sequel to Myst,"" it's going to be easier to try and get your discs to work on an older OS of windows. Do not buy the Steam version, it does not work (well). Instead, google search ""The Starry Expance Project"" and support those guys in their efforts to do to Riven what was done to this version of Myst.			"

												If you played the original Myst or one of its remakes (Myst Masterpiece, realMyst, Myst for iOS) then you will enjoy this remake that takes the old game and puts it into a modern engine.  If you have never played Myst, this is perhaps the best way to get acquainted with the series by starting at the beginning in a modern game engine.  There are a few shortcomings, the framerate is a bit slow at some points and the controls are bit clunky, but besides that, this is a classic 1990s game updated to 2010s standards, and I would give it an 8/10.

The graphics are way better, definitely on par with some of the more modern games. It would be awesome if the other games were redone too. I bought Riven also which has a major jump in complexity from Myst. Hope to get Myst V and Uru before the summer sale ends, just wondering why Myst III exile is not on here.			"

I am looking forward to the new game..is it called ""OBDUCTION""?   I am very sad that RIVEN will not save on my system 8.  I searched to buy a second version that would accomodate 8 but could not find one.  I am getting a bit discouraged.  Still hoping that someone has an answer.  I didn't have a bit of trouble with REAL MYST: Masterpiece Edition for system 8.  What is the difference?   It is really beautifully artistically done.   Of course, nothing thrills me like URU.  It was so fun to see all of the dimensions.  I would love to see my character actually rest somewhere.  I feel like she has worked so hard.  That just shows you how realistic this experience is.Don't quit.  Give Riven a chance.  I am proud of CYAN and STEAM for allowing those who love mind stimulation for the more mature adults.

												As someone who grew up on Myst and Riven, a new rendition of this classic is always welcomed. Yes, it has issues. But honestly, I feel as though they're kinda small issues. Small enough to the point that I can look past them to see the beauty of realMyst: Masterpiece Edition. Seeing all the ages of Myst in this much detail is simply breathtaking, in my eyes. It's not CryEngine, but honestly, it doesn't need to be. The placement of foliage, the color choices, texturing, modeling, it's all phenomenal.Honestly, the only real con I have about this game is the optimization. It's not great right now. Maybe Cyan will fix it, maybe not. With them working on Obduction, we may never see another optimization patch for this game for a while.Overall, I'd give this game an 8/10.-1 for optimization, and -1 for the semi-steep price point.

												This is the best way to play the original Myst. It's a full recreation of the game in Unity, from what I can tell, and it's absolutely amazing.Let me start by saying that playing through this in a single summer day near-single-handedly sparked my interest in the series. That wasn't even a month ago, and I'm already working through Myst IV.There's no game (well, except maybe the new Cyan game, Obduction) that can or ever will surpass the surreal and immersive feeling that Myst gives you, not to mention realMyst: Masterpiece Edition.""Immersive."" That's a word thrown around in the VR ecosystem, right?Well, here, you don't need VR to feel immersed. While that would certainly make it just that much better, it really isn't necessary. This game is spectacular.The way the game works, you roam around worlds that are written as books, solving puzzles to collect pages for other books. That's all I'll tell you, as I don't want to spoil your experience. Gameplay is awesome, and the graphics and sounds make it even sweeter.And dang, the music. It's so good. Just wait until you hear the music play as you hold the Myst linking book in your hands... Beginning of the game, okay?The story is hard to find at first, but it's there. It's a good one, too. Once you see the conclusion, you will want to play the sequel (which, by the way, you should buy the DVD version on Ebay, not Steam).Oh, sequels? Yeah, there are four of them, and the only kinda bad one is Myst IV: Revelation (the one Ubisoft made).			"

												The most impressive thing is every location you land on serves as big functional machine and you have to really understand how they work intuitively instead of just playing some math and graphical gymnastics. That being said, some sections are underwhelmingly easy and the puzzle play is somehow restricted due to the lack inventory system. The graphics are realistic and the mouse click feels unresponsive, therefore the biggest difficulty is often figuring out which pixel on the screen is interactive.For reviews and other article about games, visit my blog http://silverthorns.kinja.com/ "

												Note: I've never played the original Myst. Also it is to my understanding that this was intended to be as identical to the original, complete with dated movement and camera controls (which I used in contrast to free movement WASD). Personally I found the free camera to be unwieldy and nauseating.realMyst: Masterpiece Edition is an enjoyable game that really attempted to mimic the original in everything down to the puzzles. The puzzles were fairly difficult, and if you missed any clue, you were dead in the water. I found that the game didn't hand hold, and you couldn't really tell which object was interactable. The story was minimal, but the embedded videos were an interesting addition and the acting was portrayed in very different, but positive, way.Graphics-wise, the atmospheric effects were a nice touche as was the day/night cycle. However for a 2014 game, the 3D models were very dry and plain in some levels. 9/10.			"

												Being a console gamer, I was mostly oblivious to PC games. Most of the computer games I've played were board games, Solitaire, ""push-the-block"" puzzle games, and Space Cadet Pinball. It wasn't until recent years, where I found out about the world of early PC games, particularly LucasArts point n' click adventures, such as the Monkey Island series, but chose to stick with my N64 and PS2. As I continued gaming, I became more and more accustomed to the newer generations, but as gaming morphed into a soulless machine spewing out nothing but meatheads in power-armor teabagging endless n00bs, boring brown enviroments, gun and ragdoll physics, etc, I started exploring the realms the more cerebral games of yore just to keep my interest in the hobby alive. One of the games in particular that peaked my interest in the adventure genre is, Myst. Myst is a graphic adventure game from 1993. The game thrived on the PC back then and was remade and ported several times on many systems, including the Playstation, Sega Saturn, the Jaguar CD of all things, and Nintendo DS & 3DS (Both are regarded as the worst ports of the game) I did prior research in the game and checked out a bunch of reviews. Almost all of them kept yapping about how they loved this game as a kid, all this nostalgia-gushing, how the reviewers kept kissing the game's♥♥♥♥♥ I kept thinking, ""Is there ANY reviewer sees this game for what it is, other than from childhood significance?"" I decided to give the game a shot on my PS3, via PSOne Classics. I played it and I hated it...at firstIn the game, you take the role of the stranger. Some random stumble-♥♥♥♥ who happens upon a book that transports him/her to the island of Myst. The Stranger is left with no choice, but to explore the island. The island holds a library, a rocket, an observatory, a cabin, and a power room. All of which contain puzzles for the Stranger to solve. These puzzles reveal four different books that transport the Stranger to different worlds, called ""Ages"". Upon entering the library, the Stranger finds two standalone books, the red and blue book. Both contain a message shrouded in static as both books have missing pages. The pages have been scattered through the different Ages located on Myst Island. The Stranger is now tasked to piece together why he/she is there by putting together the books and deciphering the messages. The main detractor of the game is the whole graphic adventure aspect. As soon as you start the game, it places you on a picture of the island, and a cursor. You start clicking around and realize your means of locomotion are through pointing and clicking, suffering screen-by-screen. I've been spoiled by 3D-games like Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, even first-person games like Perfect Dark. The screen-by-screen felt really strange and slow. It took time to get used to it and I eventually stopped noticing. As soon as I got used to it, I was in for a cerebral, and sometimes obtuse ride. The game averts several gaming mechanics. There is no combat system, no enemies to fight, no risk of dying, no time limit, and no hands to hold. Myst Island is your oyster! Also, be prepared to take notes. Seriously, you're going to have to write a whole bunch of stuff down. Many of the puzzles involve memorizing numbers, symbols, safe combinations, some of them are visual puzzles, some are auditory (One involves deciphering sounds to distinguish between north, south, east, and west) This isn't a game that you play, but one that you experience. It's solely about piecing together the story of how you got there and how you're supposed to leave.Myst is quite a unique experience. I'd liken it to those ""escape the Room"" puzzles, but on a much bigger scale. The puzzles are challenging, if not a bit obtuse, the settings look nice, given the old graphics (I'd recommend the Masterpiece Edition, an HD remastering) and story seems interesting, (Though, I'll have to play the other 4 to get the whole story). If you're tired of teabagging n00bs and wish to experience a game that involves your grey matter, rather than an itchy trigger finger, then step up and see what you've been missing.			"

												I never got to play Myst when it was originally released so it was nice to get the oppurtunity now. For a 20 year old game they've done a nice job of making it look good. This game just drops you onto Myst island with no hand holding advice about what to do. You need to explore and figure things out. I really liked the puzzles in this game. Theres no obscure ridiculous ones. They all felt intuitive and if you explore your surroundings enough you'll eventually figure out the solution. The game really does a great job of giving subtle hints and clues. ( Thats not to say i didn't need to google a hint every now and again).Good points:- Nice remastered graphics- The islands in the game make for a very memorable setting. They seem so unique and unusual that it fits the game perfectly- Brilliant puzzles that are intuitive enough that they dont frustrate.Bad points:- The free roam controls felt a bit fiddly when walking aboutOverall this is a great game that im glad i finally got to play. If you havent ever played this game it's worth picking up this edition. Also worth mentioning if your completely stuck on a puzzle, try the Myst guide on Universal Hints System instead of just googling the answers. It'll give you useful hints without spoiling the answer as solving the puzzles yourself, even with a hint or two, is more enjoyable then just getting the direct solution.			"

												myst was the first game I ever played and was effectively my first gaming love so excuse me if my view is slightly biased towards amazing.this remake is stunning and although it has very little difference from the original gameplay wise and has some troubles in areas with lag especially rime although it's graphics make up for this in spades and these problems will likely be fixed in the future.it also has myst 5's free roam system so you don't have to slide along predecided routes this also allowed several easter eggs to be hidden in very sneaky locations but for those who liked the classic point and move system you can swap between them at will.word of warning you may need a fairly beefy computer to run this at the graphics levels where this remake really shines.all up an amazing remaster and with real riven in the works it could only get betterif you are a myst fan you will adore this game if not then if you don't want to spend 15+ dollars on this then consider the original myst first it may be old but it is significantly cheaper.

												I still remember this game when it came out in 1993. It was such a great looking game and created such a buzz that there was even an hour long program discussing the game and showing some of the gameplay and features. It was the first game I got when I bought my first computer in 1995. It has been 17 years since I last played the game.Now, here is realMYST. Much has changed from the original game. You can now play in free roam mode (classic mode still available for those who prefer, but if you are trying to get the achievements, you must play in free roam mode or you won't get many of them) which lets you look and move in 360 degrees. Graphically, it's not the revelation it was in 1993, but still looks solid. The music and sound effects are still the same with a few extra things thrown in. Still brings up the great nostalgic feeling I had back then. It has been awhile, so I don't remember much, so this game remains a solid challenge.The music and atmopshere of the game are what sill amaze me along with a strange and somewhat creepy story and adventure that you are lead on. Upon completion the game, you are now granted acces to another age called Rime. This is a very short and quite easy age, but the setting and a couple of smale things you can do are pretty cool, but pretty much a useless age. Pretty much a short part just before the Age of Riven. Only good if you wanna get the last 3 achievements done.Anyways, still a solid game for the right price and a good 10-12 hours of gameplay, as long as you can solve the puzzles and figure out what to do next. Good luck and good clicking.			"

												It's basically impossible to capture what was so amazing about the original Myst in 1993. These re-releases show that to me. But it can be nice to revisit the old island, check out how the spaceship is doing. See if that giant cog is still there, if that boiler still works.Moving around independently is nice, but adds little beyond seeing places previously rendered in still images from the occasional new angle. The updated graphics leave something to be desired. The game feels torn between being locked into its small levels from the 90s and expressing its beauty with the technology of today. In this way it begins to feel out of place, odd. For another example, the video of the brothers trapped in their books is painfully low-quality (understandably so!), and the ""distortion"" effect, reminiscent of VHS degradation or antenna tuning, shows its age.Part of what makes the appeal of the original Myst so unattainable is that I, we, are different people now. Not only was I extremely young and exploring a fantasy world for the first time, but in 20 years we've seen what games are capable of. We've explored amazing worlds with hidden stories and mysterious origins. Time and video gaming has moved on, and while Myst will be remembered for its landmark status at the time, it, like early 3D games, will be less playable going forward.I enjoyed the additional age after beating the game. It was a nice epilogue to the original. I liked that there was an internal help system for those who might need it. I felt it could have been implemented better, just like the controls, which I never fully got used to. But the additional feature is nice.I'm not sure if I recommend this generally. It's often really cheap, so there's little cost to getting it. If you want to relive a shadow, if a crisp, well-defined and anti-aliased shadow, of the original experience, get it. Don't expect magic, though.Hmm. It appears I HAVE to either recommend or not. I imagined this without a thumbs-up or -down. But given the price and the frequency it's on sale, it's an okay buy.(I wrote a more personal and sprawling review of this game[enduringbeta.com] on my website.)			"

												A walk down memory lane. I remember playing the original MYST a good 20 years ago back when I had my first CD-Rom computer. The game intrigued me with its photo realistic settings and complex puzzle solving. A classic through and through. Now with today's technology, we can finally explore the worlds of MYST in full 3D movement; something many have pined for since the game's advent. It is well worth it with Day/Night cycles, some weather effects, and improved visuals. Some may be turned off by the controls, but there is an option to play it oldschool style by just clicking where you want to go. Fans are more likely to enjoy this, but newcomers should enjoy it too. Let's hope the other games in the MYST series get this treatment. Would totally buy a realRiven if it existed.			"

												I played the original in college 20 years ago and absolutely loved it.  Before then, nobody had really taken on such a graphically beautiful (for the day) point-and-click puzzler.  With the new updates, I found that although I solved it back then, the challenges were still fun and twenty years of separation had dulled memory enough that I didn't have all the answers immediately so it was a fun replay.  Taking it to the first-person space gave it a whole new feel and the updated graphics though not photo-realistic were still enjoyable.  If the devs are reading, please do this for Riven and the rest of the series too!			"

												This probably the first PC game I ever played, and man, I've got to tell you something - this game is a must play. I didn't understand the game at all when I first played it - but about 15 years later, when I got the remastered version right here on Steam, it was like a whole new experience. The graphics in this remake are nice, and the free roam ability they added make the game even more interesting. The level designs of this game are so unique, it’s like something you’d see in a dream. Best of all, in a world as crazy as Myst, there’s an equally crazy story to it that you have to put together yourself. The best part about this game is the puzzles. I love a good puzzle, and this game almost managed to stump me in every area. Its games like this that are seldom seen today – where they pry at your mind and make you stop and think about what you have to do. The only downside to this, is that if you don’t figure out how to do something, you can be there for quite some time, and you will probably have look up a guide if you just don’t get what you’re supposed to do [*cough *cough railroads *cough] On a last note, this game has spectacular music whenever you’re in an area it plays. It creates an atmosphere for you to immerse yourself in, and give a little more emotion to the story. I wish I had the soundtrack myself, some of the music is really interesting. In conclusion, Myst is a game that I once played as a kid and had no idea what I was supposed to do. When I grew up and played the remastered version, it was like a whole new experience. It is my favorite 3D puzzle adventure game to date. Someday, I’d love to create a game just as good and memorable as Myst.P.S. – Don’t trust them boys. Just don’t – I’m warning you. "

Update June 2015:Over a year has passed since my initial review, which in hindsight I realize was pretty harsh. As a 3D artist who was inspired by Myst to work in the games industry, I have high expectations of Cyan. While I was grateful for an update of Myst, I mainly focused on the negatives, intending for the heavy critique to stand in contrast as tough love.When news came to me that the game had been updated, I reinstalled because I believed RMME deserved another shot. It is difficult to express what a massive difference the latest update made for me, but I will try to express it in few words.The spark is back.Upon loading up the game and wandering the various Ages, all I could focus on was what felt right. The controls felt right (especially Free Roam). Day and night felt right. I am charmed by the chunky new rock formations and lovely handcrafted textures on almost every surface. Visually, every Age feels far more cohesive, which goes a long way to selling the whole. These are real places.It's an entirely different game and I'm excited to revisit it again, hopefully with some VR goodness down the line. I have changed my review to now recommend the game. Thank you, Cyan.--March 3, 2014 Review:I purchased the new realMyst on Steam for the sole purpose of having a copy of Myst that will actually run on modern hardware. Revisiting Myst is a tradition for me. The feeling of ""standing"" on Myst Island is akin to building a warm fire in my brain. It is a deep, nostalgic trip to my childhood; dreamlike, mesmerizing, and incredibly familiar. I return to Myst to remind myself of who I was when I was younger, and reflect on the person I am now. I was optimistic when purchasing the new Unity-based realMyst, despite some disappointing pre-release screenshots. Unfortunately, my fears were well-founded.realMyst: Masterpiece Edition (RMME) suffers from dramatic inconsistency. It is often sloppy and unoptimized, but can be, at times, staggeringly beautiful.I feel the consistency in art direction which made the original realMyst [which also suffered from poor optimization] look good for its time was lost to accommodate for shaders and surface normals in the Unity engine. I suspect most of the normal maps from the game were generated from the original diffuse textures in CrazyBump, and not much care was put into the nooks and crannies to make things look right. The original Myst gave attention to every detail, with every bolt and screw painstakingly rendered. RMME is plagued with glaring texture seams and poor texel density distribution across the various Ages. Things are not made to look lived in, but are clean with poorly tiled textures. Comparing the foliage on Myst Island to Channelwood, I can't help but think how some level-of-detail work could have really paid off while showcasing some of Unity's best features, or would have at least made these choices less apparent.When the game gets dark, it gets really dark. I imagine the flashlight was included to combat this, but it only serves as a painful reminder that the artists neglected to put proper spec maps on models. Everything I shine the flashlight on turns a blinding white, even with bloom disabled.*The control scheme has also taken a misstep from the original realMyst. In Free-Roam mode, you are unable to stand in one place and look around without holding right-click, and the cursor reacts awkwardly as you look around. Moving up and down ladders is a chore, and having to rely on my meta-game first-person camera instincts to navigate breaks all immersion the game tries to render. Classic Mode completely locks your camera view, disabling the ability to appreciate various angles in realtime without accessing the menu again to disable it. I believe while trying to simplify the control scheme that the designers have in fact created a more cumbersome system that alienates and punishes users who are already familiar with playing first person games on the PC.I hold out hope that Cyan plans to release future updates to refine RMME, for I would really appreciate having it be my go-to Myst game in the future. The fact that Myst, Myst: ME, and realMyst cannot be made to work on modern hardware without breaking your computer is tragic.[Edit: I stated before that there was no hot-key for the flashlight, which somehow I recall the F key being unresponsive in-game. I tried again and it works. I've edited my review to reflect this. Thanks, Vec! *I also realize that the flashlight brightness may just seem a tad high rather than the spec maps being wacky. Sorry for that.] "

Apart from ""it's better than the 3DS version"" -First of all, unless you've literally never played any version of this game before, the puzzles are not going to surprise you because THEY ARE STILL EXACTLY THE SAME. You can literally dig out your old notes from twenty years ago and use them to get through to the endgame.  This is probably my only real complaint with the re-releases of Myst, at least as far as the gameplay is concerned; would it have been so hard to add a random element to the puzzles?  Or maybe change a couple of them a little?  (Well, okay, there's a new Rime age and all, but even that one has been recycled from the original RealMyst.)So I guess nostalgia rules in the realm of Myst... but the main appeal of this game has always been its appearance, and I'm happy to say that has improved.  This version updates the original RealMyst to bring it in line with what modern hardware can produce, and the full 3D movement makes navigating the islands much easier (Channelwood treetops, I'm loking at you).The Steam version brings Myst up to date with Achievements, because that's what the kids are into these days (okay, I had fun trying to get them all too).If you're into the quiet, cerebral and immersive type of game, why not go for the one that made itself a landmark and give this game a try?  If you're an old fan of the game, there won't be too much in the way of new content to bring you back, but you'll have already made up your mind on this game by now anyway!			"

												An absolute gem.The added 3rd dimension with the great graphics and day/night cycle really brings life to the Myst universe.I loved exploring the ages again in free roam mode.Often I would just stop and just listen to the sounds and watch the sunset/scenery.I can't believe 22 years have passed since I first played this great game.Do yourself a favor and buy this game. You won't regret it (probably :D )Now... if only they would remake the other games in the series. One can dream...			"

												If you ejoyed Portal or Antichamber, I must say you have to try this game. I did play the original a bit, but didn't get far. I dare say nostalgia didn't cloud too much my judgement since I had so little experience (for you afraid other reviewers might have played the original). The 3D graphics seems to free from the constraint of having to examine each of a series of screens meticulously, and instead you get more focused on solving the puzzles themselves as they come up.This really is a masterpiece, even more in this format and beautiful graphics. I don't think there's anything quite like it out there.			"

												I love MYST. It was one of the first games I ever played as a child. Came out 1993 and I played it a lot when I was between 5 - 8. I used to spend hours and hours trying to figure out the mysteries of the island with my brother and neighbour. A few years ago when realMyst came out I was super excited because my original copy of Myst no longer worked since my computer was too new. Alas, realMyst was plauged with crashes and didn't work on newer hardware/software. I thought this game may be forever lost to me as nothing but a very fond memory...constantly haunting me as the game I could never finish. (As a child I was only able to ever complete the mechanical world.) Then I found the remastered 2.0 version and it ran perfectly on my windows 8.1 and I finally got to relive and complete all those childhood memories. It is bittersweet in a way. The game was so fantastic in my memory and now that it is done the mystery that has haunted me my whole life is gone. I was however finally able to finish a task I set out to complete 20 year ago though and that felt great too. The remake is awesome. It stays true to the game while adding functionality. Also there is a little surpise at the end but I won't spoil that ;) If you haven't played MYST ever then for sure pick this up, even being 22 some odd years old it holds up fantastically if you have played it, there isn't really much new to keep you interested unless you are looking to run down memory lane...but this game is fantastic and will always haunt my dreams, and MYST will always be that perfect lonley island I will wander in my dreams.10/10 for max feels from a game thats hardly a GB big.

												This game brought back a whole lot of nostalgia for me. My dad used to play it back when I was a kid and when I asked him to play, I got no where. Definately not a kid game; not because it is graphic, which it is not at all, but because of the percise logic that this game demands from you. However, I resorted to watching my dad play it hours on end. The mysterious storyline and the music is captivating. I've been looking for it all over since I'm a lot older and I own a Mac (it used to only be on PCs). I just beat the game, but if it wasn't for the hints, I'd still be banging my head on my desk. What I appreciated is that they put hints/clues that did not give you direct answers unless you really wanted them. They gave you clues or thoughts to help trigger solutions to problems you might be facing. You start off this game by entering this Age called Myst and you just have to explore since you don't know how or why you got there. If you liked Amnesia, which starts the same way and also requires you to explore to find clues and requires reading, this is a great game. However, it is NOT as dark as Amnesia. It is more Sci-Fy then Horror and there are no monsters jumping out at you. But this game can be very eerie, simply because you are alone. There's no other physical beings around you, just their stories that have been left behind. It also requires you to figure out who and what to trust based on your judgment. There's 4 possible endings to the game. If you like strategy or findings clues and putting one and two together, get this game. Some of the visuals changed from the original PC, but it was still satisfying for me. There's so much thought and logic put into the puzzles in this game, which can make it VERY challenging. Will forever recommend.			"

												After nearly 18 years, I have finally managed to complete one of the first Windows-based games I ever played.When I began the original Myst as a kid, I was clearly stumped by the (then) challenging puzzles, and never made it past the Mechanical age, let alone completed the game.Being not only to complete the game, but be able to move around in a (now) normal fashion satisfied a need I wasn't aware I carried for two decades.For those that still wish to complete what they never finished as a child, this is the game for you. Otherwise, this is a hit-or-miss depending on how much you enjoyed things like Ether One or similar slow-pace puzzle games.			"

												10/10Fans of the original game will absolutely love this! I thought this game looked great as a child 20 years ago but wow the remastered edition is beautiful. The graphics really do set the tone and atmosphere of the game much better than the original. You feel utterly helpless, lost and alone in this puzzling realm. While yes it is a little pricey it's worth it in the end for the nostalgia value and I generally don't buy on nostalgia alone. The edition of the ability to free roam is by far the best; all these little things I never noticed in the original surprise me every now and then. This is most certainly a game I'll be coming back to again and again as the years go by.			"

												I started playing this series in 1997 when Riven came out. That game was very challenging in those days but I eventually beat it. I always wanted to play Myst because Riven didn't make much sense because I never knew any backstory. I eventually borrowed a friend's copy of Myst in 2002 or so and played it and loved it. I researched into the series and found out there was a 3D remake of Myst called realMyst. I found a copy of it at Staples (lol) and played the crap out of it. Even though it was fun, you could tell there were issues with the controls and the game had many glitches. But this right here? THIS is what Cyan should have made when the timing was right. I LOVE that you can play with the old point and click controls, because I was very fond of those controls in the past. I just finished this for the first time and did it pretty quick because I remembered all of the puzzle solutions, but it was still just as fun as I remembered.I highly recommend this to fans of adventure games with a good story and good puzzles. The ""book"" cutscenes haven't aged well, but I can see why they kept MOST of the original videos. Recasting wouldn't make much sense, but that's just a small complaint.Here's hoping Steam eventually gets Myst III and Myst IV.			"

												This probably the first PC game I ever played, and man, I've got to tell you something - this game is a must play. I didn't understand the game at all when I first played it - but about 15 years later, when I got the remastered version right here on Steam, it was like a whole new experience. The graphics in this remake are nice, and the free roam ability they added make the game even more interesting. The level designs of this game are so unique, it’s like something you’d see in a dream. Best of all, in a world as crazy as Myst, there’s an equally crazy story to it that you have to put together yourself. The best part about this game is the puzzles. I love a good puzzle, and this game almost managed to stump me in every area. Its games like this that are seldom seen today – where they pry at your mind and make you stop and think about what you have to do. The only downside to this, is that if you don’t figure out how to do something, you can be there for quite some time, and you will probably have look up a guide if you just don’t get what you’re supposed to do [*cough *cough railroads *cough] On a last note, this game has spectacular music whenever you’re in an area it plays. It creates an atmosphere for you to immerse yourself in, and give a little more emotion to the story. I wish I had the soundtrack myself, some of the music is really interesting. In conclusion, Myst is a game that I once played as a kid and had no idea what I was supposed to do. When I grew up and played the remastered version, it was like a whole new experience. It is my favorite 3D puzzle adventure game to date. Someday, I’d love to create a game just as good and memorable as Myst.P.S. – Don’t trust them boys. Just don’t – I’m warning you. "

												Myst is a wonderful first person adventure puzzle game which gives the individual time to explore and “get lost” in five or six enchanted worlds.  There is no risk of dying, no mechanics or stats to maintain, and this really free's the player to get lost and explore the diverse and creative worlds Cyan have imagined. You're not given a map or directed how to proceed, and certainly when I first arrived in Myst I was like “huh?” I had no idea where to start. This may sound like a negative comment but both puzzles and the lack of direction did actually add to the mystery and made the game more enjoyable. You get the feeling “Right nobody is going to tell me what I need to do here so I better get on with it!”. I found that quality of the game unusual and attractive.Puzzles were mixed; some challenging, others I got immediately and others still I had to google (pathetic I know!). With respect to length I completed the game in roughly 8 hours but I imagine it largely depends how quickly you catch on. With respect to re-playability; I don't think I'd be able to replay until I've played enough games to “forget” what your supposed to do in each age. I think the game has replay value but after some time has passed.The graphics are dated and do look like they were taken from a Civ IV trailer (tangent: why the heck are Civ Game trailers so inconsistent with gameplay??). but the environments are still aesthetically pleasing. Myst Island does feel like a mesh-mash of clutter but once you begin to unpick the puzzle it is an enchanting place. With respect to the “hints” menu these are genuinely helpful and offer various levels of “hint” rather than just giving you the answers. At times I even kicked myself for using them having actually taken the next step and not realised! I think if the edition didn't come with them at times you simply wouldn't have a clue (well I wouldn't anyways!)Using my camera phone to take pictures of key bits of information was a must and I totally understand why some individuals historically kept note pads / journals on which to jot and sketch. Frankly unless you have an eidetic memory it's likely going to be more trouble without. Some areas in particular still have me confused but perhaps this was deliberate misdirection by the authors. For example what are those crystals for in the throne room? Or why is there a recording of a guy speaking a peculiar language in the last tree house? Given I still have 11 outstanding achievements I presume there is probably more to all this.While at this point it is perhaps moot to comment on possible improvements I will. I should perhaps first add the disclaimer that 1) I never played this back when it was first released 2) I've never played any other games in this series, and 3) I can only comment on this as a game played in 2017 with all the prejudice and experience that goes with that.The first was most obvious; the ages offer nothing more in storyline development. It isn't until you have collected all of the pages that you get the next storyline instalment from the brothers / father. It's definitely here a lost opportunity as the idea of books you can examine could have further developed each character were they found in the ages. Consequently the significant choice (red / blue cliché!) toward the end seems a little arbitrary because aside from what they have told us and what we have read in the library we have no other opportunity to learn anything further about the key characters.There is also limited [meaningful] interaction within the environments, and no other characters emerge as you play (such as the tree people) that were mentioned in the library. Aside from father and sons you actually don't meet anyone else with whom to interact. I'm undecided if this is a good or bad thing. Likely a good thing given the age of the game and how difficult it would have been to implement well all of the relevant characters.  A remastered edition could have offered the opportunity to provide a more richer and interactive environment. That said I can entirely understand the authors decision to remaster as true to the original as possible (I can only imagine the colourful comments and reviews that would have ensued by the unforgiving internet had they done otherwise) and omit new sections.With all of that said Myst Island and each of the ages offers a beautifully rendered environment to explore and get lost in. I found the game well priced, well balance and thoroughly enjoyable. Thanks Cyan I enjoyed myself and can't wait to pick up a copy of Rivan!			"

												As someone who grew up on Myst and Riven, a new rendition of this classic is always welcomed. Yes, it has issues. But honestly, I feel as though they're kinda small issues. Small enough to the point that I can look past them to see the beauty of realMyst: Masterpiece Edition. Seeing all the ages of Myst in this much detail is simply breathtaking, in my eyes. It's not CryEngine, but honestly, it doesn't need to be. The placement of foliage, the color choices, texturing, modeling, it's all phenomenal.Honestly, the only real con I have about this game is the optimization. It's not great right now. Maybe Cyan will fix it, maybe not. With them working on Obduction, we may never see another optimization patch for this game for a while.Overall, I'd give this game an 8/10.-1 for optimization, and -1 for the semi-steep price point.

												v2.0 is a great improvement - the right-click mouselook option solves the biggest issue I had with the game, making navigation as smooth as it should be. Thank you!There are still a couple of rough edges - most notably, changing the color of the crystals in Ryme requires click-and-hold rather than simply hovering as in the original realMyst, and there's no intuitive way to discover that. I had to look it up after assuming the game was bugged. Speaking of original-flavor realMyst, I also miss the day-night cycle in Selentic. The new skybox is cool, but I'm not sure it's worth losing that beautiful red-to-purple-to-black twilight.All that said, this is an absolutely beautiful game, superior to the original realMyst in pretty much every way not mentioned above, and should now be considered the definitive version of the game.

												An old, but not dated puzzle game that really holds its own despite the test of time. It still lives up to today's standards, and the lore of this whole series is incredibly deep and rich. Especially nowadays, where games aren't meant to be difficult, MYST is a welcome challenge, as it will keep you thinking and struggling, and the struggle only makes solving the puzzles even more gratifying. Rarely will you find the solution to something simply written down, and if you're playing through it for the first time, you could spend months just exploring the beautiful worlds in MYST. The only thing I can say is keep a journal while playing, you'll want to write down what you're doing and planning on doing so you don't lose your train of thought, and sometimes simply writing down what you've done will spark a thought on what to do next you wouldn't have thought of otherwise. Plus, there are plenty of things you'll want to have recorded for later, such as number sequences and such. Believe me, this game is difficult, if I hadn't kept a journal while playing, I wouldn't have completed it, but that difficulty could hardly be called a con. If you like puzzle games, good story, or are simply tired of multiplayer and simple games, you should definitely give MYST a try. The updated graphics in this version are worth the extra money (plus there's some extra content that I won't spoil here), trust me.			"

												As I hardly knew anything about this game prior to this Steam Summer Sales of 2014, I was a bit sceptical about the fact that this modernized version of the 2000 release was named: Masterpiece Edition. Once I bought and played realMyst out of sheer curiosity, I was quickly convinced it was truly one of the best exploration and adventure/mystery experiences that can be had on the computer screen.Do not let the 'Point & Click' gameplay frighten you, the controls have been adapted to more modern players in this overhauled release of the game, and players can choose to move around using the keyboard.I realize that it can be hard for someone to get into realMyst if they are not fond of exploration games, but I definitely recommend this game otherwise.

												MYST: Masterpiece, realMyst: Interactive 3D, realMYST: Masterpiece, MYST VR... They keep remaking this game because it is a masterpiece. Is this the best version? Your taste may very. I suggest finding the oldest or newest version and playing that.			"
