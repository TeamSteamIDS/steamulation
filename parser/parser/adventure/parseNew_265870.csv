												Alpha Kimori is a sci-fi Japanese-style RPG set on a planet that humans have colonized and fled to, and home to two warring factions: one that wants to reclaim Earth, and one that wants to live in peace on their new home.This game is really bad.In a good RPG, combat requires some tactical decisions and creative use of skills and abilities to beat tougher enemies. In Alpha Kimori, combat is purely a grind, with 99% of fights requiring nothing more than mashing Attack, 1% requiring the occasional Defend command to heal, and 0% of the fights requiring the use of a skill. The sole exception to this rule is the final battle, which is the game's only interesting fight. I highly recommend using JoyToKey and setting up a turbo controller so that it will do the button mashing for you.In a good RPG, characters are deep and memorable, live in an interesting world, and take part in a grand story. In Alpha Kimori, the plot is dumb and predictable, the heroes have no interesting qualities, and the world is shallow.Here's the plot: one faction likes to kill animals and people to drain their energy. Our heroes are the only few people that think that rampant murder might be wrong. So, after murdering a few hundred bunnies and birds, the heroes decide to abandon their home for another faction that is only a little less bloodthirsty. A few times, they remember the one defining moment in their lives (the one time someone said that killing was mean) in the form of about ten flashbacks to the same event. There's supposedly a romance in there too, but our leads have less chemistry than oil and water.I should also mention that the quest design is awful. It mostly consists of running through the same dungeons over and over again, sometimes taking the long way around just to stretch out the game.The graphics look decent, except that the character won't stay anywhere near the center of the screen. The music is upbeat but not at all memorable. The controls are sub-par, and the game is in desperate need of a sprint button.I really only continued this game out of a morbid curiosity to see how bad it would get. The bad news is that this game really just isn't even entertaining. For most of my playtime with Alpha Kimori, I was actually playing Mario Golf and letting the turbo controller do all the heavy lifting. This game is a tedious mess, and I can't recommend it to anyone, even if you get it free.The developer needs to get the first game right before continuing with this ""trilogy"".			"

												Excellent Game, been awhile since I played something that really kept me interested story wise. Also liked the classic JRPG feeling, I look forward to part two when you release it!			"

												""So Hashbrick do you recommend Alpha Kimori Episode 1?""""Absolutely!"" is what I would have said if it didn't have so many things wrong with it.  At this point it is nothing more than a ""Well if you like RPGs and don't mind a huge let down...be my guest""Let's go down the list of everything that just makes this a disappointment in any regard.CONSShort - 5-7hrs depending on how hard you grind there isn't much going for it.  The story has a hard time taking off and when you are done you are still wondering what exactly went on in that short time frame.  This is exactly why RPGs were never made in episode form originally, it is hard to tell a meaningful story in a short period of time.Soundtrack - Get ready to hear the same damn music over and over.  One of the songs actually sounds like watching a citcom where it hits the high notes and out comes the actors running down the stairs with their names appearing.  It is a very odd taste of music and you will groan everytime you hear it even with the short episode.Lack of Strategy - The only time you will ever use ""skills"" is on boss fights to quickly defeat them, other than that the whole game is cruise control of spamming just attack and watching♥♥♥♥♥♥die.  There is no weaknesses or status effects just a minor attack up, attack down system.Redone & Overused Areas - Get ready to go to the same damn areas you go through in the beginning of the game with the exception of the final area that is new everything is rehashed for every quest and side quest.  You litteraly do not venture more than a woods right next to your town and nothing more.  There is times where you wish they'd just wipe the enemies clean and just let you run instead of running into lvl 1♥♥♥♥♥♥at lvl 32 just cause its the very first area but you need to do quest X here for the 10th time.Story - Extremely weak story of a love triangle (or lack there of) between a brain dead, can't think for myself female that is obbsessed with the main character to the point it makes you sick.  Then this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ likes the chick you could care less about while you hunt for another chick on the other faction to realize that you could care less about your own morals that were forced on you by your crazy♥♥♥♥♥parents who have no problem to just kill you off if you fail your exam?!?!  Oh ya and something about some alpha ship that came from Earth to this planet, with two factions; one that wants to get back to Earth and one that wants to just stay and make the best of it, who then made these Kimori human like things but not considered humans who consider themselves gods, while 7 souls of angels that turn into some kinda gem thing implanted in 7 different characters that can call these angel things in battle, while the other faction can turn into enemies and the reason to kill monsters on the planet is to harness their ki energy for....reasons.  Confused yet?  Good don't expect anything else when it ends there is nothing if anything explained in this crazy mindless plot. (It is suppose to sound like a run-on because of how short the episode is and how much they jam in your throat)Items That Don't Matter - Throw your items in the garbage, you will never use them if you are on par with the levels you should be.  As for weapons and armor you will get hand outs during the story no point of ever using the stores ever...Lack of world building - There is no detail in most the areas you will travel through, just plain grass, caves, one town and a small one with little to nothing in it.Cutscenes - Not only will you see the same cutscene cut up in different places over 10 times in different points in the game as they ram it home that ""this is the defining moment of change!""  You will also be greeted to ingame cutscenes that require npc movement that takes so long and you can't move until its complete.  The graduation ceremony you watch 3 npcs walk up take their document and go back to their place, for what, what point is there making the player wait a long♥♥♥♥♥time for no gain, no dialog, just movement...  Seems like they just did one flash back and cut it up cause it was too much work.PROSGraphics - looks good for a 2D RPG, models are nicely detailed.Battle Engine - While not having to actually use it much, it is overall a well built battle engine turn based menu system.Character Building - While being short it does a ok job at detailing some of the characters and giving them a background, this is probably the shining moment in the game and the only shining moment.  There are some cliched character of course but for the most part the reasons and ambitions are clearly detailed throughout the short episode.FINAL THOUGHTSIf you like a RPG with a meaty story, look elsewhere.  If you don't mind grinding mindlessly and go through the same areas over and over again for a little piece of pie (the story or lack thereof) then by all means take the plunge.  I can't recommend this game based on the obvious issues with this game there is no meat for the lover of RPGs and in retrospect if I had known it was going to be what it was I probably would have not pushed myself through the entire episode.2/10 - extremely average run of the mill RPG with little to no reason to actually need to experience it.

												Falls short in too many areas. Just going to echo the major points, though:1. Combat is too simplistic. Just spam your high damage ability and grind. Nevermind any kind of ""balance"" concerns, it never even attempts any kind of depth by giving things like ability/class variety, itemization, consumable management... nothing!2. Writing is too awkward. I can forgive the above point and a weak story/premise if the writing is good (especially since this is an RPG where the focus is on writing). 3. I did complete the game. The ""hours played"" is a little long because I left the game on for an hour or so while I did other stuff. I don't think the game is too short. If anything it's too long. I say this because this game IMMEDIATELY throws you into grinding. And there's plenty more grinding to be had throughout. On top of that, you revisit the same areas all the time! Basically this is a ~2 hour game stretched into 7 or so. And you can't avoid at least doing some grinding. I was about level 37 on the last boss and he presented the only challenge of the game. If I was... I dunno, level 25 or something I don't think he would be beatable.More on the writing-The major problems come from two sources: everything is too direct and on the nose (Main character is told to kill, he states that he refuses to kill. Every person has to explain everything like how the government is fascist and fascism is bad. People outright point out their own biases and then say, ""But you're not like that"" within one second of meeting someone, etc etc) and the dialogue itself is awkwardly phrased. It sounds like it's written by someone with a passion for writing, but their first language isn't English? Like if you were to meet this writer in person you'd be impressed and say, ""Wow, your English is great!"" but it's not up to snuff when it comes to dialogue in a written story. The phrasing is always SLIGHTLY off. On top of that, it neither attempts to be natural or what I call ""movie dialogue"" (where each line is meant to both move the plot forward AND demonstrate a [thin] personality within 5 or so words). So- to put it more simply- it's kind of a pain to read.			"

												Here is your generic JRPG.Though, it has beautiful music, a catchy battle theme and a great story concept, the story is almost non existent.75% of the time, you will be in the same three zones, grinding through monsters.And that's pretty much it.The other 25% you will get a little bit of the story, and some character who orders you to go back again to the zones you were already three time through.An spoiler-free example:Someone mentions, that this girl wants a word with you, so you head to her home.The girl isn't there but you can talk to some stranger in her house, who tells you that she is in the flat of that dude upstairs.So you go upstairs, only to find out she and that dude aren't there either.Gladly, another random person tells you they are both at a top secret place, and because he's a nice guy he will tell you where it is.IF you bring him this stone, which is unfortunately at the end of a place you already been three times.To reach this place, you have to grind two other areas, which you been obviously too,  in the past.Another example:There is this super important tower which you have to get to immediately.But first, you have to get a few items, from the zones mentiond above already.Once you recover the items, you may notice, that you bought these exact ones about an hour ago in the town.So yeah, thanks for nothing, let's head finally to the tower now.This basically the gameplay.Someone tells you to grind through those three zones, you go back, to another port of your hometown, only to get told to go through the damn three zones again.Sounds a bit harsh, but really: this games doesn't deserve more than 2 out of 10 points.Especially with that price, which is way to high.

												Alpha Kimori is an ok game that suffers from some debilitating issuespros:easy to learn battle system.Good artgood musicCons:the fights are relatively easy without any grinding required.I don't know if it's due to the translation or not,but the dialogue and plot are so terrible I cannot continue to play this game. reading the dialogue is like watching a soap opera it is that level of forced conversation.  In fact a soap opera is better.Update! I got developer comments. That's awesome.  That makes the dev's credibility go up a notch in my eyes just for that.  And, given that I think I'll add some more detail to this review so they, and others, can understand exactly what I'm talking about.  Warning! Small spoilers along with *a lot* of text belowThe issues I have with the story are more to do with the character interactions.  I played right up until the two main characters have spied on the lady in the cloak and it's time for graduation.  I've got three specific examples I can show right at this point in the game:1. you are ordered by one of the elder's to follow the woman in the cloak. Why does this person order you, someone that's not even graduated to follow someone?  I could see the motivation for choosing the MC as being an internal political struggle since maybe the MC and his family has leanings towards the other elder you are supposed to deliver the package too, a test of loyalty for the character to see if he is willing to follow orders since he doesn't like to kill and may be conspiring with the enemy, or some other thing.  However, whatever the motivation is for having the MC follow the woman in the cloak we aren't shown any of it.  All we have is a blatant plot hook that the player is smacked in the face with.  The Elder even says something to the effect of ""she trusts you"" but we don't know that. The Elder certainly shouldn't know that. It makes the Elder come across as either knowing way more and being scary intelligent, which it didn't for me, or just some dumb guy that has powers of the script.  Aside from the fact that having a non-graduate tail someone who could be an enemy spy instead of trained government agents the presentation to make the MC as a choice could've been better: Something like ""that areas mostly for trainees, you being there makes perfect sense so go ahead and catch up and see what you can learn""  It's not great but it's better than ""Plot character appears and forces you on a quest""2. On the day of graduation the character ""confronts"" his parents with his lack of desire to graduate and be a soldier.  This has several flaws:A. The MC seems entirely unaware of the situation he's in and how his opinion will be construed. Either the MC doesn't understand his situation and therefore is stupid or he does understand the situation and doesn't care if his parents reject or report him and is willing to accept death.  Now if he's aware and is willing to accept death he's either brave or depressed at his existence maybe verging on suicidal.  However, we don't see any of those traits in the MC prior to this.  We see only a sort of vague resistance to his situation.  He'll avoid killing the beasts if he can, but if the player chooses to charge headlong into every fight killing every animal drenching the characters in the blood of the fallen that's all good.  So the MC is neither directly opposed nor directly for.  he's only sort of ""meh""B.  His parents reaction is so over the top it is unbelievable.  The line ""I'll kill you myself"" is probably what pushed it over the edge for me.  That single line says so much about the characters relationship with his parents as well as theirs with him and yet the response to it is ""oh well I guess I should go to graduation then"".C. There's no variation in the text.  It seems like a small point and yet throughout this whole very intense conversation the text is the same.  I don't know if there is inflections or raised voices or anything. It reads monotone.  I have no problem with the plot being straightforward. Straightforward is fine. I don't need a bunch of choice trees like mass effect to enjoy a game.  But I do need to be able to believe the characters.  With this game I felt like I was watching a presentation not playing a game.Hopefully this makes my point of view a little more clear and also doesn't come across as emotional.  I have tried to present my examples objectively without rambling. Feel free to comment and let me know if this comes across as too personal instead of professional.			"

												It's clear that a ton of work went into Alpha Kimori's legitimately impressive spritework, visual design (that very much brings to mind the classic Phantasy Star titles) and custom systems.  Unfortunately, the experience quickly becomes mired in tedium thanks to an absolutely insane amount of backtracking, terrible writing and boring characters.  After two hours I could stand no more.

												I wish I could recommend this game.  It's clearly not just another crappy RPGM game: the devs put effort into the art and story, and it shows (I played through the whole thing mainly because the story seemed promising).  Unfortunately, it fails at being a game.  As other reviewers have noted, the characters' ability sets are all made with the same cookie cutter, and battle is extremely repetitive with no tactical aspect: attack, rinse, and repeat.Maybe get it on sale if you're an avid JRPG fan; otherwise, avoid.

												Boring, simplistic and tedious.This game has fights that are constantly the same with no degree of difficulty or even the slightest chance of failure. The storyline can be guessed right from the start. This game consists of walking around in a RPG Maker world (which can be fun, if you like it old-school), but consists of nothing more then 'fetch and retrieve'-quests. No change, no challenge, no story. I am glad I got this game from a Humble bundle, because I would not have forgiven myself the purchase otherwise.			"

												First of all i had a bit of fun playing this game i even got me part 2. But there are some issues with it:1. Length - the game has such a lack of content and stuff that is there is being rehashed over and over and over. one Flashback scene in particular2. Difficulty - the game is painfully easy, even without fully utilizing your abilities and training you will have no problem at all3. Items - or better the lack thereof. there is basically one weapon for each character for sale at some point and they are pretty pricy too.  few pieces of armor/helmet and accessory's i have found ONE in the whole game. Not that you would need any in regards to -2-.4. Scripted events - no matter how strong you are, how you wipe the floor with event enemies the outcome of the battles won't change in the slightest. It starts to get very annoying at some point. I can understand that the linear path has to go to a specific outcome but there are better ways to make that happen.5. Ending - this trilogy is probably never gonna finish. Part 1 came out in 2011, part 2 (which is not on steam yet) in 2012 and then the dev seemed to abandon the project. The last feedback on how far part 3 is progressing was from 2012 so its safe to assume that the project is dead.			"

												Alpha Kimori 1 is a short 5-10 hour game depending on how you play. I picked this up in a bundle and i don't believe this game as a stand alone is worth $9.99. If you are a fan of this retro style jrpg you will probably really enjoy this game and for an rpgmaker game it goes above and beyond the typical bad steam rpg game.I think some of the others reviewing this particular game took it way too seriously and didn't enjoy the subtle charms that Alpha Kimori offers.This is the first in a trilogy and is the only one currently on steam so keep that in mind. The 2nd can be purchased on the offical website. Pros: Great MusicEngaging Story Fun artwork and StylesEasy to learn battle systemCons: First hour or two is basically fetch quests.

I don't think you can get a game over(I have only used a heal once at the game start mainly to test it) because you have way more health than it ever seems you can take damage, you heal from leveling constantly and you get a crap ton of healing items. The combat is either spam your few skills or spam attack 4-5 times to kill the creature that can barely hurt you.			"

												I don't recommend it!This game may look good and feel like a really good Nintendo DS Game, but it's extremely long and slow.The battles are totally unbalanced:The normal moves has almost the same strenght than the special moves.The bosses mostly uses massive attacks that causes 35% of damage, and the animations are too slow and long.Many times the battles happens without any motive, you will be fighting without knowing it why.The biggest part of the missions of the game are forced, where you must do ""something"" to a Npc that doesn't have nothing to do with the story. (The only reason is to make the game longer than already is)The game has few songs, and many times it repeats the intro song inside the game, even in a boss fight. The songs aren't bad but the repetition makes them seem old really quick.You will be walking around on the map most of the time without any reason. The World Map is useless and has a disguised loading.the story of the game is really shallow for a story made by a developer that wants to create an anime and a manga about it,There are lots and lots of repeated scenes in the game, and the worst of all 3 episodes got cut off the game even knowing that it was totally possible to put these 3 episodes inside it. Resume...The game is forcibly long and the missions are mostly unnecessary.The songs repeat a lot and they pisses you off. The battles are long and tiring. Not forgetting that the game is absurdly expensive comparing to the games of the same platform.This is one of the WORST RPG MAKER GAMES that exist!That's the reason I say: don't waste your time and money playing this garbage game.-------------------[PT-BR]Não recomendo!O jogo pode ser graficamente lindo, e ter um bom ar de jogo de Nintendo DS.Porém peca muito em ser extremamente longo e demorado.As batalhas são muito desbalanceadas:O golpe normal dos personagens tem quase a mesma força que os golpes especiais.Os bosses quase sempre usam ataques massívos, que causam cerca de 35% de dano, alem das animações serem extremamente longas e lerdas.Fora que as batalhas muitas vezes são forçadas. Pois muitas vezes você vai estar lutando sem nem saber o motivo.A maior parte das missões do jogo são forçadas, onde você deve fazer X coisa para um npc que não vai influenciar em nada na história. (tudo pro jogo ficar mais longo)O jogo possue poucas músicas, e várias vezes vai ficar repetindo a música de introdução dentro do jogo, seja em cenário ou em boss fight. Não que as músicas sejam ruins, mas o excesso de repetição é muito desgastante.A maior parte do tempo voce vai ficar transitando de um mapa para outro sem motivo algum. Fora que o World Map é inútil, alem de ser um loading disfarçado.Quanto a história do jogo, pra uma desenvolvedora que almeja fazer um Anime e um Mangá em cima do jogo, a motivação dos personagens é muito rasa.Fora que há uma repetição de uma cena no jogo várias e várias vezes.E como não bastasse, o jogo foi CORTADO em 3 episódios, sendo que podiam muito bem ter lançado um jogo completo com os 3 episódios.Resumindo...O jogo é forçadamente longo, e as missões são em suma parte desnecessárias. As músicas se repentem de mais e chegam a ser irritantes. Fora as batalhas que são muito longas e cansativas.Ainda que o jogo é absurdamente caro se comparado com outros jogos da mesma plataformaEste é um dos PIORES JOGOS de RPG Maker que existem!Por isso eu digo: não perca seu tempo, nem dinheiro jogando esse lixo de jogo.

Product received for free
												It's an RPG made by RPG-maker== Story ==The story is interesting, but it really lacks details (there are some inconsistencies, for both the story and the character psychology). Also, there is an annoying flashback that you will get to see at least 10 times.. (remember Naruto's flashbacks ? Well, it's in the same style).The battles are also not consistent with the story. You defeat a character, but in the story he actually defeats you.. It's a bit misleading, and devaluates a lot the battle (why did you fight him in the first place if he knocks you down anyway in the story ?)== Battles ==The battles are unfortunately dull and boring - your characters become very quickly OP, the animations are slow, and you spend most of your time doing battles that you know you will win.An average battle in this game : you kill the monster in 2 shots, the monster kills you in 15 shots, and before your health goes down, either you lvl up or you just heal yourself with a spell.However, the final boss battle is really challenging - I wish all the (at least boss) battles of the game had been like that !Bonus : the 7/8 unavoidable consecutive battles that are just copy/paste of each others, and that you know you will win because you one/two shot the monsters== Quests/Gameplay ==""Hey ! I've heard that this and that guys will meet in secret.. I won't tell you where, unless you bring me back this thing that someone stole from me.""> You go meet the guy, walking through 2-3 zones infested of monsters, the guy tells you that he needs you to bring him another item> You go search for this item, walking again through 2 zones> You just wasted 30 min - 1h just so that you know where to go nextThese kind of quests are necessary to continue the story, but man I wish I didn't do those. It does not add anything to the story, and it really feels like content-filler at this point.== Music ==Hell yeah, the music is really awesome in this game. That's one of his only positive points, but the OST is really cool, especially the main theme.== Visuals ==Aside from some of the animations that are a pixel mess, the sprites are very well done and eye-candy.== Characters ==Like I said above, sometimes they are not really consistent.. But I liked them nevertheless== Conclusion ==Don't play the game for the gameplay - play it for the story. It has some dull phases here and there, but it's a quite good story.However, I don't think it's worth the 9.99€. For 10€, one would expect a more challenging / less dull gameplay, as well as a more refined storytelling, and this is the main reason of my downvote.If it included both episodes 1 & 2, it would already be better. I just want either more content for that price, or more gameplay quality.			"

												Very unbalanced, seemingly unfinished even for an episode.  You could grind and buy the weapons and armor in the stores like I did, but nearly everything but the shields are given to you just by wandering around.  It's not like the encounter enemies really need it.  And the prices for the (only) weapons in the shop are in the 4000-6000 range, while most of the enemies don't drop nearly that much gold.  Everything else in the shops is priced at nearly 1/10 of that.  Lots of artificially forcing you to walk everywhere, with tight corners to force you to battle monsters.  Oddly inserted fetch quests, having to randomly grab 50 of an item, which I conveniently had through grinding.Near the end of episode 1, I was Level 37 with all the equipment upgrades and could crash through scores of enemies without really needing to heal (even outside of battles). But the last boss fight of the episode nearly slaughtered me.  2/5 - 1/2 of every character's HP from the two group attacks each round, with two extra individual attacks.  The best healer is the only character who has a group attack at that point, and my characters spent most of their time healing, and still losing HP.  Two of the characters' healing skills only healed about 1/5 HP.  Either the encounter enemies were too weak or the boss was too strong.  No group heal skills, but all characters have individual heal skills.  Only two characters can heal strongly enough to offset the continuous damage.  Supposedly your character wants to live without killing or hurting, but you can't help but slaughter the local wildlife.  It wasn't ever made clear if those monsters are also part of the Ki Monsters that I supposedly hate killing.  There were several battles where I'd defeat the super-powerful boss and then the plot would still show me defeated.  I was death on RPG rails and everyone called me lazy and under-achieving.  It doesn't seem like your performance affects the plot much.  In fact, only 3-4 skills per character at Level 37.  Pretty vanilla for the understated town badass.  Any other skills probably won't exist until the next episodes.  Doesn't seem worth the grind to find out.Nice animations, good sprites.  Seems like it's based off of one of the RPG Maker engines, so it was odd to hear my laptop fan (2Ghz x4 Core i7, FirePro M5950) running at full-blast for 2D tiles and it still wasn't smooth.  I don't think I'd try it on the minimum specs.  Maybe it was the AMD drivers, but more visually impressive games are smoother and less demanding.  It's probably RPGMaker, which never seems to be smooth in full screen mode.  The game didn't seem like it would run in windowed mode, though (Alt+Enter).  It would show a window, but only display 1/4 of the screen in it.It has potential, but because of the plot on rails it seems more like I'm playing a visual novel with a high encounter rate than an RPG.  Seriously, one weapon upgrade.  It might be worth $5 (half the price), but I'd look around and catch it in a bundle or on sale, rather than paying full price.  2D JRPGs are nostalgic, but it's not like they're uncommon, even today.  And better ones exist, both new and classic.  Go back and play Phantasy Star IV, Final Fantasy VI or Grandia (3D maps, 2D sprites), instead.			"

												It was difficult for me if I should recommend you this game or not. I chose for a no, because I wanted to quit on this game a few times during chapters 1 & 2. I enjoyed chapter 3, but it was the shortest of them all.PRO:+ Typical JRPG game (decent story and ok music)+ Easy straightforward English for the beginning player or non-native English speakers   (but maybe too easy for the other gamers)+ Different enemies, character design+ Good bossfights (maybe that's the way the combat should have been for the entire game)CON:- Short game, not many quests- Dull quests (you can't choose to do a side mission or not)- Small area & always returning to previous ones to stretch out the game- Only a few items you can buy, very low character adjusting items- Unrewarding, unbalanced overpowered combat (grinding)- Critical hit chance for your characters is way too high, you are also way overpowered- Unskippable special ki-attack scenes (very repeating & boring)(- Maybe an option to unlock artwork when finishing certain parts of the game)(- Maybe an option to adjust screen size, graphics aren't great on full screen and the 2nd screen option is too small)(- No option to delete save games in-game)(- Mouse sensitivity can't be adjusted in-game)(- Music gets too repetitive after a while)Grab this game when you are an (J)RPG fan and the price is low. I got it at a low price and finished the game, so it's not all bad. I can't compare it to other JRPG's because I haven't played many JRPG's.			"

												I loved this game it had a very clean story as well as easy control play. It can be satisfying if stuck on a mission that would take a long time to finish. The battle format is clean and simple with a robust FF design or What ever RPG game that was satisfying to play and the world to travel in was easy and clean with great color. I loved it so much I want to play the second episode and even a third. I would also say that there is a bit of wit and love and drama that can be missed in some games wich made this game fun also I found that reading there conversations fun and easier then listening and not being able to listen again, that and the jurnal made questing easier.  Sneaky wisper parts of conversations was a fun and kind of funny part of the games character interaction. I would recomend this game for it is a game most everybody can injoy, Five out of five stars :D			"

												Pro:* Nice soundtrack.* Nice art.Cons:* Insane amount of forced pointless backtracking. Visit that cave again and again? Seriously?* ""Script owns you"" kind of boss fights. It doesn't mean if you just won the fight - if you had to loose you will be taken down by the almighty script scene. Seriously, if I had to loose then throw something unbeatable at my characters to make me think they were weak.* Weak story right from the beginning. Weak presentation of the story.* No CG in the game like in the trailer. So, trailer has nothing to do with the actual game. :(* Also there are no point to buy the weapons at the store except for Yuki.No, I don't hate this game. In fact, I like it and may play next parts when they will be released but I wouldn't recommend buying it except for buying at a huge discount.			"

												Yet-another-RPGMaker-game for the JRPG lovers. I will recommend the game, but it's just a barely positive. I agree that the RPGMaker has no ability to create ""creative"" games. But any developer should mask this inability with a good scenario. Alpha Kimori's scenario is weak. The story is not clear enough. The concept is OK, but there are some holes has to be filled in the story. The graphics and the audio are OK also. The game mechanics such as battles, resting etc are below average. The world design is awful. There are just a few areas which you will grind several times.  I don't recommend it for the full price, but in a bundle or a big sale, give it a chance. 5/10.			"

												Alpha Kimori is a great indie RPG that starts out simply enough, but provides surprising depth in its themes and story.  The character interaction is mostly great, and while there are a few minor complaints, the game will keep you hooked until the end.  It’s worth it to finish the game as well, because the final battle and cutscene afterward are both worth the price of admission alone.  The game runs a little on the short side, but each hour is packed with story, and will leave you wanting more.  I’m literally on edge to find out what happens next. 10/10			"

												Alpha Kimori™ 1 is an RPG where the goal is to reclaim the Earth after an alien attack. Like usual, your character is super special and can help to save to world. You can harness power from Ki crystals, and control a large robot exoskeleton to assist you in your attacks.Gameplay consists of the normal RPG maker fare. Click to select attack, click enemy to target, repeat. You can explore a few towns, including the large starting town, and encounter many battles in the overworld map. You can see the enemies on the map, so avoid them if you are tired of grinding.The story did not really grip me in the beginning, and I quickly found myself clicking through dialogue to get to the next scene. The graphics are not much beyond the royalty free inclusions in RPG Maker. The music was ok, but could have been royalty free for all I know.I must admit that JRPGs are not really my preferred game, beyond a select few. There really must be a good story behind them, and I really found it lacking here. I experienced as much as I could before I lost total interest, but sadly that time came very quickly. I can not recommend this unless you are desperately looking for a new JRPG to play, and you have exhausted all other options.Grade: D			"

												This was quite an enjoyable little game that sure left me waning to play the next one to see where the story goes. The game starts off really slowly with you basically left utterly confused for some time (main character doesn't want to kill but you have to kill for exp?). But anyways even though the game lacks the comfort for players to play, the story picks up and is actually quite interesting.CRITICAL HITCRITICAL HITCRITICAL HITThe game became too easy the moment you started getting a million critical hits. To be honest, monster grinding would be even more boring without the critical hits. However the critical hits amount surely did astound me as it seems like its 100% critical hit count against monsters. There were a couple of ""boss"" like fights but really weren't too hard due to your large health and ""mana"" pools.One of the most annoying things about the game that I found were the monster walking paths. It literally seemed as if the monsters were spazzing with some spazzing towards you. It was really annoying and unpredictable so I couldn't even avoid those useless low exp giving monsters. They also should have put more teleporters to different regions so I wouldn't have to worry about those pesky spazzers.Overall nice short game.Rating: 7.3/10Also, don't criticize me for my tastes, but I genuinely enjoyed the theme song BiRD by the oh so famous robot singer.

												Alpha Kimori is a game with an interesting story. The gameplay itself is that of a simple RPG. The difficulty isn't high and in general you won't find any great challenge in this game. The main point of the game IS the story, resulting in a short game with characters you can still really care about.If I had to describe it, I'd say it feels the most like a visual novel with RPG elements. All in all, the game is for a somewhat niche group, but it's awesome all the same. If you're looking for a good story, be sure to check this game out!			"

Posted: December 30, 2014
												First off, I do like the artistic side of the game and the story line is a more new one to me so it was good to feel like you are engaging in some new. But the game itself kinda ruined that with the playability of it. There was numerous things that I didn't like:1st: Event processing. Half the time I wanted to explore the map after an event, but then its like, ""nope, teleport back to town"". 2nd: The level system & Equipment. Played for 2 hours, am level 20's, and have not gotten any new weapons or armor (I bought the tunic and bandana at the start). The only weapon that is of use costs 15000$ and you will never be able to afford that for quite some time. I had like 6k or so when I stopped. There is no ""cool new weapons or armors"", your strength is only from leveling up, so you never feel like you are actually becoming powerful. It feels more gringfest then anythhing else. 3rd: Skills. Super unoriginal skills. Each person has their own keyword for their skill (as far as I got there was God, Metal, and Angel). So for example your first couple skills for the main character is ""God Sword, God Focus, God Blast"". Also with that, everyone has the same skills. Each person has a heal, a KI restore, and a Power attack. Since everyone's health and KI grows at the same rate and everyone basically has the same skills it feels like all the party members are the same. It's like playing with duplicates of the main character. 4th: There were some holes in the story as well. The biggest one for me is the part where you have to go recieve a canister and then you have to go get a special KI crystal to trade (which was a huge pain to walk back and forth with). The leader tells you that he will pass you for the graduation exam for doing it and you don't have to kill any KI creatures. This is where the problem happens with story. It is basically nearly impossible to avoid enemies. They have sporadic pathing and some are really fast. So you know, you kill like 100 KI creatures with the amount of traveling you have to do. I tried avoiding them at first thinking that if you killed one it might affect the story, but nope, apparenlty you can just slaughter them all, and still be crying about how you are trying to be peaceful and not kill them. 5th: Health & Items: Basically you only level up to face the bosses. All enemies once you level up enough you will be able to 2 hit them with normal attacks only. They only deal 20-30 (this is being level 20 range) damage and you have 1106 health. You want to just ignore them all, but then its like, ""oh this boss might actually kill me because he deals 200"" You basically gring to fight bosses. You also collect KI crystals to use to restore health and what not. They heal by 10% 25% and 100%, (from what I have seen) and you get an abundance of them. I do a long sidequest and he is like here is 3 10% health crystals. With your health pool and how fast you level up, your health will never get low enough to actually start using them. All they do is just sit in your inventory. So all in all with story and artwork I would give it a 4/10.			"

												It's a pretty fun RPG with a decent story that's hard to put down.The good: The combat is fun, the skills are nice to look at.  The story is easy to get into, and the characters are interesting.The bad: Movement is slow.  I mean really, really slow.  You walk along a long path with no ability to speed it up.  You have to wait for the NPC to leave the screen before you can move, and there's no way to skip anything such as cutscenes or fastforward things like battle animations.The ugly: No matter what you do in battle, if you're scripted to lose, you're going to lose.  Even if you one shot the enemy, once the battle is done it'll pretend like you lost the battle, making it feel like there's no point to winning them.  The finale brings up an interesting aspect of the story, namely the ability to (DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS) harvest the gems of enemies and add their strength to your own (DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS) but there is no mechanic in game to do that.  You're also greeted with a strength +100 gem, but it's the only one you get and it's impossible to get more.All in all, this game is worth $5 or even $10, but for a five hour game it's not really worth $15.  Get it on sale if you can, because there's a part 2 that steam needs to add (and a part 3 they need to make supposedly) that will eat your money away if you buy it at full price.  It's not worth $45 ($30 for both parts for a 12 hour game) for however many hours, but it's a fun game for a one and done.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. A futuristic RPG about two warring nations who have populated a planet after being driven from the Earth. Sounds like a decent plot to base a game off of. So why did this game fail to entertain? There are a number of reasons which I think it just isn't up to snuff. First off, lets talk about the main character. Ugh, Rick, is our typical angsty teenage boy trying to ""find himself"". He's always so depressed because people are always fighting but does he really do anything about it? No, he says he won't fight, but then doesn't want to disappoint his parents. Then he has this elder friend who asks him to fight, and he has this whole inner struggle that is just plainly boring to watch. He makes me long for the days of the silent protagonist. Do you remember Chrono from Chrono Trigger? Never said a word the ENTIRE game. Still had more personality than Rick. Second would it be too much to add a RUN button? It might be one of the lesser annoyances of this game but I feel like if you're going to have me travel to the forest a half a dozen times the least the developer could have done was add a run feature. Instead I'm trudging through the same dungeon at a leisurely pace for the 10th time I'm sent there for something.Third, the plot. I feel like this game wants to give that whole moral dilemma type of vibe with the dialogue. But it's constantly hammering this idea into you with long winded diatribes from Rick and Co. about who's side is right about the war. And as much as he seems to dislike his people for killing animals and whatnot he defends his nation every chance he gets. And to make matters worse is there's one flashback that the characters all seem to play every time they reminisce about the past. This flashback of ONE event happens literally half a dozen times. If you're going to use life defining moments in time use them sparingly for maximum effect. Not every time a character has some inner conflict. It loses it's effect if you're showing the same flashback scene several times in one section. I could go on ad hominum about the things wrong with this game including the boring battle system. The one thing I appreciate is that it's just the first episode. I can't express how disappointed I'd be if this was supposed to be some 50 hr rpg in one shot. I probably won't bother with the second episode if it's going to be more of the same as the first.			"

The world and backstory offer a good foundation for a larger plot but this ""episodic"" format left my first experience feeling very hollow.I can summarize this by saying I liked about 2 hours worth of the 7 hour experience.  Those 2 hours could have been better established in the first 2 hours of a larger game.  I'd be more forgiving but the game pads itself by forcing you through the same 4 combat zones several times.

												Alpha Kimori is a great game and everyone should play it, but it is has too many problems to recommend. It has great graphics and a superb battle system, but as an RPG, it story falls too flat and the characters are too one dimensional.First of all this is a well made game, most of the times. It really feels like the developers took their time to craft a great battle system. This is the shiny moment in this game, the enemies become cannon fodder and the games go no further than medium difficulty. The songs at the beginning and end are great, in my opinion. This is a great game for beginners and those who want to have fun.Alas an RPG is only as good as its story and characters, and this is where the game makes its greatest mistake. The story is not bad, but it is mediocre. Don’t worry when the game finally lets you run around you are going to figure out the plot in minutes. Just talk to everyone in town.  You also only get one weapon upgrade which you get from the characters automatically just buy shields and maybe some armor. By the way save all your items for the final battle and it will be easy.  I could go on with the list of problems, but I feel as if this is one of the better RPG Maker games.I hope this developer puts all three episodes together for 15 dollars. As it stands this is a tech demo that tries to be a game. I say buy this game when it goes on sale for five dollars or less.			"

												Alpha Kimori (ep1) is a fun little RPG (in JRPG-style) that while not perfect does prove that with effort a small group of people can use RPG Maker to put something together worth your money. RPG Maker has a seedy reputation due to some people abusing it but it’s far from a bad piece of software, and in the right hands can be used to everyone’s benefit. Alpha Kimori is one such product that stands as testament to this.That said the game doesn’t try to be anything more than it appears to be, a very traditional RPG in the style of old SNES classics. Characters have HP/MP that you use in the usual turn-based format to launch your staple attack/magic/healing commands (given different names in this case, but still the same), and you run around from place-to-place viewing events. So if you’re looking for something that stretches boundaries you’ll be disappointed. But, if you can enjoy that style of old-school gameplay then Alpha Kimori is a very polished version of those styles. I should mention here that battles are not random but instead initiated by contacting enemy sprites on the field.Story-wise things are interesting but feel a little scatter-brained, as if not all the dialogue is in the correct order. For instance our main characters occasionally have drastic shifts in their points of view within the very same discussion, rather than seeming like a solid progression from one view to the next over the course of several discussions. Still the story it’s trying to tell is interesting enough, there are plenty of tropes but it’s still trying to be its own property despite that. Similarly most of the characters are likable, the above mentioned shifting back-and-forth on positions sometimes detracts from them but in the end they’re mostly solid.Some blatantly not so great points include there being a little too much backtracking for its own good as you revisit a small set of locations many times, it could have stood to have a few more songs for world locations and events (for instance it continues playing the bubbly, upbeat city theme even when events get serious which detracts from the scene taking place), and it’s very easy to begin with and even simpler if you spend more than a few minutes grinding with nothing coming close to beating you. So make no mistake, if you don’t like this style of game then Alpha Kimori will NOT change your opinion on them. But if you do then this is a well-polished game that clearly has intent to go somewhere and should keep you content for the 5-7 hour playtime the first episode purports.  "

												Been a long time Jrpg player and i must say this game gives the right amount of story/action that a good Jrpg needs it slowly introduces the characters so you get a chance to get use to each ones abilties.Took me around 4 and a half hours to beat this episode and thats only cause i rushed thru the final part cause i wanted to know  what happened and didn't know i was at the end already.i look forward to playing episode 2 when you release it on Steam i look forward to seeing where the story goes and i look forward to traveling around more of your world setting i give this game an 8/10 maily off potental i'm really looking forward to seeing where the love triangle leads			"

												It's good, but I believe you have to have an affinity for classic JRPGs from the 16-bit era to really enjoy it, otherwise it'll just feel tedious a lot of the time.  The story isn't bad, the characters have a bit of depth and development to them, and the sprite work and art design looks nice.  As an RPG, its battle system is just standard basic attack, magic, and item commands selected from a menu, with an option to defend and recover HP/MP, but doesn't offer anything beyond that.  Enemies show up in the field and battles can be avoided for the most part, which is a step up from having to deal with completely random battles.  The game could have stood to have a wider variety of music tracks.  You'll be hearing the same upbeat town theme a lot of the time, which will sometimes end up clashing with the tone of the story when things take on a more serious mood.  The first episode is also really short.  Taking my time with it and walking away from it every so often, I still managed to get through it in under 10 hours, and a good portion of the game has a lot of padding from battling and backtracking.  Overall, it offers enough where I could recommend it if you really like older console RPGs and can get it for cheap during a sale.			"

Thank god there are no random encounters you can move about peacefully . Nice anime style graphics suit the game well.The game has some lovely music as well , looking forward to episode 2			"

												I got this in a Humble Bundle deal. I would be annoyed had I paid the $11 Steam wants for Alpha Kimori. There's no point collecting money or items you wont need them. Don't bother buying anything in the shops you'll find what you need along the way. Running through the same 4 areas several times becomes quite boring. At the final area? Good now let's run to the cave furthest from everything cause that's where your friend hid all her supplies you barely need. The story and dialouge are dumb. The music/sound effects once you get to the final boss are awful. I beat this game in 5 hours level 36. I feel like the only way this game is going to give you trouble is if you are 8 and have never played a video game in your life. I'd like to mention my favorite bits of bad dialouge are between Rick and his parents when he says he doesnt want to kill the animals anymore. They basically tell him to shut his ♥♥♥♥♥ mouth or they will kill him on the spot and how dare he.2/10 Don't buy.			"

												Amazing game.I wasnt sure if this was a good game, but after the first 15 minutes of playing i was sure IT IS GOOD INDEED!I have played many RPGs but this one stands out with its graphics, its not the normal title used RPG style and also fighting style isnt the same like most. there are lots of handmade graphics (pictures etc) which just looked so nice.the game itself is very hsort with about 6 hours to complete it but also really worth playing!I could not get me distracted from this game as i wanted to play it since it was fun playing when testing it.The Story of the Game, well..i wont say much about it. Let´s just say it goes around Power from crystals named ""Ki"" i am not sure anymore but i think ""Ki"" was sth in japanese meaning sth like ""Strong"" or ""Power"" or character strengh of someone.I really hope the Episode 2 and so on will be fast Released on Steam since its a really amazing RPG.Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:Gameplay: 9/10 (The only thing i did dislike was the walk only i did had loved to run in the maps.)Graphics: 10/10 (looks great)Support: ?/10 (never needed since the game was working properly)Price: 8/10 (it´s a bit high but worth and if you are lucky you can get it on discount)Story: 10/10 (amazing smooth story about power from crystals)Sound: 8/10 (good. some effects arent that good though)Performance: 8/10 (was fine but some skills did lag like hell from 40->5-17 FPS down and also the game was instead of 60-> 40 FPS only)FAZIT: 8.8/10 (well made with amazing graphics and story)			"

												Alpha Kimori™ 1 is a old-school style JRPG game made in RPG Maker. I've seen how there are many negative reviews simply for the fact that this game is made from RPG Maker. This is what you would call a biased review - the ""reviewer"" is letting their feelings for RPG Maker-created games get in the way of seriously taking the time to actually go through the game. One reviewer I've even seen admitted to reviewing this game before playing it. Judging a game by it's cover, or anything for that matter, is never a good idea.Now, the game itself has a very unique story that includes warring human factions, were-people, robot fighters, and angels. All in the same game. That's fairly interesting in itself. JRPG's, on average, have the player grind a bit or search for powerful items just to beat some kind of boss. This is not the case for this game, mostly: although I did grind a wee bit (maybe ten battles total), this amount of grinding is rather low as far as these genre games are concerned. This helps to flow through the story better. The music isn't what you would consider outstanding, but I found the theme to be pretty good. I particularly like how the theme is implemented into major boss battles, giving them a more ""adrenaline rush"" kind of feel.Naturally, this game is by no means perfect (nothing is perfect). This does not mean that you, the reader, should shy away from this gem. The only complaint I can think of for this game is that it's rather short (beat it in ~5 hours). I strongly feel like there could have been a lot more story put into this first episode in the series, especially with the main character development.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this JRPG and simply can not wait until Episode 2 becomes available on Steam.

												You won't actually start playing the game until 11 minutes have passed in game. There are far too many boring cutscenes. You can't remap your controls.

Worst of all though is the music sounds like it belongs in one of those training videos you're forced to watch when you get a job in retail like at Walmart.			"

												Ever played a turn-based RPG before? If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, then I have news for you: you've played this game before. It's not on your Steam library, you say? Oh, no, don't worry, it wasn't on your Steam library. This game was actually the tutorial sequence on the very first turn-based RPG you ever played. You just didn't know. You have doubts on what I'm saying? Don't worry, so do I - a Great Doubt, in fact.	""Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt - Episode 1"" is the first of a turn-based RPG trilogy developed and published by Sherman3D. Let me start off by saying that this trilogy is not yet complete! Only Episodes 1 and 2 are available at the moment, and only Episode 1 is available through Steam. If you wanted to get Episode 2, it would have to be either through the game's website[www.alphakimori.com] or somewhere else. But why am I talking about Episode 2 when I haven't even started talking about Episode 1? I'll touch back on that later, but for now, let's get to the meat of this thing.	The story of ""Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt - Episode 1"" is... umm... well, to heavily summarize: on a planet called Kimori there live two human tribes, the Bidarians (tech people) and the Jinrians (beast people), and they're at war! Your protagonist through this war will be Rick Brightheart, a young Bidarian who's more indecisive than a drunk CEO under stress! Rick is confused about a few things, such as why he should be fighting, who does he really care for, or if there's a bigger meaning behind all of this. I can't answer those questions, though, because that'd be spoilers. The other two main characters are Vanessa Avery and Yuki Furikai, though you technically don't find out about Yuki until a while later, but the trailer for this game reveals her name, so no point in hiding it. Personally, I found both Vanessa and Yuki to be more likeable than Rick, though that's subjective.	Now, what's the relationship between those three characters? Well, the trailer and the game's website talks a lot about a love triangle, making you believe that romance will be a huge part of the story.  And then you play it and it's... not that much about the romance. Like, it's there, but it's not the biggest nor the most interesting aspect of the game's story. Bad advertisement on Sherman3D's side. So, what is the best part about ""Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt - Episode 1's"" story? Well, I mentioned that Rick isn't that great of a character, but I don't hate him. He starts... OK, but he does develop, and the same can be said for Vanessa and Yuki. They do have a bit of charm to them, and they'll grow on you as you keep playing. However, like the characters, the main plot - the ""reality"" of the war between the Bidarians and Jinrians - also takes a while to take off. The story unfortunately fails at hooking you early in the game, which results in you mostly dragging yourself through it for the first couple of hours, hoping that it'll eventually get better. Yet, it does get better, and I was actually a bit surprised by that. But still, pacing could have been done a lot better.	Despite the company's name, you will not find 3D objects in this title; the game offers 16-bit styled graphics, much like classic Final Fantasy games and the sort. And in that department, it looks great! The game's colors are varied and vibrant, which is really important in keeping you at least somewhat awake during otherwise dull moments. The sprites in this game are pretty well-made, too. I was surprised to see that not only do the playable characters have custom animations, but all the enemies do as well, and they look just as good as the main cast! As far as the actual designs go, there's nothing that really blew me away, but the art-style all throughout is consistent. However, these are just the basics of graphics. As far as extra, special stuff goes, there isn't really much to talk about. There's a few particle effects here and there, none of them are noticeably impressive, and I can't seem to recall any fancy lighting effects either. Overall, I do really like the art style of the game, and I can appreciate what it does, but it doesn't do anything to put itself above the crowd.	OK, let's talk about the most important part of this review - the gameplay. I am sorry to announce that this is where the game falls the shortest. Remember when I said that you've played this game before? Well, that's because ""Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt - Episode 1's"" turn-based combat system is just the absolute basics of the genre: basic attack for average mobs, ""Ki Attacks"" for bosses, rinse and repeat. You have no status ailments to worry about, no special attributes that only affect certain enemies, etc. You have no strategy. The game doesn't even try to spice things up a bit! In turn, the game's also ridiculously easy - and short! It took me about 6 hours to beat the game, grinding constantly mind you. And the only time I actually felt challenged was with the final boss, where the difficulty just spikes out of nowhere and I actually had to think for once - which was actually great, and it just makes you wish the rest of the game was that intense! Outside of battle it's just go here, talk to so-and-so, do what they want, go talk to blah-blah-blah, bleeeeh. Levels are nice to explore the first time, but after having to revisit one area more than three times, it gets old quick. Now, I will say that I can handle repetition pretty well, and leveling up in the game doesn't take too awfully long. But if you're impatient, I'm sorry, just... just skip this one.	There's a few songs in this game, and they're not bad, but you will hear them... over... and over... and over. You do have the option to mute the music if you get sick of it, but when muting a game's soundtrack acts as a solution to a problem, there's an issue. As far as sound effects go, I was not amused. Almost all of them are really underwhelming and don't contribute to the game's already weak immersion. I do like the main theme song for the game - ""Bird"" by Hatsune Miku. It's a nice little tune, I must admit. But otherwise, the sound design of this game is simply nothing special.	OK, we're getting close to the end of this review, and I have to answer the big question: do I really recommend this game? Look, this game is not for everyone. If you can't handle repetition and dull moments, stay far, far away. And personally, I wouldn't pay $10 for this game - I'd only buy it on sale (I got it from a Humble Bundle). But there's another issue: like I mentioned, this is supposed to be a trilogy. And again, Episode 2 is not available through Steam, while Episode 3 is nowhere to be found! If you do end up liking the game and want the sequel, you're going to have to go out of your way and get it from somewhere else, and probably end up paying more than you would with Steam sales (not to mention, Steam is just more convenient, honestly). Episode 2 was released back in 2012, so for the third episode to still be undone 3 years after just doesn't give me a good vibe. And I'm ashamed to admit it, but that's why I'm recommending this game. There is some potential with this franchise, and I want Sherman3D to do well so they can continue it and improve it. Even if it's not that good, this game does have a certain charm to it; you can tell it's a very humble product from a very humble company, and it does feel like they put their heart into developing it. I'm not too awfully fond of just Episode 1 alone, but I do want to see the Alpha Kimori franchise grow. But that's just hopeful thinking on my part. I recommend this game on sale; this game could probably benefit from a price drop, as you'd be getting a more accurate ""bang for your buck"" then. Even then, don't expect to be blown away by anything from ""Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt - Episode 1.""			"

You have no status ailments to worry about, no special attributes that only affect certain enemies, etc. You have no strategy. The game doesn't even try to spice things up a bit! In turn, the game's also ridiculously easy - and short! It took me about 6 hours to beat the game, grinding constantly mind you. And the only time I actually felt challenged was with the final boss, where the difficulty just spikes out of nowhere and I actually had to think for once - which was actually great, and it just makes you wish the rest of the game was that intense! Outside of battle it's just go here, talk to so-and-so, do what they want, go talk to blah-blah-blah, bleeeeh. Levels are nice to explore the first time, but after having to revisit one area more than three times, it gets old quick. Now, I will say that I can handle repetition pretty well, and leveling up in the game doesn't take too awfully long. But if you're impatient, I'm sorry, just... just skip this one.	There's a few songs in this game, and they're not bad, but you will hear them... over... and over... and over. You do have the option to mute the music if you get sick of it, but when muting a game's soundtrack acts as a solution to a problem, there's an issue. As far as sound effects go, I was not amused. Almost all of them are really underwhelming and don't contribute to the game's already weak immersion. I do like the main theme song for the game - ""Bird"" by Hatsune Miku. It's a nice little tune, I must admit. But otherwise, the sound design of this game is simply nothing special.	OK, we're getting close to the end of this review, and I have to answer the big question: do I really recommend this game? Look, this game is not for everyone. If you can't handle repetition and dull moments, stay far, far away. And personally, I wouldn't pay $10 for this game - I'd only buy it on sale (I got it from a Humble Bundle). But there's another issue: like I mentioned, this is supposed to be a trilogy. And again, Episode 2 is not available through Steam, while Episode 3 is nowhere to be found! If you do end up liking the game and want the sequel, you're going to have to go out of your way and get it from somewhere else, and probably end up paying more than you would with Steam sales (not to mention, Steam is just more convenient, honestly). Episode 2 was released back in 2012, so for the third episode to still be undone 3 years after just doesn't give me a good vibe. And I'm ashamed to admit it, but that's why I'm recommending this game. There is some potential with this franchise, and I want Sherman3D to do well so they can continue it and improve it. Even if it's not that good, this game does have a certain charm to it; you can tell it's a very humble product from a very humble company, and it does feel like they put their heart into developing it. I'm not too awfully fond of just Episode 1 alone, but I do want to see the Alpha Kimori franchise grow. But that's just hopeful thinking on my part. I recommend this game on sale; this game could probably benefit from a price drop, as you'd be getting a more accurate ""bang for your buck"" then. Even then, don't expect to be blown away by anything from ""Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt - Episode 1.""			"

												I've barely played the game (it's apparently short though so :P ).The only JRPG I was ever extremely attached to was Golden Sun on the Gameboy.Alpha Kimori has already hooked me (though I am a bit wary of the decision to release it in (short) episodes...); I have high hopes for this series. I find the story very interesting; it's like an anime... that I can actually understand (for the most part). O-o Whaaaaa?!?! The Earth is doomed; God manifests as spaceship Alpha; along with Seven Angels, they transport the chosen of Humanity to a safe planet. There, Man breaks into two factions: one that wishes to stay put on the new planet, one that wishes to use that planet's resources to attempt reclamation of Earth. You play as a human aligned with the latter faction, though you have significant moral qualms.*stage is set for the game*I always read the Negative Reviews over the Positive; I won't echo further what those say, but they do seem to raise legitimate concerns. My only significant problem with the game (as of now, again, not far into it - not expecting too much since I did read those Negative reviews) is the lack of any resolution options. Playing on a widescreen TV, if I go Fullscreen, the corners are cut off; if I go Windowed, I can't squint enough to see everything comfortably.Please keep this in mind Sherman3D!!!I eagerly await the sequels... but... wait... *off I go to play Episode 1 some more*			"

												This is the best looking RPG Maker game I've ever seen! The developers managed to make the engine resolution higher, thus the game look very crisp. The characters sprites are very detailed. This is the only RPG Maker game I know that have battle animations.The game story and aesthetics are reminicent of the classic Phantasy Star games, specially Phantasy Star 2 and 4.The only problem with the game is that the developers chose to release it in chapters.If you are looking for classic a JRPG-like game that don't look and feel amateurish like most RPG Maker games, I highly recommend Alpha Kimori.

I would probably give 4 of 10 points.I want to edit now:I played it to the end within 6 hours in total. And i have to admit the story really is facinating. The engine is pretty bad I think, but what do you expect from a game made from the RPG maker. But I'm looking forward to see how the story develops!Now it's 6/10 points.			"

												Overall, I generally like the game and will eventually pick up the 2nd one, but I will only slightly recommend this game for the following reasons:1. You end up going through the same areas over and over again on different quests thoughout the story line.  There is a whole built world map that you can see the few times you get outside of one of the 'dungeon' forests, but each exit leads only to the next area on the quest, so you will be going through the same areas over and over killing the same monsters over and over.2. Near the end, some of the areas are mixed up by adding some extra monsters that you fight, they are about 10x stronger than the other monsters in the area (that were a little bit of a challenge at the beginning of the game) but give the same or in some areas less experience and treasure than the original monsters.3. There is a weapon in the weapon shop that seems to have no use whatsoever during the game, it's the most expensive item there, but the main character, nor any of the people that can join the party (and stick around longer than a fight) seem to be able to use it.4. Some things in the game seem to have weak story line, for example at one point you get the giant robots, use them then 'give them back' in the middle of a forest, who you took them from, and why you gave them back at all, considering how the story line is progressing at that point seems a mystery.5. You are pretty much on a rail throughout the entire game, sure you can run around in the area and kill all of the monsters in each area if you wish, but if you try to backtrack, your companion scolds you, tells you where you need to go and then you have to follow the rail to the next event.6. Some of the spell effects seem over the top and just take too long to show on the screen, When it comes to the big final fight, multiple large spell effects happen, which really makes the combat rounds last a while7. Very little in the way of equipment upgrades during the game, except through scripted events.  Yes it's a short game, but still.It however is a nice game, and was fun while it lasted, but it did get a bit old with the constant backtracking.  So I do recommend it.			"

												An another anime inspired JRPG game...I'm always up for those! 5 hours of gameplay is indeed very accurate and if this is RPG maker game it has alot more effort in it than many others of it's kind out there. However it also is still lacking in many many areas. Here's the key points: Graphics are nice and detailed better than what you usualy find in most indie jrpgs. Soundtracks are good but not much of variety of them. Their prided hatsune miku soundtrack is a nice addition but when it plays on almost every occasion get's a bit boring.  Sound effects of charackters in combact are very weak and lame, I'm sure you can get better SFX from freesound.org but it's something one can get used to and don't care. Combact itself is quite repetetive, charackters really could use more skills to obtain, however almost all enemy encounters are avoidable if you so desire.  The game is really easy, until the last boss fight, where it suddenly becomes frustatingly unfair and luck based. And lastly it's calling itself the ""story-driven"" so I guess the most important thing is whether the story is good?  The answer would be - yeah it's ok. By no means great, the emo protagonist is a bit annoying, cliche dialogs are a bit too obvious, some nonsensical forced quests inserted out of place is...really annoying, but It's still engaging and I enjoyed it quite a bit.So overall the game is above average, I'd recommend it for everyone who likes JRPGs. Full price is acceptable, on sale - definitely.			"

												A short but interesting game.Presentation: As you start up the game you are greated to a anime sounding soundtrack, and to be honest I did not know what to think. The style is very JRPG and I am not the biggest fan of the genre. Eventhough the presentation made me think JRPG and indie, I was very suprised by the game. It is not a game of the year ofc, but it is still a fun little titel.Gameplay: Well it`s a turnbased attck game, you have your basic classes the warrior the mage etc. But this game is set in a future like theme, so everyone has there own abilities based on the stone in them. It`s hard to explain without spoiling the story. The gameplay is decent but get`s repetative and slow very fast. Only the story really keept me going. A big flaw for me was the short amount of grinding I needed to do, in order to become a unstoable god. This balance flaw should be fixed in my opinion.There are also a few fetch quest whitch makes a lot of the gameplay whitch was not in any way interesting.Charecters:All the cahrecters are pretty great. One thing I did not like was the fact that the charecters personality are really...one sided. This is not a bad thing, but this stops cahrecter develpoment and makes the charecters really boring at times. The main charecter dose not belive it is ok to kill, therefore his ""girlfriend"" helps him out by killing the creatures he is told to. This reapets throughout th story again and again, I will talk more about this in -story-.The main bad guy is your starting leader and he believis it is ok to kill creatures in order to go home, the main good guy belives the opersit. I will talk more about it, but as said the charecters are really one sided and stays that way throughout the story. Visuels: The style is 8-bit and it suits the game for the most part. Not much to say here since the game is as short as it is. Sound/Music: The music is pretty great, the soundtrack remeinds me of other games from the same genre. A small problem about the music is that it loops and repeats in every area, and when you enter a new area. This can make the music a bot tiresome at times. Now about the sound. The speciel attack sound is pretty....loud! I needed to constantlly turn up and down my volume becouse new charecters had a highpich speciel attack. This is not a flaw, but really annoying.Story: The story is as folows: humans has been removed from the earth becouse of aliens have taken over. They find another planet to live on and are split into 2 factions. The ones that want to go back to earth and the others that want to live on the new planet. These factions are at war, becouse the first faction wants to kill the ki creatures on the planet, in order to power thier powerfull robots. The main charecter hates to kill ki creatures and his girlfriend kill for him, in order not to make himself a bad name around town, when the main charecter gets a chance to join the other faction, he goes for it.Without spoiling to much, I can say the story is good at times, but really get`s boring at other times. The climactic ending made up for it in my opinion, but really judge for youself. Conclution:The game is short, a weak RPG, and gets really boring at times, still I found the game enjoyable, eventhough it has flaws, This for me was a decent game, and if you are a fan of the JRPG genre, you could give it try.

												Alpha Kimori is a game I have some tough love for. It lusts to be a better game, and while what is at its base is decent, the episodic nature that can be healthy for most forms of gaming just doesn't click with this sort of game. Just when some character development is made, the game ends, and the sequence of events leading to the ""climax"" feels hurried and poorly explained, leaving us with a cliffhanger of sorts that feels more like a transition than an ending to a product.To give credit where its due, the ability to avoid most encounters thanks to their corporealLater on they make the enemies track you, which gets a bit comical once you get a good conga-line of enemies following behind you. Thankfully the battles themselves are quick and harmless, and while there is no autobattle feature, rapidly tapping enter until everything is dead seemed highly effective in every situation except boss battles.The mythology is interesting enough, and while the core story concept seems to have some depth, we only gather so much before we are booted to the credits. For the length of the game, flashbacks occur far too often, encircling the same scene from different perspectives. While this idea could work well in a different context, the scene they use is a bit too boring, and gets further ridiculous as they show the amount of people tied into this one fairly mundane encounter. One flashback was enough for this bit, but it occurs at least 6 more times, JUST to make sure you get the picture. The heavy-handed plot is definitely worth the watch however, as I got a good chuckle once I realized what they were going for, but don't expect any real thought-provoking moments. The protagonist in particular is a classic case of insensitive prick with a harem complex, and the dissonance of ""I don't want to hurt any innocent creatures"" combined with him and his constantly changing female companion slaughtering thousands of said creatures is just silly, especially given that his ""reluctance"" is the main driving point of this first chapter.When it comes to pacing the game is sporadic, as the lack of fast travel has you going through the same enviornments and encounters without adding anything to pad out the repitition. It would be okay if there was a variety of locations, but almost every mission objective is a little farther than the last within the same four areas, and there are no shortcuts that are always open to you. The shortcuts they do provide are often story specific, and while they usually teleport you back to save time, they aren't always a two way street, which had me flinching every time I found out I had to go through that same forest with the stupid purple bunnies for the 10th time.Ultimately, Alpha Kimori is a b-tier RPG with a lot of camp to it that keeps its charm even after it outstays its welcome. The effort is genuine, and I will honestly consider picking up the rest of the episodes once they're released, for there is something at the core of this that I can't help but admire. I enjoyed my time with it, and while my attention was mainly focused on the show I had playing in the background, I've found myself thinking about it well after finishing and I couldn't tell you why. Definitely worth the pickup if you can look past the flaws and enjoy the heart that it has.			"

												Not bad.The story is alright. The music is good.Has a typical RPG feel, not overly hard but not super challenging either.Combat definitely needs some work. It's not bad. however it would benefit from a ""rush"" button.As well as it not remembering who attacked what each time you select can get rather tideous.Having to chase down the monsters in order to initiate battle is somewhat infuriating. The monsters who fly move around rather quickly, I am using the keyboard but I still have to chase them quite abit before being able to catch them to start a battle - that is definitely annoying, I can't imagine how infuritiating it would be with using the mouse.Overall, I'd pick up this game when it's on sale.

The Ki Skills attack did the same amount of damage as the normal attack most of the time. I used the healing skill a few times but most of the time I would lose the same amount of life with the next attack. Further is the combat slow. If you don't like that you can walk past the enemies without problems (Most of the times). Don't buy this game if you only want combat.This game looks kinda like a visual novel: There isn't much of a game without the story. Only in a visual novel you get to choose what you want to do, in here you just go do the thing you have to do to get to the next part in the story. The battles doesn't make a change what the story will do. One of the battles I won without even getting damaged but the story said that the main character Rick (The one you play) got so much damaged that he almost couldn't get up..They don't show you where to go, you have to find out yourself if you have to go to the school or some other place. I always got lost whenever I had to go to a new place. The first time I had to go to the school building I ended up in the Item Shop.. The walking is very slow and you can't walk till the npc are done walking. They don't have a sprinting button (Which they should add) They don't show where you can and can't walk. I bumped into stuff almost every time it was possible.I also miss a button that can lower the music. You only can mute it. And whenever I walked outside of a building the music would go louder..Only buy this game for the story or watch someone else play this. I bought this game with the Humble Bundle you can buy it here[www.humblebundle.com]  before 25 december 2014 I think.			"

												I liked the gameplay and the story was pretty awesome. After a while it gets annoying to walk everywhere though.			"

												Pro:  Amazing story.  As much as i disliked the game i played the entire first episode just to see the story.  Leaves you on the worst cliffhanger wanting more.  Hopefully by the time episode 2 is released i will have forgoten the story and not care to find out.Con: Terrible game mechanics.  Leveling up just adds more life to drag the boring fights out longer.  You were so overpowered the entire game that you find yourself constantly avoiding fights and slamming the action key to do basic attack as fast as possible.  On occasion the fight took so long you had to heal.  Skills and items were worthless in a fight except for heals.  On top of that, you spend the entire game in only 3 different maps + the city.  They rehash those 3 maps so much you will be banging your head against the wall becuase you have to go back there again for the 6th time.  Everytime you run an errand you dont just go to that one map, you have to go to all 3 of them again.Otherthoughts: Just watch a good anime if you like stories.  Save you the carpal tunnel from repeatedly hitting the enter key for 10 hours.			"

Alpha Kimori: Episode 1 is the first instalment of a three-part narratively-focused JRPG series, brought to you by Sherman3D. While it boasts highly in the way of narrative and gameplay, how well does it compare to the other titles in the genre and does it really do anything to set itself apart, which is an apparent problem with a lot of recent JRPG’s?Full review in the video above, I hope this helps you decide if Alpha Kimori is suited for you or not! :)			"

												too me this game just feels like a time waster, repetative uninteresting combat, lots of back tracking, and wasteful dialog of how ""Im going to be the best warriror!"" some pretty cliche writing off the bat. I know a lot of people claim the story is really good but i havent been able to get into it at all.			"

												the combat is really grindy, even for a fan of the genre.  The writing was pretty terrible, but I liked where the story was going.  The problem was that almost 3 hours in, and I had fought about 200 enemies of 6 different types, and they pretty-much just use auto attacks.			"

												This game is amazing, brings forth the nostalgia feeling from oldschool Jrpgs from Nintendo, but on that note...for the almost $10 USD this game falls short, its leaves it to be continues at the end...*spoilers* I know, but it needs to be told it doesn't finish and requires a continuation....really =\ wtf! :(For that amount of money, should get the entire game =.=			"

												I only idled this game for trading cards. Normally I wouldn't review a game that I haven't actually played, but this game has WAY too many positive reviews for something that looks like a cheap RPG Maker ripoff of Secret of Mana.			"
