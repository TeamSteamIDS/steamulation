												I don't think a game has ever made me cry so much. Coming from a family with substance abuse, this game hit down to the core. It isn't a difficult game, but it has a beautiful and powerful story to tell.			"

												I love this game! Pure poetry in a childish dream! It's a metaphorical game about a child and his deep fears. The more you play the more you want to know the truth about his father. It's really interesting because there's a real drama behind this poetic and sweet appearances. Plus puzzles are amazing ^^ Very good game, both fascinating and relaxing!9/10			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Papo & Yo Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Adventure; Puzzle-Platformer; Atmospheric; Short   My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 4-7 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamersREVIEWPapo & Yo is a highly atmospheric, third-person puzzle-platformer that will embark you on an imaginative and enthralling adventure.  The game is quite short; but it boasts an undeniable charm that makes every hour played, however few, rather enjoyable.   The metaphorical narrative is mostly told through the emotion in the atmosphere and the styles of the puzzles, rather than lines and lines of dialogue.  The enchanting soundtrack and imaginative environments serve to create a stimulating atmosphere that tells the story through its interpretation.   This approach to storytelling in video games can be hit-or-miss, but I think Papo & Yo is a good example of how it can be quite effective.The gameplay boils down to three-dimensional, environment-based puzzles that can be solved mostly through exploration and experimentation.  Due to this style of gameplay, the game is quite linear.  It will usher you from one location to the next, each with its own puzzle to solve.  The puzzles are mostly challenging without becoming needlessly frustrating, although some of them can be a little tricky to figure out without any hints or direction.As I alluded to, the game is fairly short— topping out at a handful of hours, depending on how quickly you can solve the puzzles.  To add a little supplemental depth, there is also a decent set of collectibles to search for (i.e.: hats) that can add a little more to the game for players who choose to pursue that.  That said, I personally felt the length of the game was perfect and that it helped create a short-and-sweet appeal to the game, instead of allowing it to grow stale.I thoroughly enjoyed my playthrough of Papo & Yo.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys atmospheric games and/or puzzle-platformers in this style.  Further, I feel this is a game that can also appeal to gamers who don’t normally play this type of genre, due to the fact that it is intriguing and short enough to give someone a taste of something different without overburdening them.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												I am outraged that I have never seen this game before getting it in the Humble Bundle. The fact that Papo & Yo got almost no attention while Gone Home got game of the years, 10/10s, and several thousands articles written about it frustrates me to no end. Not only is Papo & Yo a good game, it does more for story telling and social commentary than any video game I can think of.Here's the important part first. Purely as a game, it is a good game. The player is required to solve a series of platforming puzzles that gradually become more complex the further in they go. None of them were incredibly difficult. Most of the difficultly comes from figuring out how you're suppose to use a new mechanic or item and then adding it to larger problems. Using the classic system of introduce, teach, then impliment, it makes sure the player is never confused. I was only once stumped enough to restart the level, thinking I had broken the game. However, I had just not been looking hard enough at the answer staring me in the face. Other than solid platform puzzling there's nothing completely amazing. It does what it does well and is definitely worth the Humble Bundle price.Now for extra bullox. Papo & Yo is not 2deep4you. In fact, it states the symbolism of the monster in the first few seconds of starting the game, but everything about the game manages to be abstract enough to make the player think and form their own interpetations. It is rather light on story, focusing instead on the gameplay itself. What this game aces is the use of gameplay to tell the story. From the beginning, the player should know that the monster is an abusive parent, but nothing else is ever stated. The interaction between the boy and the monster in the form of puzzle solving mechanics reveals their relationship. There is no walking around reading notes. Very little of the story is spoon-fed. This combination of gameplay and story is what makes Papo & Yo so fantastic. It is telling a story about social issues by the means of a video game, not by a collection of text files.And the best part is that this social commentary goes beyond first-world, white people problems. It covers problems of child abuse, alcoholism, and class issues, which I feel are much bigger problems in the world than sexuality. Quite honestly, I didn't understand the story at first because I have never been in any similar situations. Still, I was able to feel for the central characters far more than any other attempts at video game social commentary because I was involved with the basics of the relationship through gameplay.If video games want to be taken seriously they never will , they need to bring to light world issues that don't involve the internet and Papo & Yo does that excellently.I'm sure someone else could say this far more eloquently than I ever could. Papo & Yo is a good game and is a fantastic example of how to mix gameplay and a serious, non-action story into an enjoyable and emotional experience.			"

												Papo & Yo is a rare game that manages to perfectly represent what it is like to be a child and the effects of substance abuse by those closest to them. This surprised me, because it is hard to tell a story with such complex themes under the guise of a game with any degree of success. Yet Papo & Yo handles it beautifully, and crafts an emotionally rewarding experience that deserves to be played. It certainly has its problems, but it manages to entertain and engage the player from beginning to end.Throughout Papo & Yo you play as Quico, a young boy who explores a dream like interpretation of Brazilian styled favelas. Throughout the game you are accompanied by three characters. The first is Lula, a cute yellow robot who hangs on to Quico’s back throughout the game, and serves to help him navigate and solve the puzzles that he encounters throughout his journey. There is also a girl who uses chalk to bring buildings and other objects in the environment to life, and more often than not plays tricks rather than help. These two characters are the ones that actively communicate to you.And then there’s Monster, a giant pink beast who grunts and roars as he eats and sleeps. Despite his outward frightful appearance, he is actually quite peaceful more often than not.Papo & Yo handles the complexities of addiction and abuse extremely well, never going into lengthy explanations or long, dialogue encumbered scenes in order to convey its themes. Instead, the game mostly relies on the actions of the characters and the change in environments and scenery in order to communicate, which is a very welcome change.Throughout Quico’s journey, he will encounter puzzles of varying length and complexity that obstruct his path. What is most amazing about Papo & Yo’s puzzles is that they involve the environment in rather stunning and wonderful ways.Turning a switch can result in a building gaining legs and moving to another position, pulling a lever could turn a building sideways to unveil a hidden set of stairs, and lifting a box can create and move giant crates that could be used at your disposal. The mechanics and feel of Papo & Yo also deserve praise. The jumping and navigating of the world feels natural, and I always enjoyed how Quico interacts with his environment. The favelas are simply stunning to navigate and explore. The locations feel like they have been lived in, but also are off just enough that you can tell that it is in an imaginative world. The sounds that the environment makes as you solve puzzles and move about are a delight to listen to, and credit must be given to whoever designed the ambient sounds found within the game.Papo & Yo is a unique game. It handles its themes extremely well, and the world is simply amazing to behold. Though the game is not without its faults, chief among them a lack of difficulty and challenge, Papo & Yo should be played at least once. Trust me, the journey will be quite worth it.			"

												Empathy seems to be in short supply lately.Though it’s now easier than ever to interact with others, between the endless deluge of vitriolic comments, coordinated harassment, seemingly spontaneous violence and the general lack of decency so often show to other human beings, it feels as if we’ve only become more disconnected as our methods of communication advance.Papo & Yo is the rare game that asks for us to find the ability for greater understanding. Its design is subtle and meaningful, created in an attempt to tell nuanced human story but without the intention of forcing its meaning upon you. It’s an exploration of our capacity to love someone trapped and tormented by their inner demons, and how sometimes the ability to help them is beyond our ability.Much of Papo & Yo is surreal and impossible, with walking houses and magic chalk lines allowing its themes to come across less overtly. Playing as the young Brazillian, Quico, the world takes on a sort of childlike wonder, delightfully playful and unconcerned with any greater troubles that might exist within it. Running around picking up frogs and reading the crayon drawn insides of cardboard boxes, I was struck by how humbly the game presents itself. It doesn’t attempt more than it knows it’s capable of, but at the same time has something important to say and wants to make sure it says it right.One of the ways developer Minority Media achieves this, is how it presents its other main character, Monster. It’s a giant horned creature, but what’s important about it is it’s never framed as the antagonist. When you first meet Monster he’s just a big sleepy companion, who runs around with its tongue hanging out as you lead it around with the help of a mellon. These early moments help to develop the bond between Quico and Monster, as they help each other through levels and Quico shows a very clear fondness for his hulking friend.Monster’s love of poisonous frogs however, turns him into something to fear. As he ravishly gobbles them up, his actions become violent and his appearance demonic. What was once your friend becomes an unstable brute, and in this feeling of helpless terror Papo & Yo strives to give you a glimpse at the horror of being a child surrounded by abuse. I wanted to help Monster, but any attempt to do so only lead to him taking out his aggression on me. It made me feel small and powerless to do anything but flee, and distressed that there seemed no solution to Monster’s addiction.Papo & Yo might not be the most polished game, and its puzzle design is rife with unnecessary backtracking and tedious solutions, but it’s overshadowed by what the game represents and is trying to convey to the player. With much of the narrative being autobiographical, it makes it all the more raw and haunting to watch Quico and Monster be torn apart from each other. It’s a complicated story told with uncomplicated methods, deriving empathy through gameplay more than dialogue. From the start of the game, Minority Media seem prepared to not overly simplify the story they want to tell or to take the reassuring route with a clean cut happy ending. I’m finding it hard to completely reconcile my feelings over how everything wrapped up, but if nothing else I feel I comprehend at least a little more what those going through the sort of experiences displayed here are feeling. And that’s something we could all stand to do more often.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												First of all, I have to mention that this is quite a powerful game and can have quite an impact on people if they have ever suffered with or been aroud substance misuse although it isn't primarily focused on this. The gameplay is incredible. There is lots to explore and lots of creative elements involved such as making things in order to help you through your journey. Without giving too much away, you feel very much like you are the character playing and you quite often feel what he is feeling. This did make me cry, I will be honest but I personally, love games that has such a powerful impact on me. It makes me want to play it again and again and I have already completed the game twice and itching to go back. It's easy to forget yourself and get totally immersed. If you like adventure and a taste for real life elements, give this game a try. It was suggested to me by a friend and I can't thank him enough for putting me in touch with this game. I highly recommend it and I'm very thankful to the developers for going to so much trouble and effort to make it an amazing experience for me.			"

												While not difficult or complex as a platform puzzler, Papo & Yo offers visuals that are at times cartoonish and whimsical, but always hold an undercurrent of something truly sinister. There were times throughout the game, especially near the end, where I felt genuinely tense, and I found myself on edge in dreadful anticipation of what I knew was coming next- which is no doubt exactly what the story-tellers intended. Papo & Yo has a story worth telling, and does not waste your time telling it.			"

												This game really surprised me!At first you'll think this is just a very linear story-driven platformer with some easy puzzles. It actually feels somewhat like a kid's platformer, but there's more to it.After completing the game you'll learn that everything in the game is a metaphore for a very dark and mature subject.That aside, the game have really unique and artistic level designs and a fitting soundtrack.I have no problem recommending this game. However, the full price at 12,99€ do seem a bit high when the game can be completed in 3-4 hours. "

												Gorgeous, brilliant, intelligent, beautiful, surreal, magical. A treat for the eyes, the heart and the mind. This indie game cleverly mixes metaphor with gameplay in an amazing, colorful presentation. The puzzles themselves are not too challenging, but still provide a comfortable feeling of accomplishment when you conquer them. The platforming could have used a tiny bit of tweaking though. But the game's real goal is to let you share the emotional journey of the silent protagonist. Unfortunately, as the entire game is a metaphor I don't want to explain it too much by giving away the meaning (sadly the trailers, while beautifully made, blatantly tell the hidden meaning so I recommend to interested parties that they do /not/ watch them). Still, it's hard not to emphasize with the pint-sized hero as he explore his magical world even knowing what is coming. Definitely one of the most interesting games I've played this year. "

Beautiful music, fantastic atmosphere, interesting characters and intriguing puzzles. 10 out of 10.For people like me, it's an 11.For me, this became less a game, and more of a therapy session.When you discover the nature of the story, there will be a divisive point. Luckily, you will enjoy the game either way. Some people will be emotionally struck. Thankfully, in a very healthy way, in my humble opinion.Experiences like this transcend the medium. They elevate it, and should be understood for more than just entertainment value, but a conduit for healing, and understanding.That is all I can say. "

												What is a monster?  What is a frog?  What if your best friend was a monster?  Papo & Yo is truly a remarkable adventure, puzzle platformer which may make you rethink these questions.  Truth be told, Papo & Yo only caught my eye after a good friend of mine added it to his Steam Wishlist.  As many of you may have done, I waited for this game to go on a 75%+ sale when it was released as Humble Indie Bundle X's beat-the-average tier.  Luckily for me, rather than leaving this game to sit in my Steam Library to collect dust, I downloaded and decided to try it out.What I discovered was one of the most captivating games I have ever played or watched.  From the first scene, a black screen with white text: ""'To my mother, brothers and sisters with whom I survived the monster in my father.'  Vander Caballero,"" to the ending of the credits, this game does not disappoint - it simply gets better.Verdict: Papo & Yo is simply an absolutely stunning game.  It is symbolism at its finest and storytelling at its greatest.  It is a visually gorgeous game loaded with an immense amount of creative ingenuity.  In order to not reveal any spoilers, all I can say is ""this game is a must-play.""  You know a game is good when all you can do is sit in awe, thought, and understanding through the entirety of the credits after you complete it.			"

												I really liked this game. The music and visuals were pretty good with a unique setting. The game is very story focused although the story is never told in direct terms. It becomes obvious as events in the game reveal it. I think for people who enjoy games with a story to them the presentation here is something to appreciate.The story really resonated with me personally but I will refrain from saying why to avoid any spoilers. You may find that it does with you as well but even if not it is still just as worthy of your time.As for the gameplay itself, it is simple puzzling and platforming and I do mean simple. Anyone good at those sorts of games may be critical of this one on that account but I hope not. The gameplay is just a vehicle to deliver the story really more than anything else. It's very casual but I liked that personally as someone who does not generally get into puzzlers or platformers much at all. If you shy away from those sorts of games don't let the mention of that here scare you off. It is so easy I can do it which means anybody can. Furthermore, there is a built in easily accessible hint system that will guide you along so you cannot fail if you find yourself puzzled about how to advance. Now, I did not need this of course but I just wanted to let you know it is there and makes what you need to do crystal clear.I played the Mac version on OS X 10.10.2 with no problems at all. It ran just fine on my late-2013 27"" iMac.			"

Every part of it. you play as a kid who is trying to escape reality cause his father drinks a lot and becomes abusive ( the plot twist in the end is really sad and made me cry :( )-your playground is a colorful shanty town which you can  change and alter part of it to solve easy to medium puzzles , nothing hard and your main objective is to escape from a monster and try to cure him.-didn't face any problems or bugs, everything was smooth-the music is very emotional and really good, voice acting is in a different language but still good, and the sound effect are perfect.- easy achievements but sadly no cards to craft a badge- takes 4 to 5 h to complete .i highly recommend this gem to anyone who likes platform games and emotional/atmospheric games such as me ( i did cry in the end T^T )- i was going to say that the price is a bit too much but after i finished the game i think its worth it .9/10			"

												Initially I thought Papo & Yo was a platformer with simple puzzle elements intended for children, but I was greatly mistaken. The game appears to be very happy-go-lucky and easy on the eyes, but when you dive deeper into the game, you realise that every object and character around you are tiny pieces of a massive allegory, revealing a much darker tale. Hidden behind the pretense of a child's daydream, this game beautifully tells a tale of a child's fears, making use of brilliant composition and an amazing soundtrack. The fascinating level design displays a completely new take on the world. After playing through this masterpiece, I was incapable of finding a reason not to recommend this game!			"

												Papo & Yo is a fairly short indie puzzle/platformer game that doubles as an elephantine metaphor for the game's creative director's troubled relationship with his father. The puzzles are fairly simple, but the way you interact with the world is interesting and the visuals are fantastic.

												A pleasant journey in a surreal world. As I was playing together with my kids, the story behind the game in the end made me feel very sad and somehow upset. I didn't expect it to be that profound and realistic and even though it's a tragedy, the road the main character follows is paved with hope and good feelings all around. Sometimes the world feels empty and lonely, there are a total of 4 characters in the game.I can totally recommend it if you like third person puzzle platformers with few text lines to read and a lot of platforms. And jumping, and platforms to jump to. And when you need to run, oh God, run without looking back or your kids will start screaming at the screen and kick you to run faster.			"

												I want to see more games like this. In fact, playing this game makes me want to make a game like this. I can tell you exactly what the message of this game was (I won't, for those who haven't yet played it). I can tell you how the characters struggled, how the story affects us in real life, and the core lesson we learn from this game that allows us to better ourselves outside of it.I believe games like this will define the way people will view this medium in the future. Just as there are books and movies that really have no real value other than being a fun ride, most games today are played simply because they are enjoyable. But when something like this comes around the corner and gives you a story that challenges your opinions and so clearly mirrors the pain we see in our lives, I have to take notice. This is a small story that mirrors the Big Story, and it's asking us to listen and learn. So go ahead. Play it with an open mind, and reflect on what you find. This game has a lot to say.			"

 Overview	Papo & Yo or Father and I markets itself as a puzzle, action, platformer set in a dream world of a Brazilian favela.  You play as Quico a boy who has to help a monster who has a strange addiction to poisonous mushrooms that enrage the beast upon consumption.  The only way to temporary calm down the monster is to feed him some blue, rotten fruit.  Following the advice of a mysterious girl named Alejandra, you must navigate the favela by manipulating buildings with chalk magic and bring the monster to the temple to cure him of this unfortunate addiction. Papo & Yo is also tagged as story rich, but it isn’t shown on the steam page and I truly believe that is the greatest asset of the game.  Papo & Yo is not only about escaping the big bad monster and rescuing the femme fatale, but also contains lots of metaphors and symbolism.    The Good	One of Papo & Yo’s bestselling points is the amount of visuals.  I’m not only talking about graphics options and textures, but also about the backdrop and wall art.  Throughout the game there are some amazing looking graffiti art, which I can only guess is a digital rendition of something that already exists in the real world.  Each piece of art is not only eye candy, but also contributes to the game experience because the art follows the progression of the story.  If one takes the time to look at the graffiti, while making connections to the game, the game as a whole becomes much more pleasant and enjoyable upon completion. The game is also linked and joined together really well.  There are no ‘fade to black’ scenes and the whole game seems to be made on a single map.  The goal of the game is simple enough, with level progression usually locked away by a metal gate, out of reach, or just requires the weight of the monster on a pressure plate.  Camera work is superb when it takes over control from the user, and it really does the map justice with its long pan-overs and high angle shots.  This is also an extremely important step because it allows the player to quickly look at the layout of the map since there in no in-game mini-map.   In terms of audio, the accompanying composition features 2 main soundtracks.  One with the slower ‘wild’ music that plays when monster is calm which really fits in with the Brazilian favela setting and the rushed rapid drumming music when the monster is poisoned by the frogs.  In particular, the latter sound piece is composed in such a way that actually promotes urgency.  The quick fade between the first piece and this other composition, along with the rapid change in colour scheme of the map when the monster becomes enraged really feels like something out of Pompeii.   The voice acting was great and you could really sense the great sense of urgency in the tone of the voices between Aljandra and Quico.  I personally think going with subtitled text was the much better option in terms of localization rather than a voiceover since there are often certain vocal ticks that can’t be transferred from one language to another.  That is why I always prefer spoken dialogue in its original intended language even if I don’t understand what they’re saying.However, Papo & Yo’s greatest selling point is the story.  It’s definitely not a story everyone can relate to, but it definitely shines a lot more light on some real life situations that are still happening in this day and age.  If you hadn’t guessed what the story and the metaphoric actions meant throughout playing the game, you will find out at the end as the story crosses between the two realities that it exists in.  The Bad Since the game is story-driven, and it tells you pretty much everything in the last chapter, the game loses out on replayability value, even if the option is given in the menu to start from every single checkpoint save.  Another thing I really disliked about this game was the puzzle aspect of this game.  This game had nearly no puzzle aspect.  It wasn’t like the Talos Principle or the Portal series, but more like a point and click game.  You just had to trial and error to find the next gear or pressure plate that allowed you to advance to the next stage of the game.   Ultimately, the game was more of a walking simulator mixed into a movie for me.  I would have finished it much faster if there weren’t a lot of forced ‘walking back and forth’. Overall Score I give Papo & Yo a score of 9/10.  I truly enjoyed this game because I am a huge fan of strong story based games that make you think and make connections to real life scenarios.  Apart from mediocre puzzle and some useless features a la the ability to walk in the game, this is one of the best games I’ve ever played and is definitely worth a buy just to play if not just for the art and music.

   My Playthrough   Youtube Video    The Review Papo & Yo which means father and I, is a very fascinating game. The game is about a boy named quico who escapes into his mind in order to deal with the trauma caused by his father. It's very rare that I play a game this creative and cryptic. While on the surface this looks like a simple platformer but in reality it is a more complex puzzle platformer. If you like games with deep mysterious story and great puzzles then you will have fun with this game.  "

												At first I thought this game was just kind of a cheery little silly platform puzzler where you bounce around with chalk markings and floating magic sugar cubes, but as it progressed the story became revealed... the game actually got legitimately unsettling, even frightening at points. The story is very carefully revealed and if you don't get spoiled through reading guides or wikis, you'll be stabbed in the stomach with feelings. These aren't 'girly visual novel' feelings, these are 'I have never cried at a movie and I'm not scared of horror games; there's just something in my eye, please hold me' feelings. For some people, the topic may actually hit very close to home.On a gameplay note, the gameplay itself is actually fairly simple though it can be periodically frustrating if you don't know what to do. It's a short-ish game, taking about 4 and a half hours to complete if you get stuck only on a couple of puzzles. Definitely worth it, especially if you get it on sale. I've had the game for over a year and I don't regret purchasing it.			"

												I decided to buy this game after watching behind the scenes of making the soundtrack, I was fascinated by the way they made the live music, but wasn't expecting that much of the gameplay - and I'm pleased to say this game proved me wrong!The world is beautiful, and just my cup of tea, part fantasy but realistic. I love the imagination that just shows in the game, and the controls are tight, great quality apart from the camera being a bit too close when the monster's chasing you. Now on the emotional part  - the creator said himself that it's based on his experience of being abused in his childhood, and while I have not gone through emotional or physical distress like that personally, the way this game showed me these emotions was simply genius. It was gentle, yet it was a completely new emotional for me. That a video game could do that really earned my respect.All in all, I'd recommend this game though it's short and maybe not your style if you're looking for a challenge, but it's something I cherish and am glad I've played.Here's a link to the behind the scenes I mentioned above: http://www.desura.com/games/papo-yo/news/the-music-stylings-of-papo-yos-soundtrack "

												Beautiful Dark Turth Story 5/10Gamplay 6/10Replayable 6/10Achievement 9/10Papo & Yo is a beautiful charming game that holds a deep dark secret. Guiding you throughout a dream-scape, parkour-puzzle sort of world is a series of colourful and dynamic scenes and puzzles that change the world around you as it unravels its truth. A calm, soothing, often upbeat and cheerful soundtrack rassures you venture deeper into the  world.The story of the game is quite short and took you on a slow but increasinly intense journey which really didn't make much sense on the first playthrough, small cutscenes didn't give away much about the story in the gameplay, but then the pieces all rapidly come together to reveal the dark truth which created a much different perspective on the second playthrough. You gain attachment to the main character who I believe is Yo, as you explore the urban maze through a childs eyes, and how the smallest things look different to a childlike imagination.The puzzles are not to difficult and the controls are easy to pick up.Recommend if you like puzzles, mystery, intrigueing storyline and beautiful imagery.

												Papo & Yo is a masterpiece. It contains one of the best storytelling I've ever experienced in a video game and it does so in a very unique manner. The game tells the story about a boy and his alcoholic dad and if I understood correctly, you play in Rico's (the boy) mind and you play around with his imagination. The dialogue is pretty much non existent, it's the actual progression through the game that counts. The game features an amazing and wonderful soundtrack that really got me in the right mood while I was playing. Now, most of the gameplay is actually jumping and solving puzzles and even though I usually hate solving puzzles, I was astonished by how simple, but yet, how unique and how clever the puzzles in Papo & Yo were designed. The game has it's touching and very emotional moments and I think that's one of the strongest points of it along with the gorgeous graphics it has. I honestly don't know how can I recommend it more or if I'm recommending it enough. Please, buy it and play it I guarantee you won't regret it.			"

												Despite being a short game (it took me less than 5 hours), you aren't left wanting more after finishing Papo & Yo, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Think of a TV series that finishes after two series or so while it's still fresh and the stories are worthwhile, instead of dragging on season after season trying to wring every last penny out of the idea. Papo & Yo communicates some very strong emotions and makes sure it gets the point across and then it ends. Simple and perfect. The graphics aren't exactly mind blowing, but if you're looking for graphics you're in the wrong place - Papo & Yo is about story and, more importantly, emotion. My thoughts go out to the developer of this game, and I hope creating it helped to provide closure.			"

												I was expecting this to be a small indie title that was rough around the edges, which is why it was such a surprise.  This has the production values of a AAA title - whatever any of that means, but it would never be released and marketed as such.  You'll see amazing, world-bending things, things that haven't really got an equivalent in other games.But you'll also get the point, which is why this could never really be an AAA blockbuster.  It's beautifully sad, and definitely not for everyone.  Mindful of triggers due to the subject matter, but without spoiling anything, I'll just say that the ending is as redemptive as you want it to be.			"

												Played through Papa & Yo today.Not a bad game. I remember the press on this being highly favorable. The gameplay wasnt really very challenging, but it was engaging enough to convey the story, which was obvious very quickly, so no worries about spoilers really...you (but really the guy who wrote the story) had an abusive alcoholic dad, and the torment of that upbringing haunted him throughout his life until he was finally able to let go of the fear and torment and move on with his life....that is pretty much the story in a nutshell. It is put forward in a very sensitive manner, and serves to explain the writers feelings without necessarily forcing them on you the gamer. So, I can see why people liked the game based on that. I think the gameplay was probably a 6 out of 10, but the story was more like a 7 out of 10, and the presentation was a 9 out of 10.			"

""NO QUOTE TO ADD FOR REAL""Pretty little indie game from unknown or let me say lesser known developer Minority. They're in making of Time Machine VR Indie that so far looks pretty average however recieved best indie of 2015 E3 award. And how does this indie from 2013 stands out? Even better.Papo & Yo is basically adventure puzzle jumping running hiding game. Story is about brazilian boy goes by name Quico who is running through the favela, stacking buildings and shacks like puzzle, while hiding and also interacting with the Monster. Lot of people saying that story Vander Caballero created was beautiful but I feel like it was more weak than actually good.The whole gameplay is really repetetive and always about same thing. Me personally, I didn't really like Quico, I didn't really like his yellow little friend, I didn't even like his girlfiend Alejandra (GF really?) and also I didn't really like the Monster. So what else was any good for me to give it thumbs up? Favela. Puzzle. Music. I like the interacting and manipulating of the buildings and shacks so much, and also whole puzzle concept and the way you make out those puzzles was really good. Music is matter of personal taste so all I'm saying is I've liked that.The whole game lasts about 2-3 hours depends how you play it, additionaly few minutes if you want to collect all the hats. I did play it through calm and enjoyable way back in 2014 now I've finished speedrun but to be honest it's not that type of indie game you would replay. At least for me.To sum it up, if you can get it during sale for 2-3 bucks then definitely go for it. If you like soft stories and calm gameplay then also go for it. In the worst case it'll be less enjoyable but certainly it won't be bad.Bonus Point: FavelaRating: 6/10 "

												Where most platformers have a full host of enemies, Papo & Yo has just one, and that's rather important. While it very satisfyingly ties gameplay to a deeply personal narrative, it also puts considerable strain on the game's obstacles to make up for a lack of variety. Fortunately, the game manages to surprise throughout in that department, with level design that is elegant in both form and function.			"

												The two words I'd use to describe this game would be: unsettingly beautiful. What You get in this title is about 3.5 hour of gameplay, which may not seem much, but it's one of those cases where what matters is quality over quantity. And the quality is spectacular, mainly because 'Papo & Yo' comes close to perfection in terms of merging beutifuly designed world, deep plot, and amusing gameplay relying on solving not-so-hard, yet satysfyingly clever puzzles.Chosing one from points mentioned above it's definitely the plot, and how it's told, that makes 'Papo & Yo' unique experience worth getting. The plot in which we guide Quico through dreamy land strongly resembling one of the south american favelas takes some sudden turn, as we experience more and more deeply methaphorical events culminating in one of the most touching story climaxes I've experienced.I strongly encourage everyone to give this game a try, I believe none of You will regreat this.

												This was one of the first puzzle games I've played with my six year old. The controls were too much for him but he adored sitting on my lap and pointing out things I needed to move toward or what to do. I played it on a Steam Controller and found the endless need to change the viewpoint to be... unpleasant to say the least. More than once, the camera got jammed up against Papo and it was frustrating to move out of the way; on the other hand, looking around was an important part of the game so it is good and bad.There were a few scenes where the plot got a bit too emotional for him and I chose not to explain the final few scenes to him. The story itself was lovely, revealing slowly with only a few confusing moments that I still don't understand.			"

												Alcoholism is destructive. Not only for your liver but for the lives of your surroundings. Especially your family, and even more specifically, your kids. The delirious anger can inhibit a child's imagination and creativity in ways you never thought possible. The shame that comes with a parents insane behavior could possibly mentally scar a child for life. Not giving a child the proper attention, will belittle him or her to the point of extinction. Humans have a bond to their parents, a bond that is hard to break, especially when that bond is held tighter by constant attempts to catch a father or mother's attention, and failing. This need for acceptance is everlasting, and never getting it will assemble a world-view of misconstrued self-hating nonsense. Self-hatred and shame will burn inside of you with the same fire that fueled your father's anger. You will feel so insignificant and, subsequently, depressed, feelings of hopelessness will cover your interests in creative endeavors in a thick goo of inability; a lack of energy, lack of confidence, lack of belief in your own talent. These associative memories will be there however long your experiences of the world stays the same. And this is where Papa & Yo comes in. The game takes us through an imaginary world - where we are the co-creators and reformers. We are accompanied by our lovely companion ""Lula"" and eventually we meet the Monster! He seems like a lovable fellow, mostly interested in nuts and sleeping, we provide him with these life-essential things, mostly because he provides us with progression. Things seems to go fine until we stumble across some cute-looking ""frogs"". This is where our Monster scurries into a frenzy, he no longer cares about our needs of progression, he just wants to get a hold of this frog and devour it. We are left behind, until we see him coming back, but now the sky is red and our Monster is on fire: charging right at us. What does this mean? We don't have long to think before he grabs hold of us and throw us to the ground with a thump. Huh. This monster is not a friendly one after all, then why are we with him? We run around for a bit and see this blue/purple fruit, described as rotten. Our first instinct is to throw it at him, we do, he calms down. He is back to his pinkish, amicable and lovable form. In this form he only sleeps and eat, he doesn't hurt us, we can manage to stick with him for a while longer. Along the journey his fiery temper tantrums become more frequent and more limiting. We need to get rid of him, we need to let go, we need to move on. We need to exempt ourselves from the grips of destruction, to separate ourselves from the person that is this angry, projecting, mean-spirited Monster. Despite him being our means of progression and survival. Despite him being the reason we exist and survive. Papa & Yo tackles the subject of a destructive family very well. It illustrates the need to let go of your parents, in general, perhaps not just the despicable alcoholic abuser. A realization: we are separate human beings from the ones which created us, we are our own persons and have our own quirks and dreams. This game illustrates the need to escape when your family life is in shambles, in imagination or videogames. Escapism until you can finally escape it in reality. Papa & Yo gives people a way to escape and even more, it manifests a scenario a huge amount of people are in and gives them validation, a feeling of acceptance and most of all, advice is given. Good advice, helpful advice. Your family is not you, there is a world outside of this small world, imaginative or not. The world is truly yours. Sometimes you just need to let go, of whatever is holding you back.			"

												Every now and then I find a game that is entirely mediocre in every way, and I have a hard time with my overall recommendation of it. Papo & Yo fits squarely into this category – it’s never bad, but it’s never more than simply okay either. For positives, I can easily say that Papo & Yo is a very pleasing game, visually. You spend the majority of your game time in a favela in Brazil, solving Alice in Wonderland-esque puzzles with floating platforms and clever mechanics which change your landscape in interesting ways. It doesn’t take very long to progress through, and feels mostly tight with controls and camera movements. However, there seems to be just a layer of polish in all aspects that prevents this game from being better than average. The animations are choppy, and some game mechanics, such as jumping puzzles, may not feel as accurate as other platforming games. The story is my main dividing point. Although the narrative is essentially a very dark memoir, everything that you really need to know about the tale is shown to you up front. When the curtains are pulled back for a big reveal, you are basically shown what you’ve known since booting up the game – the monster is your father, and the poisonous frogs that put him into an uncontrollable rage are bottles of alcohol. It almost seemed odd that they decided to spend so much time at the end of the game devoted to showing you this, as that is the outset of the game. To be fair, Papo & Yo has its heart in the right place, it just could have used a little more time to shine up what’s already there. However, this game is entirely skippable. Not recommended, unless you can find it as part of a package deal or it’s on a steep sale.			"

												Finally got around to finishing this game; it is absolutely wonderful. The puzzles are challenging, but even though I got stuck on one of them for a while, they never felt impossible, and once I got a hang of the mechanics (which was my problem), I really enjoyed trying to solve the puzzles.But the biggest thing this game has going for it is the story; the game tackles some heavy themes, and the story it tells is very personal to the Creative Director, Vander Caballero, and that really comes across very strong. It does a very excellent job of exploring complicated inter-personal relationships.And while I had no problem picking up on the metaphors for addiction, abuse, and the other themes, the game still explains itself at the end, and I really really loved that.It gets emotional; I ended up crying. The only downside to it is that I don't see a lot of replayability, since the game is so very story driven.But all in all, a wonderful game that is both beautiful, personal, and fun and engaging to play.

												Papo & Yo is a great puzzle-platformer. It's far from perfect - imprecise controls and some bugs regarding animations and clipping hamper the experience a little but not to a severe degree. This is a beautiful story, tackling subject matter that is important but very rarely dealt with, especially in video games. The art is colourful and unique. The soundtrack is good. The puzzles are maybe a bit easy but I think the difficulty in playing this comes from the topics at hand rather than progressing through the levels. You're meant to feel good about completing stuff because the story itself is quite dark. Overall, I think Papo & Yo is a great game that does a lot of things right as a puzzle-platformer, and that's impressive because it tells a unique, emotive and personal story while doing so.8/10			"

A very great game.  Has very relaxing music and great graphics.  The achievements are fairly easy if you complete the game.  The story is pretty good, especially near the end.  Only problem at all is that $15 is quite a bit for 5 hours of gameplay, so I would advise that you find it on sale or get it in a bundle like I did. "

												Sad, haunting and also uplifting. Papo & Yo deals with a lot of serious themes, yet deals with them in such creative and imaginative ways. It's story is heavy with metaphors, yet maintains it's vision and morals admirably. And while it may lack innovative or polished design. It's the kind of game that grabs you while you play and sticks with you long after it's done. It's not a happy or even fun game by any stretch. But it's a powerful game that delivers worthwhile messages about addiction, life and learning to grow up.			"

												One more game to demonstrate that telling stories without hurting interactivity (generally done using lenghty cinematics) is entirely possible, if not much more powerful.Here the non-litteral story is distilled progressively through various clues: short dreams allusion, characters relationship and interactions and a few metaphors. It just works.As for the actual gameplay, this is a kind of ICO-like gameplay, using different mechamisms (with the usual switches, levers and the like...)The nicest thing about almost all puzzles is the ability to manipulate the scenery, which is almost a living thing.This game is short (3~4 hours, more if you want to collect stuff), which is not a problem afaic, because why should story-focused games *need* 40 hours to tell a simple story ? Ihmo this game is no shorter nor longer that it should be, but, most importantly, the story ends in a logical but not quite expected way you will not easily forget.			"

												An absolute surprise. The level designs are imaginative and breath taking (if you have ever seen the movie Inception you would enjoy this game).  The controls are spot on.  The intention and story of the game are moving and inspiring. This is an adventure/puzzle based game that should be experienced.It's a shame that Minority Media (the developer of the game) have not made any other games (the first thing I did after finishing the game was to search for other games from this developer).

												A charming little indie game with nice presentation and art direction. The music is lovely and fits the scene perfectly. The graphics are technically average, but still look great. This game is fairly short, but about the right length for a game of this type.Most of the gameplay is simple puzzle platforming, but the style and atmosphere stops it from getting boring. The puzzles are well designed but fairly casual, so don't expect a challenge. This game would be suitable for young children, although they may not understand the adult message (which is fine).After enjoying “Brothers – A tale of two sons” (an amazing indie game), I searched for some more indie games that I hoped would be similar, and found this. While Papo & Yo is not quite as good as Brothers, it is still decent and I recommend it.			"

												Papo & Yo is an emotional experience about a young boys escape from the reality of his abusive drunk father via the power of imagination, told in the characters actions with the surrounding environment and Monster, the allegoral representation of his father. The story is not told with text, nor with spoken audio. It unfolds differently for each player, as you must imagine what you will as the visuals and character interactions further the narration of the story. While Papo & Yo is short in length, it delivers in excellence a touching, beautiful, and heartrending experience. Visuals are top knotch, audio is clear, and mechanics are stable and concise. While not a AAA experience, Papo & Yo far exceeds expectations both in format and design, and is an incredibly underrated title. This tear inducing social commentary in artistic form is a must have, and is well worth it's current asking price.			"

It's short, visually beautiful and depresingly immersive.

												First off, this friggin game should come with a trigger warning for abuse victims before the later levels. And personally I wouldn't let a 10 yo anywhere near it, cute though the beginning might be. I know we've all already murdered a million people in games, but games like this come around and manage to use a simple as anything game mechanic to give you goosebumbs, to put it mildly. (Yes, I'm talking about the darn lifeless ""dolls"" - 'nough said.)It's not about the puzzles. Don't come to this game for the sense of accomplishment a difficult puzzle platformer gives you. There is no place for competitiveness here, it's storytelling by playing. It's not a walking simulator either though (and I am using the term as a descriptor, not as a curseword). The gameplay is simple without being simplistic, and the puzzles are well, one could say they're easy, but I felt they were appropriate. Basically the puzzles play like the platforming elements do: They flow comfortably, at a natural pace, an average player won't have to stop anywhere long. The atmosphere and the visuals are fantastic, the music and the voice acting are beautifully done. Everything, including the rythym of the gameplay, just flows well and all elements work together to tell a simple story, albeit one we don't often hear in games in this manner.And btw, it's so insanely refreshing to see minority and lower class protagonists, languages and aesthetics so uncomrpomisingly portrayed in a game.It's not flawless, but its flaws are totally secondary and besides the point. It deserves every penny we can throw its way, because these developers should be encouraged to try again and do more. So yes, buy it. As for whether you will enjoy it, well, if you aren't coming to it with an all macho ""harcore"" attitude, then yes, you will get something out of it. I don't know if you'll love it, and personally I wouldn't play it again, but it's definitely a game worth meeting and a little journey worth taking.			"

												Papo & Yo is a puzzle adventure game where you play as a Brazilian boy named Quico, who is hiding from his alcoholic father in the beginning of the game. While hiding in his closet during one of his father's drunken rages, clutching his favorite toy, a robot doll named Lula, Quico discovers a strange chalk mark on the wall, and touching it, finds himself taken to a dream-like world.The dream world is incredibly whimsical and fascinating, and it turns its Brazilian environments into a dream where Quico can manipulate objects, enter portals, and use special panels. With special panels on objects, he can push, pull, and move objects with ease, moving houses in place and pulling staircases out of houses. Lula also becomes animated and helps guide Quico through the world.Quico eventually meets a young girl named Alejandra, who doesn't understand him or his intentions, and attempts to slow him with puzzles.Quico eventually comes across a creature known as Monster, a massively strong beast with razor-sharp teeth. Quico sees it as his friend, although the creature is powerful and has strength unknown to him.Throughout the game, Quico sometimes has flashbacks of things that have happened, and bad memories of his father. These can be very haunting and sad, but are quite the wake-up call to what addictions can do, and the damage that an addicted parent can do to one's child.Papo & Yo is an incredible game so far. The game is very whimsical and detailed, and the gameplay so far is quite fun, although certain puzzles can be a bit difficult. Its visuals and graphics are very nice as well, and breathtaking to see. Its exciting and beautiful soundtrack suit the game very well, and I really like how they often kept the theme true to traditional Brazilian music. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys puzzle games and anyone who enjoys whimsical game worlds. ^.^			"

												Papo & Yo is a puzzle platformer that's light on the puzzles but heavy on the virtual button/lever pushing/pulling. The story is impressive for a puzzle game, though. No shallow stories here, this one actually has depth, giving the player indications on what might have happened in the past, leading to the events in this game.The graphics are acceptable. They're nothing special but not terrible either. At least they're colorful, and fit the environments you'll come across. The music and voice acting (gibberish ?) are done very well, by the way.Papo & Yo is a short game which you'll complete it in 3 hours. After that you can play the game again collecting hats, but to be honest that's not really incentive enough to play it again. Unless you're a fanatic of course.An ok game that's currently too pricey for what you get. The perfect price point for this game would be €7-8 or less. Your choice.[Rating: 76/100]			"

												I don't know if what really catch me was the plot, the lush visuals - street art referenced -  that reminds me my own childhood here on Rio de Janeiro, the cool and well placed soundtrack, or the way they manage to bring to us the story in a so engaging manner. But the game have so many good things, that doesn't matter what catch me first.The mechanics and puzzles are very simple, you will not get stuck, frustrated by angry and wanting to quit the game or looking for some walkthrough. You will be challenged just a few times, and just for a few minutes each time, bounded to the feeling of keep on doing it to know a little more about that story.It's a metaphoric world created by the suffer and desires of a boy, that leads you to join him on his quest to help a friend.

												It usually is very rare for a game to invoke such strong emotions in a player. I had an idea about the story behind this game before I played it. While going through the game and solving the various puzzles, there was always an element of emotion present. Whether it was happiness, trust, sadness, terror, or needing and desperately hoping to be able to trust. The graphics and gameplay were superb. Being to control the environment in ways I have never seen before was fascinating. The music blended perfectly. I won't give anything away, but the ending was emotional and tied so many elements of the game together and pieced the puzzle. Playing it a second time will make you see the game in a different light. In short, beautiful and powerful game. Play it.  "

												Papo & Yo is a beautiful adventure about a boy and his monster... but you already did notice that, right?I'd like to recap this game while trying not to spoil anything for you, since the story is one of the strong points here.+ Beautiful environments, characters and art style in general.+ Deep and emotional story.+ Fun to play in general.+ The soundtrack is well orchestrated and is placed perfectly when needed.- The puzzles get a little bit tedious after a while.- The controls aren't as responsive as they should in some cases (most notably in jumps or camera twists).- It has almost no replay value, since its second run would be playing the exact same game but collecting some hidden plushies in some places.As an overall review I'd say that it isn't a good game per se, the controls feel a little bit clunky and the puzzles could have been way better implemented. However, it is a really good story and the way it's told helps to compensate for its technical flaws.Overall, I'd say that as a puzzle game this barely reaches a 5/10 but as an overall experience I believe it could easily reach a 8/10.

												You know the game is good when the ending can be interpreted in so many ways, while at the same time not losing any of the emotional impact. This is one rare gem in the massive library of games we have today, a true example of how one serious theme can be presented. You don't have to have a hard life as the lead character Quico has to find a little bit of yourself in this game and to learn, in my interpretation, that forgiving and letting go is an essential part of moving forward.

												I dont think its fair to even call this a game. The level design is very linear, making it almost impossible to get lost or off track. There isnt much point to exploring during your first play through (second play through you can find hats), but what there is to see is very surreal. Its more of an interactive story then a video game, and a beautifully told one at that. I wish there were more stories like this to experience. 9/10 WELL DONE.			"

												(If you have read the review of this game by Mitch Dyer on IGN, please ignore that review. It is a horrible review and should not be taken seriously.)Papo & Yo is a 3-D puzzle platformer by Minority Media taht was first released for the PS3, but then brought to the PC. At first, you might not understand the story, but you will understand it once you get towards the end. The story is actually quite depressing and makes you sympathize for the main character. The game is only about 3-4 hours long, but it is an amazing and well made game. I feel the length of the story is perfect for a game like this.The game is pretty basic since it is a puzzle platformer, but there are other aspects added to the game at some points. Some of these include trying to get a monster following you from one area to the other, or even jumping on his belly to get to a higher platform. The puzzles in the game are mostly easy, though there were a couple that I had to look up, personally. I felt the music used in the game was quite good and very fitting for the game. The graphics are pretty good and can be compared to some triple a games, in my opinion.I didn't find many issues with the game, except for occasional bad frames and it would sometimes freeze for a couple seconds, though this could have been my PC. It mainly happened to me when I walked near where a cutscene would start, or occasionally when I hit a checkpoint. I must say that this is now one of my favorite indie titles, and I hope to see more games from Minority Media. If I had to give this game a rating, I'd give it a 9/10.			"

												Excelent. It's not terribly hard, so if you are looking for a big chalenge and you aren't looking for a long, deep experiance game, move on. However, if you want to experiance a story game, and are fine with a gentle curve of fairly softball puzzles, then dive in. It's worth a trip. It won't take long, but I think it's just the right length for what it is.			"

I mean, my cold black heart felt nothing but you might.Okay, I might have had a 'minor' case of the feels... Don't judge me!

												Papo & Yo is a beautiful adventure about a boy and his monster... but you already did notice that, right?I'd like to recap this game while trying not to spoil anything for you, since the story is one of the strong points here.+ Beautiful environments, characters and art style in general.+ Deep and emotional story.+ Fun to play in general.+ The soundtrack is well orchestrated and is placed perfectly when needed.- The puzzles get a little bit tedious after a while.- The controls aren't as responsive as they should in some cases (most notably in jumps or camera twists).- It has almost no replay value, since its second run would be playing the exact same game but collecting some hidden plushies in some places.As an overall review I'd say that it isn't a good game per se, the controls feel a little bit clunky and the puzzles could have been way better implemented. However, it is a really good story and the way it's told helps to compensate for its technical flaws.Overall, I'd say that as a puzzle game this barely reaches a 5/10 but as an overall experience I believe it could easily reach a 8/10.

												The gaming industry is at its best when a developer manages to turn a personal story into an enjoyable game. Papo&Yo is a wonderful experience: the gameplay is fun and gimmicky, turning the landscape and urban architecture into puzzles, thanks to all sorts of imaginary devices, the kind a child (or a talented graffiti artist :) ) might draw on walls. Many times I just surprised and delighted by what my next click did, never bored and always looking forward to the next area to solve.The game looks and sounds just right enough to draw you into the world and the story it wants to tell. Just stand still in the sun, look around at the colorful houses of the South American slums and listen to the silence. And the crickets :) Just beautiful.Everything feels organic, in its right place and I don't want to tell you anything more specific, for fear it will spoil your own experience. I'm just sorry I didn't pick this up sooner, it's been sitting in my Library for months.Do yourself a favour and put a smile on your face with this gem.			"

												Papo & Yo is a 3D puzzle platformer adventure, in which you are a boy running after a girl, avoiding a monster while using it to solve puzzles, and playing with your robot toy. You use platforming to reach various stuff in the environment to change the the world around you to progress. Well, on one plane. On another plane, and this is made clear right before the game proper starts, this is a game about overcoming a drunk abusive father. Papo & Yo's story isn't the best, but it has a reasonably well put together theme and a very strong subject matter. There were a few story elements that felt somewhat jarring, taking you out of the immersion. For example, the tone of the girl changes dramatically and unexpectedly at times.It's puzzles are on the easy side, all difficulty in this game comes from either finding the things you are to interact with or with your 3D platforming skills, sometimes together with a timed element in the  puzzle. Some times, it's hard to judge the distance to items and when using the robot overshoot. The platforming control does feel well implemented and I did not encounter any situations where I had managed to block progress by going somewhere I was not supposed to and with no recovery options.Graphically, it's a nice looking game with a very consistent style to it. Textures and effects aren't the very best, but on the other hand, that's not really to be expected from a game like this. It does some world building through the environment, but over all, it is a very linear world that does not present mane chances for exploration outside of your immediate puzzle surroundings.Game world isn't the largest, and the game doesn't take more than maybe 4-6 hours to complete if played with no prior knowledge, but for what it provides for the price, it is a solid and well designed game.

												Papo & Yo is a Puzzle Adventure game in which you play as a boys imagination. As you play the game you will slowly start to understand the boys imagination intill the end in which everything is explained in the end you you will then learn and understand the game you had just played.+ The game runs great on PC, there is no lag and is always smooth with max settings. There was not one point in the hole game in which I was getting lower than 100 FPS which means almost all computer will be able to run Papo & Yo without a problem.+ The games looks are good, the textures are okay but the lighting is amazing! I wish more games had lighting like this becasue the game looks alot better and you become more immersed in the game. The character models looks good aswell.+ The story is very vivid at first but as you start to play though you will slowly get a understanding of the game. It adds a mystery to the story and you will want to find out whats happaning. You will quickly realise that you are in a childs imagination so the world changes and is not normal (almost like a dream) and uses puzzles to improve that.+ Controls for Papo & Yo are very simple, they are like every other game which is a good thing since you dont even have to learn them. You can just play straght away without thinking about it.+ The creativity in this game is huge! There are lots of diffrent and weird things happening in Papo & Yo which is great since its something diffrent from most games today. Its unique game which feels alot diffrent from anything else.+ The soundtrack works well and adds depth the the game which is needed, its not used to much but its used in the right places that make it sound and feel alot better.Now I do like Papo & Yo but there are alot of things which I just didnt like and disagree on which is a shame. This is what I find annoying about Papo & Yo.- The puzzles are good at first but after a bit of time they become the same thing over and over, this makes them a bit pointless and since there are so easy most of the time I some times which they just wernt there. At first they are good and you want to play but once you know what your doing its pointless.- The length of Papo & Yo is tiny! Its about 3 to 4 hours long, 5 hours to get all the Achievements thats it... A short and isnt necessary bad but since the game is priced at £10.99 it makes it was too expensive. You should wait for a sale if you wanted to buy the game.- There is next to no replayability once you have finished. The only thing that you can do is get the Achievements or just play again. Nothing else and since its only a 3 to 4 hour game this means that you feel like you want more. I would recommend getting the Achievements if you want to get your moneys worth out of it.- The story... I know people arnt going to like me becasur of this but I didnt like it personally since I have no experience or relation to the games ending. For me its was a bit bland but I did understand it and for the people who have experienced and know what its like, then I bet you will love this game. But it seems that for me it was an okay ending. Overall I think that Papo & Yo is a good game for a few hours and a nice easy playthough with is some ways relaxes you when you play. Becasue its so unique in its own ways and how diffrent it isto any other game I will rate Papo & Yo 6 out of 10. I would recommend this game to some people who would be able to understand the ending but to someone who wont when I would not recmmend it to them. But Papo & Yo is still a good/fun game.			"

												  This past couple oyf years has seen the release of a bunch of games dealing with a lot of real life issues, like alcoholism, physical abuse, death of a loved one etc... This is one of those, is a not very difficult puzzle game, with some platforming, and in this regard if you find yourself stuck most probably is because you are overthinking it, is a nice looking game, not astonishing but it looks good, the soundtraack is pretty good in my opinion, is short as most of this games are but it´s worth its price.  the game has certain issues with the camera in some parts , specially when the monster chases you and in that regard i wouldn´t have mind and FOV slider (the deffault is 90 wich is good enough but i  like something like 105 usually)  the core of the history goes around and alcoholic and abusive father and how the protagonist deals with it, to be honest it lacks the punch of something like brothers but is a moving one nonetheless. Overall a good way to spend three to four hours, it has a checkpoint save system but it doesn´t take much time to get to the next one and you can play it in one sitting or chapter to chapter.  So if you are into this kind of experiences is a game you should check out			"

												I'm an hour into the game so far. I quite like it. The music is great, the art design is wonderful, whimsical and fun. Has a mysterious sort of feel that is at the same time, fun and haunting. I found my first play feeling a bit of trepidation.  The opening has the creator thank those around him while growing up for helping him live through his childhood.  It's fantastic what this game is doing. It is enabling someone to share an important narrative that is often unheard. Not only through story, spoken or written words but in gameplay. Gameplay serves to communicate the feeling of fear, excitement, paranoia and hope. This is an accurate portrayal of one persons difficult childood, dealing with abuse and loss. This game rings true and accurate with my own as well. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is curious what it might be like to be scared when a parent gets home. I recommend this game to people who enjoy puzzles and platformers that may be a bit on the simple side but serve to communicate something greater. I recommend this game to people who want more heart and sincerity in their game and less brown, gray and repetitive shooting. I recommend this game to people who want to feel emotions while they play a game.			"

												This game is a real treasure.  Obvious comparissons to Brothers: A tale of 2 sons are appropriate.  Both are puzzle, platformers set in imaginative worlds with fantastic music.  Brothers though I had a few problems with that this game doesn't.  This game does not force you to use a controller and while the single player coop was unique, this game opts for creative puzzles not ones that require adept controller work.  Also the camera here is pretty much free and the levels are less linear though the game is still quite linear.  Also the length is about 4 hours which is about the same i believe in both cases.  Also the levels in this game, as is the story is very imaginative and where brothers had some unique set pieces and puzzles, this game blows it away in imaginitive and non, done before fantasy setting, etc.  The story to me also excels.  I will say that i like morals, meaning in storys.  Brothers seemed to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off to no end in what the struggle and sacrifice of the story is all about.  In this game your father is the main driver though in a different way of saving him.  In the end sacrifices, etc are about your character and his progression, not the forced emotional &jY&$3# that was brothers.   So yes i keep bringing up brothers, and this is because the games are more alike each other than any other games i've played.  I would recommend this for a fan of that game or any player who likes a moving story, imagination, and non bang-your-head puzzles.   The way the puzzles work in this game are some of my favourite ever in my decades of gaming.  Hell even the hints are in game and require you picking up a box, placing it over your head and turning the 4 sides to see 4 panels of hints.Get this game-- the 4 hours of your life will thank you!

The world and puzzles are whimsical in a way similar to the ""magical thinking"" of a child. The music is unique (South American wind instruments!) and perfectly captures the mood of the story.

												I just finished my first playthrough of this game and I'm so moved that I barely have words to describe it. The story brought me to tears. The world and puzzles are whimsical in a way similar to the ""magical thinking"" of a child. The music is unique (South American wind instruments!) and perfectly captures the mood of the story. This game challenged my existing notions of storytelling through gameplay, with an emotional depth and complexity I've really never seen before in a game. Not only just a great game, but a fantastic human story. Just a whole other level of amazing.			"

												This is a decent puzzle platformer with solid mechanics, minimal glitches (as in, if you encounter a bug it was because you were deliberately looking to break the game), a decent story hampered by its main twist being blatantly obvious, and a fairly decent play time.However, the best feature by far is the hats. Once you beat the game, you can play the game again in order to collect various hats scattered around the levels; collecting them all rewards an achievement. However, the collection itself quickly becomes your main goal, as while the first hat is fairly normal, the second hat is a soccer ball and it just gets crazier from there. You'll find yourself eagerly anticipating what Quico will next decide to place on his head.tl;dr disregard first playthrough, acquire hats			"

												An adventure/puzzle-platformer that's light on challenge but heavy on quality story-telling. Excellent presentation and beautiful Latin American-themed artwork/music make Papo & Yo both a visual and audible pleasure. While the puzzles aren't anything that'll test your mind, it's less about figuring out how to solve them and more about watching and admiring the solutions as they unfold. The way you can manipulate the world with the push or pull of a lever is a neat sight to behold and has a ""child-like imagination"" feel to it. There are a few technical issues present (noticeable framerate drops here and there), but nothing significant.Overall, an impressive game that does a great job of using metaphors and symbolism to tell a powerful story full of dark subject matter in an accessible manner. Short, but still well worth playing.			"

												An emotional, metaphoric platformer with gorgeous graphics, Papo and Yo explores subjects like alcoholism and domestic abuse through chalk line magic, voodoo houses, a living toy/jetpack and one seriously addicted monster.   Not to take a back seat to aesthetic and theme, the action itself is very satisfying.  Papo and Yo is brief, but it is so dense with symbolism and striking scenes that it seems much longer.  I guarantee that you've not played a game quite like it!			"

												Papo & Yo is a nice game with some shortcomings.The gameworld is beautiful, it feels like exploring a wonderfully imaginative daydream full of magical portals and walking houses.The fantastic soundtrack adds a lot to that atmosphere.The game is a bit disappointing when it comes to actual gameplay, though: It has platformer and puzzler elements but fails to really convince in either field.The platformer parts of very straightforward jumping over rarely more than three blocks, for most puzzles it's simply enough to press all buttons and levers available. Both game elements are so easy, there's hardly any challenge in the game. Additionally the jumping is very boring. Quico, the game's protagonist, doesn't jump very high and the double-jump ability he gets during the game makes him only jump slightly farther, not higher. In my opinion the game designers wasted a lot of potential: Making the gameworld more open and giving Quico tthe ability to jump on top of most buildings to explore the surreal city and adding some collectibles to find would have allowed to really take advantage of the amazing setting.Papo & Yo is rather short, according to Steam it took me about 3 hours to finish and I didn't rush through it. There are collectibles to find but out of a strange design choice they are only collectable after finishing the game at least once. I could definately see myself replaying some levels in order to get collectibles I missed but not the whole game (however short it is), especially as I already found a lot of the places where those collectibles appear the first time but couldn't pick them up then.All in all Papo & Yo is probably more a piece of art than a game. If you can enjoy a game for its beautiful scenery and music alone than I highly recommend to get this (but maybe wait for a sale).			"

												This game is quite beautiful and also heartbreaking. The game actually makes the player feel the frustration and hopelessness of dealing with an alcoholic family member, while still loving them and wanting to be with them. During the first playthrough I was worried that the game would suggest to young kids that they were responsible or capable of changing their alcoholic parents, but the ending convinced me otherwise. Well done.			"

												The colors and magic of the world of children, tainted by the darkness and harsh reality of the adults. I will not dwell on what happens in the game, as some might consider that to be spoiler territory.On the gameplay side, this is a puzzle game where reality bends and changes at will, leading to a sense of magic and surreality that is extremely pleasing. For thoses who don't like to think too much about puzzles, there are always hints to guide you, if you ever need them. They are optional, so you're never forced to read a hint if you don't want to. On the whole the puzzles are a bit like Portal : you stop for a while trying to figure it out, and then you have an ha-ha moment and manage to move forward. So not complicated, but give you just enough pause to make it satisfying to solve it.I really enjoyed the game, but got slightly frustrated toward the end. The game almost overstays its welcome. The goalpost keeps moving forward, you often think ""this is it, i'm gonna see the ending"", but there is actually one more puzzle to solve, and then another one, etc...Still on the whole the game is short enough for its own sake, and it's really worth to go through all of it to see the well crafted ending, and understand exactly what the game was all about.

												Papa & Yo is an amazing indiegame. It's colourful, creative, original and cute, and at the same time it's sad as hell. A true indie game. It's a bit short though and it seems a little expensive to buy it for 13 euros on steam... You can wait for it to get on sale if you want - but you have to play it sooner or later! There are a few bugs and glitches, but nothing major. It doesn't ruin the whole experience - and this game is definetly an experience!

												An interesting but very simple platformer with a not so easy story to deal with.  The puzzles are super easy but I actually didn't mind that for a change.I recommend the game for a number of reasons:1) The developer to have the balls to make a game out what would of been a nightmare to live through.2) Graphically nice and interesting terrain transforming.3) The music  is awesome and just sits beautifully in the background.However, I do have to say that I do not agree with the ending in the slightest.  Surely in this day and age people still don't think that... Having said that though, I have also been fortuante enough not to have lived through something like that, so.........Make up your own minds.			"

												Papo & Yo is a short (but very intense) puzzle adventure that turns around the struggle of a boy named Chico, as he explores an imaginary world (to eventually find a cure for the ""monster"", which clearly represents his father). This game develops a story about a theme that's obviously not the most feasible one, but it does so in a way that almost shock you (in a positive way).The gameplay could be described as a first person puzzle but there's so much more to it, in terms of colours (this game has some of the best colour palettes i've seen in a videogame), sound and interaction with the environment, within most of the levels your role will be to literally shape the space around you in a way that will let you solve the puzzles and move ahead. In some ways this feels as a ""metagame"", in a sense that it challenges you to go after preconceptions, no matter whether they're related to space or to what the space stands for. I would *strongly* encourage everyone to play this game. There isn't possibly not much of a age limit or any interest span that should stop you from playing.			"

												A surprising theme, tactfully done weaves through Papo & Yo. The game, while simple in its control and play, was intriguing enough that I played through the game in a sitting. While some gamers may not appreciate this game for what it is, Would have a lot more to say, but the story and the experience make this game, and I do not know that I could do it justice without spoiling it. I highly suggest at least one playthrough. So long as you can go more than 30 minutes without killing an alien/terrorist/animal/robot, you will find a unique experience.Storyline: 7/10 - the underlying story kept me intriguedMusic: 7/10 - the music added to the experience, and I enjoyed it, Walking away from the game I can't say that I remember much of the music, though.Sound Effects: 8/8 - simple, non-obtrusive, but felt organic to a surreal scenario- especially the 'dialogue' sound effects.Graphics: 8/7 - A fairly charming visual experience. Was not hard on the eyes. :POverall, I give Papo & Yo an appreciative 7.5/ 10.			"

												This is right up there with Psychonauts for best game ever. It's a puzzle/platformer with emphasis on the platforming elements.The puzzles are usually quite easy to figure out on your own, but sometimes quite difficult to enact. For instance, there's a level where you have to catch three frogs and destroy them before Monster catches you, and if you fail you start over from the beginning. It's the closest to dying you come in this game, but it's still quite frustrating.I expected the story to be heart-rendingly moving, and I was still caught off-guard by it. It's that powerful.One of my favorite things about this game is the setting. It looks like a favela if you look at it out of the corner of your eye, but if you explore and pay attention, you sink deep into the art and mood. It's one of the most fantastic and magical places that I've ever been in a game world. And just to emphasize this, you must revisit each level (except two of them) twice or sometimes three times, each time to do something different, and requiring a different perspective, which truly gives the city a sense of extent and volume. It's also so amazing the way nature and more magical eliminates insinuate themselves into the city, as if the city itself is invading something far older.The mechanics of this game are also unique in a very well-thought-out way. For instance, most of the puzzles require you to rearrange the world itself, moving, stacking, and tipping the little shacks, and at one point, tipping the whole village on its side. This is the first game I've seen where you get the ability to make ""long jumps"" from another character (a rocket-propelled robot action figure named Lula) which can be detached from your character at will. Which means the game can take away your ability to jump far at any time, just to make the gameplay more interesting.While I will say that this world drew me in so far, I didn't want to leave, and so felt a bit of withdrawal when the story ended after four hours, I can't help but note that the story arc is so smooth and coherent, it could not have been longer than it was. It ended exactly where and when it had to end. Given how little gaming time I have these days, it's probably best that it didn't take longer than it did.Pros:- Heart-rending story lovingly told- Beautiful sets and models- Clever game mechanics- Just the right amount of frustrationCons:- The feeling of sadness slowly sinking into your soul the moment you beat the game and realize you must go back to real life nowOut of five, I'd give this game at least a seven.

												An interesting Indie platformer/adventure game with only a few minor things that set it back. I have to say it does remind me a lot of what Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons does in terms of story, conveying most of it through the gameplay and what you see rather than dialog, but this game does have dialog occasionally so its a little more clear sometimes what is going on. Even then though this game isn't what it seems like at first, without ruining it you will find out what the real theme is about and the metaphor for the monster as you go through.You play as a kid, Quinco who comes across at one point a big monster, who has an unhealthy appitite for poison arrow frogs and a very bad temper; he eventually becomes your companion on the story as well as your little robot protector Lula. You are following a strange girl who claims you are ""cursed"" and are on a journey to find out what is going on, and where you really are. Through out you need to platform and solve puzzles to progress through the areas of the game, many revolving around the monster himself. There are no real boss fights to speak of in the game.The game has some pretty good looking visuals, nothing that is going to push your machine to its limits but its very nice and the world itself very interesting and somewhat surreal at times. The game also has some fantastic music in it to go along with the visuals and perfectly fits the tone of the game and what is going on.The game controls fantastically with a controller and KB+M, however despite the game implying you to use a controller, I personally at least found it to play better and be more enjoyable with keyboard and mouse, so the port gets that right. In terms of perfromace there really isn't much to complain about, there are certain times where the frame rate will drop but quickly goes back.The issues with the game unfortunatly come from the design itself: while it is part puzzle game, the puzzles themselves aren't very challenging and are very itterative and repetitve, on top of that the game is short, very very short. Four hours is the most you can expect out of it, that's on first playthrough, but given how linear it is on subsequent playthroughs and knowing what to do, you could get through it in under three potentially. There is little incentive to replay the game too, outside of 25 hats hidden around the game to find, of which unlocks upon beating the game the first time. Besides that there are no other kind of collectibles or distractions, the puzzles, gameplay and story are the only attraction here.The story attempts to be emotional and moving, which it does pull off many times, but at the same time once you learn certain things it kind of falls apart and become predictable and that hold it has wears off, doesn't ruin the game though by any means.Overall, its a short, very easy, but enjoyable adventure through an interesting world and is charming at the same time. Its definatly worth playing through at least once, maybe twice if you are interested in collecting all the hats and achivements, but I cannot say I would recommend it at full price, but consider that part at your own discretion. All that said I did enjoy this game and I do recommend checking it out. None of the minor issues I mentioned are enough I think to deter from this nice puzzle/platformer.			"

												This game is very heartfelt. I love the way it addresses such a serious issue from a child's perspective. Whilst this game isn't always happy and cheerful it is such a wonderful game to play. The puzzles whilst tricky are not overly complicated and there are always help boxes for you.This game has little additions to it like finding all the hats and some of the hat designs just make you laugh when he puts them on. I have a let's play of this game if anyone is interested in the play style. I highly recommend playing it!

												Big thanks to creator of this game, it is one awesome experience. It's worth buying this game for the story alone and replay it one more time, just to sit in. As gameplay goes it's platforming puzzle game. Puzzles are quite easy and not frustrating at all, it would be shame to ruin story with  frustrating gameplay anyways. You also get great and fitting soundtrack to follow you thru it. As far as im concerned it's a must play for any gamer, you can get it for really low price on sales so it's a no-brainer :). Highly recommended.			"

												This game... No words to explain.The gorgeous artwork and beautiful soundtrack tells the story of a boy, and his monster. And their adventure through a world of an enormous, shiftable world. And as you advance into the game, you slowly realize something devistating is happening with Monster. The storyline is what gets me. I'm not telling you a single thing about the storyline. You must play it for yourself.My rating for this is 10/10. I would most definitely play again.			"

												Super organic use-switches-to-move-blocks puzzler (this is a serious over-simplification) that is a metaphor for a man's story of how he dealt with a troubled childhood. The clue is in the dedication right at the start of the game. I don't want to explain too much about what is actually going on with this game because it takes the form of a ""reveal"" story that you see more of as it progresses. I can only say that the game mechanics and asthetics are very original and unique and that you feel a sense of wonder from the start. I would recommend it purely on merit of its originality but aside from that it's actually fun to play and thoroughly absorbing. If you are on the fence about getting it I would suggest a very quick look at a let's play or just someone who is playing it to see how interesting the mechanics are but, of course, it would be better if you don't resort to this and just jump in and experience it firsthand.*edit* in fact you can see some of how it works on its store page videos - which I luckilly didn't look at until after I played the game.

												Papo & Yo is a short (but very intense) puzzle adventure that turns around the struggle of a boy named Chico, as he explores an imaginary world (to eventually find a cure for the ""monster"", which clearly represents his father). This game develops a story about a theme that's obviously not the most feasible one, but it does so in a way that almost shock you (in a positive way).The gameplay could be described as a first person puzzle but there's so much more to it, in terms of colours (this game has some of the best colour palettes i've seen in a videogame), sound and interaction with the environment, within most of the levels your role will be to literally shape the space around you in a way that will let you solve the puzzles and move ahead. In some ways this feels as a ""metagame"", in a sense that it challenges you to go after preconceptions, no matter whether they're related to space or to what the space stands for. I would *strongly* encourage everyone to play this game. There isn't possibly not much of a age limit or any interest span that should stop you from playing.			"

												An adventure/puzzle-platformer that's light on challenge but heavy on quality story-telling. Excellent presentation and beautiful Latin American-themed artwork/music make Papo & Yo both a visual and audible pleasure. While the puzzles aren't anything that'll test your mind, it's less about figuring out how to solve them and more about watching and admiring the solutions as they unfold. The way you can manipulate the world with the push or pull of a lever is a neat sight to behold and has a ""child-like imagination"" feel to it. There are a few technical issues present (noticeable framerate drops here and there), but nothing significant.Overall, an impressive game that does a great job of using metaphors and symbolism to tell a powerful story full of dark subject matter in an accessible manner. Short, but still well worth playing.			"

												This game is quite beautiful and also heartbreaking. The game actually makes the player feel the frustration and hopelessness of dealing with an alcoholic family member, while still loving them and wanting to be with them. During the first playthrough I was worried that the game would suggest to young kids that they were responsible or capable of changing their alcoholic parents, but the ending convinced me otherwise. Well done.			"

												I just finished the game. Right when I first saw the promo video and played it I knew I would love it. The art direction, the choices in design with the characters , the music and the enviroment play an important role on the game. It remind in a way of games done by Tale of Tales such as Graveyard and The Path as well as the know ICO from Project ICO. It one of those games that is most aboutt he experience and the story than the game itself. Even though it doesn't have such obscure view it touches an obscure subject, the monster in Quico's life and as you'll figure in the first hour, the methaphor for the whole situation, it's still a pleasant game to play. Without super complicated puzzles but challenging I'm sure you'll enjoy a lot this game. I sincerely loved it. It moved me a lot. I hope you all buy it! =)			"

												The colors and magic of the world of children, tainted by the darkness and harsh reality of the adults. I will not dwell on what happens in the game, as some might consider that to be spoiler territory.On the gameplay side, this is a puzzle game where reality bends and changes at will, leading to a sense of magic and surreality that is extremely pleasing. For thoses who don't like to think too much about puzzles, there are always hints to guide you, if you ever need them. They are optional, so you're never forced to read a hint if you don't want to. On the whole the puzzles are a bit like Portal : you stop for a while trying to figure it out, and then you have an ha-ha moment and manage to move forward. So not complicated, but give you just enough pause to make it satisfying to solve it.I really enjoyed the game, but got slightly frustrated toward the end. The game almost overstays its welcome. The goalpost keeps moving forward, you often think ""this is it, i'm gonna see the ending"", but there is actually one more puzzle to solve, and then another one, etc...Still on the whole the game is short enough for its own sake, and it's really worth to go through all of it to see the well crafted ending, and understand exactly what the game was all about.

												This game is criminally underrated.It stands side by side with another one of my favorite games Brothers: Tale of Two Sons as a shining example that a game can be fun as well as tell a beautiful story and have as much emotional resonance as any other type of art.The theme of this game is so dark but is approached in such a beautiful way that the ending left me in tears.And the game, though short (although I think the length is just right), has the right amount of difficulty.The art direction was also wonderful.  I loved how the favela was not something you just navigated through but was integral part of the game.I wish more people would play this.More games should be like this.			"

												An interesting Indie platformer/adventure game with only a few minor things that set it back. I have to say it does remind me a lot of what Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons does in terms of story, conveying most of it through the gameplay and what you see rather than dialog, but this game does have dialog occasionally so its a little more clear sometimes what is going on. Even then though this game isn't what it seems like at first, without ruining it you will find out what the real theme is about and the metaphor for the monster as you go through.You play as a kid, Quinco who comes across at one point a big monster, who has an unhealthy appitite for poison arrow frogs and a very bad temper; he eventually becomes your companion on the story as well as your little robot protector Lula. You are following a strange girl who claims you are ""cursed"" and are on a journey to find out what is going on, and where you really are. Through out you need to platform and solve puzzles to progress through the areas of the game, many revolving around the monster himself. There are no real boss fights to speak of in the game.The game has some pretty good looking visuals, nothing that is going to push your machine to its limits but its very nice and the world itself very interesting and somewhat surreal at times. The game also has some fantastic music in it to go along with the visuals and perfectly fits the tone of the game and what is going on.The game controls fantastically with a controller and KB+M, however despite the game implying you to use a controller, I personally at least found it to play better and be more enjoyable with keyboard and mouse, so the port gets that right. In terms of perfromace there really isn't much to complain about, there are certain times where the frame rate will drop but quickly goes back.The issues with the game unfortunatly come from the design itself: while it is part puzzle game, the puzzles themselves aren't very challenging and are very itterative and repetitve, on top of that the game is short, very very short. Four hours is the most you can expect out of it, that's on first playthrough, but given how linear it is on subsequent playthroughs and knowing what to do, you could get through it in under three potentially. There is little incentive to replay the game too, outside of 25 hats hidden around the game to find, of which unlocks upon beating the game the first time. Besides that there are no other kind of collectibles or distractions, the puzzles, gameplay and story are the only attraction here.The story attempts to be emotional and moving, which it does pull off many times, but at the same time once you learn certain things it kind of falls apart and become predictable and that hold it has wears off, doesn't ruin the game though by any means.Overall, its a short, very easy, but enjoyable adventure through an interesting world and is charming at the same time. Its definatly worth playing through at least once, maybe twice if you are interested in collecting all the hats and achivements, but I cannot say I would recommend it at full price, but consider that part at your own discretion. All that said I did enjoy this game and I do recommend checking it out. None of the minor issues I mentioned are enough I think to deter from this nice puzzle/platformer.			"

												I don't normally write reviews for games I play. Once I finished them, I just go onto the next, but this game is not like the rest. I finished this game a couple of days ago and it's still lingering in my head. The story is unlike anything else in the industry. Rarely do games have the brass to tackle social issues such as alcohol abuse. This one does it in spades and leaves you feeling empty and melacholy inside. It's such a simple story with minimal dialogue, yet one of those plots that is told more through actions than words. I can't get into the story too much without spoiling it, all I can say is that this is a beautiful little gem among a vast Steam roster that is easy to sweep under the rug, but no one should ever miss one. Coupled with an equally beautiful and mesmerising soundtrack to go along with the moving and emotionally driven plot, if there is any example proving games can be art, it's Papo & Yo.			"

												A beautiful game in every meaning of the word.Aesthetically Papo & Yo is so beautifully designed and rendered that it almost needs nothing else to recommend it. But then it brings so much more to the experience.This is a game that has me writing - and erasing - and re-considering - and re-writing. This game is simply that powerful.At GDC2015 I spoke about the power of games to engage - and change - minds and Papo & Yo is one of the games that I used as an example. The relatively simple narrative is transformed when combined with the game mechanics into something very powerful: Papo & Yo reveals the ability of games to be something much more.This is not to say that the narrative and associated emotions will necessarily speak to everybody, but if they do then: watch out. Although I've finished the game, I only have around half of the achievements and don't plan on returning to the game. As beautiful and engaging as it is - the emotional impact is something that, although I am glad I experienced it, cannot go through again.(If you ever hear an art / movie / book critic scoff about ""games as art"" ask them to play this game. The interactive nature of digital games offer an emotional experience like no other medium.)			"

												More disclosure from me. I may be the world's worst platform puzzle gamer. I am absolutely terrible at these things. So going into ""Papo y Yo"" I was a little hesitant but the great reviews and the relatively short gameplay time had me thinking ""why not"". ""Papo y Yo"" is the story of a boy named Quico dealing with an abusive alcoholic father. While hiding in the closet he sees a chalk mark on the wall and ends up falling into a dream like world and for the next 3-4 hours you'll be traversing this world in order to find someone or something to help you cure the Monster (AKA your father's demons). I really enjoyed this game. The game world was incredibly cool and the soundtrack was excellent. The gameplay is standard puzzle platforming but other than a couple frustrating moments this wasn't difficult at all, even for a rank amateur like me.  Some might take issue with the game length but I found it perfect. The pacing was excellent and there wasn't a lot of time wasted. The game wasn't perfect. I did come across a bug or two that would screw up a couple of jumps here and there and the gameplay variety was a little lacking (pulls this, push that etc.). Some may also find the game a bit pretentious (the monster = Quico's dad, frogs = alcohol) but it didn't bug me at all and I found ""Papo y Yo"" to definitely be a journey worth taking. 8=10 from me.

												I wish Papo & Yo was the first game I've ever played.There's something about it which envokes a childlike wonder within players - the entire game is reminiscent to an interactive Pixar experience, the feelings we used to have as kids watching Toy Story or Monsters Inc. This lies in the wonderfully magical aesthetic of the game - the colours are vibrant, the music is playful, and the world feels magical, displaying a beautiful level of imagination.At its core, Papo & Yo is a third person puzzle platformer, but I would never dare use this as a description for this game. The puzzles are all very well paced, providing the slightest challenge, which although may be offputting to some, the previously mentioned magic within the world makes up for it. Quico (the main character of the story), the young boy who travels inside his own imagination will be picking up boxes and causing houses to move on little legs. He will make staircases pop out of the side of houses, or rotate a building inside of itself to reveal a new path to further advance in his goal. Each time I found myself with a new interaction in the environment, my eyes lit up with glee as the Pixar effect of discovery, imagination and beauty played off on screen. Quico is accompanied by three other characters; Lula, Monster and Alejandra. Lula is Quico's helpful pet/toy robot. She rides attached on his back, constantly hugging him and allowing Quico to do a double jump thanks to her rocket booster legs. Lula can also be used to flip switches out of Quico's reach. Alejandra is the first character we meet, and the only one we don't really get to interact with. She is a metaphor for Quico's growth throughout his journey, and not much can be said about her without spoilers.Lastly, there's Monster. A giant, fat, bulky, horned creature who either sleeps, eats, or looses himself in rage attacking anything in sight. He brings a majority of the puzzle elements in the game, as Quico has to manouver Monster via the usage of fruit, which Monster loves and will run up to one if he sees one, in order to advance to the next area. Monster also loves to eat frogs, but upon doing so he will enter a state of rage, charging at Quico and attempting to kill him.This brings me into the game's strongest point - the story.The story in Papo & Yo is based on real-life experiences of it's director amd designer Vander Caballero. The Monster is a metaphor for an alcoholic and abusive father, and the world Quico finds himself in is his imaginary escape, picturing his father as Monster. Without spoiling much, you will understand the effect and impact of this metaphor especially towards the last 20/30 minutes of this game.The game is rather short, as displayed on my profile it took me just three hours to beat, but I also haven't had the chance to explore every nook and cranny to find the collectible ""hats"" in game. When considering Papo & Yo, please don't let it's length turn you off the game. It is a beautiful, heart-touching, childlike experience unlike any other I've seen in video games so far. Due to Papo & Yo's easy difficulty, no deaths or death penalty, a story which is well suited for everyone - children will love the aesthetic; the characters; the environments; the puzzles, whereas older audiences will love the metaphor and the meaning behind the game, I simply have to recommend this game to everyone.TL;DR: Beautiful aesthetic, very deep and emotional story, envokes childhood memories and feelings 10/10 recommended for everyone.

												First time I was staring speechless at credits after a game. Before playing this game I assumed it would be a fun game for  kids with crazy moving houses, but I was wrong. Yes, I got moving houses and many more weird level design ideas (which on its own would make a great game), but the story blew my mind. It's not happy at all but bitter and sad. After getting attached to all of the characters, even a robot toy, I was close to tears when anything would happen to one of them. The ending was hard to finish, not because of puzzle complexity, but because of extreme emotional load.The only downside to game is how short it is, but I was not expecting anything longer.I would recommend it to anyone who likes weird level platformers, unusual characters and wants to experience a game that has a deeper meaning.

												This one is interesting.It has nice puzzles and seems very creative. There are many games that go for an ""Art form"" approach but I felt this game didn't quite nail it. Don't get me wrong it is a good game. I feel the story is new and emersive taking key parts of childhood and focusing on how imagination is a beauty. But as far as a story, this is just the cover. Inside i found the controls clunky and a suprisingly annoying checkpoint system. My character seemed a little slow, although this is just a speed preference, and the turning didn't help. At parts it felt like it was aesthetically finished but still like playing a early access game. I remeber one point I got very stuk on a level and used hints to try to figure it out. I had placed a box to get to  a higher platform and it hadn't worked. I watch a walk through and my box should have been two inches to the right and none of this was clearly marked outI know I have been quite mean during this review but on the whole it was still enjoyable.

												I'm guessing a developer grew up in a troubled family and had nightmares as a child. They then took those memories and made a strange game out of it, that is fun when you need a change.			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough. It is a very special puzzle platformer full of childlike wonder that explores the effects of parental abuse. It is a beautiful, healing sort of game with a very emotional ending. It is very personal to me because it actually helped me to heal from my own childhood issues. This is a rare gem in the gaming world that you shouldn't pass up.			"

												Neat Indie game with an interesting back story. I bought it on sale for around 1 dollar, not the 15 that it normally is. Short story; I finished in about 3 hours. Also, the puzzles aren't very difficult at all. If you're going to play it, play it for it's artistic value-not gameplay.			"

												Man, the final chapter...... I've got surprised. There's a deep meaning to every character you see. A story behing on what you are facing in the game.This game is great. It's beaultiful, it's gorgeous, it's brilliant. At first, you think this game is just a simple and bealtiful game, but after the end, you may see a diferent perception of it. The puzzles are great and challenging. You always have a little hint if you need and it's incredibly fun to solve it ( even when you have to control the monster to not eat the freakin frog. God, that was annoying.... but fun ). I've never seen a game like that. It's just bealtiful, but as long as you keep playing, getting closer and closer to the end... the game becames darker and a bit deep. I don't think someone 'simple-minded' could handle the truth.I've got really touched at the credits. The music was just so...... I don't know what to say. It was a nice experience and definetly worth the money. But the end, the credits....... oh god.......			"

												First time I was staring speechless at credits after a game. Before playing this game I assumed it would be a fun game for  kids with crazy moving houses, but I was wrong. Yes, I got moving houses and many more weird level design ideas (which on its own would make a great game), but the story blew my mind. It's not happy at all but bitter and sad. After getting attached to all of the characters, even a robot toy, I was close to tears when anything would happen to one of them. The ending was hard to finish, not because of puzzle complexity, but because of extreme emotional load.The only downside to game is how short it is, but I was not expecting anything longer.I would recommend it to anyone who likes weird level platformers, unusual characters and wants to experience a game that has a deeper meaning.

												.....Wow! What an experience. I wish I knew about this game sooner. The game primarily deals with a boy interacting with a big creature called 'Monster' as well as a guide and a toy robot friend. Although the game has been out for years, I won't spoil the story. I highly appreciate how well crafted it is in the game and how the devs want each person to interpret the story based on their experiences and perception.The music is great and adds to the atmosphere. I will say that I didn't like how there were some bad camera angles. And a couple puzzles were more based on precision and timing rather than just thinking puzzles. And it can set you back to the beginning of the puzzle. And there is a bit of backtracking so make sure you don't mind that.			"

												A magical realism platform/puzzler with a largely symbolic plot that manages not to be heavy-handed.  You explore the city and use magical chalk drawings to manipulate the colorful environment.  Meanwhile, your character gets more and more bedraggled as he interacts with his friend, Monster.  Monster, alternates between a playmate and a villian/obstacle, depending on whether he has indulged his addiction to poisonous frogs.  Good, intuative controls and a sensible camera along with a thoughtful story make this platformer worth your time.			"

												Papo y Yo is a textbook example of ""Games as Art"". In terms of gameplay, you won't get much and it's incredibly short; I beat it in less than 3 hours. However, the concepts/ideas and visuals are nice and there was one or two surprises that I didn't see until right before they happen. The development team is fairly creative and they do succeed in capturing child-like wonder and exposition though atmosphere, though that's their only major successes. The ""big reveal"" is blatantly obvious halfway through the game and it should have balanced more on the characters/backstory than just the message. My biggest complaint is that there is no real payoff to all the buildup; it kinda just sits unresolved and quite frankly, is unsatisfying. While that may have been the intention, the rest of the game isn't satisfying enough to justify leaving it that way. Overall, the game is simply ""pleasant"". Don't go out of your way to get this game, but if it stumbles upon you for cheap, it's worth a single afternoon.			"

This soundtrack has real feeling in it, and adapts as you progress through the level, never did I feel as if the music was intrusive, or annoying, but a perfect compliment to the art and game style.  Papo & Yo has been awarded with over 10 different awards, all well deserved. If you have an afternoon, and want a game that is different than the norm, but very worth its price tag.

												Super organic use-switches-to-move-blocks puzzler (this is a serious over-simplification) that is a metaphor for a man's story of how he dealt with a troubled childhood. The clue is in the dedication right at the start of the game. I don't want to explain too much about what is actually going on with this game because it takes the form of a ""reveal"" story that you see more of as it progresses. I can only say that the game mechanics and asthetics are very original and unique and that you feel a sense of wonder from the start. I would recommend it purely on merit of its originality but aside from that it's actually fun to play and thoroughly absorbing. If you are on the fence about getting it I would suggest a very quick look at a let's play or just someone who is playing it to see how interesting the mechanics are but, of course, it would be better if you don't resort to this and just jump in and experience it firsthand.*edit* in fact you can see some of how it works on its store page videos - which I luckilly didn't look at until after I played the game.

												Can't properly remember the last time i played something that good! Got a little ""upset"" to see this game didn't get much attention, but i'm glad i played - and i did really enjoy it - and i hope some you will play it too. Papo & Yo  is something between reality and dreams, hope and escapes, is a little story about a boy named Quico that suffered from his abusive, alcoholic father, and on this case the father is the ""monster"" that follow us. The father is really gentle, kind person, but when drinks get super violent, but on this case when the monster eats frogs - and by frogs we change for alcohol - will get very angry. About this 'masterpiece', with has a lot of puzzles, not very hard our to easy puzzles, medium puzzles that you can solve in 1/2 min, it also has a very good artistic side, in almost every corner you will see some graffiti with excellent art.  Although the favelas are always empty you can ""sense"" some loneliness but is also here some people are happy. The OST that follows is great, super calm, fits with the theme. Ths plot will suffer some huge twist, some happy twist and some SAD twist, and if you ""connect"" with the characters you will get a little sad - like i did - , but in the end is a explanation to all. With no doubt is a EXCELLENT game, everyone should play it and enjoy the most! Some of you will get some empathy - like me - but the story kind remember some people lives, so make a favor to yourself and play this! ~ 10/10			"

												A beautiful and heart-wrenching game entrenched in metaphor. This game left me shocked, silent and with a lot of thoughts to process. Our story opens with Quico, a young boy living in a Brazillin favela with his abusive alcoholic father. Retreating into his imagination, we follow his adventures through a surreal landscape as he interacts with his friend Monster as his means of coping with the real world. Beautifully written and and powerfully executed, more than once I felt on the brink of being physically ill at many of the implications and how they related to Quico's life.In terms of gameplay, it's a fairly standard puzzle-platformer. As you travel through the favela you'll be pulling levers, hitting buttons, manipulating the landscape in surreal ways, and either coaxing Monster to aid you, or running from him. The puzzles are fairly simple and never frustrating, nor do they ever interfere with the game's atmosphere. In terms of music, the atmosphere is only boosted by a gorgeous soundtrack (which you can purchase along with the game). The game's only downfall is how short it is, as it can be completed in less than a day.This is truly a masterpiece and a work of art. If you're a fan of heavily story-driven games, I highly recommend Papo & Yo.			"

												This game only has simplistic gameplay and puzzles, but even in its simplicity, the small aspects of the game seem to paint brushstrokes on the canvas to completing a masterpiece. The imagery seen through the interactions between Papo & Yo is outstanding! It told a story that I wasn't expecting heading into this one. Halfway through, I finally realized why this game is called Papo & Yo.So TO BUY or NOT TO BUY:If you like shorter, artsy, puzzle games that have meaning behind them, then this game will probably be a good playthrough for you. However, if that's not your kind of game, then you'll probably find yourself bored within a couple of minutes. Overall though, I had a decent experience with this one and enjoyed it.My personal rating: 6.5/10See you on the other side,Godspeed!			"

												Papo and Yo is well worth your time.Very novel, well executed and powerful subject matter. Papo and Yo is the culimination of a son's experiences with his drunken and abusive father.Dark stuff indeed, but Papo and Yo is very careful not to overplay its theme too hard.The game felt to me as if it were borrowing from Miyazaki's Spirited Away at times. A young protagonist trying to cope with circumstances far outside their control. Dark at times, but careful to not to burn you out, feeding you just a small piece of the darker story before dropping you back into lighter fantasy.The game features a lot of thought and consideration for the design of it's puzzles and mechanics. The platform elements are rarely frustrating. And, the game provides many shortcuts as you explore a given level to help you recover from bad jumps.This game is just a great bit of fun and has great payoff of its theme. Please give this one a play.			"

												I feel bad writing this review because the game has goog intentions. It doesn't stop the game from being repetitive, slow yet unreflective, unimpressive visuals and just mundane overall. Nothing here is fun and none of the designs are all that inventive. It's just pulling levers back and forth. This would have been better without the forced game aspect. If you are looking for a thoughtful smart simple game with nice animation and depth, you are better off with journey than this.			"

												Papo & Yo ('Father & I') is a third person puzzle platformer and tells the story of Quico and his friend Monster, who has a prefernce for tasty frogs. Unfortunately, these frogs turn the calm Monster into a violent and dangerous creature, so Quico sets out to find a cure for his friend - but is there any?While this sounds like your average game story, it gains a lot of emotion and intensity once you realize that the story is metaphorical for Creative Director Vander Caballero's troubled childhood. It's relatively subtly tied into the game and if you don't pay enough attention or don't care about it, you could very well miss the message of the game, so don't rush it, step back for a moment and let the impressions work.The game has relatively simple platforming mechanics and you will mostly end up jumping over gaps to progress in the level. Due the general pace of the game, there hardly are any timed events where, for example, you have to press a button and then quickly run somewhere to move on.Relatively early into the game you also find your friend Lula, a toy robot who will latch onto your back and lets you double jump by launching his tiny jet pack. Additionally, you can also command him to flip switches that are out of your reach.While the puzzles present themselves in a unique and creative manner, they aren't really challenging at all and mostly just require simple combination skills. It's a shame because the puzzle design as such is wonderful and could've made for some fun challenges.Papo & Yo is based on the Unreal 3 Engine and while this engine isn't exactly the standard for visual fidelity these days, the game still looks pretty good and the lighting and level design add a lot to the overall atmosphere.With roughly 4 hours of playtime, the game is fairly short, but if the game would've been filled with repetative puzzles in favor of playtime, the emotion and strength of the story would have suffered immensively and would've made this game just yet another average puzzle platformer.There are dolls scattered throughout the levels and once you beat the game, those dolls will receive hats which you then can collect in a second playthrough. Other than that, the game doesn't provide you with anything else to do, which is fine - games like Papo & Yo aren't meant to be played for days, weeks or months. They want you to immerse yourself for a few hours, tell you a story and maybe even think about it a few days later.Papo & Yo is a prime example of how emotional and intense video games can be. Don't buy it for the platforming and don't buy it for the puzzles. Buy it for the story and let the emotions take over.			"

												This may very well be the first example of magic realism in a videogame. More than a little rough around the edges, Papo & Yo still deserves enormous respect for its brilliant handling of metaphor, unerring focus on the strengths of the medium and other fancy concepts like that while managing to not be too snobbish and arty-wanky about it. Add painterly, enchanting visuals and culture-fusing music to that and you've got something quite unique on your hands.			"

												Papo y Yo was a game that came out a while ago that I only now got around to playing despite having it since it came out on Steam. I'd been intrigued by it from the time the creator started talking about it, and interviews I saw on Giantbomb years ago now. The themes of an abusive father and alcoholism are things I am all to familiar with and so I found it intriguing that the creator wanted it to be the cruxt of the game.Unfortunately, as a game, there is really only one mechanic. It's a really cool mechanic, but there's only one. Terrain deformation. Basically you play Quico, a young boy, and you have to traverse this surrealist world to unfold a story. You move around buildings, change the terrain, create stepoping stones, all in the name of... fairly typical platforming. The game is very easy and never really gets difficult at all.Since this is the only mechanic there isn't really a time you should get stuck and even if you do it won't be for very long. The puzzles are super simplistic.Graphically the game is amazing. I have nothing, but praise for the visuals crafted for this adventure. The aspects of moving houses, terrain that bites down like teeth, or even just the backdrop of what appears to be Brazilian streets are all splendidly realized. Even the beautifully crafted murals which serve no purpose, but to make areas look cool. The one good thing I can say about this game is that it looks amazing. But a video game is not bought just to look at it. We want to experience it, and in that Papo y Yo fails entirely to create a worthwhile experience. As said previously mechanically the game has little to offer, and while novel for an hour or so it quickly wears thin. On top of that the story is abominable. In parts it's incredibly hamfisted- catering mostly to visual metaphor (the game is never explicit and yet is always entirely implicit) it's never not obvious what the story is talking about, and that is fine. Yet the way it gets to what I would assume is it's moral is entirely questionable and not something I agree with at all. It's telling that you play a child as the platitude at the end is comepletely childish.-Spoiler for the ending. Do not read further if you don't want to know.-I understand being abused as a child, and having a father who is an alcoholic, but to imply that there is nothing you can do about it, and you should just let them go forever is something you believe when you are a child but is not actually true. That's called giving up, and where I come from you never give up on family.There are many other aspects of the story I found completely nonsensical: such as monster as it is represented- a visual representation of his father- makes absolutely no sense. I am unsure if the creator understands how people work. There is always a reason people do bad things. They don't just do things. Anyway, I won't continue to go on and on about the creator of this game's world view. I wouldn't recommend believing it, though, as it's a good way to become everything you hate.I like the visuals in this game. They are often gorgeous, surreal, and amazing to see. Everything else in this game is completely skippable- right down to the terrible moral espoused at the end here. I do not recommend this game at all. If you want to see the cool visuals you can most likely look up pictures of the game and get the same effect. There's nothing else to experience here.			"

												Papo & Yo is a truly excellent 3d puzzle platformer has great gameplay, great visuals, and a great story.The main gameplay sees you solving a series of puzzles using what's given to you by the environment. Each puzzle introduces some kind of mechanic and the 3D platforming gameplay gives you an interface to interact with that mechanic. Discovering what that mechanic does then figuring out how to manipulate it to progress is key and the game does an excellent job of letting you explore the mechanics without punishing you for trying something that doesn't work.  If you mess up, the game gives you a way to come back from what you've done and in the few cases where you can fail (such as falling off a cliff), you get put back in quickly so you can try again. This is a great way to encourage players to explore their options and try anything they can think of and is an example of how to do puzzles well. None of the puzzles are repeats, so each puzzle gives you something new to chew on without any filler. All of the challenges are really well designed and fun, while there were one or two puzzles that got a bit tedious, I wouldn't say any of them were unenjoyable. I did encounter one glitch where my character got stuck and couldn't move, but other than that everything was pretty solid.The graphics of this game are excellent both artistically and technically. Unreal Engine 3 is being used in full force to create a game that looks nothing short of gorgeous. The game uses lighting and bump mapping to great effect, but this would be mean nothing without the creative visuals that the developers put on display. The game more or less take place inside the protagonist's imagination (that's not a spoiler by the way), so they get really creative with the environments. The color pallete is vibrant and absolutely beautiful to look at. The animation of the monster is also fantastic, although the player character's run cycle felt a little bit stiff. Unlike most indie games that run on Unreal Engine 3, this game is actually extremely well optimized, and my GT 440 (which is somewhat old and outdated by now) usually got around 40 FPS on max settings.Even though the gameplay and graphics are fantastic, the story just might be the best thing about Papo & Yo. I won't go into too much detail because that would spoil it, but the storytelling does a great job of telling a deep, emotional story in a mostly nonverbal way. What you see in the imaginary world of the character's imagination is allegorical to his life (and the life of the creator of the game), which makes the game feel the developer is opening up a very personal part of his life to you. It's emotional and beautiful there are some soulcrushing twists along the way.Overall, Papo & Yo is a must-play for anyone interested in puzzle games or great stories.			"

												Papo & Yo is not the first game developed in the story direction of childhood abuse or parental issues, though it is understandable that people with such experiences want to make stories with that focus.And that in a sense leaves me feeling uneasy about what I want to say for this game. It is the awkward borderline of judging a game for it being a game, and judging it for the overall intentions.Now, I know the review began with giving away the premise of the game, but the reason I was fine with doing so is because of an immediate flaw in the game. Within the actual first minute of Papo & Yo, right after starting a New Game, there is a dedication and following scene which give away the game's purpose. That destroys any surprise completely. I definitely think that the game should have been set up differently for an even stronger impact of the parallels/metaphorical world.Despite that, the game moved along properly story-wise with what the characters represent. And the general events that occur as well as the world's environment are very strong and unique because of how surreal things get. The graphics of the game are mostly well-done, with interesting setup of the favela you traverse, nice color for the world as it morphs around you. Towards the end of the game, some of the physical effects that happened to the map genuinely made me dizzy, which, while not exactly enjoyable, gave me the idea of how strongly I was grounded in the distorted world.As I said towards the beginning of the review, though, how I want to judge this game is not exactly balanced. Though I became quite invested in Quico (the main character) throughout a short game that took me less than 4 hours, that does not mean that the game was perfect by any means.In fact, the majority of the flaws were from its technicality as a game. The game is platforming and puzzle-solving. The puzzles as a whole were all extremely easy to find the solution to; but many were made simply annoying due to how you get around as well as the Monster's interactions. For instance, there are some places where the Monster is literally in rage, trying to hurt you, which is understandable for the story. However, due to your limitations, some of the puzzles with that end up taking a long time because the Monster easily catches you, can block your path and throw you around over and over, and so on. It's meant to be a challenge for some of the puzzles, but the ones where Monster is permanently angry tended to waste a lot of my time, instead of making me more sad for the child.Most of the puzzles for a good chunk of the game require the same repeated actions. Flip a switch here; run somewhere else and flip a few more; return to your original spot and flip the switch back. Grab this item; run away from the monster; throw it somewhere. The game didn't get that unique until some of the extremely surreal areas of the game, or the puzzles that allow you to move or attach favela houses to one another to create bridges and platforms.The platforming aspects of the game are also rather disappointing and need lots of cleanup. There are a lot of invisible boxes blocking you all over the place. Whenever I was climbing around or jumping across rooftops, for instance, I would very often find Quico hitting some invisible edge of the roof. Despite seeing his whole body being above it all, I would fall down and have to go back around. Or there were certain puzzles where I saw a way to physically reach an object or switch, but there was an invisible box floating in the air, intentionally preventing me from getting there. There's also graphical issues such as clipping, where Quico's body would be inside of a wall or through some object on the ground.There was also horrendous lag during certain puzzles, and also any time I would enter a new area or a checkpoint occurred. Literally, everything would just freeze up and move choppily for several seconds, until the game got itself together again. The frequency of this was quite bothersome, usually being every handful of minutes.In the end, there was a lot of disappointment for me in how Papo & Yo was a ""game"", in its playability. There is lots of frustration with technical glitches and certain bad puzzle layout to the point where it got me angry (which isn't common for me), when it should have only been the story evoking my emotions.Thus, I am on the fence in how to end this review. The point of the story is not exactly new, though the visual aspects and uniqueness of the world are interesting. The idea of the gameplay using Monster is also intriguing, though there are many issues as mentioned above.Since there is only a ""Yes"" or ""No"" in Steam, I guess I will give ""Yes"" a slight edge due to the world.

												Autobiographical game and a surreal parabole about a relationship between a child and abusive parent with drinking problem. That alone makes Papo & Yo stand out. However actual gameplay consists of series of puzzles that are inventive and satisfying but never bring greater challenge as it is almost always obvious what to do. Jumping is imprecise at best and sadly there are few sections where you have to perform a double-jump in a very specific way which is not fun at all. I reccomend Papo & Yo for tackling with difficult topics and for creating a memorable experience.			"

												This masterpiece caught me off-guard.  I was expecting a lighthearted platforming romp through puzzles, like Portal, but instead what I got was a powerfully moving story.  The visual experience that is this game is hard to overstate.  The puzzles are unique and balance the edge between challenge and ease perfectly.  The dual-layering of everything you see and experience is really powerful, and merits a second playthrough, just to let what you're seeing sink in.What impressed me most about the game was the incredible imagination it showed.  It's so imaginative, you really do feel like you're controlling a creative child, without it feeling too much like a children's game.  Believe me, it isn't.  10/10, best game I've played in years.

												Papo & Yo is the story of a boy who wants to save his friend Monster. On the surface this seems rather silly and simplistic, but it is a metaphor for a very real and heart wrenching tragedy. It is highly uncommon to see real world social issues brought up in games, especially social issues which no one wants to talk about, but Papo & Yo does this beautifully. The core gameplay is a puzzle platformer. The puzzles are quite easy to be honest, and if you get stuck it has a built in help system. The world you are in is very surreal and fantastical (think Salvador Dali), and is set in a bario neighborhood somewhere in South America. The soundtrack in this game is just fantastic as well. You must play this game to the end, or else it will not make much sense.  While this is certainly not the best game I have ever played, it is by far one of the most memorable. Papo & Yo takes about 3-4 hours to complete. 9/10Please upvote this review if you found it useful :)			"

												""Ba ha ha video games can't deal with any sort of real-world issues!""""Yeah?  How about THIS!""""Oh no I am undone!

It's also a fantastic example of gameplay-story integration, one of the best I've played.  The gameplay of alternating between working with and running from Monster really makes you feel the themes, which wouldn't work in any other medium.

												""It's not a real indie game if it doesn't feature a small child in a dark, dark world."" This one was a 3d platformer-puzzle game. Papo & Yo was a bit on the easy side, even though I was pretty stumped at the scrapyard scene with its colossal tower-in-building. The game was solid. Everything worked and it did not glitch to my recollection. I liked the game a bit, but despite its shortness it was starting to grate on me nearing the end. Not because the end was bad or anything -- the game simply wore out its tricks.			"

												Autobiographical game and a surreal parabole about a relationship between a child and abusive parent with drinking problem. That alone makes Papo & Yo stand out. However actual gameplay consists of series of puzzles that are inventive and satisfying but never bring greater challenge as it is almost always obvious what to do. Jumping is imprecise at best and sadly there are few sections where you have to perform a double-jump in a very specific way which is not fun at all. I reccomend Papo & Yo for tackling with difficult topics and for creating a memorable experience.			"

												The game starts out a bit slow but give it a go for at least 30 minutes and you'll start to see what got me hooked. This is probably one of the very few games I'll tell players to FINISH IT. PLAY IT TILL THE END.The game is short compared to other story driven games but you know what? It might be short but time well spent. Story telling in this game is subtle - it doesn't make any sense in the beginning but slowly everything will come together as you play. No plot twist, story just unfolds gradually and then BAM! Everything make sense at the end.The puzzle difficulty is just right for me, a couple of retries here and there but not to the point of throwing away my gamepad and bawling on the couch. Even if you're not the puzzle type of person, go play around with the puzzle and you'll be at awe at some of the designs. Manipulating buildings, terrain and my favourite - carrying big fat squishy frogs (I don't think anyone enjoy splatting the frogs though, they're too cute to be treated that way!)Another thing that's worth praising are the the tutorial and hint system are very well done - unobstructive upon request-only tutorial and subtle hints pointing you to the right direction without giving it all.If you're looking for a short, but meaningful game - this is the one.

												Papo and Yo originally invented for the PS3 is renowned for it's role as an empathy game. One of the few games on the market aimed specifically to evoke an emotional empathy response from it's player, this is largely because the developer Vander Caballero found here... http://www.weareminority.com/ has decided to use the expression of game art to exercise his own personal demons.While it was largely inspired by the game 'ICO' there is a more larger similarity to the game 'Among the Sleep' and 'Brothers' in the way that the developer has chose to use cute characters and backgrounds to handle some adult touchy subjects such as alcoholism and physical abuse.The story revolves around a young Brazillian boy named Quico who cowers in his bedroom closet while his father storms past. He then escapes into a magical slum world he creates where he finds a girl Alejandra who at first sees Quico as a threat, but who eventually aids him in his adventure. He is also joined by a robot toy named 'Lulu' which always has his back and a monster who is usually somewhat love-able who sleeps a lot and you can have fun bouncing off his belly, but when he ever has French Cuisine he launches himself into a rampaging devil. All set out on a magical journey which ends both bitter and sweet.The amazing slum background which would have Salvador Dali jumping up and down on a cat in excitement is sheer magical and enchanting to explore. While the puzzles aren't that sophisticated, some can be challenging on the basis that they are slightly vague and will have you scurrying either for a hint box placed in the game which you can don on and run around in or for a youtube walk through. In truth you've probably just missed something obvious like the fact that you can move the buttons as well as press them.Your first run through will be greeted with a metaphor of what happened in the developers personal life, you will also be challenged to go through the entire game a second time, this time without the need of a hint box and the further realization that 25 collectible hats have been hidden in the game.So what are the metaphors in the game? Unlike other games which often be coy about the matter and leave it open the gamer's digression. The developer here wants his story to be told. (Spoiler Alert) The developer (quico) grew up with an abusive father (monster) who was an alcoholic due to the fact that he had accidentally hit someone in his car and killed them. The developer's mother (lulu) always was there for Quico until one day when the monster seemed to have killed lulu (severe abuse) eventually she did get better though through the help of Alejandra (a mixture of the developers first love and his literal little brother) .They at first tried reasoning and hiding the frogs (alcohol) which was making the monster angry. But after one severe abusive bout which took the life of Alejandro Quico eventually realises that he cannot cure this monster and instead has to let this monster go from his life for good. As Quico grows up he drifts away from his dependance of Lulu and pushes the monster away from his life for good after what he witnesses with his attack on Alejandro.The game is well made, because the puzzles aren't that difficult no severe feeling of accomplishment is ever made and so the moral of the story is some what less victorious in feeling. The monster in the game just tosses you about too and is not really that fearing enough to make you sympathise as much as you do in 'Among the Sleep'. The biggest enemy of the game though is it's price. With such a noble meaning and story to a game you would think that they would lower the price so that more could enjoy as the game is also hardly long enough to warrant a large sum. However it should be noted that making games can be a very expensive journey. When asked why he chose frogs to represent bottles of alcohol, the developer replied that it was largely to do with cost. They originally wanted chickens to represent bottles of alcohol in the game, but to put chickens in the game would have cost them $15,000. Since they already had frogs in the game they decided just to go with the frogs and scrap the chickens idea. I have many question marks with that last statement???Anyway the game is seriously worthy of a glance especially if it goes on sale...			"

												If I were to made a list of nice things about this game I would have to mention that graphics are nice, the visual design of the game is fantastic, the soundtrack is amazing and the puzzles are rewarding. But that would leave out the fact that this is an incredibly moving and touching game. It deals with a very serious and personal issue of the game creator's childhood and transforms it into a heartfelt game as a sort of personal therapy. The ending is specially cathartic. A must buy if you want to take a look at what games can do when they go beyond the usual thematic conventions of gaming.			"

												Perhaps the most emotionally powerful game I've played. Those of you who have read about the game or watched one of the trailers know what the game is about already, but if you haven't, the game is full of metaphors that become clear by the end of the story, and it's devastating.The gameplay itself is wonderful - it's a puzzle platformer, with some neat puzzle mechanics (changing the world to complete your objectives), with one bit right out of ""Inception."" The puzzles aren't too difficult, and there is even a hint box in every level in case you need a hint. The art direction is terrific (with street art commissioned from actual artists); combined with the music and sound design, it really immerses you in a favela like nothing else.If you are looking for a well-told story that immerses you in the world of a young boy in a Brazilian slum dealing with a monster - I can't recommend this enough.

												Papo & Yo is a delightful platformer/puzzle game with a very interesting theme. Though the game might at first look seem like a fantasy story of a boy and a monster being friends, it really is about growing up and coming to terms with your childhood. It is a game about how our imagination can help us cope with difficult times, until we are strong enough to take the masks off, see things for what they really are and accept reality for what it is.In essense, Papo & Yo is not an extraordinary game, but it is a very good one. It has a strong and very personal message, one which I believe most people should be able to relate to one way or another. You can't go wrong with it.			"

												I really wanted to be able to recommend this game, even if only as an experience. It ticks all the boxes I look for in an interesting game - It’s developed in a country not known for their dev studios, it discusses a very real and very important question and it’s technically well executed. But I can’t recommend it as it makes the cardinal error for an interactive experience - it’s plain boring. The theme of parental abuse is overstated and the metaphors crude, but all that could be forgiven if it was only fun to play. As it stands it’s a run-of-the-mill 3d puzzle platformer with unimaginative puzzles with no story telling. Should be played by hardcore explorers of the modern gaming medium due to the reasons in the first paragraph or if you need to write about it. Otherwise stay away.			"

(sighs)cons:1. no map2. stupid hint boxes that only show pictures3.dialoge is in a bubble format like a comic and goes by rather quickly so if your not a very fast reader you do miss some                            things* note* may have to replay and set it slower...hey when ur playing at 3am it is hard to see without things getting kind of     blurry and i  was totally sober *big cheesy grin***Personal thoughts and opinins**so far i am happy i got it and it was on sale as well ^^ (possible spoiler) from what i saw of the 2 car seens not sure if the kid was abused or saw something the adult male did to someone else...have not finished yet...but he is traumatized. I do love the quirkiness of some of the npc's and the main characters interaction with them. gameplay itself took a min or so to get comfy with the controls but it is just fine. depending on your normal genre this is a love or hate game...me i love it. it is very interesting. p.s. on the rating it takes alot to get a 10 out of 10 from me or lower than a 2 out of 10 where i like a game or not. i take alot into consideration when evaluating a game regardless of my personal feelings.  a true review is suppose to b unbiased altho it is hard to do but for some i cannot believe the one liners i have seen they r NOT helpful at all as to help ppl decide as to whether or not to purchase a game especiall with no demo to try. (rolls eyes at some peeps supitity)seriously i really read positive and negative review b4 buying games once i found out they were there hey i am a natural blonde (rofl) and sometime a bit slow at figuring things out) and yet i have those days when everything is clear and falls into place (woo hoo) just because i have a 148 iq does not make me a genius just means my br ain works faster in ways i do not even comprehend XD ^^peace out and happy gaming y'all =^.^=8/10			"

												A really nice and surreal action adventure puzzle game. I usually prefer 1st person perspective in 3D games where you control a single character, but since I enjoyed playing this one, which is purely 3rd person, I can say it's a really good game.A downside is that it's a little short. Playing for the first time, you can finish it in about 4 hours, and 1-2 hours on the 2nd play through (if you don't search thoroughly for ""secret"" locations, which are only useful after you've already finished the game at least once ;)).

												First of all, let me just say it got this game through humble bundle about a month or two, but never had the time to play the game until recently. i have not watched any review or let's play of the game, but heard of it through a friend who enjoyed it. other than that, i was completely clueless to what this game could be. also this review is SPOILER FREE.Papo & Yo focuses heavily on story (according to me) and tries to connect it with the surrounding enviroment both in terms of immersion and key elements in gameplay. This sounds great in theory... however the game itself is a mess. The art alone is wonderful and i would definitely recommend Papo Y yo as an art exhibiton rather than as a game. This is because the controls feels very clunky and slow and i personally feel that the lack of ""ledgegrabbing"" could be... mildly infuriating. Not only that, but the puzzles themselves could be a bit painful due to backtracking without any other mechanic than simply ""walking"", ""climbing"" or the painfully slow ""getting a box  2 feet away to an adjacent square in the ground"".However as i mentioned earlier, Papo & Yo wants to (i think) focus on story and immersion, not the gameplay. When i got the humble bundle, i also got another game that did the same thing and it was called ""To the moon"". To the moon had half the staff and budget (probably) that Papo & Yo had, but delivered in so many more ways in that. What im trying to say that Papo & Yo doesn't have a story good enough to ""carry the game"". It feels very rushed, and the immersion just isn't good enough because of it's poorly designed gameplay. There are so many other games (such as ""To the moon"") which does story much better than Papo & yo, so if your looking for that, i suggest another game.That said, the game has some beautiful art and some great tracks. if you find a deal where you get the game AND the soundtrack, like humble bundle, it could be worth a dime. Buying the game solely on it's own? Not worth it.			"

												To be honest I'm surprised there are so many positive reviews for this game. It is an okay game, and I mean that in the nicest way possible. It is incredibly accessible and heavily story driven so anyone can get through it with relative ease and experience the story. However, that is probably the root of my largest complaint. My main gripe comes with the fact that almost all the ""puzzles"" in this game are not very clever and feel more like a chore. I never once had an ""aha!"" moment because it was always incredibly obvious what one needed to do to proceed. This isn't necessarily a negative for all people, but for me it is. For the most part they are just repetitive tasks you must complete to advance to the next zone. Most people rave about the story, and I thought this would be enough to redeem the game for me. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The ending came as no surprise as I thought they were very in your face from the beginning about the identity of the monster. I did however find the meaning of the frogs and their effect on the monster to be used in a way that was well done. Indeed, it wasn't all bad. The game did a good job of easing you into the mechanics and slowly building upon them as the game progressed. I also liked how when the monster became enraged the whole environment shifted and the monster came at you at just the right speed, This was enough to build tension most times I was caught off-guard (not realizing there was a frog around).Lastly I want to say I did enjoy the music and art direction within the game. And a few of the levels (especially towards the end of the game) did some very visually interesting things which made me wish that same creativity could have been used to increase the difficulty of some of the puzzles. In conclusion, I do not recommend this game for the current price of $14.99. However, if you happen to find it dirt cheap (perhaps around or under $5) you might want to give it a go. It is certainly a little adventure, but not one that I would probably take again.     "

Nice premise, but the slow pace killed it for me.GameplayAll you have to do during the game is jump, push and grab. Not complicated and nicely done. Aiming a jump was at times a bit difficult during the first playthrough. But during the second I was doing well, so I guess it was just a matter of practice. PuzzlesMainly easy but every now and then there was one I had to spend more time on. It may get tedious trying to resolve a puzzle when you are in A and go to B to pick something, return to A only to discover that whatever you picked was useless, go to C, return to A and then go to B to continue to the next puzzle.The puzzles also mark very clearly the different stages in the game, 1 stage // 1 puzzle. For me this was one of the things that impaired the pace of the game.CinematicsDuring the game the cinematics are generally very well executed, meaning you can still control your character while watching them. I feel this is a very pleasant thing to be able to do.However, there are times where a short cinematic would have been welcomed instead of a long sequence of doing nothing but waiting (when going to see the shaman, in the floating isle ). It was pretty frustrating being able to do nothing but turn in circles and playing with the camera.There were times also, where I had the impression that the use of cinematics was unnecessary. There's a puzzle composed of 3 parts near the end of the game (when reviving Lula ) and after each part there is a cinematic telling you that yes! I had beaten that part yay. I know I have done it, I've just did it. Tell me I did well the first time if you want, but not all of them please. CharactersQuicoMain character, nothing much to say about him.LulaQuico's favorite toy. Her (I'm going to assume she's female) first appearance presents her as a guide, she tells Quico how she can help him and how to make use of the new discovered abilities. But that is the only piece of dialogue she gets during the whole game and she becomes more of a tool than a friend.AlejandraGirl that teases Quico into following her and helps him to deal with Monster.MonsterBig lumbering creature that burdens you throughout the game. You must make use of him in order to resolve most of the puzzles.The death of Lula and Alejandra seemed forced, the character were killed because they acted stupidly, Lula could have dodged Monster and Alejandra shouldn't have stood jumping with and enraged Monster behind her. Although I feel those deaths were important, I believe they could have been implemented differently in order to appear more credible. AchievementsHats, why?Although I gather the game has a lot of value I had not a great time playing it, and I'm sorry but a cannot recommend it.			"

												[GENERAL] This game is a true piece of art, the gameplay is interesting and fun. The puzzles in the game are easy enough to enjoy but hard enough to give you a challange. This is one of the few 3rd person puzzle games where you do not get frustrated or annoyed just because the obvious is not possible. The story is interesting and even though a typical story, it has a great way of portraying it. I got this game on sale, but the original price for 15,00 is acceptable but still a bit steep for the length of the game. You will not waste your money, but I would recommend getting it on sale.[FAMILY]This game is in my opinion acceptable for kids of younger age too, though I would not suggest letting kids play this alone below the age of 10, the story and puzzles are not easy enough and the Monster might scare and confuse the younger kids. Other then that, if you play this together with your children, they will enjoy it.			"

												A game with a deeper story than on the surface, with characters narrating people in one's life and an ending that one have to find the courage to accept.The puzzles involved in the game are relatively easy without any need for the hint boxes; You can get an achievement if you do not use the hint boxes at all. Depite wanting to get the full achievement on steam for this game, I still find it hard to force myself to replay the game.With the length of the game I wouldn't recommend it at full price. But if it's on a 85% discount and you have a few hours and dollars want to spend then go for it. "

												TL;DR A nice atmospheric game but the simplistic puzzle-work and paper-thin storyline leaves a lot to be desired. Still kinda glitchy on *nix too, nothing gamebreaking though.---Overall if you don't want to think too hard and play a very linear game that'll handhold you through most all puzzles then this game is for you. The enviroments and the music are nice but the gameplay is pretty lacking. Nothing really novel here in story or gameplay best as I can tell. From a performance point of view things run mostly OK on *nix, it does hitch pretty badly at times and the lighting effects can look a bit iffy at times but overall nothing gamebreaking. My biggest nitpick is that despite the large environments there really isn't any incentive to explore from what I can tell. Sure you can look around and see stuff but short of exploring a fairly unpopulated, albeit beautiful, environment for the sake of exploration I don't see much to hold me. From what I've seen this game isn't worth an evening of my time.			"

												I purchased  this game a few weeks  ago just  because I saw the trailer and the gameplay reminded a lot of Ico for the Ps2, which is one of my fav games of all times. The gameplay of Papo & yo works in a similar way that Ico game, you get into areas, solved a couple of puzzles, turno on switches here and there and that's it. The game is simple, easy to go through and solved the puzzles. Now grafically speaking, the game is just BEAUTIFUL, the environment where the action takes place is just AWESOME, living in South America, in a awesome city with lots of hills and house build on them one above the other kinda feel like the action is taking place in mi city even thoug it's a mix of several architecture cities in South america (Chile, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia) which makes it more awesome because it's the first time I saw this kind of environment in a game. I should also  mention  the awesome art/painting in the walls of some buildings, they're incredible, I realized that those painting were actually done by  chilean artists and that some with similar designs are painted  in huge walls around my city, I just love it!!! As for the game quality, it's all thumbs up, music, art/design of the game no complains here and the story is deep, you can notice that the director put a lot of efforts in telling his own personal story and putting it into the game, lot of emotions, I think you should be a grown up to catch the whole plot to understand it though. The music is also excellent, so much that I decided to get the  OST as well.  To sum it up, this game is an excellent story telling/puzzle  kind of game well worth your money. I t won't be a waste I can assure you that.			"

												Papo & Yo is a lot of things. It's a 3D puzzle game. It's interactive magical realism. It's a meditation on abuse and alcoholism. It's pieced together with a real familiarity with and affection for the assembled look of Brazilian favelas. And it has a autobiographical tone that's nearly impossible to find elsewhere in games.The gameplay is decent. The setting and music are strong. But the real star of the show is Monster. The game couldn't exist without him. For a creature that says nothing and spends half the game sleeping, he's fascinatingly complex. You'll switch between trying to protect him and trying to escape from him at a moment's notice. You're trying to break his addiction, but sometimes you'll use that addiction to force him to do what you want. You'll find yourself clinging to the brief moments he shows some affection, even if it's nothing more than a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥toss of football. You want to like Monster, though you'll repeatedly ask yourself if you should even bother. It's a juggling act, but you'll find yourself practicing quite a bit of cognitive dissonance as you go from puzzle to puzzle.The game isn't subtle in its metaphors, nor should it be. Think of it as a children's story about abuse. It's like Where the Wild Things Are, except instead of wild creatures as stand-ins for the anarchy of childhood, Monster stands for a child's perspective of the physical power, aloofness, and cruelty of adulthood.

												A wonderfully artistic platformer.  Takes place in a magical realist South America.  The gameplay is a little off at times, but the presentation is solid.  It's a good game if you like platformers.  If you're not big into platformers I'd give it a pass.			"

												A powerful narrative, imaginative puzzles, and strong presentation combine in Papo & Yo to result in one of this year's best gaming experiences. The emotional journey of Quico and Monster that comprises Papo & Yo leaves a long-lasting impression well after its conclusion.			"

												I'll say 8/10. If you are interested in this sort of game, you should play it. It is good, but it is not a great 9 or 10 game. It is a puzzle game, figuring out how to get from here to there, moving platforms, jumping, etc. The puzzles were varied and unique, and I was sometimes challenged, but never frustrated.The plot is that you are a boy, running through a magical version of Brazil (maybe, I wasn't sure). You spend most of the game in a poorer section of the city, but you can pull levers to make buildings move. You have a beloved robot companion, a monster that follows you around, and a mysterious girl. But all of this is a dream, because in the real world your father is an abusive alcoholic. Monster, is of course, your father. Normally, Monster is Ok. You can use him to jump to higher ledges, or activate switches. He walks arounds, and sleeps a lot. But when Monster eats a frog he becomes a flaming demon of pain.This game did a great job of controlling my emotions. In the beginning, Monster isn't so bad. Maybe even helpful. But as the game progressed, I found myself hating Monster. Really hating him. And hating frogs. I would smash every frog I saw, and I have never wanted to murder (no defeat, not slay -- murder) a monster more.			"

												Well whoops, here I thought this was a cute puzzle game.. Oh metaphors you sneaky sneaks you win again. That being said FANTASTIC story, good graphics,fitting soundtrack. The puzzles were just challenging enough to keep me interested. Really can not say much because I do not want to ruin the story for anyone whom might be interested in playing. All I will say is this is one of the better games I have played for a while and that maybe children of a certain age should NOT play it as I found out it is of more mature subject matter then previously expected, And that is why I always play my games first before letting my children play them (and that way it is more easy to help them acomplish puzzles and what-not). 9/10 two thumbs way up.

												Wow, what to say about this game!  When I bought this game, I did not know what to expect.  To be very honest, I did not even know what the game was about, other than it was an action/platformer game.  The story of this game is rather deep for such a childrens style game.I don't really want to post any spoilers, but you run around as a kid named Quico whose father is an alcoholic.  You are in what seems to be a dream world where you have to solve puzzles and platform your way across each area to progress the story.  The puzzles are not overly hard, but the game is just fun and the story is a big metaphor.The game is relatively short, but I believe you can play through twice just for the achievements.  Overall, this was one of the most enjoyable games I have played in the last year.  I did not want to stop playing! Part of me wishes it were longer, but another part is glad it was the length it was, because it did feel just right.Anyhow, if you are looking for a action/platform/puzzle game that has a pretty good metaphoric driven story and is fun to boot, well I think this is right up your alley!

												Papo & Yo is a delightful platformer/puzzle game with a very interesting theme. Though the game might at first look seem like a fantasy story of a boy and a monster he befriends, it really is about growing up and coming to terms with your childhood. It is a game about how our imagination can help us cope with difficult times, until we are strong enough to take the masks off, see things for what they really are and accept reality for what it is.The game itself isn't very challenging, but the platformer controls can be a bit finnicky from time to time. The environments of the game are well made and it is fun to see how the world shifts as you solve the puzzles. The game is fairly short but it definitely keeps you invested in it until its very appropriate and memorable ending.In essense, Papo & Yo is not an extraordinary game, but it is a very good one. It has a strong and very personal message, one which I believe most people should be able to relate to one way or another. You can't go wrong with it.			"

												I was gripped the moment the game loaded. From the artistic main menu, to the absolutely gorgeous look to the game, to the fluid game play and stellar control feel, this game is top notch. In fact it makes some of the other titles that I've been playing lately  all of a sudden feel mundane.I've noticed a few reviewers have felt the game to be boring, but this wasn't the case for me at all. It was SUCH a refreshing change from the usual ""gun and ammo seeking"" games that have flooded the market. Trying to kill everything that moves before it kills you is not part of this game at all...you're actually trying to help someone who needs help. I suspect that those who didn't like this game fall into the COD or war gamer category, and that's not me.If you're remotely curious about this game then dive in and get it! You won't be disappointed. 9/10			"

												Papo y Yo is a 3rd person action platformer. Its basic controls and easy to understand mechanics allows its charm to shine through. The story is centered around Quico, a south american boy, that sets out to find why he is cursed. He follows a mysterious girl around in search of the answer to his quest. He comes to find that his curse is to be paired with a monster who is usually disinterested in him but will turn in a moments notice and attack Quico when presented with some mysterious tree frogs. Quico has the ability, or the task, rather of manipulating his world. The south american favela setting is both oppressive and beautiful; at times the world is vivid and imaginative. Traversing the various puzzles can drastically change them in ways you would never expect. As the story unfolds you come to find that the metaphors run deep and will certainly hit hard. The only complaint I have with Papo y Yo is that while the story is superb, it ends too soon. I suppose for the underlying subject matters, no spoilers, its best for this to be a short experience. The game is beautiful, and easy to pick up and play. It's a 4 to 6 hour romp that is worth its asking price. Go check it out.			"

												This is one awesome game! I especially love the different ways in which you can change your environment ""magically"", pulling stairs out of a wall, stapling buildings on top of each other like cardboards, tilting and twisting rows of buildings, it's a highly imaginative and fantastic journey. Even more so because the actual scenery would otherwise be rather depressing to behold (except for the colorful graffittis).  The gameplay itself demands a bit of action and right timing, additional to the puzzles, but is still not really hard to cope with. Just explore your surroundings and try out a few things, watch what's connected to what, and you'll get it :) There actually are optional hints to discover somewhere within the sceneries most of the times too. Each level is a bit different from the ones before, getting more and more dream-like, and a few times suddenly turning into short sequences of nightmares that are symbolic but obvious at the same time, and will leave a lasting impression. The soundtrack does it's best to underline the atmosphere and never gets annoying. It might not be a very ""long"" game, and it makes you wish for even more levels and more of all these amazing ideas how one can toy in a virtual dream-like reality with an otherwise ordinary cityscape, but it's still well worth it's price :) "

												While Papo & Yo is far from being great, it's unique and interesting enough to be worth checking out. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone though, it's better to know what kind of game you're getting into.Plot-wise, it tackles a difficult subject very rarely seen in videogames. I'm not an expert, but to me it was portrayed very nicely and what's important was actually tied into the gameplay - a big plus right there. Another positive was the ending. It was quite surprising and to me, much more moving than the kind of conclusion you expect throughout the game. Where the game really shines for me are the visuals. The base of the game is pretty enough, but when you begin to bend the world to your will you come across some really nice things going on. It's probably one of the best applications of blending the reality with fantastic elements that I ever saw. Unfortunately, what lets the game down somewhat is the gameplay. There simply isn't much to do in the game - in theory it's a blend of platforming and light third-person puzzles, but neither of the elements really works. Platforming is very basic and frustrating because of being unprecise. The puzzles rarely demand any real thinking and in most cases come down to just activating whatever switches you can get to at the time. What's worse, some are quite dragged out and become a real chore to do. There is no challenge at any point of the game, the levels become more complicated but don't get any less dull. The game could use some more variety but it becomes a minor complaint when you compare it to the bigger problems. I could see Papo & Yo aiming to be a relaxing, easy game (at the same time with some important things to say) but to me, it became just a bit too frustrating in the end. That's not to say I didn't like it - one bad aspect doesn't have to ruin the whole game. Judging by the positive reviews the game has its crowd, so I would partially blame my own attitude for my disappointments. If you're coming with the right approach, you could be in for some great time with this game.			"

												Such a beautiful game, love the story behind the monster representing his fears and his father problems, puzzles aren't to much mind breaking, they are just soft puzzles to keep you going on the story.Loved the game, loved the story, nice evolvence and a relax soundtrack, a must have!

												While it could have spent a little more time in testing, this game is one of my favorites of 2013.  The gameplay is engaging and fun.  The puzzles are interesting and unique.  While not overly difficult, they will make you think.  The hint boxes scattared around each level give you just enough help whithout giving you the full answer.  And the story is heartfelt and moving.  I can't help but compare this to Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons.  But Brothers did nothing to get me emotionally invested in the characters and the solutions to the puzzles were obvious.  This game does a brilliant job of connecting you to the characters emotionally.  And the puzzles are challanging without being too difficullt.  The result is a game that is touching and fun.  If you like good gameplay coupled with puzzles that are challenging without being frustrating and a great story, you will love this game.			"

												A short 2-4 hour game with simple puzzles that just end up becoming frustrating and taking lots of time (not thinking) to work through as you get to the end of the game. The symbolism in the game is very obvious. I was forcing myself to keep playing to finish the game; it was not very enjoyable.			"

												Brilliant puzzle game with excellent graphics, movement, and creativity.  Play as a little boy guided by a girl that has unique supernatural abilities but is convinced you are cursed.  Monster is a metephorical representation of the boys father, who has a penchant for poison frogs, and is quite dangerous after eating them.  He is needed in all his glory for the boy to get through the intricate puzzles however, and even when asleep can be quite useful.  I recommend this game to anyone that loves puzzle adventure games.

												Papo & Yo is a story about a troubled childhood and using infinite imagination to escape, rationalize, endure... and, in the end,  let go of the troubled memories. The story is presented in a spectacular and beautiful world, with impressive visuals and weird adventure-like puzzle design. The entire game world is a metaphor, every element having real meaning- some things quite obviously so, while others are left for interpretation and discussion.The game is neither long nor hard, but keeps throwing one impressive scene after another to constantly occupy the player's attention.While it might not be everyone's cup of tea, I was definitely impressed and had to keep playing until I finished the story in one sitting. Take that as a recommendation if you wish :)			"

												There are a couple of things that I really admire. You see the world through the eyes of a child, full of logic defying imagination. The context is a little grim because you're in a filthy shanty town of South Africa or something like that and need to rely on your fantasy for escapism. You don't see settings like that in other games.I'm disappointed in the lack of exploration and the weak puzzles. It's way too easy. Also, the story beats are somewhat hamfisted and so are the flashbacks. It is obvious the atmosphere was most important to the devs and not the gameplay. They are self-satisfied by being ""indy"". I dislike the notion of ""Let's break conventions for no good reason. Let's not follow any rules of narration or game design and confront the player with controversy. He'll have to like us if he wants to stay PC.""			"

A Paladin's Steam Review: Papo and Yo. Lacking in Interesting Characters or Puzzles.Genre: 3rd Person Puzzle Platformer TitleDeveloped & Published by: Minority Media Inc. Platform: Windows OnlyBusiness Model: Base Game. Copy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts & PreambleI was rather interested in giving this a whirl when it came out a few years ago. Fast-forward to this past week and I finally got a chance to try it out. Well, this game makes two major mistakes to me. First: the characters are given very little backstory or personality. You could swap in any person to fill the role of these characters and it would come off as the same. The other problem is the puzzles themselves. They mostly range from really easy to unnecessarily frustrating. Not even the good kind of frustrating, just time-wasting frustration. So, let’s dig in and talk about Papo & Yo.Story ThoughtsI've seen comments been made that the game’s story is subtle and full of meaning. I found that it was rather blunt and in your face with its themes about living with people that abuse alcohol. I mean, a shadow in the shape of Monster behind a guy, it’s just not that subtle. The toy getting destroyed by Monster wasn't all that subtle. I do recall that I wanted to know more about the main character, more about this mysterious girl who’s guiding you around. Instead, you’re given very little information. The story seems content to focus on one little part of the boy’s past. It's hard to get invested when you're not given any character to invest into. So, if I can’t get invested in the characters or story, all that’s left is the gameplay. And for the most part, it’s boring. PuzzlesA lot of the puzzles consist of getting monster from one place to the other using what few items and environment puzzle pieces you have at your disposal. Most of the time though, it’s climbing up ladders, doing very basic platforming, puzzling with levers, switches and buttons. Each puzzle is overly long and unsatisfying to finish. I can’t help but get the impression they were put in to stretch the game out. Especially when one particular puzzle has you climbing all over rooftops and platforms to collect around 10 pieces of building in order to finish it. There isn't a lot of nuance, its figuring out the quirk of the puzzle you've stumbled upon and then sinking however many hours the puzzle decides you need to until you finish it. PC SettingsIt’s got texture, shadow, AA, light shafts, motion blur, bloom, depth of field and all other graphic settings a 3rd person game requires to tweak. Most, however, are on/off switches but at least you have options to optimize your experience. Not that I think you’ll need to tweak with them much, the game isn't very demanding. You may need to tune up the gamma settings as the game seemed really dark to me. Final ThoughtsFinishing the game isn’t tough. However, this is one particular journey that I didn’t feel better for having experienced. I think the main problem lies in the characters themselves. I felt no investment into them, no reason to find moments evocative when perhaps I should have. It feels like this subject has been handled better elsewhere. Add that problem to the other problem of the simple, time-wasting puzzles that were far more frustrating than they should have been. I don't recommend this title. This has been done better.

												Good game with a great soundtrack but overpriced for such a short and easy game. I would recommend it but I'd also recommend you wait on it to go on sale because it's only a couple of hours long, unless you care about achievements which will force you to play through the game a second time to get the hats. The story for the game seems to have been inspired by ""Tales From The Hood"", a movie from 1995. One last thing, the live action parts of the trailer are stupid.			"

												When you see the main menu of game, it looks unattractive, there are no pictures at a background, color inscriptions and effects, just  white lines.Probably it reflects sense of game to some extent.Introductory video didn't give me an idea of game. The sense will begin to reveal only when game will be finished.The destiny of the main character is hard and he goes from real life to the invented world. But there it is expected far not by easy tests.At first the monster kills him the toy robot (which is live in the world of imaginations), then it takes away the girlfriend whom the boy for the first time met in this world. Playing it is possible to understand that the monster personifies the father of the boy who did his life difficult.Speaking about a gameplay it is possible to tell that we should use only the left joystick and 3 buttons.Music in conclusion give us time to thinking about whole game, about all events.I suppose it`s important for the full impressions.This game isn't perfect, but 9.5/10.

												Drowsy game.  Boring. Puzzles are simple, one-directional, and tedious to complete, with the premise of going from point A, to point B, then A once again, to finish it in C.In the hour and a half that I've been playing, I've enjoyed 2 dynamical and original puzzles, while I suffered of boredom the remaining hour and 20 mins.Wouldn't recommend it because:1. Gameplay is too repetitive, soft, and boring.2. The first phrase when you start the story reveals everything.Yes, the story is touching, but the time you have to suffer playing betwen cutscenes is NOT worth it, in my opinion.			"

												Perhaps ive not given this game enough of a try, i picked it up quite a while ago and i remeber being excited about it when i did. the the game started. so lets dive into my first few minutes with the game. opening that kind ruins the game. to my brothers, sisters, and mother whom all survived the moster in my father... okay so the onster is your father... no subtext, we arent going to play around, monster is not a word used playfully when talking about a person, let alone a father. so yeah, the game has already started to lose me with it's lack of tact and we havent even begun yet, okay. lets get into gameplay, we run around chasing this girl, learning the mechanics of the game, white glowy thing? yeah thats always the answer, jumping feels like morrowwind with 1 acrobatics, clunky and awful, but wait heres lola the robot whom tells me we must get back to monster, and heck we get a double clunk jump. then you find out her other function (one of the reasons i stopped playing) you can send lola to reach for switches you cant reach, why you may ask, does that entail me no longer wishing to play this game? lola! lola! lola! every dang time you tell her where to go the damn kid yells her name! why? it serves nothing but to have the same three intonations of the name repeated endlessly for no reason!  anyway get to the monster, cool design, oh wait i have to feed him these lemons so he'll follow me...k, some chick puts him in jail, i bust him out, why, feed him more lemons, hit a switch to RELEASE THE FROGS,♥♥♥♥♥♥he'll chase those damn frogs!!! and then i was done.The game is just too much, no subtlety just an in your face story about a drunk father. i dont understand why you would make a game with such lacking gameplay, maybe im just not into this style of game, gameplay lacking, story to in your face, at least it looks kinda nice?

												Papa and Yo is not Subtle. It takes its abusive father metaphor and beats you over the head with it. I applaud what the creator is trying to do; even more so knowing its based on his childhood but, I think the game needs a better writer.Plot:The plot is about you letting go of your abusive and alcoholic father. Its not a bad place to start but thats all the game has plot wise. Very little character building or reasons to get attached to the characters. The only other npc is a girl that helps/hinders you who may be your sister but is unliklely due to the lighter skin color and almost no resemblance to you. *spoiler* She dies... or just gets abused. I have to say, I hate ambiguity. Not that ambiguity itself is bad, but few people know how, and when, to use it. Papa and Yo uses it as a crutch because 'I guess' the writers could fill the gaps with something they thought was interesting? I dont think the ambiguity is needed as much as they used it. GameplayThe gameplay consists of puzzle platformers. They are very simple puzzles and it gives you hints if you get stuck. Pretty bog standard as far as these things goAestheticThis is where I feel the game wins. Its damn beautiful with creative use of the environment to assist the puzzles. With the exception of a few technical pop ins, the game looked great. SoundThe sound was... alright. It did the jobs but nothing really stood out. There were also moments, like at the temple when you make the monster angry, a short music piece plays over the normal music and it doesnt sound good.LengthIts 2 hours. Im not sure if thats good or bad considering I wasn't really having fun, or an interesting experience. I feel like any more and I would have just stopped playing. At least I beat it because of its short length?If you really like puzzle platformer and non subtle plot threads strewn with ambiguity, then this game is for you. If not; give it a pass. "

												Papo & Yo is a puzzle game, however that is also where it fails the hardest. The puzzles in the game seem to be designed in such a way to waste as much of your time as possible, not because they're difficult (which none of them actually are), but because of the massive amount of running around that is required for solving each and every single one of them.The second major fault of the game is the clunky way of trying to control the monster to do what you want him to do, the mechanic is contrived, again simply to add to the play time.The storyline is very thin, the game tries to allude to things, however everything is already blatantly clear long before the conclusion of the game. And the soundtrack is almost equally nonexistant, most of the time there is no background music playing at all and the rest of time it's only sometimes interesting.All in all Papo & Yo Desperately tries to be much more clever than it actually is.However despite all its faults the game had me mildly entertained throughout, the atmosphere it tried to create was enough for me to finish the game, and because of the short play time and more importantly without any major setbacks there was nothing stopping me from doing so.5 / 10			"

												This game doesn't have much replay value, unless you want to get 100% on the achievements.I could predict what was going to happen, and who the characters would end up representing in Quico's life. If there was a plot twist, or the elements in the conclusion were more hidden and not as obvious I would have taken more gratitude to it. But for the repetitive and tedious puzzle sequences it dulled the gameplay because I already knew what would do what and how it would be done. Don't get me wrong, the storyline IS there, but the fillers for what little storyline is present consists of moving gears and wishing your walkspeed was faster.       The visuals are great, as well as the decorations, I was constantly exploring the maps out of curiosity and hoping that I would run into an easteregg (I found one near the end of the game).        For full price, I do not recommend buying this game because it is quite short, and your money would be better invested in a game where you could spend many hours on. Plus, the storyline is present, but not very strong. If you are considering buying it during a sale (I got mine 75% off), then I say there is no harm  if you have done your research and know this is a game you will enjoy for its price.			"

There could have been a slower reveal of the story-behind-the-story, but they chose to just show it all upfront.			"

												Edit: It is amazing how many people dislike this review, simply due to the fact that it doesn't supprot their preselected bias. Whether you agree or not with another's point of view, it is something to be respected. That goes the same, for myself; just because I didn't find this game entralling, doesn't mean I don't have a major respect for the creative minds behind it.Poor mechanic/thin story. This was a game that had so much potential, however it ended up trying way too hard to be clever. What seemed to be puzzles were just annoyances. You are introduced to the mechanics early on, and you, as the player, assume that these are going to develop into larger, more complecated puzzles. Instead, it just becomes reheated corn-cassorole type ""you need to do this before you can proceed to the next room"". Some ""puzzles"" were literally repeated throughout the game - this wasn't rewarding as the player, this just furthered your frustration.And if you want to make the basis of your game completely story driven, then do that. I really enjoyed titles like ""Gone Home"" and ""Dear Esther"", because they did it right. They understood that in order to drive a story, you must do exactly that - drive the story. If you want to implement a mechanic on the players' way to discover the story, make sure it works. By that, I mean make sure that there is something about the mechanic that keeps the player interested in using it. A good example of mechanic working in harmony with story, is ""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"". If you're just going to be repeating the same thing over and over and over, get rid of it or heavily limit its use. Otherwise, what you're really ending up doing, is wasting peoples' time.Now speaking directly to the story. The story was paper thin, and given clues that doesn't even take playing half the game to run into - and some of these clues are unavoidable. If you're paying attention, you can see what the allegory is behind the story the entire time. It does nothing to be subtle, but it gives the illusion of trying to be subtle, and that is where they fail. If you want to make one of those ""everything will be explained in the end"" kind of stories, make sure the player doesn't figure out the entire story before the end of the game.Final point - if certain things don't make sense without some sort of external explaination, get rid of them. They have no point being there, and do not pertain to the actual story you're trying to contrive.All in all, I would not recommend this game. It has potential, and if the developers ever try rebooting it, I'd give it a shot after listening to some reviews. If you want to try great story-driven games or great puzzle games, there are definitely better games out there that get the job done.			"

												Sometimes, things which are completely unexpected work really well together. For example, peanut butter and jelly (jam). When you think about it, those things couldn't really be any further apart and yet they work very well. Why am I going on about sandwiches? Because Papa & Yo's developers took two very different things, put them into this game and.... found out the hard way that they don't work together.In short, the concept was to tell a tale about a boy trying to cope with an abusive and drunkern father. Not a bad concept to tackle for a game which attempts to be a bit like Alice in Wonderland, but sadly they chose to make this a very dull and largely uninteresting, uninventive platformer. To begin with, how is platforming considered the best approach to a topic as deep and complex as child abuse? It's like trying to paint the Sistin Chapel mural with a ballpoint pen and call it a masterpiece. For the gamers considering to buy the game let me explain what you are going to be doing in Papa & Yo.In general, the levels are linear with a clear start and finish. They are actually best described as arenas since they are usually single room puzzles made to look like the shanty towns in southern america. There is some surreal scenary later on which adds some appeal but this Alice in Wonderland-style is only put to good use in a handful of levels, the rest are just dull. It is almost as if there were two level designers, one who was talented and one who was very inexperienced and you have to put up with content from both but the majority is from the inexperienced designer. I don't even think the game could be considered a puzzle-platformer as the 'puzzles' consist of running or jump to a spot and pressing a 'button' then doing this over and over and over. I'm not kidding when I say that you will not be challenged by any of the content in this game. A few twists occour here and there like pushing a trolley with monster sleeping on it to a specific spot.. so that is basically pushing a button too when you think about it. And there are invisible walls everywhere in this game and not to mention that when monster gets mad and throws you around, it is possible to be flung outside of the map and glitch into the void or end up unable to get back into the map again and forced to restart from your last checkpoint. The QA in this game really was terrible at ensuring it was bug free. On the one hand they use invisible walls to stop you walking off a cliff in one part of the map but within the same map on the opposite side you can fall to your doom. Consistancy people!In the end, Papa & Yo is just a simplistic platformer that attempts to bite off a complex narrative that is unsuited to the style of game used. It's incredibly short (less than 3hrs long) and not very entertaining at all. If you want to have a game with an interesting narrative and some good puzzles then I'd recommend alternatives such as Master Reboot or if you want platforming with storyline I'd highly recommend Contrast. Both of which are very entertaining games with far more duration, quality and content than this junk.			"

												Man, I wanted to love this game!  After reading several interviews with developer Vander Caballero and how he poured his heart into this game as an allegory to his upbringing with an alcoholic father, I really bought into the hype.  Well... yes, I was quite disappointed by the gameplay, but the story was touching, and the ending especially moved me.  Those weren't tears though, I was chopping onions last night.  Anyone who has struggled with a troubled childhood will be able to relate to the themes of this game.  Just don't be put off by the slow and repetitive gameplay.  It's no good when a game reveals its most clever puzzles in the first 30 minutes...			"

												Random train of my thoughts on this game.I'm all for interracial marriage, but Quico and his dad seemed to be completely different races.Is Quico's continuous shedding of clothes on his journey supposed to be a metaphor of losing your childlike innocence when dealing with abusive parents?And I wholly approve of this game's message to murder your alcoholic father by shoving him off a cliff.Overall, a pretty game with a surprisingly heavy story, but I wouldn't pay the listed store price due to how quickly you can complete it. Definitely worth it to pick up from the Humble Bundle X though.			"

												I loved ""Brothers: a tale of two sons"" and Steam thought I'd also like ""Papo y Yo"" but I didn't.***They're similiar in that both games have beautiful (and I can't emphasise this enough) scenery, great music and an emotionally charged story that eventually ends in drama. They're also pretty liniar and the puzzles don't require a brain surgeon to solve them. So why didn't I like Papo y Yo as much? Probably because it kept giving me hints where I didn't really need them, prolonged gameplay by making me run all over the place way too many times, gave away the story with its achievement list and kept moving the camera angle right when it was vital for the character to go where I wanted it to. Also, I felt like it was trying too hard to be a tearjerker but it didn't really find a way to get me connected enough to the characters so that I'd empathise with them.I feel like it'd be a shame to not recommend this game, but 11 € seems pretty steep to me; if childhood trauma based games with good music and pretty art are your thing, by all means get it, but wait for the sale.EDIT: My second playthrough was better as I avoided all hint and training boxes and I spent considerably less time running away from Monster - knowing your surroundings does come with a tactical advantage.

												I for one did not have an abusive alcoholic father and didn't know what I was jumping into. With that out of the way. This game is EXTREMELY patronizing like if it's so complex that no one would be able to understand what was going on. So they explain it to you at the end. Just in case your little mind wasn't able wrap around the concept of the story. It's like if they desided to explain that a lot of people died during the sinking of the Titanic after showing you people jumping into the freezing water. One of the differences being Titanic had a better story, and it really happened.			"

That said, Monster does have a very dangerous problem: an addiction to poisonous frogs. The minute he sees one hop by, he’ll scarf it down and fly into a violent, frog-induced rage where no one, including Quico, is safe. And yet, Quico loves his Monster and wants to save him. As Quico, players will build their friendship with Monster by solving puzzles together and adventuring through a magical, surrealist world. Players will need to learn to use Monster’s emotions, both good and bad, to their advantage if they want to complete their search for a cure and save their pal.			"

Memories and the story's message is told with substitutions. The really really gets you thinking even before you start the puzzles. There's a large amount mostly solved by correct jump timing and planning a route. Mid to late game they're very challenging but satisfying when you ahieve. Brilliant music and graphics. And there's some unique game mechanics which sometimes make you laugh and sometimes shocked at the depth and level this game goes to. All in all a 10 out of 10 for me.			"

												This game is a masterpiece! It's the only game I've ever played that left tears in my eyes. Highly personal, and very fun, Papo and Yo is a game about a boy trying to cope with his abusive father. This game opens wounds, but not in a bad way. Instead of determining to make a statement, and pointing it out to you, Papo and Yo immerses you into the story, letting you dictate how you feel about the situations presented. The gameplay is puzzle based. It's inventive and very imaginative, but not difficult. Do not expect to burnout your brain trying to solve the puzzles. This game is more about the storyline and your personal reaction to it. Your first play through will probably be 2 - 3 hours; so it's not a bad game to play on a lazy afternoon. The graphics are done well with a rich color palette and tones to make you feel you are in the slums. The voice acting is spot on. I know I'm lavishing over this game, but I really can't say enough good things about it. If there was ever a game I wished everyone would play at least once, it would be Papo and Yo!			"

												Good game if you get it on a steam sale.  The actual gameplay and puzzle solving is pretty easy throughout it, but the art style, audio effects, and music really saturate you into the game.  Seeing how it comes together into the overall storyline is nice as well.  I would definitely recommend this game for the experience.			"

												It will make you feel.  This interactive media makes you look at pain and love.  Specifically the pain caused by an evil drunken father and the confusing love felt by a son.  You feel along with the son.  The son loves his sister and she is also in pain.  The confusion of having a father,  who's rage must be managed and avoided and who will has fun playing and laughing with you, is a discovery.  It is emotional to the point that I felt like avoiding it and then it was so fascinatingly truthful in its depth that I could not disengage.  I know more than I did before I experienced this.  I think that was the goal of the man who made it and I know he was sucessful in teaching and sharing somthing from his life.  I was sad and angry durring this experience.  I guess that is the key feature of this game.   It has fastinating visuals and surreal, reality bending puzzles but at its core this is about sharing feelings.  Thank you Papo & Yo.			"

It's beautiful, it's moving, it's elegantly made. Just difficult enough to be challenging, but not difficult enough to take away from the essential quality of the game -- which is the story itself.I do feel that it deserves a trigger warning -- if you trigger on child abuse, this game needs to be approached with caution.

Roughly 4-5 hours to clear.What really makes Papo & Yo shine is the way it tackles its metaphoric plot with maturity and class.Worthy of a Wishlist!			"

												There aren't enough superlatives to describe the feel and look of this game! Absolutely loved it. The puzzles or the platforming aren't particularly challenging - they aren't meant to be. Exploring the surreal world of Papo & Yo is more like experimenting with laws of a different reality than testing your skills in a familiar one. It's like being a kid again, getting lost in a playground full of possibilities.Traversing the dreamlike slums as a little boy while trying to tame a wild Monster goes from enchanting to touching when you realize the Monster is a representation of the boys alcoholic father. The ending was especially powerful. Soundtrack fits the game perfectly, making the whole experience even more immersive.I'm really curious about Minority Media's next game called 'Silent Enemy' (dealing with bullying).V e r d i c t : AWESOMESAUCE, which means nearly perfect			"

												Well, my first ever steam review.  I HAD to review this.  A of hardcore gamer for over 30 years, this is the only one that warrents my time writing and promoting.  This game is beutiful.  It is really clever, artistic, imaginative, visually stunning, charming, wierd, warm, cold, gripping, mesmerising,  refreshing, and has a deep emotional story line like no other game before it  (or probably ever will ).  And on top of  this the gameplay is excellent,  the puzzles are clever, amusing and addictive.   A lot of care and thought has gone into this game.  Its a true escapist adventure.   Its on a par with A Tale of Two Brothers, another meticulously crafted, emotional and beautiful adventure puzzler game.  I found both games evoked similar emotions when playing.   I'd rate TOTB as the greatest game I've ever played (from from all genres).  Its hard to explain why other than the powerful emotions it evoked.  This game nearly steals that title for the same reasons but not quite.   I would definately rate this as the most original game I've ever played. Worth every penny. Truly Stunning.  Basically you just have to play it!   Limbo and Machinarium, great as they are, have been bumped down the list. "

												Surprisingly amazing game, very nice and laid back with interesting although fairly simple puzzles. The game takes on the main protagonist of Papo and delves into the true meaning of what the game is about. Its interesting as not many games are able to take on adult content such as this one and provide real impact especially one on an emotional level without just showing something in full blatant force. It feels like the game takes on adult themes in a very  subtle way which makes it more interesting as you play different parts of the game and wonder what each part truly means. The game is fairly short where I finished it in one day which feels really good as its not long enough to drag on and also shows the main focus which is a lot of story, puzzles and plat forming. For an indie game I didn't expect too much and so was pleasantly surprised to find out how great the game is. As a puzzle game its also quite interesting although can be quite simple at times. The best part of the simplicity of the puzzle is that it feels like you're always moving forward kind of like if you start a good run and you don't really want to stop. This creates a good flow to the game as I never felt that I had to just stop and think, or get annoyed and trying random things until something happened. I would definitely give it a recommendation, especially if you're looking for a fairly short and intriguing indie game.			"

												Gameplay: 9/10Storyline: 9/10Graphics: 8/10SoundTrack: 9/10Overall: 8.75/10The game puts players in the shoes of Quico, a boy whose complex fantasies are loosely tied with the real world.  Think the dilapidated, South American version of the Hundred Acre Woods.  Quico is looking for a way to cure his monster friend, as every time he eats poison frogs(alcohol), he goes on a rampage, destroying all in his path.  Otherwise, the monster is a peaceful being, and even saves your skin if you mess up in certain puzzles.  At its core, Papo & Yo has a metaphorical, psuedo-autobiographical story that was inspired by the childhood experiences of Minority’s creative director, Vander Caballero.			"

												This was a lovely puzzling platformer game. The artistic style of the magical chalk lines was very enjoyable, not to mention how whimsical the world seemed. Houses might grow legs or wings to do your bidding. You could carry giant frogs like rag dolls and use them as tools (or bait). The story line was very touching, and the characters, although not English-speaking, were easy to grow attached to. The only thing that could have made the game better is perhaps additional content. I finished the game in about 3 hours, and although I felt very satisfied, I would have loved to spend more time in the story.			"

												Not only is this a really fun puzzle platformer, it has a lot of heart and a great atmosphere. The story focuses on a boy and his toy robot that he wears like a jetpack for an extra boost to his jump. The game has pretty simple puzzles usually, but they often require some skill of the mechanics to pull off. The environments are all really beautiful in their own way and it was really interesting to see such a different setting like Brazil for a game like this.The game also deals with a pretty simple, yet well implemented metaphor between the monster in the game and the boy's father. The best part about this narrative is that it explores these themes through gameplay and it's all connected and fits well within the game's design.			"

												I have mixed feelings about Papo & Yo.On the other hand I want to love the game for it's unique feel, but on the other I feel it is lacking on many fronts.At it's best Papo & Yo offers beautiful artwork and sceneries, entertainment and a fun challenge. At it's worst, it is very repetitive, frustrating and even boring. It also hosts a selection of glitches, that aren't that big of a deal, but do leave an unpolished impression.The story had me intrigued at first, but lost me after a while because of it's slow progress. Also, it's really not well carried out tbh. I did however finish the game for I wanted to get to the predictable end. Seeing the credits scroll down on the screen didn't offer the satisfaction I thought it would, other than finally getting the game off my to-do list. It was a bit like finishing a mediocre book.Still, I won't advice to steer clear of the game. If you have the patience and are willing to forgive some annoyances (many that are due to budget) Papo & Yo delivers a different kind of gameplay experience that other game makers should learn from and improve on. It is good to see that more and more people like Vander Caballero (the creative director, who the story is based on) take the effort to get off their high horses at big game studios to go and discover their own path.

												Alcohol abuse can be a sensitive and personal topic and in this game it’s presented in a blatant, realistic and yet tasteful manner. This is due to the game being well designed, possibly due to the creative director’s own experience with an alcoholic father.You never quite know whether Monster is your friend of your enemy. You have this constant sense of unease around him that he might find a poisonous frog and turn on you. But Monster is incredibly useful when he’s not charging you down. I also have to hand it to the composer, Brian D’Oliveira, for creating a light, flamenco soundtrack that ties in well with lightness of Quico’s steps and scenery. The story is well-presented and well-plotted, both visually, aurally and through the gameplay.This praise all being said, the game isn’t without its flaws. Like many platformers, the game has an element of exploration which the designers failed to… explore. There’s plenty of nooks, crannies and hidey holes, but nothing in them. I even managed to find trapped teddy bears in many of them, but they seemed to be nothing more than coincidently-placed scenery. I felt that this beautiful and unique world was just a bit too empty, nothing to encourage me to play again and no reward for getting to these hard to reach places, not quite what I expect from a platformerFor full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2014/04/21/papo-yo/ "

												First off: This game is short. Took me between 3 and 4 hours to complete it. So keep that in mind.Now then, Papo & Yo is a heartwarming, uplifting tale of a child with a violently abusive alcoholic father.There was some sarcasm there, see if you can tell where.It's a puzzle game, and you lead the Monster (the child's father) around to help you solve puzzles in an effort to eventually help him. Problem is, you can't do much to help an angry drunk who doesn't think he needs help.The game mechanics are fairly simple to grasp, although rather neat in execution, as you physically manipulate the slums around you to advance to the next area. If you're looking for a challenging puzzler, this isn't it. It's fairly unique, but not difficult. Nothing stumped me for more than maybe 15 seconds, and there's hints in the game if you do get stuck.And there's little dialogue. They don't hit you over the head with the abusive father thing. You know it's there, and you know it's pretty bad. It isn't preachy about its message, it's just showing you how this child deals with the crap he's going through.All that being said, if you can get Papo & Yo for cheap, it's not a waste of your money. Don't buy it expecting a great puzzle game on par with Portal. That will lead to disappointement. Buy it expecting a bittersweet story told in a simple manner with a few entertaining puzzles along the way. That will lead to a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.			"

												This is just a great game. In my humble opinion, Papo & Yo is as much underrated as Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is overrated. Art, visuals and narrative of this game are inspired and captivating, while the story is depicted with great sensitivity and artistic awareness. A must buy.			"

												Papo & Yo is one of the best games I ever played. It is fun and touching at the same time. The riddles and the enviroment are not just distractions in between cutscenes that transport the story but have actual meaning. I just finised it but I know I will play it again in the same way I will read a good book again.			"

												A mesmerizing approach to a poetic entity that leaves you with a sense of understanding about a character through metaphors.  This story will strike at your heart in a meaningful way, in which it will leave you awed at how well the world and events are put together. Aside from the simplistic puzzles and mishaps where you need to repeat yourself in a game of trial and error in some parts, you begin to establish a relationship with each character without need for many words.The symbolic metaphors, masterful soundtrack pieces, and seeing the dark side of the story will most likely hit you at its prime, the very core of your heart, and jerk a tear right out of your existence.

The puzzles are nice, and the game is joyful to play - there is no blood and gore (mostly), no timed levels or ""deaths"". I really wish the game could be longer, though - I finished it in less than 4 hours, so the ""replayability"" of the game is not so big. But please, BUY THIS GAME.			"

												At first i found the story to not really go anywhere. Yes Quico has some troubles with his father, yes we can see how they show it ingame. So the first 1/3 of the game i found myself asking why i was doing these (very pretty) puzzles. But after that, the game got more interesting. The story showed the connection more clearly towards the gameplay. In the end, the story is not THAT special, but it is very well presented.The gameplay is basically a puzzle platformer. A rather easy one at that. The puzzles requires not much thinking to figure out, so hardcore puzzle addicts won't get their fix with this. But the puzzles where very pretty. I was happy to see a lever so i could see the environments transform. These environment transformation is the biggest half of the puzzles, and also the most impressive to see. The other part is Monster, you have to lure him around to complete puzzles. 2 other small roles are Lulu and Alejandra. Lulu is a little robot you can throw at switches or use to do a doublejump/hover kind of deal. Alejandra is a little girl that taunts you around the gameworld, moving the gameplay/plot forward in some places.The graphics where pretty good, not much to say here. The game looks pretty, runs smooth and no loading screens other then the initial startup one. Might not be the best looking game ever, but there are hardly any complaints other then the glows around objects being pixelated.Another downside is the length, it runs for about 3 hours. Which is long enough, but i found that the story at the end went fast forward. The entire plot/metaphore of the game is revealed in the last 5-10 minutes. While it ain't that bad, it might have been better to get to the point of the story sooner in game so that they could handle the reveal a bit more subtle.All in all, even if it runs short and the plot might not be the next shakespear, the game is still good. I enjoyed the 3 hours it took to finish, the puzzles, simple as they are, are pretty satisfying due to the environment transformations.			"

												Papo & Yo is about as close to a breakthrough where games transcend art/entertainment, and become a catharsis for personal emotions.  This truly feels like the the creator of the game wants you to relive some tragic events that shaped his life, and asks you to participate in a safe and engaging way.  At times, it takes the horrible and makes something beautiful out of it.  A must play.			"

												My god. This game dredged up memories of a time when I had to let go of a best friend of mine because of illegal drug use. It was alcohol specifically, that made me decide. In the moment when he broke into a liquor cabinet and began to get drunk, (while of course being underage.), I was afraid. I let him get drunker and drunker, and when he was stumbling around and falling down, I got in my car, (which had his stuff and the stuff of the people who were with us.) , and I left and drove to his parents house. I deposited everyone's stuff on the front porch and rang the doorbell and told his dad where he was and what he was doing. Afterwords, I never looked back. I haven't seen him in years now, nor do I want to, but I just know, if I saw him again I could become friends again with him easily. But I took the harder route of not forgiving him and simply letting him go. The ending of Papo and Yo was a metaphor for an actual moment in my life, and it was one of , if not THE most, moving ending to a video game I have ever seen. Millage may vary for other people, but at least for me, I felt very moved. It was just like revisiting that moment again, but this time, I was able to let go more easily. This is a game that simply must be played. It is a beautiful piece of art.			"

												Definately in the ""arty"" category, though you probably noticed that if you watched *any* of the production materials. It is short, has several interesting puzzle mechanics that aren't repeated, and is generally a really good 3-5 hours. However, it's SUPER heavy handed. It's quite easy to get the gist of the theme in the opening FMV and you'll definately have it at the second inter-chapter sequence, but it doesn't trust the player at all to come to their own conclusions more or less spelling it out with a chalkboard and pointer.Would have been much better with a dose of subtlety either thoughout the game and then dumping things the way it did at the end as a reveal or vice versa.Get it on sale.

There was always something new and interesting to look at.  The puzzles are ok. I only got stuck in two places for any time at all. Still, it was fun to traverse the landscape of the protagonists imagination. The game is only a few hours long, but the time spent on this journey is all quality. I definitely recommend Papo & Yo.

It's beautiful visuals and it's enjoyable soundtraack also add to the experience significantly. However Papo and Yo is also one of the most tedious games I've played, and although it's a mere three hours long, I still found myself bored with the gameplay. The puzzels in the game are not challenging and the most difficult will simply have you running around for a minute or two until you stumble upon the solution. This makes Papo and Yo extremely difficult to recommend. Buy it on sale if you're interested.			"

												This is an all around stunning game. From the level design, texture quality, and unique animations to sound design to the beautifully crafted narrative of which the game is focused, nothing fails to impress. The gameplay is based around puzzles/platforming in a three-dimensional environment. The gameplay does not present much of a challenge but the controls are solid and intuitive, playing great with gamepad or keyboard/mouse. The music and ambient environmental sounds are immersive and calming, allowing for a stark contrast when the narrative calls for it. The narrative deals with themes of addiction, abuse, and denial through excellent use of imagery and symbolism.Everything fits together amazingly well in this game. It's rare to find a game that so excellently parses mature themes without resorting to mindless violence. I've been playing games for fifteen years, and I can honestly say this is one of the best. I bought it on sale not knowing what to expect and having beaten it, I gladly would have paid many times over the price for such an experience.			"

												The single best game I've ever played in my entire life. Such an immersive storyline and tons of symbolism. Unfortunately, it ends quite sadly but nevertheless, it was an incredible experience. If you have the money, I highly recommend this game to anyone. There are puzzles you need to solve though, so that may not be for everyone I suppose.			"

												Only one word can truly describe Papa & Yo: ""Beautiful"". This gem of a game left me smiling, laughing, even crying at times, as the amazing work done by the Minority team played out before my eyes. Between the cleverly designed puzzles, the stunning artwork and delightfully implemented mechanics, my journey through young Quico's imagination was a joy ride for my inner child. However, this bright and cheerful atmosphere goes hand in hand with a rather heart-wrenching, yet masterfully told story. My only complaint is that I wish the game were a little longer, but that is a minor complaint; this game is well worth both the time and money.			"

												The game isn't too long, or challenging, but it has beautiful audio and visual design. The subject of the game is also something different for a change, something personal and real. It is a great game if you are into something more about expression/narrative/art than challenge. I'd recommend the soundtrack edition, while you're at it.However, there are hidden collectables you can grab during your second playthrough, if you choose to do so.			"

												Uttelry beautiful game.The description does not the do the game any justice and is completely misleading. Quico and the monster are not ""friends"" in the slightest, you are not ""playing"" with the monster, and you don't ""build a friendship"" together. The description makes the game sound like a bright, cheerful, Boy and His blob type game. It's not.Watch the launch trailer to get a better feel for what the game is about.*SPOILERS*I don't want to give too much away, but here's the jist:The game is an intriguing and harsh look at alcoholism, anger, neglect, child abuse, and even murder, through the eyes of an innocent child who, being unable to understand these things, creates a fanciful world they can escape to and make sense of them in their own way.The monster altogether ignores you throughout the experience, try as you might to interact with it, like a neglectful parent. When it's not ignoring you, it's eating or sleeping. It only pays you any attention when you have food, or when it is actively trying to harm you. Yes, it ""helps"" you solve puzzles and progress through the game, but you're not in anyway develping a friendship with the monster.The world is breathtakingly beautiful, with some really innovative and engrossing level design. There's a lot of detail in the mystical favela landscape, and exploring it is equally as enjoyable as the controls are tight and responsive. The game moves very fluidly with excellent pacing and hitting all the right emotional cues. The music is also top notch.Overall, this is a very polished game, and an excellent experience. The whimsical setting and levels juxtapose perfectly with the deeply emotional and dark subject matter. If I had any complaint, it's that the jumping is a little shoddy at times, and since the game has such an emphasis on platforming, that's a bigger deal than it should be. But that doesn't take away from the overall experience.Definitely reccomend it to anyone who likes to play games with a good story, a lot of emotion, and a lot of layers. The fact that the controls are great and the graphics are fantastic is merely icing on this bittersweet yet delectable cake.9/10			"

												Yes, its another one of those artsy Indie titles but this one comes frighteningly close to achieving its vision. The games plot is simple but engaging: the main character is a little boy on a quest to cure his companion, a giant pink ""monster"" who is friendly, helpful, even nurturing and fun-loving at times but becomes violent, angry and...abusive upon consuming a frog. The whole setup actually is one huge metaphor for the story of the Creative Director's father and his alcoholism problem. With its surreal and colorful art style and its uplifting music, the game creates a facade of juvenile fun, but if the metaphor is to be taken seriously, the entire ending act of the boy's 'quest' might well be the most disturbing thing ever put into such a deceptively jovial piece of work. The only blemish on this game's artistic vision are the collectible hats, unlocked only on a second playthrough. But the simple but elegant puzzles and the great story closure make it such that a second playthrough can only cheapen the experience. Ironic, given that the collectibles were there to increase its value-for-money given its high pice tag and short playtime.			"

												Idea molto buona, gioco non impegnativo, risente un po' della vetustà del motore grafico (Unreal Engine 3) che però visivamente rende ancora molto bene. Peccato per la longevità, circa 3 ore per completarlo, ma tutto sommato un gioco diverso dal solito che richiama vecchi platform arricchiti però dalla fantasia dei programmatori. Se lo avessero sviluppato più a lungo sarebbe potuto diventare un titolo da voti molto alti. In ogni caso va premiata l'idea, il lavoro di un team indie e la fotografia con un bel 7,5 su 10. Certamente una tematica diversa dal solito e che lascia spazio a riflessioni personali.			"

												Not perfect but a game that should be played. Papo & Yo is about a boy with an abusive father who escapes into a fantasy world where he needs the help of a brutish monster named Papo to help you slove platforming puzzles.This game is very pretty.  bright, colorful, and atmospheric.  The tone and art style gradually changes as the story progresses and grows darker.  Most of the game involves using Papo to help you get around by lifting obsticals or tossing you to high ledges and then you need to manipulate the enviroment so Papo can follow.  There are also slugs that Papo really loves but cause him to go into a rage and attack anything near him including you.  Sometimes you need to keep him away from the slugs sometimes you need to let him eat them so you can solve a puzzle.  It's hear were your relationship with the monster begins to mirror your relationship with your abusive father.  The game does have some flaws.  its not the longest game, sometimes the physics are a little wonky and there could be a bit more variety in the game play but its not enough to be a deal brekerThis is a fairly simple puzzle platformer with appealing visuals and does a good job of letting the narrative and charm bleed into the gameplay.  It also explores a topic not offten tackled in video games.			"

												I got this game a long time ago with an Humble Bundle, and finally got around to play it.I'm really really glad that I did. I loved this game, its astounding ambientation, its nice puzzle nature.Let's try to be objective and methodic:-Story: 7/10 The story isn't that great, but it's a break from classic puzzles, it's entertaining enough, and the end packs a punch.-Longevity/Replay value: 4/10 This is the worst part: it takes 3/4 hours to finish it, and once you finish it for the first time, there is really nothing compellingyou to play it again.-Difficulty: 6/10 Pretty much all the puzzles are very straightforward and easy to solve, with the hint box it's even easier. Both on the mental side and the skill required to put it in practice. Failing has no real consequences, as you never really ""die"" and the worst case scenario is losing a few seconds to respawn, but in the game everything stays as it was, so you don't even have to restart the level. This can be a pro (no frustration) or a con (shorter longevity).-Aesthetic: 10/10 This is the strongest point of the game. The ambientation, some kind of favelas, and the effect that solving the puzzle has on it is simply amazing. It has something mystical mixed with some kind of visual poetry. I greatly enjoyed it. Also kudos to the creators for the cure put into every little detail. Just lovely.-Concept: 9/10 Puzzles that change the conformation of the ambient surrounding you are not really so new, but not that common either.Plus, the implementation is brilliant.-Controls: 7/10 Pretty straightforward. Usual wasd + mouse, third person. The cam is usually fine, in some rare occasion can move awkwardly. But those occasions are very rare, and failing has no big consequences (see ""Difficulty"")-OST: 8/10 The soundtrack is not, strictly speaking, memorable. But it always fit the game, is easy to the ears, nice, and really helps feeling part of the game.AVG: 7.3It's worth the 11€? I'm not sure. But I'm also pretty stingy.What I can say for sure is that it's worth adding to the wishlist and get on a sale.			"

												Well papo & yo is a really beautiful game that tell a good story. I recoment  people to play it because of the story but it have no replayable value. well lets talks about the story a little. Well the story is okay not great but like my friends say to me every day ""you are missing a heart"" so i find the game decent, story wise. the graphics and places in the game are really good and reprecent what most of the poor houses of south america look like. i used to live near a place like that and i used to hand out with people with that kind of problems. so they used to stay in my house most of the time. so i like the building and houses of the game but the only thing i did not like about the eviroment  was the white shinning stuff in the buildings and houses. so i will recommend it if you are playing for the story.

												Can games help us process psychological traumas? Or help us understand them in others? This unconventional game tries exactly that.In Papo & Yo you play a little boy named Quico that finds his way through a dreamlike Favela, following a mysterious girl. The environment offers creative puzzles that emphasizes whats possible in the fantasy of a kid. But this fantasy is not only that, it is also a metaphor. After befriending a monster that loves to eat frogs but starts raging everytime it does you realize that not all is well in Quicos fantasy world, and even less so in his real world.Without hitting you in the face with it Papo & Yo not only tells you, but lets you experience how traumatising domestic violence can be for a child and how it tries to cope with it. It handles the subject very delicately and at the same time offers great and challenging gameplay.The shortness of it is not a weak point as it gets the point across with good pacing. It also features good art and music - Another example of how interactive media can offer mature experiences without clichés or over the top violence.			"

												Exquisitely beautiful and deeply nuanced, Papo & Yo asks of its audience that they enter into a relationship with a monster, one that they're almost sure to regret.I heard of Papo & Yo by chance, from a friend. It's a small game -- with only about 3-4 hours of gameplay -- from the even smaller Minority development team, based in Montreal. With an August 2012 release date, it's also relatively old by game standard; I bought it back in June on a whim, torn between rave reviews by people I knew and a few spectacularly bad ones by games journalists (although, if IGN still counts as games journalism by the time anyone's reading this, I will be well and truly shocked). I didn't touch it at all until very recently. But Papo & Yo lives up to cult hype. Although relatively simple -- possibly too simple for anyone who doesn't struggle with puzzles and platformers the way I do -- the game's breathtaking environments, incredible soundtrack, charming cast and biting narrative are more than enough to compensate even the most ""hardcore"" of gamers. If you feel mocked by the quotation marks I put around that word, please feel free to send me one (1) mug of your tears, and possibly a signed Polaroid of you crying next to today's paper so I know that your pain is real, and that my general disdain for the ""gamer elite"" has found its intended target. Papo & Yo's lead protagonist -- Quico -- is a young boy buried in the depths of his own imagination, struggling to cope with the trauma of life with his alcoholic, abusive father. Based on the childhood experiences of creator Vander Caballero, Quico retreats from his father's abuse into a dreamlike version of (what is ostensibly) his own neighborhood. In Quico's mind, his Brazilian favela becomes a magical place where buildings can sprout wings and legs, and Quico himself can run across the rooftops and jump between them with ease, accompanied by his toy robot, Lula. At first, Quico's dreamy paradise is a perfect escape; puzzles are quick and fun, and interacting with the world is a beautiful, uplifting experience. But it isn't long before the Monster that rules Quico's conscious life follows him into his subconscious one, and begins to color the once-tranquil world of Quico's imagination with violence and fear.Truthfully, it's impossible to talk about this game without talking about the nature of abuse. The narrative is squarely pointed at it and as an abuse simulator, Papo & Yo is unnervingly effective. Having been in several emotionally abusive relationships myself, I saw my experiences mirrored onscreen. Monster is visually intimidating, but -- when calm -- actually takes on a strangely charming demeanor. He seems nice; a little gruff and bumbling but protective, scooping Quico out of danger when he gets in over his head, blinking up at you when you crawl on his belly, and even throwing a soccer ball back and forth with you. He's dumb and single-minded, but sweet, for the most part. But when Monster's temper flares -- when he comes into contact with anything that alters his mood -- he becomes a terrifying hellion, and anything in his way falls victim to his rage. When Monster gets angry, almost nothing can dissuade him from hurting you... and he WANTS to get angry. He pursues the thing that drives him into that fury more doggedly than he pursues anything else. Soon you're not just trying to avoid letting Monster get angry, you're bracing yourself for the inevitable. 'When will he get mad next?' you start to wonder. You become more vigilant -- both of Monster's behavior and your own -- because it isn't a matter of if something will set Monster off again, but a matter of when.At a certain point, Monster's temper isn't just something you fear; it's a fact of life. You have to be aware of him at all times, and you can never leave him to his own devices for too long. It becomes tedious managing him all the time. Monster hurts you when he's angry; he hurts people you like, and destroys things you care about. You can't get rid of him, but he's becoming something you can no longer bear to live with. There's something to be said for the way Papo & Yo brings you through this cycle: from meeting the person to meeting their insurmountable problem; to taking that problem on as your own and being weighed down and exhausted by it; to beginning to fear and loathe the person for all the harm their problem is doing to you; to eventually wanting that person gone more than you feel obligated to them. I've lived that cycle several times, and being brought through it again by the game felt organic and real. For this exact reason, I can't bear to play through this game a second time; there's a few achievements that can only be earned on a second playthrough, and due to the realness of what I experienced, I don't anticipate ever going back for them.The narrative is clearly where this game sings; gameplay is where it often sighs. There were a few key moments where I felt railroaded into interacting with Monster and his anger. I personally liked how incredibly forgiving the gameplay was -- to my knowledge there are no failure/death states -- but jokes aside, I do understand why some players have found it less than engaging in the past. Puzzles are relatively easy to solve and sometimes a little tedious as a result. Platforming in 3D is, as always, a little clunky, especially when jumping between platforms. Gameplay is very obviously second fiddle to the story Papo & Yo strives to tell, and although the mechanics in interactions with Monster feel very cohesive and in service of the narrative, most of the platforming segments do not.But, despite being less narratively resonant than desired, overall I found the platforming segments pretty fun. Part of this is that the platforming enhances my understanding of Quico as a child -- it's generally playful and inventive, combining both common, visible objects and imaginary, fanciful ones, something which is relatively common among children Quico's age. The world becomes his playground, even in moments of great peril at the hands of Monster; there's an emphasis both in gameplay and in narrative that Quico isn't mentally, physically, or emotionally equipped to cope with or retalliate against his father's abuse. His only choice is to make up a story where he can survive it more easily. It also drives home what I think is a very important point: abuse follows abuse survivors everywhere they go. Abuse affects you so deeply, that Quico's incapable of even imagining a world without it.Ultimately, I think the mechanical/narrative discordance in Papo & Yo is minimal. It might be more noticeable if the game was longer, but if you sit down and marathon it in a single day (which is completely doable), I doubt you'll think twice about it. Papo & Yo is a bold, powerful game, and has a lot of incredibly important things to say -- I recommend playing it immediately.			"

												This is a nice puzzle game (with some frustrating puzzles) coupled with a really interesting story. The gameplay is as any standard puzzle game and the design is really good. I advice playing this game especially for the story.			"

												A truly wonderful experience.The game plays out like a puzzle/platformer with fairly simple game mechanics and challanges, but the story is told beautifully and the surreal environment ties the whole game together.It's pretty short, only lasting about 3-4 hours on the first playthrough but it is a joy to play and anybody who has had someone close to them with a history of substance abuse can relate to the story.I believe it's worth full price if you're into games that rely on their story like Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons, and it's definitely worth picking up when it's on sale for everyone else.

												It will make you feel.  This interactive media makes you look at pain and love.  Specifically the pain caused by an evil drunken father and the confusing love felt by a son.  You feel along with the son.  The son loves his sister and she is also in pain.  The confusion of having a father,  who's rage must be managed and avoided and who will has fun playing and laughing with you, is a discovery.  It is emotional to the point that I felt like avoiding it and then it was so fascinatingly truthful in its depth that I could not disengage.  I know more than I did before I experienced this.  I think that was the goal of the man who made it and I know he was sucessful in teaching and sharing somthing from his life.  I was sad and angry durring this experience.  I guess that is the key feature of this game.   It has fastinating visuals and surreal, reality bending puzzles but at its core this is about sharing feelings.  Thank you Papo & Yo.			"

												I don't usually present 100% positive reviews, but when I do... this is what they look like. Papo & Yo is, without a doubt, one of the best games I have played in a long time. It's beautiful, it's moving, it's elegantly made. Just difficult enough to be challenging, but not difficult enough to take away from the essential quality of the game -- which is the story itself.I do feel that it deserves a trigger warning -- if you trigger on child abuse, this game needs to be approached with caution. But it is so very, very worth it.			"

												Papa & Yo is a tale of a boy and his Big peach-coloured-monster that in a less than subtle way is a metaphor for an alcoholic parental figure. The monster likes bright orange coconuts and can be manipulated to go and stand at places that makes bright white magic happen. What's appealing about this experience is how this dream world is portrayed, and less so in how it functions.The box city is vivid and playfully represented; cardboard boxes being picked up will make houses fly and move about to be placed in strategic places for our avatar to step on in order to progress.Some houses will grow legs and move like cockroaches, others grow wings and fly.I find these houses and what they mean to the main character more appealing than what the game tries to make me feel for the monster.The monster is nothing but a tool for the main character to use in order to trigger bright white magic so that you can progress. I don't feel for the monster, and also with all this creative freedom that the kid has, why doesn't he make his way through without the monster? It means nothing to me as a player, there is no love.The monster might just have been a ball and a chain locked to the kids foot.And then when the frogs enter the picture, making the monster go inte a fiery rage when he consumes them, the monster's tediousness just increases making me like it less.And liking it less would be fine if there just were some moment before that that established some kind of positive connection, but that never happens. It would serve whatever narrative the game is trying to convey better if the monster was simply always there, following and being present without forcing me as a player to make it go places all the time. But instead the game is tediously forcing the player to go through puzzles that after repetition loses what the game is trying to say about the relationship this kid has with the monster, the world, the girl, the robot and cardboard houses.The movement felt when moving the character about is fluent and loose but comes to a chunky halt when the game demands you to yet again turn arbitrary levers in order to progress.Or to make the monster do more stuff for you. Again.I did enjoy what I played for the most part, with a little more thought put into what the puzzles could mean set to the context of what this boy is going through, it could've succeeded in saying something.'Papa & Yo' has heart and genuinely cares, but needs more thought on how to make the theme of the game correlate with the player's choices.

												A gorgeous and interesting 3D puzzle platformer with a subtle story which is told through the gameplay. Papo & Yo offers up a great looking, fun game with a depth of story substance which never once interrupts the great gameplay. The game treats the player with enough respect to draw their own conclusions and is never overt or crude in its approach. It's a hands-off story which compliments the gameplay, and it's wrapped up in a gorgeous world with good mechanics.HighlightsThe best parts of Papo & Yo come from it's strong commitment to the story in the form of real elements rather than text or purely cutscenes. Everything is focused around that, and at times gameplay choices have been limited or altered to compliment the subject, and vice versa. There's one puzzle, for example, where your goal is to move the Monster to a new position while he's sleeping on a wooden centipede. After figuring out the mechanics of the puzzle and moving him into position, he catches a frog which results in your progress being reset and having to start again. In any other game this would be frustrating and forced, but here it's a subtle allegory of trying again and finding an alternative approach after you fail in the name of progress. Even things like the music of each puzzle serve to compliment the spirit of the story.If you remove the story though, Papo & Yo is still a very good 3D puzzle platformer on its own, and just playing through it without thinking about the content matter is pleasant fun.* The art style and set design is another compelling reason to play this title, the streets and buildings have a strong South African/Brazilian look and feel, and add to the fantasy* Puzzle design occasionally feels wobbly, but for the most part is unique, interesting and wonderfully different to the approach most other games would takeMistakesThere are no real gameplay problems to speak of in Papo & Yo, and everything is done pretty well. However, there are some minor annoyances and technical problems that will jar the experience for some, but overall wont really take away from the experience as a whole.* Movement and controls are a little less responsive than I'd like, and it's common to fall off a ledge or have to repeat a step a few times to get something right* Due to the unique design and style of some puzzles, it's sometimes unclear what the game wants of the player next, despite the useful help system* For some, the story is too obvious and the flashbacks give too much away at the start of the game for the ending to have any impactRecommendationsPriced at £10.99/12.99€/$14.99 at the time of review, Papo & Yo doesn't feel overpriced, but is very short, with just 4-6 hours play time. It routinely goes on sale for -75% or less, and waiting for a sale to get the most value out of this one is a good idea.There's an achievement for playing through the game without using any of the hint boxes, and another for collecting all the hats in the game which only becomes available after completing the game once. These two achievements make playing through the game again some time in the future more compelling

												This is one of the best games ever made and one of the most mature. It is just great. Even without the story it would be a good game for the way it plays with the environment but the story and the use to gameplay to evoke specific emotions that interplay with the storyline. The whole feel of the damn thing.... it is brilliant. It is a masterpeice that shows just what games are capable of as an artistic medium.			"

												Today I played through Papo & Yo (Minority Media Inc.﻿), an action adventure (mostly 3D puzzle platforming) about a young boy who escapes the abuse of his alcoholic father into a surrealistic Latin American–esque slum, where he embarks on a quest to cure ""Monster"" of its addiction to poisonous frogs. The monster (a very clearly indicated metaphor for the protagonist's father) is both a helpful aid it surmounting obstacles and progressing through the game's environment, but also the game's only true ""enemy"" (when under the influence of frogs), who becomes not only a danger to others, but also the protagonist himself, who in the end discovers that there is no cure for ""Monster"". So, it's basically a journey of acceptance and letting go.An enjoyable game—not very difficult, but the environments and puzzles were interesting and non–repetitive. There were occasional glitches and I had to replay one section when Monster got stuck on the environment and blocked progress, but nothing game–breaking. Notable is that the character you play as is non–White and non–Western (although there is no explicit nationality or ethnicity), and also non–English speaking (but not Spanish or Portuguese, either—some sort of constructed or conglomerate language is used in the game's limited dialog). Sad that playing as something other then a White male American is ""notable"", but that's how it is…			"

												The graphics aren't groundbreaking (although they are beautiful) and there are some collision issues and places I got my character (physically) stuck. That being said, the story this game tells is heart wrenching! You start off chasing a mysterious girl who can seemingly create doors and portals out of thin air. To chase her, you complete some easy puzzles with your robot friend (who hangs on your back and assists you in opening areas that you can't reach). Shortly after, you meet a large pink monster who helps you out in completing some more puzzles. That's when you start getting glimpses of places and things (in what seems like another universe), and you realise that everything you do just might be a metaphor for something that has happened to you. You can manipulate the world and it's objects by moving gears and cranks that are shining with an other-worldly glow. A few times my mind went ""whaaaa?"", but I still had lots of fun. The music was beautifully composed, and near the very end, it was bringing out so many emotions as the music (and story) unraveled. Even though it was only about 3-3.5 hours to play through, I think it was the perfect length to tell the story it needed to tell.			"

												Papo & Yo is short, but powerful; powerful enough that I couldn't write a review immediately after playing it, because it was all still a little too intense.I picked this game up as part of a Humble Bundle, knowing absolutely nothing about it, and installed it when I was in the mood for a bit of indie whimsy.  So it came as a bit of a shock when the opening animation sequence  made it clear that child abuse was going to be a prominent theme of the game -- I had been expecting cheery, light-hearted fluff, and this was looking instead like a terrible downer.  Within a few minutes, however, the setting and gameplay had drawn me in so much that I played all the way through in one sitting, even though I knew the game was writing me a ticket on the feels train.The setting is an appealingly surrealist dreamscape rendition of a South American favela, blending fanciful magic with rusty corrugated iron sheets.  The frequent puzzles are inventive and fun, if not particularly challenging.  But the puzzles aren't the true star of this game; story is the shining star here.   Monster, your companion through most of the game, is a very thinly veiled portrayal of an abusive alcoholic father, and what the game does brilliantly is lead you into the mindset of a victim.  You'll love Monster, fear him, hate him, resent him and even pity him, often at the same time.  You'll find yourself doing ugly, violent things without even thinking about it, because you desperately need to avoid triggering Monster's rage.  You'll make excuses for Monster; you'll blame other things; you'll blame yourself.  You'll allow yourself to believe that you're in control -- that if you just play the game well enough, you can keep Monster content and placid indefinitely.  And, inevitably, it will all come crashing down on you.The majority of ""game as art"" projects I've seen have been gross, pretentious failures that abandon concepts of gameplay in favour of marching the player on a directed tour through the creator's personal vision, and the interactivity of the experience is reduced to token actions in what is otherwise a sort of animated film or ebook.  Papo & Yo is a high-art game that gets it right; there's a real game here, and it's the gameplay makes it immersive.  Once you've been drawn in through the puzzle game elements, and you really care about the characters and what happens to them, the harsh, wrenching story elements become that much more powerful.Having such mature themes, this game is admittedly not for everyone, but, as far as I'm concerned, it's a masterpiece.

The story part is just okay but the setting, visual(art), musics and sounds are wonderful. At the beginning, there are new gameplay element introduced regularly and the level design is great but you can see they begin to run out of ideas near the end. The game is quite short and can be finished in one or two sittings.  If you can get it in sale, don't miss this interesting interactive art.			"

												If you want your heart strings pulled, play this game until the end. Wow.Papo & Yo is based on the monsters that live within. It's a sad reality that is shown in the fantasy world of a little boy named Quico, who escapes the troubled life of his alcoholic father. Quico gets help along the way from his little robot Lula and a girl named Alejandra who is quite mischievous at times. Monster, who Quico thinks is his best friend, can either help, or hinder his progression, depending on if he consumes any frogs. The game play is pretty straightforward but offers beautiful visuals, especially in its art. I wish this game was a bit longer, however it is definitely worth a play if you are into visuals and a solid story that will evoke emotion.			"

												This is a complicated review to write lots of good and a bit of bad. TL;Dr: dont expect a lot of replay value out of this one but if your are looking for a stylish platformer/puzzler it's worth the buy.the good:-great story with a very personal feel-nice enviroments with great cohesion -fairly well programmed controls and camera follow-over all unique and quite creative -attention to detail and a well thought out surreal themethe bad:-quite short could easily be wrapped in one sitting-some of the puzzle mechanics get a bit tired by the end-not a lot of replay value here (which is made more apparent by the 3 hour playtime)-the character move speed could have been a bit faster and the jumps feel a bit clunky at times.-the story gets to be a bit too on the nose by the time it wraps up, but it certainly does clarify things for those that missed it.It's really hard to rate this title over all, as a game by way of mechanics and difficulty its a 5/10 - but combined with the story and over all feel it's easly an 8 if not 9/10.

It's a basic puzzle/platformer; it isn't too difficult skill-wise, nor will you likely get stumped by any of the puzzle elements. Mechanically it's actually a very easy game - even taking my time and messing up a bit here and there, I still finished it in less than 4 hours. Despite that, it was one of the most difficult games for me to complete on an emotional level.I really relate to the main character, Quico. What this game lacks in mechanical complexity it completely makes up for in emotional intensity and engagement. It will hit you right in the feels, over and over. It's not hard to tell that this was a very personal subject for the game's main creator, and I think he and the creative team tackled it very well. They have my utmost gratitude for making this game. Honestly, if anyone ever asks me about my relationship with my stepfather, rather than explain it to them with words I could just have them play this game. It definitely goes onto my favorites list, and although I can't say it's one I'll play again anytime soon, I'm very much grateful for the experience it brought me.			"

												At first I was like, hmmm not bad for an indie game, but as the game progressed, I fell in love.The puzzles are moderate in difficulty but extremely entertaining and unique. The way in which you progress through the levels is like no other game you have played.Quite touching at the end.5 STARS! "

												Sure, the story is okay (not really though...) but any game that is this simple/short AND required a consulting company to finish, will tell you that this probably should never have been made...  On top of that, they chose to market it by making you feel sorry for this ""poor boy with an abusive alcoholic father""...  Big whoop, do you know who also has an abusive parent?... ISAAC IN THE BINDING OF ISAAC!  A waaaaaaayyy better game, where his mother is actually trying to kill him!    Moral of the story: don't spend $15 on this crap like I did. Complete waste of time/money...			"

												I managed to beat it in around 3-4 hours.But it was a well-enjoyed 3-4 hours. Like a lot of indie games, it's meant to be experienced more than anything. But it's not really something that tries too hard to be overly deep and the symbolism is made pretty clear by the end. In fact, the second trailer pretty much spells it out for you before you play. The game draws inspiration from the creator's real life experiences with an alcoholic father. It's good, but you may want to take a pass if themes like alcholism and abuse are overwhelming to you.I'd rather not give away the ending, so I'll just say that if you want to see it, you'll have to play for yourself. I personally think it would be worth the $15, although I got it on sale. But since not everyone might agree with me, I'd say just get it on the next sale if you're not 100% sure. You might not feel like you're getting much out of it as a game. It's short and pretty simple. But as an experience, I'd recommend it.			"

												I'd like to put an asterisk on my recommendation. It is a good game, in my opinion worth buying and playing, and I enjoyed every moment of it.However, here's the caveat: it's not a challenging game. It's very much Railroading: the game, with a few obstacles to get you more invested in it (still better than ""Dear Esther""). To me, that's not a problem, because the game's atmosphere, music and visuals are excellently designed, and the brazilian voices (I'm assuming it's brazilian) are a delight to listen to. For some however, this might be a problem. If you need a proper challenge to enjoy a game, this is definitely not for you. As mentioned, the puzzles are simple; just find the next switch to open the path to the next setpiece. A few puzzles require a bit of fiddling to solve, in particular a basketball court that took me a few reloads to get back on track, but it didn't make me use my head as a scratching post.It's a short game; as you can see from my play counter, it was completed in less than 4 hours. It's short, but sweet, and I'd argue that's its selling point; it doesn't drag out the overarching theme about substance abuse ad infinitum, and while the ending didn't grab me, that's not a fault of the game. It's nice to see such work put into telling the message of substance abuse seen through the eyes of a young boy, as it is quite a serious problem in the world today, and the game is just beautiful, as I've already said. Buy it for the experience, not for the challenge.			"

												FANTASTIC game! While the game time is relatively short (under 5 hours), it is a game you cannot help but stop and look, listen, and feel your surroundings. You can instantly tell in many parts of the game, just how personal and deep this ""game"" meant to the developer, a game that truly has heart. +story+characters+delivery+graphics (ok with Unreal engine)+presentation-a few glitches in humble bundle Linux version (monster's head would invert at times as if he was looking back)-length (but the story was perfect, so this is a hard one to say neg or pos).

												A nice game full of some wonderful imaginations. Remind me a little bit about the great adventure game ICO in playstation 2. The story part is just okay but the setting, visual(art), musics and sounds are wonderful. At the beginning, there are new gameplay element introduced regularly and the level design is great but you can see they begin to run out of ideas near the end. The game is quite short and can be finished in one or two sittings.  If you can get it in sale, don't miss this interesting interactive art.			"

												If you want your heart strings pulled, play this game until the end. Wow.Papo & Yo is based on the monsters that live within. It's a sad reality that is shown in the fantasy world of a little boy named Quico, who escapes the troubled life of his alcoholic father. Quico gets help along the way from his little robot Lula and a girl named Alejandra who is quite mischievous at times. Monster, who Quico thinks is his best friend, can either help, or hinder his progression, depending on if he consumes any frogs. The game play is pretty straightforward but offers beautiful visuals, especially in its art. I wish this game was a bit longer, however it is definitely worth a play if you are into visuals and a solid story that will evoke emotion.			"

The story in the game explores a metaphor about who and what real monsters actually are and brings this to a satisfying and quite emotive end that doesn't disappoint. The only detraction is that there is no real replayability but what there is definitely worth the time and money investment.			"

												Everyone go play this now. I could end this right there, and it would accurately express my feelings.I've been somewhat disappointed by a few games I'd been looking forward to recently, so it was nice to go into this hoping to not be let down again and then be totally blown away instead. Aside from some very minor polish issues and one puzzle that I got (literally) stuck on and had to do a minor sequence break to get through, I'm having a hard time coming up with anything I didn't really, really like about it.The gameplay/puzzles are mostly pretty straightforward and simple, but they're satisfying enough and serve the storytelling well. Speaking of which, there are some very good moments sometimes where what you're doing in terms of gameplay and what's happening with the story complement each other quite well, which would really stand to be done more often in games.And speaking of the story, while it does deal with some very serious things, it manages to do it with sensitivitiy but without being constantly grim or depressing in tone. The use of a child's point of view/imagination and such wonderful art and music let a game talk about alcoholism and abuse through (fairly transparent) metaphor and still be enjoyable and relatable, rather than completely horrifying like it could've been.

												My god. This game dredged up memories of a time when I had to let go of a best friend of mine because of illegal drug use. It was alcohol specifically, that made me decide. In the moment when he broke into a liquor cabinet and began to get drunk, (while of course being underage.), I was afraid. I let him get drunker and drunker, and when he was stumbling around and falling down, I got in my car, (which had his stuff and the stuff of the people who were with us.) , and I left and drove to his parents house. I deposited everyone's stuff on the front porch and rang the doorbell and told his dad where he was and what he was doing. Afterwords, I never looked back. I haven't seen him in years now, nor do I want to, but I just know, if I saw him again I could become friends again with him easily. But I took the harder route of not forgiving him and simply letting him go. The ending of Papo and Yo was a metaphor for an actual moment in my life, and it was one of , if not THE most, moving ending to a video game I have ever seen. Millage may vary for other people, but at least for me, I felt very moved. It was just like revisiting that moment again, but this time, I was able to let go more easily. This is a game that simply must be played. It is a beautiful piece of art.			"

												Buy? Maybe.Long story short, Papo & Yo is another one of those obtuse and vague story telling indie games that will appear pretentious and confusing to many gamers or groundbreaking and wonderful for others. While I largely enjoyed the games easy, but not handholding puzzles and ""Mystical chalk"" in a Central/South American favela art style, I ended up mostly confused and not very satisfied with the ending. The ending was abrupt, and like the entirty of the storystelling, all based on metaphors. Papo & Yo is a game built more for the types that enjoyed Dear Esther (ugh) and Thomas Was Alone (A pretty nice game actually) and a bit less for those that enjoyed Portal 2 or Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom - the puzzles are nice, but hardly brain-teasing or super innovative. I will say that seeing how the world forms and deforms through puzzles solving is really interesting and neat, but like any pretentious indie game, it is never explained how or why parts of buildings can suddenly sprout legs to walk or wings to fly, or why entire towns can be split and connected like a jigsaw puzzle: You're just supposed to ""understand"" some nebulous meaning and interpret what is going on, like guessing ""This is the kid's imagination or how he understand the world works because he is just a kid"" or something like that. While it is also clear that this is supposed to be a story about a child and an unclear relationship to his father manifested in a frog eating monster representing an alcohol abusing father, the exposition is all metaphorical and based on the developer's artistic vision, It's less understandable like a good Pixar short or the ""Kiwi!"" film where you understand the actions and emotions.If you need further proof of what I'm talking about, see the discussion thread about ""What does it all mean?!"" between players and developers, where the dev doesn't answer the question and instead thanks the players for debating what is going on: http://steamcommunity.com/app/227080/discussions/0/828936718797549690/Papo & Yo gets on my good side for being a short, easy to finish game with a good art style, world design and an overall solid game (fits my Ultra-wide monitor resolution and I had no glitches besides a few graphical glitches early in the game). It gets on my bad side for being another ""Guess at what story I'm trying to tell you instead of me actually telling you"" arty/farty indie game. The story may strike a cord with other gamers who have experiened child abuse from their parents. This is something playable for children as well, but I doubt they would understand all the real world paralells the game is trying to make, Papo & Yo is essentially an adults game.			"

												A barely disguised allegory, the game is occasionally overbearing in its message.  The puzzling and platforming is usually just this side of tedious.  Nevertheless I love this game as it's a perfect example of the interactive form being the correct choice for telling a particular story.  Fear, frustration, and the magical beliefs of a child thinking he can change what is through the few options available to him make for a near seamless intertwining of feeling, meaning, and gameplay.  There were times when I refused to do what the game asked of me; other times it gave me chills as I tried to process how I felt about what was happening.  The art and music are glorious.  Well worth the 3 hours it will take to play to completion.			"

This story will strike at your heart in a meaningful way, in which it will leave you awed at how well the world and events are put together. Aside from the simplistic puzzles and mishaps where you need to repeat yourself in a game of trial and error in some parts, you begin to establish a relationship with each character without need for many words.The symbolic metaphors, masterful soundtrack pieces, and seeing the dark side of the story will most likely hit you at its prime, the very core of your heart, and jerk a tear right out of your existence.

												I wasn't expecting much from Papo & Yo but ws very pleasantly surprised.Papo & Yo tells a very sad (and very real) story through a compelling narrative and clever gameplay. While it may seem to be a game for children, it's mature subject matter means some parental guidance would be advisable before letting them play.While the story may not be for kids, the visuals, audio and gameplay certainly are. The environments are more less variations of the same favela theme but some certainly do stick out as particularly pretty. The audio is great and befits the environment. The soundtrack especially is outstanding; a beautiful selection of Latin American instrumentals.The gameplay is a mixed bag. The puzzles while simple are fun to solve thanks to some unique mechanics and smart level design. The only gripe I have is with the lack of an auto follow camera forcing the player to control the camera manually all the time. The game is short but fulfilling nonetheless.Papo & Yo is a fantastic little game masking a touching story of some real world issues. It is well worth a play through, if only to experience the story, mechanics and level design.			"

												An engrossing emotional story set in a platform puzzler. I really enjoyed the blend of story and gameplay. Yes the game has a very obvious point about dealing with alcoholism and its effects on families, but that drives the story and the relationships between the characters quite well. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who wants to try something a little different and something extremely engrossing. I was so engrossed i completed the game in one sitting, which is about 3.5 hours if you take your time			"

												Wow, this game is so interesting, and i like it's mysterious content. The Graphics are gorgeous and beautiful. Controlling your main character may feel like it's too small, (well, because you are a little kid) but it feels nice. The story of this game is quite not bad at all, but there is a small lack in it, the whole gameplay was too short. Anyway, i'd recomend this game for cool adventure seekers.			"

												Not much of a puzzle game but it is definately a good platformer. It has a lovely story and great visuals. The game mechincs are unique in the way they modify the environment. It is scripted most of the time but there are a few dynamic puzzles that were satisfying. The game can be completed in around 3 hours so I would recommend getting it on a sale.			"

												This is an amazing experience, but a sub-par game. The story hits all the right points, the music is always spot-on, and the platforming feels very nice. However, the puzzles aren't very challenging. At all. A kindergartener could figure them out. There are no invisible walls, which is good, but also leads to getting out of the map easily. Never to a point of breaking the game, it just feels awkward, if anything. I suggest this game completely. The good far outweighs the bad, and the bad is just nitpicking, honestly. Get this game. It will leave you feeling hollow and you'll love it.			"

												There's not too much I can say about this game without spoiling the plot and diminishing its emotional impact, but here's what I will say.This game is relatively simple, as far as mechanics go. It's a basic puzzle/platformer; it isn't too difficult skill-wise, nor will you likely get stumped by any of the puzzle elements. Mechanically it's actually a very easy game - even taking my time and messing up a bit here and there, I still finished it in less than 4 hours. Despite that, it was one of the most difficult games for me to complete on an emotional level.I really relate to the main character, Quico. What this game lacks in mechanical complexity it completely makes up for in emotional intensity and engagement. It will hit you right in the feels, over and over. It's not hard to tell that this was a very personal subject for the game's main creator, and I think he and the creative team tackled it very well. They have my utmost gratitude for making this game. Honestly, if anyone ever asks me about my relationship with my stepfather, rather than explain it to them with words I could just have them play this game. It definitely goes onto my favorites list, and although I can't say it's one I'll play again anytime soon, I'm very much grateful for the experience it brought me.			"

Papo & Yo also excels in gameplay - lots of exploration, platforming and puzzles in a surreal ghetto, where the chalkboard drawings of children magically come to life. Also, it's an indie game that tries and almost succeeds at having a triple A quality and polish. One of the best games that came out this year.			"

												Truly a fantastic adventure game! Papo & Yo will not only present you with interesting puzzles and fun gameplay, but also challenge you to look inward to the demons we all battle throughout life (and more importantly the places we go to escape them).This is a game about a boy named Quico and his seemingly magical action figure Lula, as well as a giant - and normally docile - beast named Monster. As Quico, you will explore various facets of the dream-like favela he escapes to, where the laws of reality itself bend to the whim of one little boy.The core gameplay focuses on solving environmental puzzles, many of which involve magic chalk-like drawings on the walls and floors of buildings that let you manipulate this strange and beautiful world in a variety of different ways. There is also some light platforming and some interesting mechanics which involve Lula, who straddles your backside like a knapsack and acts as a sort of jetpack that can also carry out some basic commands (such as flipping switches for you at a distance). Monster will also play a big part (no pun intended) in solving a lot of said puzzles and offers his own unique mechanics; when he is asleep his massive gut can be used as a trampoline of sorts and of course that brute strength of his also comes in handy! You have to be careful, however, as Monster also has an unhealthy addiction to poisonous frogs which cause him to burst into flames and go on a rampage!All in all this is a refreshing take on 3D puzzle-platformers, that also reminds us just how beautiful and robust the Unreal Engine can still be when in the right hands.

												Just wow. Concise and poignant, this game is filled with sublime vistas of childhood wonder brought to life. The gameplay itself is elegant, and the mechanics reinforce the narrative of the game. I cannot say enough to convey how amazingly well executed the theme and story of the game is, from the devolving normalcy of the scenarios you encounter, to the sparse but powerful cutscenes that hit you like trainwreck. By the time I was done, I had become a bundle of emotions, both profoundly sad yet simultaneously uplifted by the ordeal I had participated in. The game reads as a catharsis on the part of it lead designer, Vander Callabero, and I wonder if its narrative could be, in part, healing for those who have gone through similar crises. I'd challenge anyone who doesn't believe that video games can be art to play this game and still support that opinion.Stop reading this and just go and experience this story.			"

												If you want your heart strings pulled, play this game until the end. Wow.Papo & Yo is based on the monsters that live within. It's a sad reality that is shown in the fantasy world of a little boy named Quico, who escapes the troubled life of his alcoholic father. Quico gets help along the way from his little robot Lula and a girl named Alejandra who is quite mischievous at times. Monster, who Quico thinks is his best friend, can either help, or hinder his progression, depending on if he consumes any frogs. The game play is pretty straightforward but offers beautiful visuals, especially in its art. I wish this game was a bit longer, however it is definitely worth a play if you are into visuals and a solid story that will evoke emotion.			"

												Rating : 8/10With good gameplay (although the puzzles seem slightly repetitive), graphics, and atmosphere, this game isn't exactly notable or special, but it's not bad.However, I loved the story. Monster is actually an analogy for the developer's drunk, abusive father as the frogs that enrage him are symbolic of alcohol and the whole game appears to be the boy's own Wonderland. It only progressed in little bits and pieces, but those were enough to make it something I will remember. Although it did go very slow, you were able to ignore the story every now and then to just focus on the puzzle.It's also a game that's fun and easy to 100%, assuming you have the time for it. There are 25 hidden hats and 10 achievements that are easy to get but worth trying for.			"

												Overall a good game, I recommend it, although if you're looking for complex puzzle, that won't happen here... (maybe after the second hour of play...) But usually, puzzle are quite easy since you just need to look for the white-shiny-thing and once you've found it, that's it, you're good to go... Oh and also, sometimes you have to go over a long distance to do a thing who seems to be there just to make sure you won't finish the game in 2 hours, but in 3.... (some sad back and forth between things in the puzzle)Beside that, the story, the music, the visual and the emotion the game creates is awesome... The visual are gorgeous and the way everything moves in this world is real genius...I had quite some fun playing it!			"

												This game is, in a word, stunning.Since I opened Papo & Yo, I've been admittedly obsessed. The way that the developers (Minority) managed to tie in mature and serious themes like alcoholism and domestic violence without using gratuitous violence or gore is commendable. In fact, Papo & Yo doesn't contain any gore at all! The story is truly captivating and you find yourself getting increasingly attached to the characters as time goes on, despite the minimal use of dialogue.The gameplay itself is mainly a mix of casual puzzles and platforming. It's a simplistic way of bolstering the narrative, and was implemented amazingly. There are only a few achievements, but I had a lot of fun getting them all. A second playthrough of the game allows for collecting hats (which appear on dolls seen throughout the game).I'm not one for writing serious reviews, but this game is deserving of nothing short of a proper review. Completing this game felt like a spiritual experience, and I'll be sure to do it again soon. Whatever the price is for this game right now, it's worth every penny.			"

												I was sceptical of the game at first and only had it in my library as part of a humble bundle. Upon starting to play it as it was in my library anyway, I noticed that it had a great Soundtrack as well as nice animation. Even though the game seems like it is directed at children sometimes, it is still moving and at points very complex. Parts of the game actually did make me cry. I can only recommend this game to anyone.  "

												A truly wonderful experience.The game plays out like a puzzle/platformer with fairly simple game mechanics and challanges, but the story is told beautifully and the surreal environment ties the whole game together.It's pretty short, only lasting about 3-4 hours on the first playthrough but it is a joy to play and anybody who has had someone close to them with a history of substance abuse can relate to the story.I believe it's worth full price if you're into games that rely on their story like Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons, and it's definitely worth picking up when it's on sale for everyone else.

												Well that was emotional...Essentially a series of spacial puzzles set in a 3D world, you play the part of Quico as he seeks to remove his friend Monster's anger by taking him to a shaman.  As we progress we see that Monster is something of a metaphor for Quico's sad past.The story is delivered with confidence and impact.  The puzzles throughout, whilst not difficult, require some thought and a fair amount of spacial awareness.All in all you're looking at 4 hours of fantastic playtime with a satisfying ending.  A second playthrough includes a now-unlocked side mission in which you must locate a collection of dolls, giving you a fine reason for a second playthrough.I had one small problem with the game crashing.  A search about found it's not an uncommon issue, but no-one seemed to have an answer that worked for me - but sure enough verifying the cache in Steam fixed it for me and it didn't happen again.			"

												This is an odd game to recommend because to explain what it is is to spoil it a bit.Basically it is a puzzle game and a short one at that; it took me about 3 and a half hours to complete it one time. Personally I'm glad I played it but if I hadn't got it on sale for £8 my view might be different. It's a very refreshing game, making a point while giving you some really cool puzzles. it tries to engage you in the 'story' and, for me, did this quite nicely with subtle metaphors and imagery. Different people will experience this game differently, if you want a game that is just about the action or puzzles, this might disappoint, but I found it to be an incredibly chilled out game, you can't die and the music is very well done, fitting the atmosphere without becoming repetative. The graphics on the trailer look really poor, but I was surprised by how nice it looked.When I finished the game I felt like it could have been longer with more puzzles, but at the same time, I played it through in one night and it was a cool little game that kept me entertained start to finish. In some ways, the fact that it's short makes it more enjoyable.If you can get it on sale then I recommend it, it's very different and if you can think of it loosely like paying for a film, in this case a puzzle 'experience', then it's well worth £8.

												Surprisingly amazing game, very nice and laid back with interesting although fairly simple puzzles. The game takes on the main protagonist of Papo and delves into the true meaning of what the game is about. Its interesting as not many games are able to take on adult content such as this one and provide real impact especially one on an emotional level without just showing something in full blatant force. It feels like the game takes on adult themes in a very  subtle way which makes it more interesting as you play different parts of the game and wonder what each part truly means. The game is fairly short where I finished it in one day which feels really good as its not long enough to drag on and also shows the main focus which is a lot of story, puzzles and plat forming. For an indie game I didn't expect too much and so was pleasantly surprised to find out how great the game is. As a puzzle game its also quite interesting although can be quite simple at times. The best part of the simplicity of the puzzle is that it feels like you're always moving forward kind of like if you start a good run and you don't really want to stop. This creates a good flow to the game as I never felt that I had to just stop and think, or get annoyed and trying random things until something happened. I would definitely give it a recommendation, especially if you're looking for a fairly short and intriguing indie game.			"

												Not to add more praise onto an already well liked game, but Papo & Yo is as great as everyone says.  I'll keep my review short and to the point.First off, its a short game, but it hits all the right points for the right amount.  It's like having a well portioned meal that satisfies and doesn't leave you sick afterwards.The twist is pretty much given away in both the trailers and the beginning of the game itself, however I wouldn't say that it takes away from any of the impact of the game. Just about everything mechanically about the game is just as I said before, cut down to the right size.  There aren't a ton of characters, but the ones we get are very expressive and nice to look at.  Take a look at all the animation in Monster's face when you hop on his belly.  The backgrounds have a surreal-realism to them with the stacked buildings mixed with the sugar cube mystic blocks.  Nice music and sound too that share that south american feel.The puzzles never got too hard, just a lot of surevying the area for clues (plus each area has a clever tutorial hint).  No need to console the internet for answers.  Puzzles that involve are raging Monster can be tricky as he can stall you by tossing you around a bit if you are caught.As someone who didn't have addict parents I could only relate on a passive level, however by the end I think I have a better understanding of what it is like.  All-in-all, I would recommend this game because it combines great gameplay with a tragic story.  This could have easily been a heavy handed tale or a good message with awful gameplay, but Minority managed create a gem.			"

												I got this game a long time ago with an Humble Bundle, and finally got around to play it.I'm really really glad that I did. I loved this game, its astounding ambientation, its nice puzzle nature.Let's try to be objective and methodic:-Story: 7/10 The story isn't that great, but it's a break from classic puzzles, it's entertaining enough, and the end packs a punch.-Longevity/Replay value: 4/10 This is the worst part: it takes 3/4 hours to finish it, and once you finish it for the first time, there is really nothing compellingyou to play it again.-Difficulty: 6/10 Pretty much all the puzzles are very straightforward and easy to solve, with the hint box it's even easier. Both on the mental side and the skill required to put it in practice. Failing has no real consequences, as you never really ""die"" and the worst case scenario is losing a few seconds to respawn, but in the game everything stays as it was, so you don't even have to restart the level. This can be a pro (no frustration) or a con (shorter longevity).-Aesthetic: 10/10 This is the strongest point of the game. The ambientation, some kind of favelas, and the effect that solving the puzzle has on it is simply amazing. It has something mystical mixed with some kind of visual poetry. I greatly enjoyed it. Also kudos to the creators for the cure put into every little detail. Just lovely.-Concept: 9/10 Puzzles that change the conformation of the ambient surrounding you are not really so new, but not that common either.Plus, the implementation is brilliant.-Controls: 7/10 Pretty straightforward. Usual wasd + mouse, third person. The cam is usually fine, in some rare occasion can move awkwardly. But those occasions are very rare, and failing has no big consequences (see ""Difficulty"")-OST: 8/10 The soundtrack is not, strictly speaking, memorable. But it always fit the game, is easy to the ears, nice, and really helps feeling part of the game.AVG: 7.3It's worth the 11€? I'm not sure. But I'm also pretty stingy.What I can say for sure is that it's worth adding to the wishlist and get on a sale.			"

One flaw I found was the camera setting (3rd person only), wich made it sometimes difficult to do certain jumps or running from Monster. People who are very sensitive and have children of their own should think twice before playing this, the game shows a harsh reality. I enjoyed destroying Monster at the end, he deserved it. "

												Today I played through Papo & Yo (Minority Media Inc.﻿), an action adventure (mostly 3D puzzle platforming) about a young boy who escapes the abuse of his alcoholic father into a surrealistic Latin American–esque slum, where he embarks on a quest to cure ""Monster"" of its addiction to poisonous frogs. The monster (a very clearly indicated metaphor for the protagonist's father) is both a helpful aid it surmounting obstacles and progressing through the game's environment, but also the game's only true ""enemy"" (when under the influence of frogs), who becomes not only a danger to others, but also the protagonist himself, who in the end discovers that there is no cure for ""Monster"". So, it's basically a journey of acceptance and letting go.An enjoyable game—not very difficult, but the environments and puzzles were interesting and non–repetitive. There were occasional glitches and I had to replay one section when Monster got stuck on the environment and blocked progress, but nothing game–breaking. Notable is that the character you play as is non–White and non–Western (although there is no explicit nationality or ethnicity), and also non–English speaking (but not Spanish or Portuguese, either—some sort of constructed or conglomerate language is used in the game's limited dialog). Sad that playing as something other then a White male American is ""notable"", but that's how it is…			"

												The graphics aren't groundbreaking (although they are beautiful) and there are some collision issues and places I got my character (physically) stuck. That being said, the story this game tells is heart wrenching! You start off chasing a mysterious girl who can seemingly create doors and portals out of thin air. To chase her, you complete some easy puzzles with your robot friend (who hangs on your back and assists you in opening areas that you can't reach). Shortly after, you meet a large pink monster who helps you out in completing some more puzzles. That's when you start getting glimpses of places and things (in what seems like another universe), and you realise that everything you do just might be a metaphor for something that has happened to you. You can manipulate the world and it's objects by moving gears and cranks that are shining with an other-worldly glow. A few times my mind went ""whaaaa?"", but I still had lots of fun. The music was beautifully composed, and near the very end, it was bringing out so many emotions as the music (and story) unraveled. Even though it was only about 3-3.5 hours to play through, I think it was the perfect length to tell the story it needed to tell.			"

												When I play this game for the first time, i thought its just ""another"" puzzles game. But after finished this game, that perception was changed. This game isn't all about puzzle that can make you frustrated and quit the game.Papo & YO has a strong message that cleverly integrated into the game, combined with cool visual art and well-placed music soundtrack. The gameplay itself is kinda short, but thats not a big deal where what matters is quality over quantity.Well if you already picked up this game from store/humble bundle, this game is worth your time.

Artisitc world and character design, vivid colors, poetic soundtrack, this is a game everyone should play!Though on the surface Papo & Yo appears to be one of the most abstract of games with no direct meaning, playing further into the game (and nearing the end) tells you the imaginary story of a boy, Quico, and his life of being bullied and abused (probably on a daily basis).Monster, poisonous frogs, the robot Lula, all have their reason and place in Papo & Yo. The story will form really well when you play it through, when you will uncover the mystery of this awesome game.			"

												This game is fun. It is also kinda sad. You feel alone. It is metaphorically dark. It starts with a dedication reading: ""To my mother, brothers and sister, with whom I survived the monster in my father."" Obviously his father is the monster in the game. It is pretty easy to decipher. Playing through the game is fun. The graphics are great, and the game is simple and easy. Since the subject matter is kinda heavy I just have a bit of weight on me while playing, so I have to play in short chunks (hard to describe).Anyway, good game, good story.			"

												This game takes you in a world where physics as we know them dont exist. It just plays with the world and its setting... and with you. The puzzles are pretty easy but I didnt buy the game because of them - more likely because of the story.At the first sight this game looks pretty easy to understand. There's a monster and it likes to eat or play football with you! But only as long as you can prevent him from eating those frogs...I won't tell any further because the emotions and feelings you experience during the game will be more intense if you dont know that much about the story. A story that many people may have lived through... That last chapter/level (call it what you want) definitely is one of the most emotional things I've ever seen in gaming/movie history.			"

												Gameplay: 9/10Storyline: 9/10Graphics: 8/10SoundTrack: 9/10Overall: 8.75/10The game puts players in the shoes of Quico, a boy whose complex fantasies are loosely tied with the real world.  Think the dilapidated, South American version of the Hundred Acre Woods.  Quico is looking for a way to cure his monster friend, as every time he eats poison frogs(alcohol), he goes on a rampage, destroying all in his path.  Otherwise, the monster is a peaceful being, and even saves your skin if you mess up in certain puzzles.  At its core, Papo & Yo has a metaphorical, psuedo-autobiographical story that was inspired by the childhood experiences of Minority’s creative director, Vander Caballero.			"

												This was a lovely puzzling platformer game. The artistic style of the magical chalk lines was very enjoyable, not to mention how whimsical the world seemed. Houses might grow legs or wings to do your bidding. You could carry giant frogs like rag dolls and use them as tools (or bait). The story line was very touching, and the characters, although not English-speaking, were easy to grow attached to. The only thing that could have made the game better is perhaps additional content. I finished the game in about 3 hours, and although I felt very satisfied, I would have loved to spend more time in the story.			"

												On first sight, Papo & Yo could be made for a younger audience. And if you'd leave the story-elements aside, Papo & Yo would be just that. The Gameplay is simple, the mechanics are easy and it is no challenge to beat the game. But Papo & Yo doesn't try to be challenging, it tries to tell a story. The story of a boy who escapes into his own imagination to seek shelter from his alcoholic father, the ""monster"" if you will. And in his imagination, still, he tries to ""heal"" the monster from its addiction to frogs.Papo & Yo tells this story in a metaphorical but so profound way, sometimes you just need to turn off the game and think about what just happened. As a game Papo & Yo is nothing special, but as a tool to express a story it is unique. 8.5/10PS: The Soundtrack is superb. I bought this game without the Soundtrack and after playing trough Papo & Yo I feel pretty bad about it.			"

												This game is a masterpiece! It's the only game I've ever played that left tears in my eyes. Highly personal, and very fun, Papo and Yo is a game about a boy trying to cope with his abusive father. This game opens wounds, but not in a bad way. Instead of determining to make a statement, and pointing it out to you, Papo and Yo immerses you into the story, letting you dictate how you feel about the situations presented. The gameplay is puzzle based. It's inventive and very imaginative, but not difficult. Do not expect to burnout your brain trying to solve the puzzles. This game is more about the storyline and your personal reaction to it. Your first play through will probably be 2 - 3 hours; so it's not a bad game to play on a lazy afternoon. The graphics are done well with a rich color palette and tones to make you feel you are in the slums. The voice acting is spot on. I know I'm lavishing over this game, but I really can't say enough good things about it. If there was ever a game I wished everyone would play at least once, it would be Papo and Yo!			"

												First, I'll say that I enjoy games with immersive atmosphere, story, and a unique artistic vision.  Papo & Yo manages to get all three of those to work together to create a truly unique experience.Above all else, I would call Papo & Yo a 3D adventure game, and the puzzles are worked into the environment in a way that makes them engaging though not the most innovative in the genre.  That's ok, however, because the real star of this game is the immersive experience of wandering through this fantastical favela, appreciating the colorful artwork, and dissecting the meaning and symbolism behind it all.I don't know if my interpretation behind some of the imagery was intended by the developers, but when a video game can rise to the level of having multiple interpretations, you know it's something special!  The shift from colorful and sunny to drab and rainy...  The graffiti so intentionally placed in each scene...  The act of moving great buildings and how it relates to both boyhood imagination as well as the main character's role in his troubled father's life...I experienced no bugs.  The visuals are stunning when using the highest graphical settings.  Look around, pause and enjoy the music, and take it in slowly to make the experience last.The little gems of creativity, the perfect soundtrack, a story unheard of in the game industry, and the sense of wonder you feel as you explore this world simply cannot be missed by any gamer who believes that games can be art.

												Ico-esque adventure game where your companion is [very explicitly] a big, hulking metaphor for the game creator's abusive, alcoholic father. Subtle this game was not ... but it *was* unique, and in the end it did have a real effect on me. I'm very glad to have played it, but it's heavy enough that I'm unlikely to play through it again.Strengths: Really striking and original visuals / artistic direction, superb music, refreshing protagonist [the opposite of the powerfulwhitemale we so often see in games]. Short length, ~3.5 hours [a big plus given my schedule].Weaknesses: The gameplay itself is a bit repetitive [though the constant introduction of new visuals and mechanics does liven things up]. The puzzles are trivial [this is an adventure game, not a puzzle game]. Some minor control+camera wonkiness. Complete lack of subtlety in hitting you with the game's central metaphor [this game's creator is making a very personal, cathartic game.]			"

												Alcohol abuse can be a sensitive and personal topic and in this game it’s presented in a blatant, realistic and yet tasteful manner. This is due to the game being well designed, possibly due to the creative director’s own experience with an alcoholic father.You never quite know whether Monster is your friend of your enemy. You have this constant sense of unease around him that he might find a poisonous frog and turn on you. But Monster is incredibly useful when he’s not charging you down. I also have to hand it to the composer, Brian D’Oliveira, for creating a light, flamenco soundtrack that ties in well with lightness of Quico’s steps and scenery. The story is well-presented and well-plotted, both visually, aurally and through the gameplay.This praise all being said, the game isn’t without its flaws. Like many platformers, the game has an element of exploration which the designers failed to… explore. There’s plenty of nooks, crannies and hidey holes, but nothing in them. I even managed to find trapped teddy bears in many of them, but they seemed to be nothing more than coincidently-placed scenery. I felt that this beautiful and unique world was just a bit too empty, nothing to encourage me to play again and no reward for getting to these hard to reach places, not quite what I expect from a platformerFor full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2014/04/21/papo-yo/ "

												I have mixed feelings about Papo & Yo.On the other hand I want to love the game for it's unique feel, but on the other I feel it is lacking on many fronts.At it's best Papo & Yo offers beautiful artwork and sceneries, entertainment and a fun challenge. At it's worst, it is very repetitive, frustrating and even boring. It also hosts a selection of glitches, that aren't that big of a deal, but do leave an unpolished impression.The story had me intrigued at first, but lost me after a while because of it's slow progress. Also, it's really not well carried out tbh. I did however finish the game for I wanted to get to the predictable end. Seeing the credits scroll down on the screen didn't offer the satisfaction I thought it would, other than finally getting the game off my to-do list. It was a bit like finishing a mediocre book.Still, I won't advice to steer clear of the game. If you have the patience and are willing to forgive some annoyances (many that are due to budget) Papo & Yo delivers a different kind of gameplay experience that other game makers should learn from and improve on. It is good to see that more and more people like Vander Caballero (the creative director, who the story is based on) take the effort to get off their high horses at big game studios to go and discover their own path.

												A barely disguised allegory, the game is occasionally overbearing in its message.  The puzzling and platforming is usually just this side of tedious.  Nevertheless I love this game as it's a perfect example of the interactive form being the correct choice for telling a particular story.  Fear, frustration, and the magical beliefs of a child thinking he can change what is through the few options available to him make for a near seamless intertwining of feeling, meaning, and gameplay.  There were times when I refused to do what the game asked of me; other times it gave me chills as I tried to process how I felt about what was happening.  The art and music are glorious.  Well worth the 3 hours it will take to play to completion.			"

												This game was the gone home before gone home. This games tells the the player a tragic story by having you play as a the son or victim of this tragedy. As you progess through the narrative... it becomes clear that this story is less about the art style and gameplay but more about telling the story of dealing with tragedy... that we don't often see in games nowadays. Don't exoect instant gratification or a great payoff. Invest your time in the story and you will come away feeling a lot better for having played this game. I remember pre-ordering this game and I normally do not pre-order a game of this type... but something compelled me to do so. I still can't find what truly compelled me because it is hard to put into words how satisfied I am for having played this game. There are very few games that I can hold the narrative and objective of the game in such high regard. This is one of them.			"

												It will make you feel.  This interactive media makes you look at pain and love.  Specifically the pain caused by an evil drunken father and the confusing love felt by a son.  You feel along with the son.  The son loves his sister and she is also in pain.  The confusion of having a father,  who's rage must be managed and avoided and who will has fun playing and laughing with you, is a discovery.  It is emotional to the point that I felt like avoiding it and then it was so fascinatingly truthful in its depth that I could not disengage.  I know more than I did before I experienced this.  I think that was the goal of the man who made it and I know he was sucessful in teaching and sharing somthing from his life.  I was sad and angry durring this experience.  I guess that is the key feature of this game.   It has fastinating visuals and surreal, reality bending puzzles but at its core this is about sharing feelings.  Thank you Papo & Yo.			"

As long as you expect a third-person advanture-like game with well-thought-out scenario and beautiful background music, this game will not fail you. You can't surely expect any blood-shattering and born-crushing actions in this game.

												I managed to beat it in around 3-4 hours.But it was a well-enjoyed 3-4 hours. Like a lot of indie games, it's meant to be experienced more than anything. But it's not really something that tries too hard to be overly deep and the symbolism is made pretty clear by the end. In fact, the second trailer pretty much spells it out for you before you play. The game draws inspiration from the creator's real life experiences with an alcoholic father. It's good, but you may want to take a pass if themes like alcholism and abuse are overwhelming to you.I'd rather not give away the ending, so I'll just say that if you want to see it, you'll have to play for yourself. I personally think it would be worth the $15, although I got it on sale. But since not everyone might agree with me, I'd say just get it on the next sale if you're not 100% sure. You might not feel like you're getting much out of it as a game. It's short and pretty simple. But as an experience, I'd recommend it.			"

												A very beautiful game. I played this back to back with Portal 2 and at first I was a little disappointed with Papo & Yo's puzzles by comparison. As the game went on though I came to appreciate that Papo & Yo has different goals than Portal and as a result different puzzles. Papo & Yo, to me at least, is a metaphor for navigating family dynamics. Its goal is to put you in a child's shoes, to oscillate between the calm and terror of having an alcoholic father, not to offer arbitrary brain teasers.			"

												Anyone who's ever shared a home with an abusive person knows that the management of the aggressor's precarious mental state is key to everyday survival. You're always walking on eggshells, never trusting periods of respite, for you know all too well how little it takes to tip the balance. It's a dangerous tango that, in a morbid way, lends itself rather well to gamification. ""Monster"", the lumbering, troll-like form the violent father assumes in the child's imagination, must be carefully guided and appeased in order to navigate the game world. It'll have you fooled with its ungainly cuteness, only to erupt into (literally) flaming rage the instant it tastes blood. Make no mistake, this is no game for children. The presentation may be beautiful and the core platforming joyous, but the final act in particular takes a turn for the guttingly sinister. Definite recommendation, but be prepared to be challenged emotionally.			"

												Not perfect but a game that should be played. Papo & Yo is about a boy with an abusive father who escapes into a fantasy world where he needs the help of a brutish monster named Papo to help you slove platforming puzzles.This game is very pretty.  bright, colorful, and atmospheric.  The tone and art style gradually changes as the story progresses and grows darker.  Most of the game involves using Papo to help you get around by lifting obsticals or tossing you to high ledges and then you need to manipulate the enviroment so Papo can follow.  There are also slugs that Papo really loves but cause him to go into a rage and attack anything near him including you.  Sometimes you need to keep him away from the slugs sometimes you need to let him eat them so you can solve a puzzle.  It's hear were your relationship with the monster begins to mirror your relationship with your abusive father.  The game does have some flaws.  its not the longest game, sometimes the physics are a little wonky and there could be a bit more variety in the game play but its not enough to be a deal brekerThis is a fairly simple puzzle platformer with appealing visuals and does a good job of letting the narrative and charm bleed into the gameplay.  It also explores a topic not offten tackled in video games.			"

												Can games help us process psychological traumas? Or help us understand them in others? This unconventional game tries exactly that.In Papo & Yo you play a little boy named Quico that finds his way through a dreamlike Favela, following a mysterious girl. The environment offers creative puzzles that emphasizes whats possible in the fantasy of a kid. But this fantasy is not only that, it is also a metaphor. After befriending a monster that loves to eat frogs but starts raging everytime it does you realize that not all is well in Quicos fantasy world, and even less so in his real world.Without hitting you in the face with it Papo & Yo not only tells you, but lets you experience how traumatising domestic violence can be for a child and how it tries to cope with it. It handles the subject very delicately and at the same time offers great and challenging gameplay.The shortness of it is not a weak point as it gets the point across with good pacing. It also features good art and music - Another example of how interactive media can offer mature experiences without clichés or over the top violence.			"

												It's a surprisingly affecting story. The monster, Papo, is a metaphor for the alcoholic father of the game's director. But what could have easily been a preachy mess turns out to be an engaging puzzle game with a poignant story. The Brazilian favela makes for an interesting setting, the music is lovely, and the ending actually chocked me up. The only downside is that it's quite short, only about 3-4 hours, but I ended up playing it a second time just because I enjoyed the world and characters so much. Highly recommended.[UPDATE] I just nominated Papo & Yo for the “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award in this year's Steam Awards. It was a tough choice between this, Gone Home, and Valiant Hearts; but there is something special about Papo & Yo. It touches on a subject that has affected me personally, so it ultimately got my vote. I hope you'll consider it, too.			"

Peccato per la longevità, circa 3 ore per completarlo, ma tutto sommato un gioco diverso dal solito che richiama vecchi platform arricchiti però dalla fantasia dei programmatori. Se lo avessero sviluppato più a lungo sarebbe potuto diventare un titolo da voti molto alti. In ogni caso va premiata l'idea, il lavoro di un team indie e la fotografia con un bel 7,5 su 10.

												A powerful and beautiful journey through what had to be difficult subject matter for its creator. Thank you for sharing this with me and the rest of the world. I highly recommend this title. It is easily one of the most fun and gorgeous puzzle platformers I've played in a long while.			"

												Third-person environmental puzzling with an emotional and clearly personal story. Somewhat reminiscent of Brothers, not in the way of game mechanics, though. Highly recommend this. (Also, BTW, play through this and then tell me video games aren't art.....)			"

												I'd like to put an asterisk on my recommendation. It is a good game, in my opinion worth buying and playing, and I enjoyed every moment of it.However, here's the caveat: it's not a challenging game. It's very much Railroading: the game, with a few obstacles to get you more invested in it (still better than ""Dear Esther""). To me, that's not a problem, because the game's atmosphere, music and visuals are excellently designed, and the brazilian voices (I'm assuming it's brazilian) are a delight to listen to. For some however, this might be a problem. If you need a proper challenge to enjoy a game, this is definitely not for you. As mentioned, the puzzles are simple; just find the next switch to open the path to the next setpiece. A few puzzles require a bit of fiddling to solve, in particular a basketball court that took me a few reloads to get back on track, but it didn't make me use my head as a scratching post.It's a short game; as you can see from my play counter, it was completed in less than 4 hours. It's short, but sweet, and I'd argue that's its selling point; it doesn't drag out the overarching theme about substance abuse ad infinitum, and while the ending didn't grab me, that's not a fault of the game. It's nice to see such work put into telling the message of substance abuse seen through the eyes of a young boy, as it is quite a serious problem in the world today, and the game is just beautiful, as I've already said. Buy it for the experience, not for the challenge.			"

												If you like a game for its story, Papo and Yo may be right for you. The game employs intriguing and abstract puzzle mechanics that will make you smile. It is not a difficult game, but it wasn't meant to be. The relaxing atmosphere of the game leaves room for its players to take in the surroundings, understand an important message, and find a few little secrets.			"

												A nice game full of some wonderful imaginations. Remind me a little bit about the great adventure game ICO in playstation 2. The story part is just okay but the setting, visual(art), musics and sounds are wonderful. At the beginning, there are new gameplay element introduced regularly and the level design is great but you can see they begin to run out of ideas near the end. The game is quite short and can be finished in one or two sittings.  If you can get it in sale, don't miss this interesting interactive art.			"

												Y'know, I'm really surprised I haven't heard about this one more. I started playing it after finding it in my library, and found myself coming back to it until the end. It's a fun 3D puzzle platformer, with a thoughtful story, a unique aesthetic, matching soundtrack, stunning environments, and gorgeous artwork. Go try it out! Minor complaints would include the lack of facial animation during in-game cutscenes, and the fairly ambiguous ending.			"

												I don't like platformer.  I don't like jumping puzzles.  I especially don't like timing puzzles.  I'm not very good at any of those.  Because of that, I should not have liked this game.  But I did.  I liked this game a lot.The gameplay was simple enough that I could play through it without getting seriously frustrated by my lack of skill; but still challenging enough not to be boring.   The puzzles that did not involve jumping and timing were very clever, but for the most part still logical and intuitive once you got into the flow of the game.  There were a few odd moments where the puzzles did not make a whole lot of sense, and I was force to rely on a walkthrough; but very few (unlike so many modern puzzle games, where randomness is used as a cheap and easy substitute for cleverness).  The mechanics of the game are very entertaining in themselves, particularly once Lulu is introduced.The game design is beautiful; and the creators use of an uncommon setting was brilliant.  The third-world backdrop meshed very well with the fantastical elements; creating a seamless world with it's own unique and readily-identifiable logic.  The artwork is stunning, and the inclusion of works by actual environmental artists nothing short of amazing.  The similar use of third-world characters, rather than white Europeans or stereotypical fantasy creatures is similarly inspiring.  The music is beautiful, and in spots almost breathtaking, wonderfully blending traditional and orchestral sounds.  Atmospheric and fun at the same time.I would be hard pressed to find any flaws in the game.  If I did, I would say that parts of the ending felt a little out of place.  Some of the scenes and actions didn't make quite as much sense as they could have, and the symbolism is a bit heavyhanded; but that's still a fairly minor quibble.   The game is a bit shorter than most of its type; but too much longer and it would have started to drag.  The pacing never leave it feeling too long or too short.One warning is that the background story that emerges from the game is disturbing, becoming increasingly so the closer it gets to the end.  This is ultimately a story of addiction and child abuse; and is accordingly dark and sad.  Fortunately, the writers do not beat the player over the head with moralizing; and manage to balance the darkness with a keen sense of human resilience.  I cannot recommend this game enough.  I picked it up at a huge discount during one of Steam's big sales; but would can easily recommend getting it even at full price.			"

												Buy? Maybe.Long story short, Papo & Yo is another one of those obtuse and vague story telling indie games that will appear pretentious and confusing to many gamers or groundbreaking and wonderful for others. While I largely enjoyed the games easy, but not handholding puzzles and ""Mystical chalk"" in a Central/South American favela art style, I ended up mostly confused and not very satisfied with the ending. The ending was abrupt, and like the entirty of the storystelling, all based on metaphors. Papo & Yo is a game built more for the types that enjoyed Dear Esther (ugh) and Thomas Was Alone (A pretty nice game actually) and a bit less for those that enjoyed Portal 2 or Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom - the puzzles are nice, but hardly brain-teasing or super innovative. I will say that seeing how the world forms and deforms through puzzles solving is really interesting and neat, but like any pretentious indie game, it is never explained how or why parts of buildings can suddenly sprout legs to walk or wings to fly, or why entire towns can be split and connected like a jigsaw puzzle: You're just supposed to ""understand"" some nebulous meaning and interpret what is going on, like guessing ""This is the kid's imagination or how he understand the world works because he is just a kid"" or something like that. While it is also clear that this is supposed to be a story about a child and an unclear relationship to his father manifested in a frog eating monster representing an alcohol abusing father, the exposition is all metaphorical and based on the developer's artistic vision, It's less understandable like a good Pixar short or the ""Kiwi!"" film where you understand the actions and emotions.If you need further proof of what I'm talking about, see the discussion thread about ""What does it all mean?!"" between players and developers, where the dev doesn't answer the question and instead thanks the players for debating what is going on: http://steamcommunity.com/app/227080/discussions/0/828936718797549690/Papo & Yo gets on my good side for being a short, easy to finish game with a good art style, world design and an overall solid game (fits my Ultra-wide monitor resolution and I had no glitches besides a few graphical glitches early in the game). It gets on my bad side for being another ""Guess at what story I'm trying to tell you instead of me actually telling you"" arty/farty indie game. The story may strike a cord with other gamers who have experiened child abuse from their parents. This is something playable for children as well, but I doubt they would understand all the real world paralells the game is trying to make, Papo & Yo is essentially an adults game.			"

												I got this game a long time ago with an Humble Bundle, and finally got around to play it.I'm really really glad that I did. I loved this game, its astounding ambientation, its nice puzzle nature.Let's try to be objective and methodic:-Story: 7/10 The story isn't that great, but it's a break from classic puzzles, it's entertaining enough, and the end packs a punch.-Longevity/Replay value: 4/10 This is the worst part: it takes 3/4 hours to finish it, and once you finish it for the first time, there is really nothing compellingyou to play it again.-Difficulty: 6/10 Pretty much all the puzzles are very straightforward and easy to solve, with the hint box it's even easier. Both on the mental side and the skill required to put it in practice. Failing has no real consequences, as you never really ""die"" and the worst case scenario is losing a few seconds to respawn, but in the game everything stays as it was, so you don't even have to restart the level. This can be a pro (no frustration) or a con (shorter longevity).-Aesthetic: 10/10 This is the strongest point of the game. The ambientation, some kind of favelas, and the effect that solving the puzzle has on it is simply amazing. It has something mystical mixed with some kind of visual poetry. I greatly enjoyed it. Also kudos to the creators for the cure put into every little detail. Just lovely.-Concept: 9/10 Puzzles that change the conformation of the ambient surrounding you are not really so new, but not that common either.Plus, the implementation is brilliant.-Controls: 7/10 Pretty straightforward. Usual wasd + mouse, third person. The cam is usually fine, in some rare occasion can move awkwardly. But those occasions are very rare, and failing has no big consequences (see ""Difficulty"")-OST: 8/10 The soundtrack is not, strictly speaking, memorable. But it always fit the game, is easy to the ears, nice, and really helps feeling part of the game.AVG: 7.3It's worth the 11€? I'm not sure. But I'm also pretty stingy.What I can say for sure is that it's worth adding to the wishlist and get on a sale.			"

												Papo & Yo is short, but powerful; powerful enough that I couldn't write a review immediately after playing it, because it was all still a little too intense.I picked this game up as part of a Humble Bundle, knowing absolutely nothing about it, and installed it when I was in the mood for a bit of indie whimsy.  So it came as a bit of a shock when the opening animation sequence  made it clear that child abuse was going to be a prominent theme of the game -- I had been expecting cheery, light-hearted fluff, and this was looking instead like a terrible downer.  Within a few minutes, however, the setting and gameplay had drawn me in so much that I played all the way through in one sitting, even though I knew the game was writing me a ticket on the feels train.The setting is an appealingly surrealist dreamscape rendition of a South American favela, blending fanciful magic with rusty corrugated iron sheets.  The frequent puzzles are inventive and fun, if not particularly challenging.  But the puzzles aren't the true star of this game; story is the shining star here.   Monster, your companion through most of the game, is a very thinly veiled portrayal of an abusive alcoholic father, and what the game does brilliantly is lead you into the mindset of a victim.  You'll love Monster, fear him, hate him, resent him and even pity him, often at the same time.  You'll find yourself doing ugly, violent things without even thinking about it, because you desperately need to avoid triggering Monster's rage.  You'll make excuses for Monster; you'll blame other things; you'll blame yourself.  You'll allow yourself to believe that you're in control -- that if you just play the game well enough, you can keep Monster content and placid indefinitely.  And, inevitably, it will all come crashing down on you.The majority of ""game as art"" projects I've seen have been gross, pretentious failures that abandon concepts of gameplay in favour of marching the player on a directed tour through the creator's personal vision, and the interactivity of the experience is reduced to token actions in what is otherwise a sort of animated film or ebook.  Papo & Yo is a high-art game that gets it right; there's a real game here, and it's the gameplay makes it immersive.  Once you've been drawn in through the puzzle game elements, and you really care about the characters and what happens to them, the harsh, wrenching story elements become that much more powerful.Having such mature themes, this game is admittedly not for everyone, but, as far as I'm concerned, it's a masterpiece.

												Papo & Yo is a platform/puzzle game by developers Minority about a Brazilian kid, Quico, and his efforts to live alongside a big and dangerous monster, Papo.Your objective is to guide Quico through the city and paving your own way to the following area each time. In order to do this, you can interact with switches and levers all over the landscape, use your personal toy robot companion (Lula) to activate remote buttons or glide for a short time and, finally, use Papo to your advantage with the right tools. Other sequences from the game revolve instead around fleeing a rampaging Papo and try to calm him down somehow.It's worth mentioning that Papo & Yo is a very short game, being beatable in under four or five hours, but is't nevertheless a very charming game in its own right and something you should consider buying during sales			"

As a puzzle game it is awesome.As a story... well, the ending was bad. I do not only mean that I do not full agree with the autor's point of view, but the biggest thing reviealed in the end is shown as if we did not guess about it before. I mean it was boring to see it as the biggest secret in the game. Only dummies can't guess about it.Still, I do recomend you to play it becuse it is an awesome puzzle game with wonderful amdience.

												I can honestly say Papo & Yo is one of the most amazing games I have ever played.The idea is simple, you're a young lad that has to solve puzzles and challenges using the everchanging surroundings.The gameplay is fairly easy, and everytime it starts to get repetitive something new is added in. However the main reason I'm recommending this game is the incredible storyline behind it.Without spoiling anything, the storyline shows the problems and fears the boy has excellently, even though it never directly mentions it until the ending.All of the characters are unique and easy to understand. For example, the monster can be your best friend, and the next minute he's turning against you.This game grabs you emotionally. After a while you start to connect with the boy and feel how he feels through the parts of the game.Definite recommendation to anyone who wants to waste 4 hours or so (until you play it again).			"

												I don't know that I would pay $15 for this game due to the fact that the game is 4 hours of content....max.  But for what the game is, it is worth a playthrough.  The ambience, sound and theme of the game is fairly well developed.  Nothing really mind blowing, but it does deal with a sensitive subject...child abuse.  All in all, the game is fun, the puzzles aren't really all that difficult, but entertaining for what they are.  I'd recommend purchasing it on sale for $5 - $7 if you ever get a chance.  But again, $15....no, that's just too much for what's here.			"

												Papo & Yo is a platform/puzzle game by developers Minority about a Brazilian kid, Quico, and his efforts to live alongside a big and dangerous monster, Papo.Your objective is to guide Quico through the city and paving your own way to the following area each time. In order to do this, you can interact with switches and levers all over the landscape, use your personal toy robot companion (Lula) to activate remote buttons or glide for a short time and, finally, use Papo to your advantage with the right tools. Other sequences from the game revolve instead around fleeing a rampaging Papo and try to calm him down somehow.It's worth mentioning that Papo & Yo is a very short game, being beatable in under four or five hours, but is't nevertheless a very charming game in its own right and something you should consider buying during sales			"

												Papo & Yo is a quiet game , but it's telling a story contains lots of strong emotions and deep feelings , it needs us to pay a little bit attention to listen and find out . In the begining , everything looked so peaceful , brought me some kind of calmness . As I was going deeper , I couldn't help realizing that Quico has been bearing a lot , that he must protect the ones he loves , help the one who hurts him......that I must help Quico to fix all of this . I think this is the main reason I continued playing . We all make mistakes , grown-up might have a childish immature heart , doing irrational things that only hurt oneself and others , while a little one might have the strongest soul . It doesn't matter how much time that one has been living , what matters the most is that we have the ability to help each other . So I thought the game is about saving an angry monster , and I believed I'd done so . But in the end , I realized there's something beyond salvation . I played as Quico , had to do the final steps by myself , all the conflicts within was about to explode . When it's done , we might understand something .Papo & Yo is a beautiful story , and the story has been being told beautifully . The art is gorgeous in it's own way , very bright and colorful , lighting up the dim raining days , along with the music , creating an exotic world that you want to stay and explore , the ending song is very touching . Lots of elements in the game are symbolic , but it isn't hard to understand , instead , finding out the meaning of these elements by continue playing makes the game more fascinating and engaging . Another thing I love about this game is the level designs . The puzzles are so brilliant and inspiring , you solving them by interacting with the imaginative environment . These two parts are blending in with each other beautifully , for several times I was just ""Wow"" . But every time the monster was in madness , the whole world was immersed in red color , it felt really uncomfortable . And I admit I'm scared of the mad monster , when I was being chased , I could hardly see myself because the monster was so big . The game is a little bit short though , It only took me 4.6h to finish , but I didn't find all the hats , it might be a glitch because I couldn't wear any of them . Papo and Yo is not a perfect game , but it's beautiful and good enough , I strongly recommend it !!!			"

												Uttelry beautiful game.The description does not the do the game any justice and is completely misleading. Quico and the monster are not ""friends"" in the slightest, you are not ""playing"" with the monster, and you don't ""build a friendship"" together. The description makes the game sound like a bright, cheerful, Boy and His blob type game. It's not.Watch the launch trailer to get a better feel for what the game is about.*SPOILERS*I don't want to give too much away, but here's the jist:The game is an intriguing and harsh look at alcoholism, anger, neglect, child abuse, and even murder, through the eyes of an innocent child who, being unable to understand these things, creates a fanciful world they can escape to and make sense of them in their own way.The monster altogether ignores you throughout the experience, try as you might to interact with it, like a neglectful parent. When it's not ignoring you, it's eating or sleeping. It only pays you any attention when you have food, or when it is actively trying to harm you. Yes, it ""helps"" you solve puzzles and progress through the game, but you're not in anyway develping a friendship with the monster.The world is breathtakingly beautiful, with some really innovative and engrossing level design. There's a lot of detail in the mystical favela landscape, and exploring it is equally as enjoyable as the controls are tight and responsive. The game moves very fluidly with excellent pacing and hitting all the right emotional cues. The music is also top notch.Overall, this is a very polished game, and an excellent experience. The whimsical setting and levels juxtapose perfectly with the deeply emotional and dark subject matter. If I had any complaint, it's that the jumping is a little shoddy at times, and since the game has such an emphasis on platforming, that's a bigger deal than it should be. But that doesn't take away from the overall experience.Definitely reccomend it to anyone who likes to play games with a good story, a lot of emotion, and a lot of layers. The fact that the controls are great and the graphics are fantastic is merely icing on this bittersweet yet delectable cake.9/10			"

												Truly a fantastic adventure game! Papo & Yo will not only present you with interesting puzzles and fun gameplay, but also challenge you to look inward to the demons we all battle throughout life (and more importantly the places we go to escape them).This is a game about a boy named Quico and his seemingly magical action figure Lula, as well as a giant - and normally docile - beast named Monster. As Quico, you will explore various facets of the dream-like favela he escapes to, where the laws of reality itself bend to the whim of one little boy.The core gameplay focuses on solving environmental puzzles, many of which involve magic chalk-like drawings on the walls and floors of buildings that let you manipulate this strange and beautiful world in a variety of different ways. There is also some light platforming and some interesting mechanics which involve Lula, who straddles your backside like a knapsack and acts as a sort of jetpack that can also carry out some basic commands (such as flipping switches for you at a distance). Monster will also play a big part (no pun intended) in solving a lot of said puzzles and offers his own unique mechanics; when he is asleep his massive gut can be used as a trampoline of sorts and of course that brute strength of his also comes in handy! You have to be careful, however, as Monster also has an unhealthy addiction to poisonous frogs which cause him to burst into flames and go on a rampage!All in all this is a refreshing take on 3D puzzle-platformers, that also reminds us just how beautiful and robust the Unreal Engine can still be when in the right hands.

												Anyone who's ever shared a home with an abusive person knows that the management of the aggressor's precarious mental state is key to everyday survival. You're always walking on eggshells, never trusting periods of respite, for you know all too well how little it takes to tip the balance. It's a dangerous tango that, in a morbid way, lends itself rather well to gamification. ""Monster"", the lumbering, troll-like form the violent father assumes in the child's imagination, must be carefully guided and appeased in order to navigate the game world. It'll have you fooled with its ungainly cuteness, only to erupt into (literally) flaming rage the instant it tastes blood. Make no mistake, this is no game for children. The presentation may be beautiful and the core platforming joyous, but the final act in particular takes a turn for the guttingly sinister. Definite recommendation, but be prepared to be challenged emotionally.			"

												There are some games that I consider both entertainment and art. Papo and Yo is one of those games. I was researching short games that I could complete in a relatively short amount of time. This game came up during my search, and I happened to own it from a previous Humble Bundle purchase. I decided to install without having any idea what the game was really about  aside from it being a metaphor for the creator's troubled childhood. I found that as I began playing I couldn't put it down, and I didn't exactly know why. This review is a summary of why I believe I kept playing and why you may find yourself wanting to give this game a try:Graphics:Created with the Unreal engine, the game looks good. The graphics aren't amazing in comparison to some other games created with the same engine, but they serve the purpose well and draw you into the South American inspired world.Sound:This is a soundtrack that I would purchase and listen to over and over. You will get lost in the atmospheric tracks as you guide Quico on his journey. Even if you decide not to play the game at least go listen to the music! You won't regret it.Controls:I used an XBOX 360 controller to play. Not much to say here. Controls are simple and the world easy to navigate. There's a basic jump and float mechanic that you will find yourself using throughout most of the game making the game feel somewhat like a 3-D platformer at times.Story:*Minor spoilers ahead*This is where the game's primary focus lies. The game tells a dark tale of a boy and his relationship with his alcoholic father. The story evoked a wide range of emotions from me as I played. I felt myself smiling at times, but there was one moment in particular I remember. It was when the monster ate a frog for the first time, and it evoked some genuine fear and panic in me. I won't say much more than that in order to avoid any major spoilers, but the game does a great job of telling the emotional story that the game's creator set out to tell and bringing you (the player) along for the ride. Puzzles:I made this a category, because this game is technically a puzzle game. I found the puzzles to be fairly simple with only one or two that made me have to give any thought aso to how I would solve them. I was ok with the simplicity, because the game really is more about the story than it is about solving puzzles. However, if you are a player looking for deep puzzles and gameplay, then Papo and Yo may not meet your expectations in these areas.Overall experience:I genuinely enjoyed playing Papo and Yo. While it may not be the type of game that I'd typically find myself playing, I was pleasantly surprised how it drew me in and kept me engaged until the very end. While the story may not be the happiest story, I felt the ending fit the tale well and didn't leave me unsatisfied. The game's soundtrack also delivered, and will be one I listen to periodically when I'm in the mood for a great game soundtrack. The graphics and puzzles aren't the strongest, but they didn't detract from my experience at all. I recommend you give this game a shot! You might end up being just as surprised as I was!TLDR;I recommend you play Papo and Yo for the story and soundtrack, but don't come for the puzzles or any deep gameplay.			"

												It's a surprisingly affecting story. The monster, Papo, is a metaphor for the alcoholic father of the game's director. But what could have easily been a preachy mess turns out to be an engaging puzzle game with a poignant story. The Brazilian favela makes for an interesting setting, the music is lovely, and the ending actually chocked me up. The only downside is that it's quite short, only about 3-4 hours, but I ended up playing it a second time just because I enjoyed the world and characters so much. Highly recommended.[UPDATE] I just nominated Papo & Yo for the “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award in this year's Steam Awards. It was a tough choice between this, Gone Home, and Valiant Hearts; but there is something special about Papo & Yo. It touches on a subject that has affected me personally, so it ultimately got my vote. I hope you'll consider it, too.			"

												Another Indi classic! I don't want to go into much detail about the game as I feel this would spoil the story line. I love the Indi games that do something different from the main stream of high end games and get back to basics to tell a story. You do get a feel for the story as you play and an idea of what might be coming. What I didn't expect was what the true meaning of the story until the ending which was a joy to experience.The game play is simple, solve some mostly straight forward puzzles with a little exploring. You can't realy wonder from the path of the gameplay.It's a realy enjoyable few hours of game play, beautifuly crafted & to look at. Enjoy :)			"

												I spent an inordinate amount of time holding a tree frog in a hug and running around. And that, I think, is the loveliness of this game. It's quite pretty to look at and the puzzles are so much fun with their chalk magic and childlike solutions. The characters speak in spanish with english subtitles, but this doesn't detract from the game. I haven't made it extremely far, but I will admit that I have no idea why anything is happening. I thought the monster would be bad and so far, it isn't. The little girl we seem hellbent on following is a horrible creature and our little robot sidekick is a unexpected addition. I'm not sure if I missed a cutscene or something to explain some of these strange characters, but the puzzle are satisfying enough that I'm not upset by the storyline (or lack thereof)			"

												Papo & Yo is a quiet game , but it's telling a story contains lots of strong emotions and deep feelings , it needs us to pay a little bit attention to listen and find out . In the begining , everything looked so peaceful , brought me some kind of calmness . As I was going deeper , I couldn't help realizing that Quico has been bearing a lot , that he must protect the ones he loves , help the one who hurts him......that I must help Quico to fix all of this . I think this is the main reason I continued playing . We all make mistakes , grown-up might have a childish immature heart , doing irrational things that only hurt oneself and others , while a little one might have the strongest soul . It doesn't matter how much time that one has been living , what matters the most is that we have the ability to help each other . So I thought the game is about saving an angry monster , and I believed I'd done so . But in the end , I realized there's something beyond salvation . I played as Quico , had to do the final steps by myself , all the conflicts within was about to explode . When it's done , we might understand something .Papo & Yo is a beautiful story , and the story has been being told beautifully . The art is gorgeous in it's own way , very bright and colorful , lighting up the dim raining days , along with the music , creating an exotic world that you want to stay and explore , the ending song is very touching . Lots of elements in the game are symbolic , but it isn't hard to understand , instead , finding out the meaning of these elements by continue playing makes the game more fascinating and engaging . Another thing I love about this game is the level designs . The puzzles are so brilliant and inspiring , you solving them by interacting with the imaginative environment . These two parts are blending in with each other beautifully , for several times I was just ""Wow"" . But every time the monster was in madness , the whole world was immersed in red color , it felt really uncomfortable . And I admit I'm scared of the mad monster , when I was being chased , I could hardly see myself because the monster was so big . The game is a little bit short though , It only took me 4.6h to finish , but I didn't find all the hats , it might be a glitch because I couldn't wear any of them . Papo and Yo is not a perfect game , but it's beautiful and good enough , I strongly recommend it !!!			"

												This game is beautiful and painful. I hold it up to be a near-pristine example of games-as-art and the story contained within was told with the utmost sincerity. All of that's a very fancy, borderline-pretentious way to say that at the end, I cried for an hour straight. I can't recommend it enough, but tread carefully if childhood trauma gets to you in a big way.			"

												I like exploring & puzzling and Papo & Yo's gameplay reminded me a bit of (old) Tomb Raider although it stays on the easier side (nothing too complex or expansive). There were some nice moments & puzzles I thought were cool and/or surprised me. The end came too sudden, though. I expected a few more devious puzzles as a build up to the finale, but as it turn out, the more ""difficult"" environments were set halfway to three-quarters of the game.Still, I enjoyed playing this short game very much and I think the developers of the PC port did a good job. Special mentions go to the music near the end of the game, and one of the better ambient occlusion programming I have seen in a game so far.			"

												In what might be a controversial opinion, I didn't love Papo & Yo, but could appreciate its message. Although many of the areas in the environment felt closed off and not conducive to exploration, the puzzle mechanics rose to the surface and succeeded in captivating my attention. Particularly the dream like sequences, and dream-infused interpretations of the character's father, his rebirth in an imaginary monster, were standouts. Papo & Yo approaches narrative excellence with its devastating final message, which will no doubt resonate with anyone who has had similar expereinces. An extremely moving, thought provoking game that masks an inordinate amount of pain. Well done.			"

												Papo & Yo is pretty decent puzzle platformer. It is also a very touching tale about a child dealing with an abusive father.The story is clearly the highlight here. The game deals with a difficult subject matter in an excellent way. Most of the storytelling is done through actual gameplay too instead of long dialogues or endless cutscenes. This is certainly one of the stronger game narratives I have ever experienced.The South American setting, the art style inspired by magical realism and the great soundtrack are all superb fits for the game too.The game does have a number of issues, however. The puzzles and the platforming both tend to be on the easy side and the puzzles in particular feel like an extended tutorial for the actual game that never materializes. The game also suffers from a number of minor glitches and bugs.Despite the somewhat weak gameplay I found Papo & Yo a great and touching experience. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good stories.The good:- Superb story- Great storytelling- Fitting art style- Nice soundtrackThe bad:- Rather easy- Little short (I finished the game in little over 3 hours)The ugly:- Quite a few bugs and minor glitches			"

												Recommended, but only if it's on sale (I think $5 is fair).The game looks very nice and has an awesome fantasy favela setting, but the puzzles are by and large simple and with one single course of action to be taken each time. It's annoying because there are some great ideas set up but they're never combined to make anything challenging. The only time I got stuck was at the very end, when I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out what I was supposed to do before discovering that a scripted event hadn't triggered as it should have.Story-wise, the monster is apparently our friend, but this is only kind of implied because he doesn't object to us bouncing on his stomach while he's asleep; he never actively helps us. He ignores us unless we're bringing him a coconut, and hates us when he eats frogs, until we find him some rotten fruit to calm him down. But even when he's in angry flaming mode he's not much of a threat, just an annoyance. You can't die in this game, so he just throws you around, frustrating your attempts to solve the timed puzzles.With a more engaging story and some more interesting puzzles, or even a co-op mode, this could be something really cool. It's like a long introduction to the game's characters and mechanics, but then once you're starting to get into it, it's all over. I know this review makes it sound like I didn't like it, but I did enjoy playing it. I was just disappointed that by the end it felt like less than the sum of its parts.			"

												Oh man, this game.This game started off as just a fun ride for me. I liked the puzzles a lot, and the gameplay mechanics. I love how you have to change the world around you to continue. Very good.Before getting through the game, I got curious as to what the meaning behind the monster is so I looked up the game and found an interview with the man behind the masterpiece.I've got to say, knowing how he felt, and what he went through made this game a far more emotional experience the entire way through. Maybe it would have felt shocking at the end if I hadn't looked into it first, but knowing the details before really playing it made it hurt me.There were times when I hated the monster, and times when I loved having the monster around. There were times when the girl annoyed me, and pain when she (for reasons I will not spoil) had to leave. The loss of Lula after just getting her back was so painful I started to tear up. This game devastated my emotions, and was a very real experience for me because my brother has a very similar and real problem (again, don't want to spoil it for readers who haven't played) that so far hasn't been remedied, and much like the Quico I've felt like no matter what I do I can't save him.Complimented by a beautiful soundtrack, I really felt this game was one of the best I've ever played, guaranteed. Really recommend playing it if you haven't, and really look forward to games from Minority in the future.			"

												It's a surprisingly affecting story. The monster, Papo, is a metaphor for the alcoholic father of the game's director. But what could have easily been a preachy mess turns out to be an engaging puzzle game with a poignant story. The Brazilian favela makes for an interesting setting, the music is lovely, and the ending actually chocked me up. The only downside is that it's quite short, only about 3-4 hours, but I ended up playing it a second time just because I enjoyed the world and characters so much. Highly recommended.[UPDATE] I just nominated Papo & Yo for the “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award in this year's Steam Awards. It was a tough choice between this, Gone Home, and Valiant Hearts; but there is something special about Papo & Yo. It touches on a subject that has affected me personally, so it ultimately got my vote. I hope you'll consider it, too.			"

												This short puzzle game is an extraordinary example of storytelling through symbolism.  The world exists in the imagination of a child tormented and trying to escape an abusive father with alcoholism.  The powerful symbolic nature of the child needing yet fearing his parent (monster) to progress through the game's (life's) obstacles.The environmental puzzles themselves are usually straightforward. If the player gets stumped, there is a box nearby that will give you hints on how to complete it.  I would recommend using an Xbox 360 or similar controller.5/5 stars			"

												Holy crap.  I was about to give this a thumbs down, but after the ending and the story, I can't possibly do that.  This game gets an A++ in environment graphic design, atmosphere, and story.  However, it gets a major D- (not quite failing but pretty close) in gameplay, puzzle design, and gameplay mechanics.  My favorite thing about this game is the incredibly trippy atmosphere and animations.  Seriously: Think of the Doctor Strange movie, except instead of Benedict Cumberbatch you play as a 10 year old boy, and instead of finding medical help for your hand, in this game you find medical help for your pet monster.The story is simple. You are a boy (quico) who loves two things with all his heart: His pet monster ""yo,"" and his friend robot ""lula.""  The problem is, Yo is addicted to poisonous frogs, which turn him into a raging fiery demon when he gets them.  The entire story is really cute and happy-go-lucky.  For a while I thought the writers lived in a bubble of happiness and innocence.  But then in the last 10% of the game, it gets dark.  REALLY dark.  I'm talking ""Bridge to Terabithia,"" childhood innocence-turned trauma status.  And not just because of violence or mature themes.  No, I mean this tackles a very real and serious social issue that ruins the lives of millions throughout the world.  You can't see it coming for a while, but when you realize the true ""innocence lost"" at the ending, it's incredibly harrowing.  I started tearing up.  For anyone who wants to spoil it, the social truth behind the game is:  This game is one big metaphor for kids with violently abusive and alcoholic parents.  The graphics, by the way, are top-notch, for 2013 and even for 2017.  It takes place in a south american favela-style environment.  The sunshine, shadow, and texturing effects look stunning.  There's one major flaw with the game, and that's the actual gameplay.  This game really doesn't have any puzzles whatsoever.  It's mainly just ""see something that looks weird, go up to it, notice it moves a platform, jump on that platform and repeat.""  I think there might have only been one or two times where I actually had to think about what to do and comprehend the situation, which should be a given for every single puzzle in any adequate puzzle game.  They're bland and straightforward.  There even came a point near the end of the game where the solutions *LITERALLY* showed up directly in front of your character as they arose.  That's ridiculous.  The game and its controls run very fluidly, but your movement sometimes feel stiff due to its seeming exception from the laws of physics.  Parkour-esque movement would have been KEY to this game, but it felt more like a literal platform-hopping game.  In conclusion, lemme repeat my original grading:Story: A+Environment: A+Atmosphere: APuzzles: FGameplay: DGraphics: B++For 15$, I'm shrugging.  It's definitely not worth the money, but I don't think it would disappoint that badly.  I got the game in a massive humble bundle, so it was somewhat free for me (though not technically), so I am not complaining either way.  It took me nearly 4 hours to beat, which is definitely on the much shorter end as others have complained, but I'd say 4 hours is hearty enough for me to feel a little disappointed; but not shocked or ripped off.  It's an ""ok"" value for the content.However, if you're one for emotionally gripping stories and innocence-lost narratives (I feel like the vibe of Bridge to Terabithia is actually a very accurate analogy to the emotions I got from this game), this is an absolute golden nugget.

												The platforming was just how I like it; impressively responsive and not relying on testing how finicky you can be in testing its parameters but instead putting you in environments that test your nerves instead.The story was very delicately told and Papo and Yo is far from a Super Mario game in its setting; exchanging cute and colourful for natural tones, abstract, moody and cinematic its very Alice in Wonder Land at times with loads of resonating character it all very surreal. There are some adorable moments; your interaction with chubby big eyed frogs, the hint boxes were the best execution I have seen for giving a hint to players in game, and the characters themselves have much more depth than I am used in any video game.Papo and Yo is strikingly original at times and if there is one thing the majority of its reviews agree on its that Papo and Yo's strongest point is its a charming and eloquently told story that is of something the medium desperately needs: something to contemplate and something human.

It definitely struck a deep chord. T.TCons-Sometimes if you stand too close to an object and move the camera, everything goes black (this could be a graphics card issue though?). -I wanted to explore more than i was allowed to. I really liked finding the doll in each level and wanted more hidden treasures. -On the short side, I spend a lot of time trying to explore and messing around and I finished it in less than 6 hours.
