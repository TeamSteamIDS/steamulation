												Let me just start by saying this game is cheezy, like a bad horror movie, and as a lover of bad horror movies, I love it to death. I loved it on the PS2 when I was 15, and I love it now. That said, if you cannot stomach bad voice acting, this might not be for you. It ping pongs back and forth between being quite good and laughably awful, but when given a chance it has some very tense moments, and the port is, in my opinion, a very good one all things considered. There is the issue that the game is not in widescreen, but it also wasn't on my PS2 so I am not terribly concerned with it. More important to me was the controller support, which thank god was added. There are also some token achievements for those who like that sort of thing, so overall, I am impressed. Overall, if you like cheap horror or old school survival horror, download this little cheap game and have a few hours of fun with it.			"

												Combine a storyline more loopy and incoherent than almost every Japanese anime ever made, a cumbersome real-time item-choosing system guaranteed to make you use those medkits even faster, a save system which ensures you'll have to waste countless minutes at a time getting back to the bit which killed you in the first place, the occasional obstructive ""camera angle"" almost deliberately designed to ♥♥♥♥ you six-ways-to-Sunday, and some of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest boss fights in all of video game history...and what do you have?  Well, oddly enough, a mostly enjoyable and worthwhile gaming experience...but ONLY if you've already played several dozen other post-Resident Evil third-person ""survival horror"" games, and are so addicted to such curiosities that you'll endure almost any level of punishment in search of that next elusive ""fix"".   I recently played and wrote a review of the first Obscure in which I declared it a ""pleasant surprise"", or words to roughly that effect.  Given that I had slightly higher expectations of this one in the wake of its more-than-serviceable predecessor, I wouldn't say that I'm ""disappointed"" so much as a little bewildered at just how nutty and, well, frankly ""incompetent"" this one so often is.     Don't get me wrong: There's a lot of REALLY GOOD IDEAS here.  One improvement it arguably makes over the original are the very distinct ""special abilities"" which each character has, all of which you will at some point REQUIRE to make progress through the game (as opposed to the ""vaguely-useful-but-mostly-inessential"" abilities evidenced by most of the characters in Obscure 1).  To this effect, most of the puzzle-solving in this game is actually quite clever (though asking the player to pick a tricky lock puzzle in the midst of the climactic boss fight while a monster clobbers you from the side was perhaps pushing the friendship a little)!  And the learning curve applied to these virtual ""mini-game-within-a-game""s is mostly realistic and achievable, even for a certifiable doofus such as I.  The scenery is also frequently interesting and varied...perhaps a little TOO varied for realistic geography purposes, but never mind (just think of it like one of those epic sword-and-sorcery fantasy worlds where a blazingly hot desert and an icy wasteland are just a hop, skip and a jump away from each other...apparently suburban high schools and spooky, near-desolate islands inhabited by in-bred Texas Chainsaw rejects do much the same thing).  It's also a game with lots of ""personality"", not least of all within the characters themselves...plenty of entertaining banter and carry-on whilst the gameplay continues unabated, giving it a convincingly ""cinematic"" feel and making you actually ""care"" a little more for the fate of said characters than your average paper cut-out video game personas (off the top of my head, the Walking Dead and Left 4 Dead games are about the only other horror titles so earnestly devoted to giving their protagonists more than two dimensions).   Look, it's pretty clear by now that I have a certain fondness for these games, even if this one in particular infuriated me almost to the point of electronic pulpification.  Mostly I'm just relieved that there was never an Obscure 3, 'cause you know that I'd feel obliged to play it, and judging by the quality arc this series has evidenced thus far, it would probably be almost intolerably ""bad"".  ALMOST.  In the tradition of the best ""trashy"" horror films, let's just chalk this one up as a ""guilty pleasure""...even if the ""pleasure"" parts only seem to come in spurts...Verdict: 8/10.			"

												It's hard to decide where to start with this one. But I'll start by saying that Obscure: The Aftermath was one hell of a good game and deserves a lot more than the 59 rating it received on Metacritic. This is truly a unique game that has never really been done before. A mix of Resident Evil and Silent Hill with a combat system that isn't♥♥♥♥♥ (Not saying RE and SH's combat systems are♥♥♥♥♥but it's not fluid and it's just tricky mostly, coming from a huge fan of both series.). Obscure gives you a mix of a good combat system that's fluid and like a classic survival horror having to stop to reload or swing your melee weapon and pretty good co-op gameplay, one of the only true survival horror games that has co-op and it was indeed creepy, co-op doesn't make a game less scary.Pros:+Good looking for it's age, not super dated.+Great co-op and gameplay mechanics/puzzles, not too hard, not too simple.+Intriguing story that you'll want to know more about and hope for a third game, likable characters although they are pretty cliche. Stoner, techie, vixen, jock, comedian and goth.+Nice control scheme, X360 controller support with button prompts and vibration.+Practical Achievements.+Mostly bug free and stable.+Creature designs.+Fun boss fights.+Just the perfect difficulty.Cons:-Voice acting is hit and miss.-Pre-rendered cutscenes are pretty badly lip synced at times or are in general not very good looking and often times in-game cutscenes are better.-No widescreen support at all, resolution options are there but the game is letterboxed at 4:3 with side borders.-Camera can sometimes be weird, though in co-op each player can focus the camera on themselves hitting the right trigger in case they get stuck on a creature or need to have each player in a different location.-Some bosses can continuously hit you if you get smacked into the perfect position and some boss fights have un-dodgeable moves, no warm-up animations or signs they'll be using their OP move that can't be dodged but most boss fights aren't super difficult.Other Thoughts:Now I know you must be thinking: ""Wow, that's a lot of cons...sounds like a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥.."" well the positives outweigh the cons by a huge margin and honestly the camera isn't that bad and the lip-syncing/hit and miss VA work is understandable for a French indie developer title that released on multiple platforms in 2007, honestly the most annoying aspect of this game is the lack of widescreen support that was available on the PSP version which I had but didn't get the chance to play.I'd highly recommend this game, specially for someone who just wants a creepy game in general with a good story or someone looking for GOOD scary co-op fun. That game is pretty short but felt almost perfect in length for me and you may need to play it twice to unlock all achievements, I missed one small key so I'll probably blow back through it again.I did not play the original one all the way through, only the very beginning, but I will definitely pick it up when I feel like.

												This is a crazy sequel for the original Obscure. As a fan of the first game, I disliked the first half of the story, but it gains so much on the second half that, for me, this game is as good as the original. The steam version runs fine, no bugs, decent controls, some little issues with the camera, but nothing too serious. If you like the first Obscure, get the second one. You will regret nothing.			"

												Obscure 2 is an extremely stupid game.This 2007 horror game by Hydravision Entertainment (now Mighty Rocket Studio) is a direct sequel to the 2004 survival game of the same name. Obscure 2 is not a love-letter to b-list horror titles, it is a b-list horror title.Important to note that Obscure 2 is compatible with both Xbox and Dualshock. Like the previous game, I'd strongly recommend using one.Sequels are a tricky affair in any situation. For all the cries of innovation, a certain degree of iteration is expected of any game with the same name slapped on it - a lesson Mighty Rocket Studio learned when they attempted to reboot Obscure and ended up pressured into renaming it ""Final Exam"". Obscure 2 is so heavily intertwined with the original that it's impossible to review it without heavy comparison. There's heavy improvements - most notably, from the getgo, melee is not only tolerable but almost fun. Devil May Cry isn't in danger of being displaced from the top of the food chain, but hitting enemies with the weapons the game throws at you is no longer a nightmare in itself. The characters swinging the bats have received similar improvement.At the cost of the ""anyone can die"" gimmick, characters now have variety, depth, story arcs, and dialogue, and aren't just completely interchangeable and forgettable. I almost got attached to some of the new and returning characters during the calmer moments where duos would banter. Calmer moments that are also heavily improved - the puzzles, from the minigames to the environmental work - is leagues ahead of Obscure's, despite the new action focus.On top of all this, it looks better - character models are respectable and environments much more detailed and interactive (with an insane amount of flavour text in select areas). None of which disguises the hilariously bad plot. Obscure 2's plot is full of holes, contrivances, retcons, arbitrary character shifts and terrifying CGs nestled comfortably in the pit of the Uncanny Valley. Even if not compared to the first game's flimsy pretext, Obscure 2's plot goes to insane and hilarious over-the-top places, while remaining completely straight-faced, even retroactively turning Obscure's plot into a land of stupidity. And you know none of it is ironic, because the developers are French. It is a joy on every level.But this came at a heavy cost.The beautiful level design  that intertwined with pleasing complexity is axed in favour of a completely linear game to almost corridor levels. The slowly filled-in maps are gone, along with maps altogether. The haunting camera angles are gone. The suspense-laden pacing is gone. The flashlight mechanics are gone. The atmosphere is completely brutalized and thrown out the window in favour of an action game with action pacing.That's without mentioning that co-op is now mandatory - and while the AI is no longer borderline useless, you now get to watch them walk over and over into enemy's reaches while handling ranged weapons and sucking up your extremely scarce resources, and then refusing to get out of the way while attempting to explore. As many failed attempts at escort missions and multiplayer games have proved - it's not fun to babysit the braindead.Even with the action horror and better controls, Obscure 2 sacrifices so much of what made the first one special that it feels completely underwhelming as a result. It's no longer surprising that Hydravision went on to make one of the worst-received Alone in the Dark titles. Play it for the camp plot, but if you're looking for more of the well-designed brilliance that was on par with the great Survival Horrors, you're going to be disappointed. I still recommend Obscure 2 - but it's a lukewarm recommendation.			"

												So I went and beat the first obscure game because I bought the obscure bundle. I loved every minute of it and wish it didn't end, it was a very good, B horror flick type of horror game. So then I went on to this one. This one has made definite improvements to the combat however this can be seen as a detriment as well. While the combat was improved the layout of the game is hindered and much more linear which to me is a bad thing. Story is actually worse than the first, but still in the B horror movie flick sort of way. Given how I was so used to the first obscures controls, camera angle, and combat, this game was difficult for me to get into. All that being said, I am still a fan of this series and I do believe the bundle in particular is worth the price for these games.			"

												Obscure 2 is a lot like the first, it's still a good game, very b-horror and uses all the horror movie cliches that you would come to expect, cheesy story but enjoyable, sterotyped characters will make you laugh. Gameplay was good but if you didn't like Obscure then you're probably not going to like this one. Combat system was okay, no big changes from the first game, i found melee weapons a little hard to use on some enemies which was not good when i was trying to conserve ammo, the puzzles were interesting and more challenging than the first game. Graphics are okay but no real improvement over the previous game. Level design was pretty cool and the soundtrack was awesome. If you buy this expecting a scary horror game you'll be disapointed, if you want a funny b-horror game than get this.			"

												Just when you thought the events of Obscure was going to end but NOPE! The horror is back and it gets worse too! Just like Obscure, Obscure 2 (The Aftermath) is another classic gem/nostalgia game if you ever played this game on the PS2. I like the new environments and the new characters on this game but some of the characters from Obscure come back to Obscure 2 world and face the horrific nightmare again! Except this time your characters are College students. I love the plot of the game, the music of the game, and I absolutely love the atmosphere! I also love the music at the main menu of Obscure 2! But there's one thing that I didn't like about Obscure 2 which is its Camera angles/movements. If you move around or turn around a alot with a weapon out, the camera will go bonkers! But besides that con, this game is awesome! This game (hell buy Obscure 1 and Obscure 2) if you like playing survival horror games! I highly recommend it!			"

												where to start well the gameplays like your average ps1/2 era survival horror game but wit a twist. every one the the playable characters has a skill from brute power to logic and reasoning. unlike horror games of the era i dose not use the resident evil style Tank controls but rather the modern 3D control style. the game can be played with a Xbox control and the keys support custom controls to your liking there are no graphics options beyond resolution. the FMVs are full screen altho a bit blurry but the ingame graphics arnt bad for a 8 year old game the monsters are very silenthill/parasite eve esq. the weapons range from hockeysticks to shotguns and the puzzles are enough to keep you entertained. the game can be played in a local drop in style of CO-OP which can be hilarious. i played this with my wife and she spent moretime hitting me with the bat than the monsters. the music is nice again reminds me a lot of silenthill which is not a bad thing. so to sum up i recommend this game for survival horror fans and alike.

I've killed some brain cellsI honestly believe the game is underrated. It just came out too late (at least 5 years I believe), when horror genre already went the other way.Optional second player on the same screen stealing the camera focus, weird camera positions, auto-aim, cheesy dialogues, flat characters, weird save system, lack of widescreen support and some techical issues make the game look bleak by modern standards.Nevertheless today it's an original artifact of a niche jenre which is sadly almost extinct these days.

												**MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**The original Obscure shocked everyone when it was released on PS2 and Xbox in 2004. What was expected to be a dime-a-dozen, bargain bin action game was actually a budget horror title with a pretty good story, graphics, and gameplay featuring co-op that you could play with a friend. It was a surprise hit that received critical acclaim across the board. A co-op survival horror experience that was the first of it's kind, and for a price that nobody could complain about.The story was right out of a 90's teen-horror movie, and greatly resembles the horror film, The Faculty. One character, Stan, even looks exactly like Josh Hartnett. Five high school students become trapped in their school and must survive against deformed creatues who thrive in the shadows. Using flashlights and whatever else they can get their hands on, the students battle their way into the bowels of the school to stop whatever is causing the carnage. Each student has their own abilities. The strong, jock character can run fast and move heavy objects,  the stoner can pick locks, etc. The main objective of the game was the keep the five kids alive to obtain the best ending. If one of the teens die, they stay dead forever. The emphasis of the game was definitely survival.Obscure II (known in the U.S. as Obscure: The Aftermath) came out in 2007. Three of the survivors from the first game make return appearances alongside several new characters. The core gameplay remains the same, but instead of keeping the teens alive, the concentration is more on the narrative. If one of the teens dies, it's game over and you have to restart. No multiple endings this time around, just stay alive until the end.Obscure II see's some improvements from the previous game. When readying an attack, the camera switches to a RE4-style camera, and gives you a target marker, making it easier to attack and switch between oncoming enemies. In the first game you just had to aim and hope for the best. The camera itself is slightly easier to control, giving you full 3D control in most areas.It does have it's downsides. There are save points throughout the game, where in the first game you collected CD's and you could save on the spot. The big downside to this is that you can only use a save point ONCE then it's gone. And the stretches between save points can be long and riddled with enemies. Even though the melee combat is improved, like the first game, using melee weapons is a crapshoot. Getting too close to the enemy always results in unecessary hits. You have firearms, but your instinct is always to save ammunition, and this game isn't too generious with ammo pickups. The enemy A.I. is very cheap and will gang up on you in an instant. Partner A.I. is spotty, and usually ends up wasting precious ammo if you give them a gun (like Sheva in RE5).Obscure II has to have THE MOST DEPRESSING STORY of any game I have ever played. There is a flower growing throughout a college campus called ""Black Lotus"" by the students. The students learn that you can inhale it and get extremely high, so it's popularity begins to spread. One night during a frat party, monsters begin to show up and slaughter the students. Kevin, Shannon, and Stan return from the first Obscure alongside newcomers Corey, Mei, Amy, and Sven. Like the first game, they all have their own unique abilites that will guide you through the puzzles and obstacles you encounter. Remember when I said it's more about the narrative? Well that's because PEOPLE WILL DIE. Like Game of Thrones, the people you least expect to go get slaughtered in horrific ways. The fates of some of these characters is gruesome and sometimes heartbreaking, making this story much darker and more depressing than the first game.If you played the first Obscure, the second is worth your time. LIke the first game it is challenging and entertaining in it's own way. Good story, memorable characters, and decent gameplay keep it interesting for the 6 to 8 hours it will take you to complete it.			"

												Aaah, Obscure 2. You see, the first Obscure game was sort of a hidden gem, a game that was kinda wonky and extremely short, but it had its charm. I remember it fondly, because I play it a lot when it first came out, and I had fun playing local co-op with my friends. The music was interesting, the ambience was pretty good, and even for an old game, the graphics were quite decent. Then, Obscure 2 came around. I dunno what to say about this one, I feel like I wanna love it, but it's just rather boring at times. Unlike the first Obscure, which was a cult classic among fans of this kind of games, Obscure 2 just kinda went by. None of my friends played it, it seems like it was all in all, an even more ""Obscure"" game than the first one. I wanted to play it back then, but then I sold my PS2 and I lost the chance. After all these years, they re-released it on steam, and I had to give it a try.Now, where do I begin? Obscure had charm, and it seems like this game seriously lacks it. The voice acting isn't anything outstanding, and the re-appearing characters got a voice change. This game is really, really cheesy, the cutscenes and the dialog from the characters range from mildly funny to seriously cringe worthy. Then again, they are teenagers, so, hooray for realism? CUTSCENESThe cutscenes didn't age well at all, the characters are deep in the uncanny valley, and most of the time, it's just painful to watch how their mouths and voices try to sync, and fail. Then again, this is an old game, so, I'm willing to let it slip. But wait, there's games older than this one that had half decent cutscenes, so what's wrong with this one? No clue.MUSICThe music is pretty awesome, the soundtrack ranges from choir to stuff with heavy guitars mixed with said choir. Most of the songs are a remix of the main theme (Which is awesome, by the way.), but sometimes, they just don't fit the mood of the cutscene or stage they are placed in. This is a hit and miss, but I personally enjoyed it.CONTROLS AND GAMEPLAYIn the first game, you could finish the game with all of your characters making it out of the school alive. Death was permanent, so you had to reload if one of them died and you wanted to keep them around. In this game, most of the characters (Except for two of them) are doomed by plot. No matter what you do, their time will come, and most of the time their deaths are a bit underwhelming, I think it has to do with the fact that the cutscenes are rather crude and the voice acting is lame at times. This seriously hurts the game. The controls are wonky and the camera work feels sloppy at times. I played this with a mouse and keyboard, and in the first game, the camera was mostly fixed, like in old school survival horror games like Resident Evil, with a bit of Silent Hill thrown in when the camera was following you. In this game, you've got ""full"" control of the camera. And I'm saying ""full"", because sometimes it's just so unresponsive, that it ends up being frustrating. Your character aims to whatever he or she feels like even if there's a bigger threat in front of you, which can be problematic. Sometimes, you try to aim at something that's off screen, coming towards you. And the game just does NOT let you focus the camera on said threat, so you gotta fire blindly. If there's more than a single enemy, this is quite a problem. AIThis game was made with local co-op in mind, and that's okay, it's a rather hilarious yet pleasant experience if you play it like that. But my god, the AI in this game if you're not playing with a partner is atrocious at times. When you switch weapons, your secondary character will keep the last weapon you were holding in your hands. The AI will switch weapons depending on how big the threat in front of you is, like switching to a melee weapon if there's small spiders in front of you, or switching to a bigger gun if there's something like a berserker. The problem is, the AI sometimes disregards this, and keeps wasting flares (Rare) on lurkers (Rather weak enemies), or rushing a berserker (A rather dangerous, heavy hitting enemy) with a baseball bat. And they are notoriously poor at dodging enemy attacks. Most of the time they will just stand there and take it, or follow you and get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because they walk and stop, walk and stop, even if you keep moving. This ends up wasting a lot of your healing items. At least they are plentiful.ENDING AND REPLAY VALUEUnlike the first game, this one does NOT have any unlockables after you finish the game. No new game+, no extra items, nothing, so, once you're done with this rather short game (Around 2-8 hours of gameplay, depends on how familiarized you're with the game), that's pretty much it. There's little when it comes to alternate routes, there's no different endings, and there's no unlockables, so there's pretty much no replay value. Now, the ending. It felt quite underwhelming, and it will probably disappoint you if you were expecting something awesome. FINAL VERDICTWhile I actually enjoyed this game, it felt like a step down from the first Obscure. It's quite frustrating at times, and boring sometimes. I wouldn't recommend this unless it's on sale, unless you like campy horror games. If you're the average Joe, you might find this a waste of your time. I'd say give it a try, play this game yourself and see if you like it. This one gets a big maybe? I'll give it a 6/10 ♥♥♥♥s.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Horror Survival game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou are able to play the game with a xbox controller.You are able to change the brightness.You are able to change the resolution size.You can not change the volume, unless you go to your own speaker.You are able to change the controls to keyboard and xbox controller.About the game.You are playing with a group of characters. Each with their own strength and you can cycle through them. You are only allowed to play 2 characters at once. You have to solve puzzles, beat enemies and deal with alot of wonkiness. Enemies are not that scary and the game is not really that horrorish. The game has no jumpscare which is already a plus. You are able to destroy vending machines to get a energy drink. Energy drinks will restore health. The combat is very wonky and you can't defend yourself beside hitting the enemy. The game has a story but i don't really get it.Controls could be sometimes wonky.Combat is Wonky.Mouse and keyboard is super wonky.Camera could be sometimes wonky.AI team mate are stupid and blocks you all the time.Soundtrack sometimes stop instantly or it comes up for no reason.Cutscene animation is weird.Graphical animation is weird.Has weak ending.You can only play this game Local Co-op or single player.Other things.Those black things on the wall are save points. They aren't dangerous.Alot of wonkiness.AI team mate likes to block you.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"

												Obscure 2 is a more streamlined experience than the first game. It’s much more linear and more focused which can be both a good or bad thing depending on your preference. In the first game you were given the whole school to explore, while in this game you are always focused on one path and constantly switching between characters in different locations for different perspectives. One thing that I failed to mention when reviewing the first game was the soundtrack, it was really good and it is even better in this game. Another thing that I noticed in this game was how hidden the progression was to the next area or an item you are looking for. Because the game uses fixed camera angles for most of the game it’s sometimes hard to spot a door that has a window that you can break to get through because the door is at the edge of the screen and you can’t see it very well. Maybe if the game was widescreen and it didn’t have black bars on the side this wouldn’t have maybe been an issue but there were moments where I was stuck and the solution was very vague and hard to spot. Some of the puzzles are very cryptic and difficult to solve which got annoying. Story and characters are just as stupid as the first game nothing has changed there. The combat is less clunky, the animations are better and the lock on works much better. But overall I found the first game more enjoyable, I think the level design was more unique in the first game and it just had better moments overall. But this is still a worthy sequel that's worth playing if you enjoyed the first game.6/10 (Decent)			"

												I swear, it lives up to its literal title. It just ruined me. I would have said the first game sealed the deal, but nothing prepared me for this. So if you want to punish yourself with teenagers, get absolutely angry, just lose yourself, or just enjoy the entertainment value, this game will be for you. (also, this game is not co-op friendly due to the bad camera controls, but it's still playable) "

												Obscure 2 is a dissapointing sequel to Obscure. While it still eschews teen horror clichés and quite a bit of intentional cheesiness and campiness, the game for some reason includes monster♥♥♥♥♥♥ monster pregnancy and suicide which are very jarring to the overall tone of the game. The gameplay is fun if unpolished and the combat system is even clunkier than O1.If you long for a late 2000s low budget survival horror, you could pick much worse.			"

												Great Sequal to a great old school horror game. The game has a really good story, nice difficulty (was out of ammo a couple of times because I wasted a lot of ammo) good sound and generally a good feeling to it. Gameplay wise it's fantastic as well. The only thing that was annoying were some puzzles. Not the puzzles themselves but rather how they're just trial&error, with no clues hinting towards what to do.			"

												Listen, this is a fun game, but its not a great game. If you have played the first Obscure, then you can see how inferior this game is to that version. The voice acting is different, the characters make no sense from the first game to this one, the saving feature is just plain stupid, and the story goes all over the place. The first Obscure game kept you localized to the school, whereas this one takes you from a house, to the school, back to the house, to the woods, back to the school, and then randomly introduces a whole new character that you have to fight at the end that makes zero sense. This is all of course not to mention the clunkiness of the controls if you arent playing with a controller. I had fun playing this game, but I cant really recommend it simply because of all of the flaws listed above. If you absolutely have to play it, then play it. Its not bad, its just a letdown after playing the first Obscure :( Check out my playthrough video here:

												Unfortunately Obscure 2 doesn't hold up to the original (which had plenty of flaws on its own).Pros:- The story is better and more involved, characters are more fleshed out, voice acting is a bit better, etc.- Switching between characters is now not only meaningful, but required to progress.- Larger variety of weapons- Unique puzzles (most quite clever, apart from the last one, which is actually confusing if you overthink it...like I did)- Larger variety of enemies- Marginally better graphicsCons:- The story presentation might be better, but unfortunately, most of the mystery is gone now and instead replaced with some kind of illuminati ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and some (almost) retcons...that don't even add anything to the overall story arch- The camera is more of a ♥♥♥♥♥ than ever and is a serious detriment to the game- Melee weapons are pretty useless and only get you killed, however, ammo and healing items are sparse, so you often HAVE to resort to beating a big monster with a hockey stick, which goes about as well as you would expect it to. The result: Frequent use of healing items, because you take unavoidable damage. Melee weapons do almost no damage and monsters can attack through your attacks, meaning even timing is useless. Since they also leap at you from long range, have fun...fighting anything bigger than a standard ""zombie"" with a melee weapon is a death sentence, so I hope you know how to conserve ammo.- Weapons are not found anymore (most of them at least), but actually have to be unlocked via chests. These chests can only be opened with 3 small keys found around the area. Miss only ONE key and that also means you can't open the chest in that area, which in turn means, you're going to collect a lot of ammo for weapons you don't have...yay. Hunting for the keys for a reward is fine, that reward being the only way to get a new weapon is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, however.- The AI is dumb as hell again and will happily either just stand there taking hits, walk into bad stuff, use important items and ammo for trivial encounters, etc. And outside of combat they will ALWAYS stand in your way and not move away. Thanks to collision that is a major pain in the butt.- Character deaths in-game mean restarting from a checkpoint. Characters now only permanently die as part of the story.- Saving can only be done at certain save points. Once. There can easily be 20 or more minutes between each individual save point in some areas (I think I counted about 16 or so). This is a major step back to the limited saves system in the original.- No difficulty option- Combat still terrible in general, thanks to camera and movement as well as reloading mechanic- Sound assets also still terrible- Inventory management is a pain and for some reason it doesn't matter which characters you control, they always retain the group's weapons. This would be ok, if you only switched characters at gathering points, but mostly you don't even have a choice, the game just assigns you 2 characters for a certain part of the game. Now, somehow that dude that got split up from the group has the same weapons my other guys should technically have...- The levels are for the most part very simple and one way. Compared to the semi open game world of the first game it's a bit disappointing, but then again, the overall area is a lot larger. Still, they could have solved this maybe differently with multiple large ""hub areas"" to explore, instead of ""traditional levels"".- Only about 5-6 hours again. Maybe that's a good thing though. Otherwise the rage meter would be building up too high.Overall, Obscure 2 is a game no one needs to play. For me the story ends after the first game. It had a definitive ending. This one obviously ends on a cliff hanger with a potential for a 3rd one, which is very unlikely by now. Don't even know who has the license to that series...You may want to pick it up as part of a bargain deal, but don't expect much.			"

												I just can't do it, the first Obscure game grasped what a B movie horror is, even though it had it's clunky stuff with the controls and the exaggerated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ characters, but the redeeming factor of these issues were that the controls were working and the characters didn't get screen time, the cutscenes were minimal. Now Obscure 2 made these two so f'ing bad, that I can't bear to play this game anymore.The controls were reworked to some TPS/classical survival horror controls hybrid and it's awful. Just in the first five minutes my character wasn't visible on the screen while I was controlling it. The camera angles are changing by themselves and you can control them too, it's just something I think don't work well together, especially when the execution is so terrible. I have no idea why they implemented this TPS type of feel to the game, the combat is more hectic and chaotic from it, you autolock on stuff and you press left click hoping that they will die before your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI partner does. Sure, you can play co-op, but I don't know anybody in a 10 mile area who wants to play Obscure 2, ♥♥♥♥ me I guess. Also the enemies are faster, which makes the left clicking and AI not keeping distance even more exciting.And the storytelling, there are too many dialogues. This sounds ridiculous, but hear me out. When you have annoying teens as your characters who are also underdeveloped and dumb as ♥♥♥♥ you probably want to use them simply as moving flesh to hack. But no, Obscure 2 had to make them talk every 2 minutes, using cringe-worthy and overacted lines. You probably saw it coming, but the voice acting is obviously terrible, so that doesn't help the case.The only positive thing is that they toned down the loud and unfitting music from the first game, they do this rarely now. The atmosphere also stayed the same as in the first game (not considering the constant hair pulling from the things read above), which is great.If you liked the first one maybe, but only if you feel like you can handle the more trashy nature of this game than that one.

												A sequel that follows in the steps of the first Obscure with a few different ideas,but that ultimately fails to solve the issues found in the previous game while introducing a few new ones.Pros:-improved graphics-soundtrack is still good,and beautifully haunting at times-characters are slightly more fleshed out and now actually have different skills needed to progress -more variety in monster encountersCons:-too coop reliant,the parner AI is often horrible,they can't keep their distance from monsters even if using ranged weapons,are slow to follow and sometimes get in the way during combat or exploration-combat is still clunky and ankward,made worse by the fact that most enemies move faster now and by the bad partner AI,even simple fights can get aggravating and send you back to the previous checkpoint-new save system (one time use fixed save points) leads to frustration,some save points are 10/15 mins apart (with cutscenes/minigames to do again if you or your brainless AI partner dies)-dialogues and characters are even more cheesy than before,some lines are downright laughable-skill minigames offer nothing new and some can get frustrating (like lockpicking,thankfully there's FAQs around if you get stuck)-loot spawn systems (where items/ammo spawn only if the game thinks you don't have enough of a certain item type when you enter a place) can leave you stranded at the worst possible momentOverall,as a single player experience,I found Obscure 2 to be lacking due to the uneven difficulty created by the checkpoint system,the bad AI and the clunky controls...if you want to see what Obscure was all about I'd say the first game offers a better experience overall.You'd find some of the problems I've encountered might be lessened by having a coop partner take over the AI companion...if so I'd see this as a possible decent purchase when on sale,but no matter what Obscure 2 feels underwhelming overall.

The game also laggs like hell for me on my high end system while Obscure I has better ""widescreen support"" and runs smoothly while Obscure 2 laggs, ♥♥♥♥ING LEGITIt would be fine if I could just play with my controller but apprently the game only supports Xbox 360 controllersGOOD ♥♥♥♥ING WORK ITS NOT LIKE THE GAME CAME OUT FOR PS2 AND SO ON AND DOING SUPPORT FOR THOSE CONTROLLERS IS NOT HARD AT ALL. Also I readed online that they announced widescreen feature, well, TOO BAD ITS NOT ♥♥♥♥ING WIDESCREEN...got black bars on the side, Im seeing my mouse ingame, the controllers dont get supported, just WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥? I feel extremely betrayed for my money, I mean this is just plain stupid, its not that hard to polish the game a little up. I mean the game itself is great and incredible, especially in coop but with all these ""problems"" I rather download the game per torrent now cause there I dont have this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. As long as they at least did not implement widescreen support, DO NOT BUY. If they did you might have some fun while always seeing your mouse ingame..or maybe you got a Xbox 360 controller after all but im not a fan of that.To summarize that: Unplayable -> strong lag on high end system/obscure I runs fine and stuff like Metro2033 too, no widescreen, seeing my mouse ingame, no proper controller support3/9/2015STILL NO WIDESCREEN SUPPORTYou can choose 1920x1080 but black bars -.- Still continueing with the Retail version...

												If you can get past some slightly funky controls and camera angles, Obscure II offers some quality fun for a small price. The local co-op enhances the fun where another player can join with a controller. But, once again, the funky camera can be a damper on things. As far as the story goes, there is much better out there, and as a solo game, I don't believe Obscure II is all that special by itself. However, playing the sequel after pplaying the original, that opened up the story much more for me personally, as it may for you if you played both. To anyone it may concern, the M rating for the game is well deserved as almost the entirety of the game's story revolves around sexual assault by a demonic plant created monster spawn. 6/10 would recommend.

												Obscure II is the sequel to Obscure. The gameplay mechanics are quite unique though a bit wonky and it has a nice blend of Silent Hill, Amnesia and Resident Evil altogether. The game has a very good soundtrack. The voice acting might be a bit off but hey, the game's story is quite gripping for me. Obscure II might be an old game but it still stands up as a good B-Horror movie-esque video game we all know and love. :D			"
