												At first glance, I Am Alive showed a lot of promise. The post apocalyptic atmosphere is believable. The story feels genuine. But ultimately playing it felt more like a chore than entertainment. The game concepts sound great on paper, but fall short on execution. It tries to pretend it's open world, yet is completely linear. I tried to play as a passive person, purposely trying to save lives and ammo, but nothing I did or didn't do mattered. Just about everyone I encountered had to die because they were the aggressor and wouldn't step down. There was no way to talk my way out of any situation. And if I pointed my gun at someone without the intention of using it, they always attacked as soon as I lowered my weapon or tried to walk away. Killing people became routine and expected so eventually I just started shooting first.Then there's the stamina aspect which works well most of the time, until you unwittingly find yourself lost with no stamina to get back to safety, being forced to restart a level. And finally there's that genuine story which turns out to be nothing more than a dead end serving no purpose other than to keep the game moving forward. There is no closure here.Attaching the Ubisoft name to this title feels very similar to attaching the Gearbox name to Aliens: Colonial Marines--setting up high expectations, only to be disappointed.

												Mixed reviews for this game confuse me, it deserves better. Don't get me wrong though, many things people complain about are true and the game really is relatively short (around 4 to 5 hours of gameplay) and abrupt, however it offers a very unique combat system and the overall atmosphere is pretty good. Playing on hard difficulty you will be forced into roungh resource managment (mainly ammo management, also water and other stuff), therefore you can't just wander anywhere you want neither can you shoot everything that moves, you have to force your enemies to surrender by threatening them with your (often times not even loaded) gun. I loved the concept and look forward to other games implementing it. The second most important aspect of the game is post-apocalyptic atmosphere, as mentioned above it is executed fairly well and the game feels somewhat unusual and therefore interesting.Surely, the game has it's flaws, they are mentioned in other reviews, However, I feel like most of them were brought up by people over-hyped by the game and therefore expecting it to be more than it actually can be. Some cons of the game I can think of is it's repetetiveness. Combat got somewhat repetetive but I am fine with that, what really annoyed me is climbing buildings over and over again (which was fun at first... but you can only climb so much without getting sick of it). And that's basically it, nothing else really stroke me during my first playthrough. To sum up, I can recommend this game. Get it if it's on sale and you are looking for something post-apocalyptic with survival aspects and unusual combat system. Just don't put your expectations for it too high and you will enjoy it as long as you keep all those bad reviews off your mind while playing.			"

												You know what? Its really rather good. Its a good 12 hours worth of bleak post apocalyptic survival so provided you don't mind the complete lack of comedic relief then all good. In all seriousness, its a very playable game with some very clever elements. Holding a gun with only one bullet (or empty in some cases) and facing off against 3 enemy makes for some very quick strategic thinking of who to take down first, and who you can bluff into surrendering. The world setting is fantastic and a very believable vision of downtown US after the apocalyptic ""Event"". It really does feel that genuine. The plot is good enough, though relatively straightforward and although a little clunky at times, the control are sufficient. Had a couple of graphic glitches, and one dead end point where an enemy didn't spawn so I couldn't make the next objective. Also find that getting the enemies into that precise point to make a ""strike"" was tricky and it would often revert to the ""struggle kill"" with no warning. There's a good mix of the puzzle and platformer elements in the climbing sections and its challenging enough, even on the regular level setting.  Whilst the game is quite ""samey"" in that involves exploring climbing and a bit of combat, its fulfilling eoughIts not a cheery game by any standards (its on a par with say, Dead Space in terms of optimism) but its one that made me pretty happy. Overall score is a very comfortable 8 out of 10			"

												I'm a sucker for the post-apocalypse genre - the grittier, the better - and thus this game looked really promising. Unfortunately, I ended up being severely disappointed.At first, the setting and mood was excellent, kinda like The Road (although thankfully not THAT harsh). I actually liked the stamina mechanism, too. In most games, your character is apparently a machine who can run/climb/fight/whine for hours without breaking a sweat, so such a nod to realism also got things started on the right foot. Graphics I didn't have much problem with, either. Hell, I grew up in the NES era, so I can forgive a lot on that score.Unfortunately, I Am Alive went downhill pretty quickly from there. It's funny that I mentioned the NES, because this game actually reminded me of the old NES games... in all the worst ways. It LOOKS like a GTA/Fallout-style open world at first, but looks are deceiving. I Am Alive is actually a linear game with constant barriers to keep you moving more or less along the one path. It's bitter that such an open-looking 3D world would offer so little room for exploration or experimentation.Looking at the map for the first time (before I became aware of this game's true nature), I actually wondered which streets I should take to the apartment. I thought ""Okay, let's try those back streets, maybe less chance of being spotted by hostiles..."" I soon learned that this game isn't big on exploration (or choices). That linear nature extended to the encounters, too. All too often, it felt like there was only one method or sequence to resolve things, with any other approach being punished brutally.That latter issue is made exponentially worse by the SAVE POINT SYSTEM. Even better, with limited retries! This is what nailed this game's coffin shut for me, the realization that this game came out in 2012 and oh wow, game designers STILL hadn't learned better than this idiocy.NO. This is no longer 1984 where you have to fit your entire game in 4 megabytes and I'm still a kid with enough free time to waste hours replaying the same fricking map over and over. If you want to encourage players to get through the game in less than X lives in one sitting, then hey, great. Make an achievement or a score bonus or a ""hardcore mode"" or whatever for it. But don't punish those of us who aren't masochists with nothing more interesting to do.You might think I'm a little hypocritical here, because I love roguelikes, which usually have permadeath and make you start over with a new character if you die. But the better ones (DCSS, DoomRL, ADOM, Sword of the Stars: The Pit) have random dungeons and classes that are very different from each other, so at least you can try something new if you die, with tons of room for exploration or just going some other way. I Am Alive should have borrowed more from that playbook if it wanted to be so harsh.TL;DR: This game is frustrating, stupidly linear, and has save points. Avoid.			"

												I bought this game in sale for a low-price about 3 years ago but only played it a couple of months ago and was not disappointed; a good discovery i must say, for my part.""I Am Alive"" is a story-driven Third-Person (Shooter) game which takes place in a post-cataclysmic era, in a dark and dusty world, with a mostly black & white atmosphere. A lone survivor wants to retrieve his lost wife and daughter when the Event occured, one year ago.The player must collect resources to restore their Health and Stamina, but also to help other survivors who will give informations about the Event and your researched people. This is a choice, among others. Some survivors are hostile and quick decisions must be taken to stay alive... or not; intimidate and/or kill are sometimes the only way, but choose your priority target(s) precautionously, considering, furthermore, the rarity of ammo.The player has also to climb walls and edges, and there again good decisions are important concerning the way to take. You can find rare and precious pitons scattered in maps to be used wisely when out of Stamina while climbing.A thing i liked is the ""Lives"" (called ""Retries"" in the game) concept that was the core of ancient era games. Helping gentle/friendly survivors will reward the player with a ""Retry"".Some are scattered in the maps like those precious 1-Up we were happy to find in the games previous generation.""I Am Alive"" has pleasant graphics and gameplay mechanics.A con of this game is a  frequent ""freeze & jerk"" cam little bug that never lasts more than a couple of seconds. No big deal here, even if a bit annoying.The key mapping is also particular considering that you shoot, interact and run with the same button : Left Mouse. Not really intuitive when familiar with L-Shift key to run and usual E/F (and sometimes Space) keys to interact.To conclude, this short but (in my opinion) good game has a realistic aspect that makes it interesting. There are challenges to take. However i would recommend to buy it in sale regarding the cons above and its short duration.			"

												A rough hidden gem.(I beat this game originally on the PS3)Okay so it took Ubisoft: Shanghai 6 years to make the damn game and the age of it is immediately apparent.When I first laid my eyes on the game I could not believe the sight - the graphics were so horrendous that I died a little inside. I went on to adjust brightness and contrast to no avail; I could barely see any difference or improvement. The anti-aliasing in this game is about -2x or -4x, that's right MINUS. The jaggies are all over the place. The water is a mess. The textures are also extremely dated. I can't take screenshots on my PS3 (I could if the game was on Steam thank you very much) so I started taking photos with my phone and sharing it with my friend. He could not believe it either. Call me a spoiled PC gamer but the graphics really killed off a portion of immersion for me right off the bat. The graphics are below average, I am sure most console gamers will agree with me.However, one hour into the game and I was hooked. The civilization lays in ruins following a series of cataclysmic earthquakes and tsunamis; it's probably a pole shift. You arrive at the city in the search for your family with nothing but your back, some supplies, a flashlight and a camcorder (which is used for the cut scenes). Eventually get a machete, a gun, a shotgun and a bow. The game itself plays like a good survival movie. I've personally missed that genre for quite some time.If you venture too far out into the dust-filled streets your stamina and health will slowly drain so you always have to make sure that you have enough supplies to replenish your stamina and health lest you suffocate and die. About that dust...It's been a year since the event and the dust still hasn't settled. So on one hand it's intriguing to not be able to see further than 6 feet away and struggle to get your bearings but on the other hand this trick can be viewed as a cop out on the part of the developers since they obviously haven't put much effort into graphics. The sound is good though. I played without the music. I liked the dead silence of the dead city.You get to meet a total of 20 survivors in the game and help them out with supplies and other miscellaneous items so I advise you to save your supplies till the last and not use them until you meet someone who needs them. Helping every survivor will grant you an additional retry. This feature is helpful if you are playing on the survival mode which I heavily recommend for maximum immersion. Basically if you play on survival then you will be extremely cautions. And that's one of the biggest things that glued me to the game. It's that there is no trial and error here, you really have to think your moves ahead. I once got stranded on the other side of the mall and it took me my last two retries, most of my supplies and two pitons (used to rest while climbing) to find my way out. All in all, I spent about 30 minutes trying to find my way back in order to avoid starting the episode all over again.I am actually surprised that the devs managed to make climbing interesting. Uncharted was probably the first game to do so but this game implements much more realism and puzzle solving when it comes to that. You can play as Nathan Drake, hang on the ledge and then go make yourself a veggie sandwich. By the time you come back Drake will still be here, hanging on a cliff above the abyss. That won't happen in this game. There is a small cliffhanger almost every time you climb somewhere. You have to make out the path in your head and figure out if you'll have enough stamina to climb to your destination. Your stamina will start draining, the ominous music will set it and your palms might start getting sweaty in real life.As for the gameplay itself, well it delivers. When you aim you get the biggest, most ablest auto-aim I have ever seen in a video game. When you face the enemies you either have the choice of running, facing them head on, fooling them by attempting to do a surprise kill or subduing them by killing the leader of the gang. It's kind of like a checkers game. If you kill that one, then the two will rush you, if you kill that one then maybe you'll survive. If you try to rush the guy who has a gun with your machete then you will die. There are also a couple of stealth kills in the game. I have also exploited this trick to have the enemy AI shoot one of their own accidentally if you align yourself correctly. It worked every time and I saved myself health and ammo. About that ammo, yeah, the most bullets I was able to muster at one time in the game was 7 bullets.A few more things that hampered the immersion for me. You don't talk back to the survivors, ever, you just stand there and listen. The bodies of the slain enemies disappear unfortunately. Some food items mysteriously reappear in some locations. Many AI (a guy with harry potter glasses) reappear in the game. For a total of 50 something enemies they could easily made more AI models. You can also kill some peaceful civilians without any repercussions. Upon their imminent death they will likely curse you for taking their life when they meant you no harm. At one point in the game you may actually kill a kid's parents by mistake. The story was okay and I liked the bleak melancholic ending.All in all in took me 8 hours to beat the game.  The whole game takes place around only 4-6 square city blocks. The game also only occupies 2GB of hard drive space. Ubisoft could have really turned this into a franchise. They could easily make a sequel or a prequel but I guess it's not on their priority list.			"

												I Am Alive was the very reason I started using the screenshot taking feature Steam offers. Probably most of the pictures I took were uploaded for this game only. I am still perplexed why people call this game ugly. It's environment is simply gorgeous. I look at the big picture here not tiny details such as not near perfect antialiasing or the highest HD textures available in current generation video games. Simply the city our protagonist arrives to looks stunning and depressing and superb. This desolate city is characterised by grey and white colours due to the fog, dust and toxic waste present and the beams of the sun shining through the sky are the most beautiful I have ever seen in a video game. Those being more expert in this area will probably challenge me - I have found this game visually stunning, regardless. I took numerous pictures especially when you climb the skyscrapers - those sequences are outstanding.Gameplay-wise I Am Alive is a rather difficult TPS game. Even a single enemy can easily kill you. You have melee weapons at your disposal and any firearms you have provide you only with limited ammo. You need to plan every single encounter very carefully. The only letdown when it comes to this game its shortness. It can be completed in 5 or 6 hours with all side missions completed and collectibles obtained. Still, it is forgivable considering the budget was rather low for this one and also it's easy to catch this gem at a discounted price. "

												I have so much I want to write about this game. I'll start with 'I love it', anyway, let's get that out of the way first.I am Alive had a long and problematic development cycle. At one stage, Ubisoft had intended to start a franchise with this game. I can see how it could have been as successful as Assassin's Creed or Far Cry. There are similarities to The Last of Us which of course became a huge success for, developer, Naughty Dog.The reality though, is that in the end the game was released, in a stripped down and relatively short state. It can be completed in around five hours but it does have a lot of replay value. There are achievements, which for some reason are not registered on Steam but can be found on the game's Main Menu screen.This game is a lot of fun, the combat sytem is unique, the climbing sequences are amazing and the game world is genuinely interesting. While I am playing, I can really see the potential I am Alive had to be just as successful as any other Ubisoft game. There are gameplay elements that were innovative at the time of it's release. I'd bet money that some major game developers have been influenced by this game. I think the combat system, though, is unique even to this day and it's really cool.However, I am Alive's tone is maybe a bit too miserable for most people, including myself. So what I did was, I turned off the depressing in game music and added a SweetFX profile for more colour. Technically, the game ran great for me on a GTX 980, running Windows 10, at a solid 60FPS. There are some low resolution textures and some dodgey lighting affects but the game looks great for the most part. The game world is dynamic and believable from the top of ruined sky scrapers, to down on the streets, below the killer dust.I am Alive is now one of my favourite games and in a way I'm glad the game ended up as it is, It's a hidden little gem, that most people over look, which just makes me love it even more.  I highly recommend that you give it a try!!			"

												I had really high hopes for this game. Before it came out, I remember seeing all kinds of press for it, screenshots of vast urban decay, hints of in-depth exploration, all the features that make a post-apocalypse fan salivate. Yet the hype for it died completely off after release, and I actually completely forgot it existed until I saw it on a Steam sale. I finally decided to pick it up and play it. Right from the start there were multiple things that bothered me. The game doesn't seem to want to go too far in any direction no matter what the choice is, and that makes it overall very bland right from the get-go. The game is incredibly linear, guiding you in a single direction and not letting you veer off the course, yet they have tiny outlets from your linear path where you can find consumable items and whatnot. It's not rewarding to get these though. There was virtually no effort put into finding it aside from ♥♥♥♥ing off somewhere that wasn't the objective and after a short 5 second walk it's sitting on the ground for you. Why didn't they have the ability to search for supplies? checking dumpsters, containers, or piles of debris would have added so much more to this than simply walking slightly left of where you were originally going to go. The interactions with the AI are just as linear as the exploration. There are two types of people in the game, the ""I'm just trying to survive, morally you shouldn't shoot me"" people and the ""I'm clearly up to no good, you shouldn't feel bad shooting me"" people. It makes it very cut and dry to be able to decide who to kill and who not to, and don't worry, if the game decides you shouldn't kill someone it does its best to prevent that. One of the first NPCs you meet in the game is a woman protecting her storefront/residence with a gun. If you walk in front of her, she'll point the gun at you and warn you to stay back. The game clearly wants you to just leave her alone and keep walking, but the game hints from the tutorial that you should have to make the choice yourself as to what you do in that situation. Yet in this situation, you have at most 1 round for your handgun, clearly dissuading you from shooting her. You have a machete, but due to her placement you can't sneak up to her for a stealth kill like you have just been taught how to do, and if you walk at her and try to kill her with it she immediately plugs you in the head and kills you. You're supposed to think ""Well duh, that's how it would be in real life"" but it is disappointing that they force that kind of situation on you with the facade of choice and moral decisions being involved when in actuality the game has forced your moral compass to point to ""Good"". This is just one of my many complaints about the game. The camera is horrible, switching between a free camera and being locked in certain angles that gets incredibly jarring. The combat is incredibly simple and redundant, as is the urban exploration with things like traversing obstacles, climbing ledges, hanging from pipes, etc.. The stamina meter built into the climbing is nothing more than, to use a cliche term, artificial difficulty. It's meant to add a sense of urgency, stress, or fear in the game, but yet they give you the simplest exploring mechanics of all time. All of it is incredibly safe. If you mess up an input, it's not like you fall to your death, you just sit there doing nothing. You can't fall off a ledge, there is no balancing on the beams as you cross them. It's meant to give you the feeling that it's dangerous, without actually giving the player any reason to be scared. All in all, the game is a major disappointment, and I can't say I would recommend it to anyone expecting an immersive or exciting game.			"

												Biggest let down of a story/atmosphere driven game i've ever played.  It's fun-ish, pretty interesting and definitially different than the usual games out there, but their story writer needs to be shot.  Honestly and without hyperbole, this is a great story made terrible by (most likely) budget and time constraints.  More specificially, they just droped act 2 & 3 in favor of ""ps. hero did stuff and... CREDITS!"" Summary:-- the story sucks... really badly. leaving a negative after taste (probably why all the bad reviews)- dont believe the marketing, its not ground breaking at all- can be rather clunkyBUT++ level design is really good!++ atmosphere+ combat is snazzy and differentRecommendation? While i cant say you SHOULD get the game, consider the following:While the value of the work put into the game is likely worth the list price ($15), the game net experience is worth around $9 - Use that advice however you wish.

I Am Alive gives players a pure survival experience at a low price. It is a short game, easily completed in 6 hours or so if you run through it.The reason Im at 9 hours is simply because I wanted to explore more of the world and do some little side quests that there is very little reward for.However, dont be fooled, this is a beautiful gameI Am Alive thrusts you into the role of a lone survivor in a believable, dark and insecure post-apocalyptic world. One year after the Event, a worldwide cataclysmic event that wiped most of the human race, a man struggles for survival in a desolate city as he tries to reunite with his long lost wife and daughter.Pros+ I Am Alive is brutal; gripping; captivating; depressing; miserable; and almost always utterly brilliant.+ Storytale & development of both character and storyline is amazing+ Emotional rollercoasterCons- Linear game- Short - A game without a concluded ending			"

I Am AliveIt's a tough call but ultimately, I just can't recommend this game. If you push through the first couple of hours like I did, you may find something worth actually seeing the game through to the end. But I'd argue that that would be working too hard for something that's supposed to be fun and enjoyable from the get-go.Pros:Tends to get slightly better as you progress;Interesting resource-based strategic combat system;Scarce resources do add a sense of pressure to decision making in Survivor mode;Stamina brings a bit of welcome tension to free climbing;Good voice acting for the most part;Decent soundtrack;Cons:A lot of original ideas that were poorly executed;Overly linear progression focused on climbing;The Fog adds to the mood but hampers the will to explore;Helping people ends up feeling like a chore;Dated graphics and animations, coupled with frame rate issues;Frustrating controls and immersion-breaking game prompts;Constant tension-building music indicator when using stamina gets old really fast.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Ubisoft ShanghaiPublishers: Ubisoft Initial release: Sept 2012Genre: Action, Lite Survival, Adventure#Worth/NotWorth: #WaitForSaleBSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): “Not” Nathan Drake in off brand Fallout/generic post apocalypse, Consistent in having a dearth of color saturation and an unruly grip meter. Think Shadow of the Colossus except it gets worse instead of better as Solid Snake and/or Raiden would attest to.Exposition, Concurrence and SummationI am Alive is.. well it's not great. But it isn't the worst way to spend your time either. You play as Carlo Mestroni attempting to find his family after [the event]. It is never made entirely clear what, how, why, or indeed even when the world has become this way. It just is, so deal with it. Early on, Carlo finds some purpose in aiding a child he mistakes as his daughter. Without going too far down the story path; She is very important to the goings on and the objectives that will befall you. I mention this only to inform that she is not a hindrance as in there is no “true” escort mission. This isn't Resident Evil 4. She is attached to you for most intents and purposes and cannot die unless you do. The survival aspect of the game comes from needing to manage your grip meter and health. If you stay on ledges too long or over exert yourself you'll find that your overall ability to stay on non flat surfaces decreased. Throughout the environment you'll find some items that can restore your health, energy as well as replenish your overall capacity for overexertion. There is also the dust mechanic. Wherein being too low in elevation where the dust has still not settled it is impossible to recover any energy and you must get to higher ground to do so; This can lead to some tense if not annoying sequences of trying to figure out where to go whilst trying not to use all your gear and resources.  The main loop and danger of the game comes from traversal. Very tense music plays when low on energy and it can be quite nerve racking. The other side of the game is dealing with other survivors. Some hostile immediately, others just scared. The combat is not especially great. It is indeed quite functional however stilted though it may be. It consists of holding a pistol up to threaten would be assailants. And then kick them off of edges or into fires and so forth. You must keep you gun trained on all the enemies lest they take advantage of your indecision. Perhaps they may even suggest you've not got the gall. If you relax, you can trick the enemies into coming closer and surprise kill them. This is one aspect that feels great. As during their approach you must quickly ascertain which if any other members of the group have a firearm. And take them out as soon as possible after your surprise kill. It can feel very tactical and systematic especially when ammo is scarce.  The game relies on retries or continues if you will. And you can earn more through helping or aiding the non enemy combatants you'll run into. The main city you'll revisit throughout the campaign so you'll get slightly accustomed to it as well as come back for people you were not able to aid before. As you may expect you eventually earn things that make traversing the dust less annoying. As well as other things that make running out of energy less of an issue. But they are near the end of the game and you don't really get to use them much. The game is about five-ish hours in total. THE GISTThe game draws a lot of small features from numerous sources and puts it into a relatively poorly executed package. However, for the right sale price I think those ideas are worth checking out.Follow my curation for more "

												Although there are some flaws, the game is extremelly enjoyable, and as its price is very low now, it is a good catch.Pros: The designers created a truly horrific atmosphere: the game has scenes of sexual abuse, cannibalism and bleak morality, alhtough none of them are gratuitousGood design: the game uses brutality to inform its simple mechanics. You have to scale buildings, using windowsills and drainpipes for handholds, to achieve your objectives, and all those actions are tense because of your limited stamina - if your stamina reaches zero, you will fall to your death. So, the game forces you to use your resources at the right time or you will fail.The game's setting – an American city, with all its skyscrapers cracked and its streets empty save for abandoned, rusting roadblocks.Combat is tense too. Your char will always be short of ammunition, but will be facing large groups of enemies. Because of this setup, you will be forced to use surprise and your environment to survive. (as an example, in one of the encounter one of the best solutions is to slice the throat of the first person to get too close, then pull a gun on the remaining bandits and force them to back up against a ledge before kicking them to their deaths).The bow and its two arrows (believe me, this one deserves the praise - you will be using it a lot)Cons:Because you face so many enemies from middle to the end of the game, you will end up repeating the same encounter many times, always following the same routine: surprise kill, shoot, ledge kick, etc.The climbing, while tense, can become a grind, specially in the beginning of the game.The ending: it seems the game was finished midway of its story. So, the main reason of the character going all the hardships will not be answered. "

												Terribly disappointing. Really, really disappointing.There are some games that, when I see them, I get hooked and tend to ignore most bad reviews. Sometimes, that is a wise choice, as I have found MANY games that I've loved that had terrible reviews all around. But other times, that is a terrible move, as the reviews are true.In this case, the bad reviews are true. I am Alive is, well, terrible.I was hooked since the first trailer ever released, and I never played it until now. Now, I wish I hadn't. I didn't want to just drop the game, as I hate doing that, so I just tried to play through as quickly as possible, ignoring the in-game achievements. Thankfully there are no Steam achievements, as I would hate to see the partial completion in that.Anyway, to the point: Don't buy this game. The controls are horrible. Getting a controller helps, but it's still wonky. The combat is no good. You can sneak attack someone, which is cool at first, but it wears off. Besides that, you can shoot people but ammo is TERRIBLY scarce. I understand that this game is survivalist, but your guy has been out there forever, and he begins the game with like a water bottle and that's it.The only other way to fight is with your knife. If the combat was more action-oriented, then it would have been better. Instead, you're usually screwed when fighting gangs. Your only knife attack (besides the sneaking one to get the first edge-up) is to run up to someone's face and proceed into a button-mashing event while you're left open to all other baddies. Your guy can't just stab and slash in an active manner. Instead, he can only lock his knife with the other guy and sit there while being shot. And each time he's shot, the event has to be restarted.Therefore, combat is terrible. It should have been more fluid and action-oriented.And as for the climbing... God, such a pain. I liked what they were trying to do at first, but then got over it quickly. Again, it's a survivalist game, but it is just too much. You have a fatigue meter which, when you lose enough fatigue, also will lose its capacity. If you don't have items to restore capacity, you're screwed and usually find yourself in a vicious circle of needing to find items which require either (a) ammo to shoot a lock or (b) you to climb somewhere. But chances are you're looking for ammo already, or you're looking for an item to help you climb. So often you're forced to restart places or re-attempt entire sections.And the graphics--they look like someone digitalized sawdust and filtered it through the imagery. The game can still look ugly and apocalyptic without looking... THAT kind of ugly.There's more issues, as I found many glitches along the way, the story was lackluster, and on and on and on.Overall, I was terribly disappointed. Do not play this game.			"

												I Am Alive is actually a very refreshing and entertaining game. - Through the dusty city in fictional city Haverton in America, there was a backstory known as 'The Event', that apparently was a bunch of earthquakes, though the backstory of post-apocalyptic essentially is present. The story is a series of events that occur in Haverton, which I must admit use a variety of buildings and adventures in order to fulfill the objectives, refreshing. The overall story is powerful through emotionally engaging with characters, for example, Mei and her mother. The story does tend to rush at the end as that could have been spaced out, though I will admit the ending is very strong and I was completely shocked by the ending. Oh, its a cliffhanger too.- The graphics are beautiful in the game. For a 2012 game, they are at a high standard for that point in time. Speaking of Ubisoft, in 2012 they had a high standard of graphics in each game they released, which was their year in relation to graphics. The atmosphere and environment and the day/night dynamic is excellent graphically, though there could be some more day/night variations.- The gameplay is solid. I do like the motions of the character and how he engages with the environment, which I felt was again for a lack of better word, refreshing, though different to other post-apocalyptic games. These same motions however, could be expanded a lot more. For example, if your character is on the ground, your stamina will deplete due to heavy dust that will affect it and eventually your health. The character walks basically like he is having a stroll as if there was minimal dust. To combat this, more diversity in actually producing motions when in the heavy dust could add a further dynamic to the gameplay. Stamina added a new dynamic to the game, which I appreciated. I liked the fact that this element suggested planning more so you as a player wouldn't deplete your stamina as fast as if you just went out there, so it was nice. I did love the element of preserving your bullets, as they could come in at handy times. There are a limited number of bullets in the game, and you do need them, though thats why planning is essential.Regarding crooks and other gang members, I loved that element in the game, though it did get repeatitive as it was too basic. So everytime you walked up to a crook, you would have to kill him essentially, no reasoning, nothing, just plain old re-shooting the guy, whilst good, repeatitive. The camera control is an absolute pain. For example, whilst on a cliff and you look at the scenery and attempt to plan what portions of the building you have to climb, the camera will literally screw you up by making you deplete stamina because the camera was not facing the direction your player was moving at. - There were bugs regarding graphics and gameplay that could have been ironed out, and balancing regarding camera control would have been appreciated. It didn't overly affect the game, but it was noticeable. Not as bad as some games I'll mention. Here are my pros/cons based off this review...Pros:- Strong story and backstory.- Beautiful graphics.- Day/Night dynamic, Atmosphere, and Environment are very good.- Solid gameplay.- Lovely balance overall.Cons:- Rushed ending to story.- Day/Night could have been used more to enhance particular missions, apparently according to the main character near the end, the entire sequence of events happened in a day...- Vague, but gameplay could be expanded upon.- Bugs.Overall, I Am Alive is a good game. It has its positives and negatives, however it has a very good foundation to build upon. The gameplay was solid, though it was basic for this genre and could have been more diverse to enhance the game. The story was strong, and the graphics were great. I do recommend this game at $17.99, however it is you, the readers, choice because I played this game on easy mode (there are 3 or 4 levels of difficulty) and it took me 8 hours to complete the game. So expect at least 10+ hours if you do the side-quests as well, as in help the surviviors. I did this partially (7/20). Score: 7.5/10EDIT: I forgot to mention, dialogue is excellent in the game. Every set of people, be it main characters or thugs had dispirate dialogue, enhancing the game. I loved that aspect. Since I forgot to mention that, I'll bump my score from 7.25-7.5/10.EDIT 2: This game lets you run your mind run wild on what happened to Haverton, what happened at the ending. It leaves a lot of aspects open for interpretation which works for this game. I forgot to mention, this game sometimes can feel like a chore to play, but personally that is what happened to me when I raged that I kept dying in the dust :p----Thanks for reading my review!

												Really nice and original little game. Not very long and a quite forgetable story, but a very interesting gameplay (may it be the fights or the platforming). The survival aspect really stands out. Fot its price, it's well worth it.Must be played in its highest difficulty level !Un petit jeu très sympa et fort original. Pas très long et l'histoire est loin d'être géniale, mais I Am Alive tire son épinge du jeu en ce qui concerne le gameplay (que ce soit les phases de plateforme ou les combats). Le meilleur coté du jeu, c'est l'aspect ""survival"", extrèmement bien exécuté. Pour ce prix, ça vaut largement le coup.Par contre, pour vraiment apprécier, il faut jouer au niveau de difficulté le plus élevé.			"

												The game was good for its time. It came out on March 7, 2012. The Last of Us came out on June 14, 2013. Some people say this game is a wannabe of The Last of Us, but I do not see how that is possible. The storylines and gameplay are different from one another. What I like the best about the game was that you had to think about how you were going to take down your enemies with limited supplies. I did not like seeing the stamina gauge at the top of the screen during every second of gameplay. I would have liked it to show only when in use. I played this game on Windows 8 with no problems. I wish there was sequal to this game with updated game play. Achievments/trophies  are not supported by Steam, but there is a trophy system in the game itself. The Playstation 3 version does support trophies.			"

												In my opinion, this game missed out on so much. You're brought into a world/environment that could be rife with background and stories but somehow they manage to leave you (or me, at least) feeling both wanting to know more about it and also not caring about what is told about what happened. A lot fo the comments about whatever took place feel like a passing explanation - as if no thought has been put into it and just trying to brush it off.The main character's story/search feels COMPLETELY dismissed for 95% of the game. I can understand being a character that wants to help people but when it comes to the point of getting home and not finding what you wanted, right there it seems to be thrown onto the backburner. The character says now and then ""Oh I'm here doing this"" - NO YOU'RE NOT! You get thrown on everyone else's errands. When it does loop back to the point he is going to continue onto his search, I found I just couldn't care less anymore.When it comes to the controls, they just seem...off. I kept finding myself climbing down onto ledges without meaning to, not being able to jump down or climb up when I NEEDED to - leading to me dying. Or aiming at an enemy and suddenly it aims at the one without the gun, or on one occassion I found I died because while trying to aim at a particular enemy the auto-aim just kept looping through the FOUR that were closing in on me. And it's so very repetitive! There's so much climbing that it just ends up with no tension as your stamina decreases because you've seen/heard it a million times, and it just feels like a chore. I thought things would get more interesting when they brought in the rope-swing but found it only gets used a couple of times, and then it's so stiff and lifeless that it just sucks you out of the game further.I've actually recorded this as a series on my YT channel and the honest reason I continued it until the end was how ridiculous it was trying to do anything. Parts were rage-inducing, but mostly it was laughable at how stupid it all seemed. I'm glad I played through it just so I know how rubbish I found it, but I would recommend others to just go onto YouTube and watch it. Or if you are going to buy it, make sure it's on one hell of a sale.			"

												The game appears to offer quite a lot yet once you've completed the game you're sitting there wondering if the creators are being serious. For the price of the game you don't really get much value for gameplay HOWEVER the detailing and level design are of some desirable quality.I personally don't recommend this game for the full price.

												I know there are a lot of critics raving about how much they hate this game, but I'm just gonna come out and say it: I love it. Even though the graphics aren't perfect, and the colour scheme is mildly bland, I love the gritty, dark and dusty feel to the game. The story line is bittersweet and I really liked the AI, because although some of the lines were cheap, the split second decision to draw/not draw your weapon, point an empty gun at someone (bullets are hard to come by) was somehow... pretty lifelike. I especially enjoyed the obstacle courses, with the added adrenaline of knowing that you only have a certain amount of stamina to perform tasks. I would definitely say, get it while it's on special... but do yourself a favour and get it :) you might just end up enjoying it too!			"

												I explore games thoroughly and take my time. I still only got 14 hours worth of play, and that is with 49 deaths. Why so many deaths? Because the combat system is difficult and dull. Recommended for its environment mainly.Pros:- post apocalyptic- be a savior- many heights to scale and descend- lack of resourcesCons:- had to install an earlier drivers set for Nvidia, 314.22 or prior. I used 185.81. New drivers had texture popping.- combat- checkpoints, no saves- still graphic errors after installing older drivers- unfinished game and story- fell short of the trailer way back when, like many games			"

												First off despite its flaws I think I Am Alive is a pretty epic post apocalyptic survival experience unlike anything I've ever played before. For a budget game it has mostly exceeded my expectations by managing to perfectly encapsulate the scarcity of resources and that dusty, ruble-y ruined post apocalyptic world setting. Though my favorite aspect of the game would have to be the mind games you're forced to play with your enemies. Imagine having to shoot the biggest guy in the group with your bow in hopes of getting the smaller ones to surrender, then whipping out your handgun with 0 ammo in order to intimidate the remaining foes just so you can retrieve your only arrow from the corpse to kill off some more scavengers with it. Secondly its a console port with a weird♥♥♥♥♥control scheme, sure you can rebind the keys but its still felt pretty weird, I think its best played with a controller although you'll most likely be fine with kb/m and Thirdly I did not experience any performance issues with it at all, it ran at a constant 60fps all the way through, the only problem is that its locked at 60 even with vsync off and editing the config file did not unlock the buttery smooth 144hz experience. noUplayFTW /10			"

												The checkpoint system is frustrating, the controls don't always work and the framerate dropped a few times on a modern pc,There is exactly one colour, contrast is so turned down that it made my eyes hurt and tetris had better textures.I really liked the original trailer, but this is a completely different, inferior game.Most importantly it felt like punishment to play it.

												I'm not really sure if I should recommend this game or not.To me, This game was incredible in design and mechanics. The trailer versus the end result did leave me wanting though, I expected a bit, no, alot more.This is an unfinished game to say the least, it won't take you more than a few hours to complete, and once you do, you don't feel like you did anything really, it's not an open world game, HAH! you wish.The only hint you get as to what happens when this is all done, is that your character is 85% dead, and 15% Missing in action.Not a good ending for an otherwise decent game. I just wish the game had an open world, and was a little more fleshed out, as well as having a dynamic day-and night cycle, but nope.It's been a few years since this game came out, so let my in-game time speak for itself, i completely finished this games storyline.... Three times. sooooo, 23 divided with 3? That makes a little more than 7 hours per playthrough.8 hours is the average minimum playsession For a person like me, take a guess how I felt after beating this game the same day I bought it. Not very pleased.Now then, as for mechanics? there's alot of nice aspects here, but also alot of pit-falls. You'd think your character could climb stuff, right? Nope, only when it's an obvious spot. If you can't obviously see the spot to climb, you can't climb it. And even then, it doesn't feel natural.E V E R Y T H I N G that happens in this game is scripted to happen, down to even the ''loot'' you can find, oh, and it doesn't appear to respawn either, if it does, i've been too quick doing the quests in this game, since there was literally nothing else to do.combat is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ that's all I can say. I can't really remember it well, but I don't think your character can swing his weapon at all, if he can, it's so slow that any enemy can just interrupt you. And ammo is so scarce, that you'll want to save it till the last part.You are going to die ALOT int this game, and 75% of your deaths, are going to be cheap shots. with about half of those cheap shots being developer created pitfalls in the climbing areas in this game.So, what can I say? I don't recommend this game, had it been longer, maybe. If they had made this an open world game, and added sidequests? Definitely.But as it stands, I can't say yes to this game, not for this price, wait for it to go on sale. It's definitely something you'll want to try, but don't spend your hard earned cash expecting this to be a revelation of some sort. It's not.			"

												I Am Alive kind of makes you feel like you're an urban post-apocalyptic Tomb Raider that can climb almost as well as Lara Croft, but you don't have the stamina or the tight buns to make climbing as enjoyable. In fact climbing can be be stressful because of the stamina mechanic, but it does provide a nice challenge in a game that is more survival oriented than a treasure hunting puzzle solving game. Everything except walking will drain your stamina - climbing, running, executing, walking through dust... Don't worry though, you recover stamina quickly, and if you find yourself in a scenario where you can't stop and rest, just keep drinking soda and you'll find all the energy you'll need to get through.The idea they used where you can have a stand-off by pointing a gun (even when it's empty) to make people keep their distance, or even make them surrender, is nice, but it almost always plays out so that they will call you chicken and attack you anyway, which is kind of frustrating given that bullets are hard to come by. Also, you'll take a little girl under your care so it's not just yourself you need to worry about, but apart from some story missions about getting her medicine, she doesn't really need anything to keep her alive. You don't have to feed her or give her water, the only problem is that you have to piggy back her around which means you can't run - but you can still jump and climb so whatever, it's better than having a hopeless NPC follow you around and messing up your mission.I wasn't terribly impressed by the graphics, and a lot of the time you're just in a grainy black and white dust storm which suits the story, but it's a bit overdone. It's still holding up fairly well for a game from 2012, but it's probably getting close to it's best before date.Works well with an Xbox 360 controller.7 out of 10. Would drink more soda in a dust storm.			"

												I Am Alive... or Am I Dead?Ok, game that was in development for a really long time. Heck it was announced at E3 2008 and the game had been shadowing the gaming industry for a long while; even having rumors of cancellation. Alas, it finally got out on consoles at first, then on PC in September 2012. So what is this game? You play as some dude, returning to Havington, a year later after some ""EVENT"" occured. No info about what the event is... So you head to that city to find your lost wife and daughter only to stumble upon an asian kid and her mother. Then you go around and try to keep them safe while fighting some other survivors that made gangs.PROS:-The setting is nice, dust everywhere so the cataclismic feel is there.-Ambiance, sounds, voice acting and even the graphics are decent.-Inventory management-Decent action and can threat enemies with empty gunCONS:-Poor checkpoint system-Poor ""retry mode"" system that if you die and out of ""retries"", you restart till last checkpoint.-Mouse look in this game is atrocious and even freeze often-Exploration is pointless as you need to go into toxic street levels that drains your stamina, only to find soda cans that replenish stamina.-Very linear.-Gangs only agressive vs you and not other gangs.-Crap ending.Worth buying?ONLY at discount! I Am Alive can provide you a good 5-7 hours of playtime... more if you seek to help every refugees.RATING: 5 / 10===SPOILER ALERT===The final cinematic of the game ends with a character crying. There is a good reason for that – I Am Alive is such a waste of a great concept.			"

												I was really impressed by this game. It's immense atomsphere of post-apocalyptic city with no usual zombies aboard just made me forget about all the weak spots (and there are lots of them). Really deep immersion into the setting. You feel alone, scared and depressed all the time. As I already mentioned there are no zombies or aliens or any other fictional stuff. It is a sad grey quest through desolated concrete jungle filled with murderers, rapists and few normal people who are mostly busy with... well, dying. Some gameplay mechanics (such as stamina loss when climbing or suffocating on the bottom levels covered with dust) came out to be very good ideas for making the game closer to real life. Lack of supplies makes it more challenging - you won't be running around with pockets full of different types of ammo and various goods.However, if we speak about the tech part, I Am Alive is far from perfect. I would say that the graphics are very avearge for a product of 2012. It feels more like a game of 2008. The makers did pretty bad job for a product that has been in development for like 5 or 6 years. Sometimes it felt like the they didn't put much effort in this title (especially when everyone were waiting for The Last of Us which came out a year later).Anyway, I do recommend this game for anyone who likes post-apocalyptic settings. It has a unique atmosphere and is definitely worth trying.			"

												Ugh, this game falls short in so many ways.  Within the first minute of playing, I could tell right off the bat that whoever designed the camera had NO idea what they were doing.  It's god awful.So what's to say?  All gray palette with no color, terribly linear game mechanics in a world I thought would reward exploration when risk was involved.  No ability whatsoever to converse or negotiate with other survivors so it's usually walk away from a hoarder or kill every bandit.  The necessity to kill every bandit you encounter is ironic, considering the game rewards you when you help people in need of aid.  I rage quit when I was facing three  bandits with machetes and only had one bullet with absolutely no way to take care of the other two without getting my♥♥♥♥♥beat.Interesting idea but overall, it fails quickly.Rating: 2/5			"

												First thing's first - don't let the mixed reviews scare you off.I guess detrimental to its success was the fact that this game came out way before the whole survival/resource-management shtick came into fashion.Despite what you may read, the game is pretty enjoyable. Granted, you shouldn't play the whole thing in one sitting. Also because it's fairly short. But considering it probably never was planned as one, nor was it given the budget to be a major release (and it shows), the end product turned out great imho.The atmosphere and graphics are decent, the gameplay too. Yes, the camera rotation and player movement tend to hickup every now and then, but not in a 'deal-breaker' way. Another thing I thoroughly enjoyed was that there wasn't 'one correct way' to get from A to B. Sure, when it came to getting from one quest location to another, the game is pretty linear, but at the locations themselves you can get into dead ends, so this will force the player to really think their actions through. Which is refreshing.It is also refreshing, because the game WILL punish you if you are careless. Or reckless.And it is very thorough in doing so.Forget saving at will. You get checkpoints. And you get limited retry tokens. Stamina depleting during climbing also makes you reconsider the routes you take.  None of that willy-nilly climbey monkey BS in Assassin's Creed. :PBullets? Limited. Arrows? Better strategize, because you need to draw it first and that gives your foes plenty of time to run up and butcher you.The only thing I didn't really like was the lack of closure in the storyline. I mean, not to divulge any spoilers, but it really leaves the player thinking like it ended too soon. Like there's a chunk of the story we didn't get to see/play/experience. And that is a pity. Yet Ubisoft has obviously it's priorities and funds elsewhere.Oh, and before I forget - best part? It DOESN'T use uplay.TL;DR - MEAN every bullet, LOOK before you climb, micromanage to survive. 7 decent hours of fun if you're into survival sims.			"

												So, I'm gonna make this one short. I really enjoyed I AM ALIVE but once you look at the game on the paper it pretty much sucks.On the plus side we have:+Fun.+Good Story.+A decent morality system that I will talk about in a second.+The difficulty is nothing crazy but satisfying.+SOME good character dialog.On the other hand we have:-The awful Graphics.-The bad combat system.-The game took me around 5 hours to complete and I also did most of the side missions.-Minor bugs(nothing too bad)-That annoying dust filter in sequences where you are outside of the dust.The (kind of) morality system:Now there isn't much of a real morality system other than a few things like ""don't steal"", don't eat humans"". Those things will give a small boost to your endscore. However I found myself thinking about my victims as you will often find yourself in a place where YOU raid a camp. The bad thing  about this that instead of actually putting some people that are innocent where you can kill them to make you think about who you shoot. I only killed 3 innocents while playing and every time there was a way around them, the game however does not give you the possibility to skip ""bad"" guys(yoiu CAN skip some but it is usually much harder). Then again you have the possibility to execute your enemies which will give you no bonus other than the feeling of justice/douchbaggery(maybe, that is).Final Verdict:I had a lot of fun with this game and it didn't frustrate me at all, the story is good but the price is a bit too high. I'd say buy it but maybe wait for a sale, unless you are a huge fan of post-apocalyptic games then grab a paysafe card and buy this little UBI pearl. ~AndGeo			"

												I Am Alive might have been a great game but it manages to fall over itself in several critical categories. The first is atrociously awful combat, where you are saddled with an avatar who has only two combat moves and both are ridiculously hobbled. The first is shooting a gun, which is effective in dealing with enemies but ammunition is purposely in extremely short supply. The second is melee combat, but the only move you can make is to grapple with an enemy and jab a knife into their midsection, and that move can be interrupted by getting hit. Essentially this means you are helpless against groups, because you won't have enough ammunition to take down all the enemies and melee is impossible against more than one person. Of course, the game frequently throws you against groups. Toss in a hobbled save-game system (save-points, and only a handful of retries before you have to restart the entire level) and combat becomes a game-killer. The platforming, the other half of the game, is too cumbersome and limited to make exploration enjoyable, and the dreary, limited graphics mean you won't want to wander the world anyway. The game does open up some after a while, becoming far less linear than its first few levels make it appear, but there's really not that much to do in the world so there's no point. And just when you think you are starting to make progress, the game suddenly ends, with no resolution or even a climax. It's a disappointing game on so many levels.			"

												This game is really good, one of a handful of games I've ever played that really surprised me. You can read more in-depth reviews by others, I'll just say that I Am Alive is not really like anything else you've ever played before.It has two gameplay elements that really got me hooked - one is the climbing, which is not anything like Tomb Raider or Uncharted. It is puzzle solving and stamina management and sometimes incredibly tense. The other thing I loved is the rarity of bullets - you get maybe a handful throughout the entire game and so you are forced into situations where you might use your single bullet to kill one enemy in the hopes it scares the hell out of the other two that were with him. It might work or it might not. You never get into firefights, you get into very intense standoffs and any hesitation on your part will get you killed.Cons? The game looks like trash, ends very suddenly and is quite liniar. It's not Fallout. But I was very impressed by the gameplay ideas the devs of I Am Alive had and it's too bad the game didn't get more critical success. I would have loved to see a sequel with a better budget.			"

												DON'T BUY!  I know the trailer looks good.  However, this game fails on an overwhelming majority of levels.  Let's get the nice stuff out of the way: the art is good & the voice acting isn't terrible.The pacing is stilted & awkward; the camera angle feels claustrophobic and unnatural & when he's climbing it's randomly a fixed camera; the difficulty isn't challenging, it's frustrating and feels inconsistent and unfair.  The music is samey & swells with the same grating ""dramatic"" loop the second your stamina gets low.  And it will get low A LOT, so the music loses its meaning. Every single combat is essentially the same quick time event, but instead of ""press x, then press y"" it's ""click the mouse button a whole lot really quickly.""  Wanna run?  Clickclickclickclickclick.  Climb up a ladder?  Clickclickclickclickclick.  Open a locked gate? Clickclickclickclickclick. Fight an enemy?  Clickclickclickclickclick.  Fight more than one enemy?  Dead.			"

												This game is good for about the first hour... then it quickly becomes apparent that NOTHING will get better. ""I Am Alive"" hides some serious issues underneath a beautiful atmosphere, and honestly I didn't catch them at first.Atmosphere/DesignI am a huge fan of post-apocalypic and survival games. Give me an ugly waste land, a single can of beans, and a stick and I'm in heaven. The atmosphere is probably the best thing about this game: cars are overturned and rusted from years of abandonment, buildings are crumbling with most of their windows broken out, the streets are empty, and small pockets of survivors/bandits can be seen scuttling from cover to cover. However, after awhile, I did notice some flaws. First, all bandits and survivors seem to hide out in buildings that are undergoing some kind of construction. The obvious reason for this is that construction offers a lot of pipes and ledges for you to implement the primary gameplay element of climbing/platforming. Logically, it's idiotic. The ""event"" that caused the apocalpse in the game has left most buildings damaged, and yet somehow these UNFINISHED buildings are left standing along with all of their scaffolding, tools, and materials intact? That's just stupid. Furthermore, EVERYTHING is gray. I get it, apocalypse= dirt covers everything, but dam, cars should still come in multiple colors at least! These two flaws combine so that every area is the same crumbling/under construction gray building, and it gets boring to look at really fast.GameplayDon't believe the trailers, this game is a climbing/platformer. I would liken it to assassins creed, but it's not as fast or intuitive as that game. The climbing in this game is SLOW, but worse than that it is also tedious. You are given a stamina meter and it runs out extremely fast, which makes sense to make it challenging, but there are several moments that are absolutely unforgiving. There are areas where you literally have to scale a building, and there is a veritable maze of pipes and ledges that you must navigate absolutely perfectly, or your stamina runs out and you fall to your death. This wouldn't be a problem if you could just look and plan a safe route, but often it's simply trial and error because you can't see where there's a ledge for you to stop and regain your stamina. To top it off there is a permanent stamina loss mechanic, where you can extend your cimbing time using up the stamina meter itself! This mechaninc is completely artificial because the devs obviously set up some climbing puzzles to require you to use it, which means you would always have failed those sections without it. The combat is also idiotic. You have a gun and a machete, but combat only occurs in two ways: a stand-off/bluff and a quick-time event. You never have more than three bullets for your gun, so when you encounter enemies you have to quickly draw on them, shoot the one who has a gun first, (or he will shoot you even while you are pointing a gun at him), and then ""juggle"" the other two with commands, environmental traps, and your machete. Can you swing your machete? NO. It uses a ridiculously long QTE where the enemy always blocks your attack and you have to mash the button to kill him, which gives plenty of time for his friend to run up and kill you. So you end up telling them to back up until you can kick one over a ledge, or make him step in a fire, and then kill the last one with a QTE. It was this terrible gameplay that inevitably made me put down the game. I spent an hour at one point figuring out the perfect climbing path up a building that required the least permanent loss of stamina, and after I reached the top I was immediately greeted by three enemies, who took me around 8 tries to defeat. Ultimately, just boring!StoryThis isn't really a spoiler, but you are looking for your family. Surprise, surprise, you were separated from your family after an apoclyptic event! That NEVER happens! Don't get me wrong, the ""find your missing family"" storyline could have been great, and even starts fairly promising with a scene at your house where you pick up a few clues as to where your family may be. I was honestly looking forward to a story where your wife left litle clues behind everywhere she went that you would follow to inch closer and closer to her. But guess what? After that first scene in your house, you NEVER look for your wife again! Sure that is your ""long-term"" goal, but for the duration of the this game, you are on one long side quest to help out someone else. Yep, the entire game is spent helping ONE other person that your character is not related to or knows in any way. This is reason #2 why I stopped playing, I genuinely didn't care about what my character was doing. It doesn't even make sense! You encounter like twenty life-threatening situations just for this one stranger!Technical NoteI have a very good PC and a newer AMD Radeon GPU, and I had to make some serious tweaks to my system to stop the environment from completely disappearing! I can run far Cry 4 on max settigns, but this game made me spend a few HOURS just to see the dam floor! Also, you cannot play it with anything but a gamepad. Using a keyboard and mouse make the camera stutter every 3-5 seconds and it is absolutely enfuriating.Don't buy this game, because I am confident that you will have the same experience I had. You will be really excited about the apocalyptic story and atmosphere, and you will be wooed for the first couple of hours, until you start to smell something, and then the smell will grow and grow until it makes you stop playing. Later the next day you will realize the smell was coming from the sh!t this game is made of.			"

												Before reading my review, first thing you need to do is watch the E3 trailer from 2008.


YouTube™ Video: E32008 - Ubisoft I Am Alive Trailer 

			Views: 3,038,278		

			Brand new title by Ubisoft unveiled at E3 2008.		

Did you watch it? Looks great right? I remember E3 2008 and said to myself, ""This game looks great!"", although I knew it was a cinematic trailer, it was the initial concept of survival and escape from hordes of other humans that were possibly your friends prior to ""The Event"", as it's called in the published version of the game, that stood out to me.The game we got? Well, it went through a lot of changes as it was already in development for like, five years prior to E3 2008, and then released in 2012, went through even more changes. The biggest change is that you don't experience ""The Event"", okay, it's a big f*cking earthquake. But how awesome would it have been to experience that as part of the game?Instead, I Am Alive takes place a year later as your character returns to the city of Haventon to find his wife and daughter, how original. Instead, you find some girl named Mei who's just crying in the playground by your house, so you help her find her mother instead, as well as some bloke in a wheelchair.During the game, you can help strangers that actually need it, or kill people that are hostile. It's a very black and white game, literally too. Instead of the nice, yet muddy, colors of the initial trailer, Ubisoft Shanghai rapes your eyes with an over abundance of black and white, mostly white, film grain. The dust is thick, foggy thick.Let me remind you that this game came out in 2012. The textures and models from Super Mario Sunshine are better, and that was 2002. The gameplay tries to emulate the Assassin's Creed climbing, but somehow messes that up. And the shooting mechanic switches you from 3rd person survival game, to 1st person shooter.This game's just doesn't really do anything right, except for the limited ammo which would make sense considering the stuff doesn't just appear out of nowhere.It's mediocre.5/10			"

												the climbing aspect would have been great if it didnt eat your stamina way to quickly. i dont know why have a limited number of retries before spawning back at the last save considering this game is actually hard to play with difficult camera angles that spin and turn when you dont need them to etc.prosthe atmosphere/backgrounds are amazing, the heights make this game feel real. feels like a real survival game.consnot enough save spots if you're going to give us a limited amount of retries make it so the game saves more often so you dont have to go all the way back even after cutscenes. the slow climbing/glitch climbing where you just wont move and will just stop moving/camera switching angles when climbing wastes stamina and can get you killed. this game can get very frustrating.im going to choose ""yes"" to recommend this game but i doubt i actually would.

												I will start this by stating that it's a decent game.  I found it to be extremely easy, but it's a decent game nonetheless.  However, these are some key issue that I would like to point out.  The main issue is that there is almost no back story.  I know, people will think 'but there has to be, even a little.'  Well, there is a little, but it is only learned through playing the early stages.  Other than that, however, there is no general narrative that sums up the state of the world at or before the time of the game.  Now, this isn't to say it's a horrible game.  It is interesting, but it's more like a demo of plausible video game features, rather than an actual game.  I would also say that it's fairly short.  Even when you are trying to achieve all of the in-game mini quests, it's still short.Unless it's on sale, I do not recommend purchase.  4/10			"

												Without giving anything away, let me just say that I Am Alive is incredibly depressing. I'm not talking about the story, which is half baked and clearly cuts off well before whatever script the developers were working off of ended. I'm talking about the fact that every single moment of the game was spent remembering how excited I was after the first trailer came out, promising an open world exploration that never ended. Instead, the final product was this♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game gets repetitive after the first level, and nothing actually happens. There is no open world, just some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unfulfilling side missions that were clearly tacked on in a desperate attempt to make the game seem deep.I do like the almost but not quite monochrome stylings of the graphics, they addded a nice touch to the ambiguously post-apocalyptic wasteland that I barely got to properly explore.At some point it became necessary for the player character, whose name I already forgot, to lash a young girl to his backpack and ♥♥♥♥ around sheer walls for a while. This was very annoying...To repeat my previous point, I am Alive was originally meant to be a massive adventure through a broken world, like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. with platforming elements.The last thing I need is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot device hooked to my character, constantly reminding me of how good this game would have been if it hadn't hit so many problems during development.The main character dies at the end, you don't find out why. Presumably, somewhere between the end of the game and the credits, he went on aforementioned huge exciting journey without the player.Don't buy this game. Ubisoft needs to go back and try making this game a second time, perhaps actually making the game they said they were making the first time around.			"

												7/10Pros- Atmospheric- Great storyline- Excellent tension the entire game- Very Difficult in a good way- Intersting combat system (Every fight is more of a puzzle than a shooter)- Great platforming- Beautiful map- Open world elements- For its time, it had decent graphicsCons- Ending was terrible- Though they were decent for the time, the graphics are dated and can be a little annoying at first- No warning before the end- No Steam AchievementsThis was a pleasant experience that was worth $15. It would be best to get this game on sale unless you are just wanting a difficult platformer/survival game right away. I would have liked for them to have finished the plot and their ending was absolutely one of the worst in game history, but it at least fills in some gaps when you actually think about it. I just want to say that the tension that I felt in this game was tremendous. I felt weak and like I had to think to survive. Exploration always payed off in the beginning, but eventually the fear of tough enemies that could be around any corner kept me from exploring what really could have been explored. There are some very gruesome and raw scenes in this game and would highly recommend that nothing less than a mature audience play it. Seriously, there is some jacked up stuff. It was unique though and I really enjoyed the experience. It did take me an hour or so to really get into it though, so if you buy it, keep playing. It gets better. I beat this game first time on Survival and if you want a real challenge, I suggest you do the same. Spoilers incoming! Please do not read this unless you don't want the game or have already beaten it. The event is never explained and this bugs me. I really want to know what happened and what is going on. There are too many holes left in the storyline. However, the ending is what really bugged me at first. It was just too sudden and felt like they ran out of money to finish the game, but that being said, I believe that he is indeed alive. The end where his wife is crying as she watches the account of his travels does not mean he is dead. Seeing that would be a very emotional experience. Imagine seeing a documentary of your wife (or husband) trying to find you for a year and you see how much heck she/he went through and how she/he never gave up on finding you and finally did. It would be emotional (especially for those of us in the steam community who still have emotions). His stuff is everywhere so he made it there. All of his stuff was not given to her by a good samaritan. He is there. This ending definitely leaves the door open for a number two and we can only hope that they retain the great things of this game, improve the flaws, and make it sooner rather than later. Thanks for reading the review. Peace "

I defiitely do not recommend this game if you are not buying it at a discounted price. I completed it in 6 hours. Atmospherically the game is great. For those of you who enjoy post-apocalypse games, you will enjoy this. The storyline is good and gritty.On the bad side, interaction i the game is kept to a minimum. If you are a big fan of Fallout and want something to tide you over until number 4 is out, this will barely scratch that itch. All interaction with survivors is limited to one single button push to determine if you help them or if you don't. Combat is equally simplified and extremely repetetive.I enjoyed the game. I'm glad I played it. Now that I have finished it however, I will delete it as I have no intention of ever playing it again as it is completely linear.			"

												there were some of the best edge of your seat gameplay mechanics here and its really hard to not recommend this game for them. this game made me sweat while scaling building as my stamina drained and bluffing with an empty gun and ordering people back to a ledge to kick them over was awesome. i think the game only has 10 bullets 5 shot gun shells and 2 arrows in it total. seriously.butthis game is awful and incomplete. its like a tv series that knows it getting canceled before the final episode is filmed. everything is grey brown when you look at things they are unreal engine 3 half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the worse. also i lost points for being a cannibal. i consumed mystery meat that got from guys in the freaking subways who were cooking a rat! seriously thanks game.so this game has amazing gameplay but a terrible ending i beat the big baddy by running past him and getting to check point. also where was the rest of the story? spoiler alert you are dead as seen from the loading screen. WHERE IS THE PART WHERE I DIED THAT MAKES THAT REMOTLY RELEVENT?! "

												I love the post apocalyptic genre, and I love the realism of this game, but the controls are twitchy at best, combat is poorly handled, and the mission objective points are unclear, also the grey scale texture of the world makes it incredibly hard to tell where things are, it looked like it would've been an awesome open world exploration game, trying to find supplies and ammo, but turned out to be incredibly linear in it's pathing, several areas that looked like they should've been easily traversed were completely inaccessible. Everyone in the city having either a machete or a pistol and no variation of weaponry was also kinda dissapointing. I should've listened to the reviews on this game and not purchased.			"

												Lets start with the good things as there are few.1. The levels itself - are in itself atmospheric, it really gives you the impression how a town could look like after a series of earthquakes.2. The climbing mechanic - that you loose endurance/stamina if you climb is a nice change.3. Overall interesting take on survival in a town after a global catastrophic event - without the obligatory zombies.Yeah...that's it.Now to go on with the bad things where do I start:The graphics are washed up and even if you use the highest settings you can't change the fact that this piece of crap was meant to be played on an XBOX or PS2. Yes I know - it is developed for the XBOX 360 and PS3 but I can't drop the feeling that I have seen better graphics in part on a XBOX or PS2.The music at the beginning is good and adds to the little bit of atmosphere there is at all - but it gets so repetitive after a time (especially as you loose stamina constantly and with you loosing stamina the music builds up and always the same tune) that you sometimes just want to mute the whole game.So now we know that the game itself is just a common stone between pearls and diamonds in terms of audio and graphics, but there are these rare jewels that suck at this too but still have great gameplay and story.This game is absolutely NOT one of them.The gameplay is overall horrific with the exception of the climbing mechanic.Combat or stealth - it gives you no choice - you have to fight. There is no sneaking (although they implemeted the sneak button how cool is that) at all, the moment you pass a certain point the game spawns enemies and you can not get around them either because they detect you on the spot or you desperately try to get by the ones that are already somewhere in the level - and the level is created so that you have to get through them. This is no ""THIEF"" at all. So lets ""fight"" which comes down to coerce the AI in getting stuck or other ""special"" movements.Why? Because you either have guns - for which you practically never have any ammunition or you can use your mighty machete.Nonono, not hacking and slashing, you have to wait until your enemies have reached you and then you can draw your machete for one hit.If it is someone with a machete he will block it and you have to go through button smashing, it is easier if the enemy has a gun, then no button smashing.The only problem is that these guys come in packs. So the moment you have to buttonsmash and are locked in the scripted killscene, our enemies friends are hacking you to pieces OR his gun equipped buddies just kill you with one shot (ok,ok @ higher difficulty)The AI can shoot at you forever but if you loot them they magically have emptied everything they had after 1001 shots (one of the many bugs in this game shows you that fact when you get stuck somewhere in a wall and they use you as invincible target practice or you just run around eating up your health items just to see how often they can fire) if you are lucky there is one bullet left after you killed them, about 50% of the time the gun is empty although the owner of it WILL kill you with it if you believe that you could reload the level and just walk past by him.Yes I have the feeling that the people working at this game desperately wanted to shoot themeselves after they saw what they had created and implemented this thoughtful underlying message of the last bullet.You can get a shotgun in the game but first you really have to do some climbing and exploring and the few shots you have are the only ones in the whole game.After around 75% of the game you get a bow with one arrow - oh and you won't believe it - YES!! you can reuse that arrow. The story is pretty mediocre, you should have encountered it somewhere else already and probably better told but worst of all it is pretty shortlived (around 8 hours and I took my sweet time) and cut at the end.The ending is one bad joke. I couldn't help but think that at some point of production they really believed they had born a new superloved AAA title hence the dream of producing dlcs and a second game.But when at the end they realized what a boring abomination they helped to bring into this gamingworld they just hurried up and forced some kind of ending in and a really bad one too.  The bottom line is that if you really want to try out this game buy it in a Steam Sale...for up to 3 $/€. Anything more will make you wish you had tossed that money in a blender and watched it blend - more entertainment for the buck.			"

Posted: August 8, 2014
												First off, I would like to state that I have yet to complete this game out of sheer frustration.Though I will keep on attempting to finish the game,granted if I can win the race between me finishing the game and my controller breaking.That being said, here are my two cents about this game.I will start off with the bad side of the game in order to create a critique that feels like you are eating a pudding with glazed sugar layered at the bottom, where the further you go and eat in more of the chunks, the sweeter it gets.I Am Alive was once an extremely anticipated game when it was first leaked on 2009, and announced to be completed on 2010, but was later pushed back several times before finally being released on 2012. This gave potential buyers the time to ponder about the game.When news first befell unto my ears, I heard so many rumors that this game would become the ultimate open world survival game with a good storyline to follow through. However, like any fairly hyped games, you are bound to be disappointed.The final product released into the market looked like a stillbirth compared to what people were expecting from the game.As a result, the game's popularity sank faster than a fat lady trying to water skii whilst wearing lead shoes.Granted, this is not entirely the developers' fault, as speculations may have created greater expectation, but could be easily diminished by not being so hush about the game's situation and deliver actual information and updates rather than popping up ever so often just to deliver push-backs.Over the course of some five hours of me playing this game, I can sum up the game in three words, ""Trial and error.""By using new players' naiveté, the game would constantly throw you into situations where you are required to know beforehand what you are facing, to which usually results in death, and because of the limited retry system, this is like someone giving you a slap in the face and then proceeded to light your head on fire, as the system adds more than a big slap to the face, to which I will elaborate in a moment. I have found myself setting the game to the easiest difficulty to allow myself to go through all the death hoops the game presents to me with my trial and error technique in order to become acquainted with said death hoops, just so I would not light myself on fire on the normal playthrough.The second thing is the delusion of difficulty, not illusion, but delusion. For some reason, the developer thought that simply by limiting the amount of retries the player can have in a trial and error game, the game would be interesting and challenging. If that were the case, then Honey Boo Boo's mother is a supermodel, and telling people to limit the amount of times they can urinate a day is a good idea.Look, we have all gone through the age where that formula worked, where you played, died, and subsequently receive a game over screen. That was when the existing technology limited the amount of content that could be present in the game, and so by using that retry formula, the consumers would have the illusion of getting their money's worth. I have had my fair share of Contra and Ghouls 'n Ghosts already back in the days, I want to be able to play a game that would not tell me how many times I could go pee-pee in the waterbowl.The three things I also absolutely hated in this game are: The grappling hook mechanic, the death conditions, and the bullet scarcity formula. When I first acquired the grappling hook, it was a complete nightmare for me. The swining momentum is just so bad that it makes swimming through a tub full of mayonaise seem that much easier. It took me seven tries before I could finally get the gist of it and finally not fall off and become the next cannibal's grand slam. Talking about falling and dying a horrible death, I never understood how the main character sometimes manages to die from a half-meter drop. Those areas obviously have absolutely nothing there, and if I were sliding, my momentum was just about enough to rub a gum off of my shoe, but yet, those spots still somehow manage to kill me. Perhaps messing up the sliding gave the main character so much emotional distress that he died of pure embarrassment.Within any survival games, I am one of those players that tend to hoard anything that I can find and use as little of them as possible, this game was no exception, but what definitely has gotten to me was the fact that the game will attempt to, in any manner and time as physically possible, to keep your bullet count around one or two. Now, this may sound like an excellent mechanic, and I am the one who is whining about something mundane, but the fact that any time you kill a gun-wielding assailant with two or more bullets in your possession, the gun you get from them is always empty, really ticks me off. However, if some other baddie picks up the gun, he would start shooting up the place like a twelve year old kid playing Rookie Mode on Resident Evil 2. This is not a good mechanic, this only manages to show the player a huge sign written thusly, ""You are in my pistol theme park, and you will never have more bullets than I want you to."" Why bother doing the whole survival aspect when you are not letting me worry about using resources? Since I know for a fact that I will always get bullets somewhere for a necessary fight ahead of me.Talking about bullets and fights, the staticity and linearity is absolutely flabbergasting. You would think that despite not being the ultimate open world survival game, I Am Alive would still provide the fundementals of the genre, right?Wrong.For the majortiy, if not all, of the cases, there is only one way to climb to the destination, only one way to swing somewhere with the swing hook, and only one way to defeat foes. There are some hidden items here and there given out for looking a bit further, but would also usually mean wasting precious foodstuffs and dying; they might as well place big pieces of paper with, ""I owe you, invalid upon death,"" all over it, as this was mentioned to be a trial and error game with limited tries. As for its staticity, every event and item placement are always at exactly the same place, even with static events, you would at least expect non-static placements for loots, and hope that perhaps that one time when you recheck that mundane corner again, a flashing item surrounded by an white aura would appear, like a young kid hoping to find Narnia in their grandmother's wardrobe, only to find an abundent amount of mothballs located within.Oh, and the save system sucks harder than an industrial grade vacuum cleaner.Despite so many factors, including the menu being complete and utter stinking fecal matter, that make this game so frustrating, I cannot get myself to hate this game.All in all, I am just so very intrigued by the world, the environment, and the idea of this game.Despite the frustration I Am Alive makes me deal with, during the immersive moments of the game, when I truly looked, especially into the story and the world, this game makes me feel in awe, and delivers so many other emotional impacts, like a pyromaniac seeing a forest on fire for the first time (to which the aforementioned person may or may not have been the cause of).I realize that I am on my own in the broken world.I realize that this game is not be for everyone, hence I would not recommend this game.However, if you are willing to overlook the many flaws I have already pointed out, and the ones I may have forgotten about, go ahead and try it out, but I do not in any way guarentee a frustration-free playthrough.TL;DR:You most likely will not like it, but if you are willing to look at the game in a different perspective, by all means, go for it.

												I really wanted to give this game a try, but it seems to be fighting back.There is NO FOV SETTING in the game, so if you tend to suffer from motion sickness induced by low FOV, this is not your game. There are hacks available, though. On the plus side, the game does not appear to have motion blur.There are several issues with the game, such as the controls not remappable separately, but only as a group (e.g. ""Drop/Draw Weapon""). And since ""Fire"" and ""Run"" are in the same group, that is really annoying.Another issue (and ultimately the one that leads me to not recommending the game) is that the game streams in world data, and when it does that, it sometimes stops responding to mouse input. This can go away within moments, but on occasion it stays. As a result, your mouse cursor will be fixed to the centre of the screen, in menus as well as in Windows when tabbed out. Even killing the game process doesn't seem to fix it, only a system reboot will do.I tried to like the game, but it's just not enjoyable.			"

												Good concept and great atmosphere and visuals, but Ubisoft knowlingly shipped a broken (pc) game. There's a near-game breaking mouse lag problem. The mouse randomly and frequently becomes almost totally unresponsive, sometimes during combat, which already has a fickle targeting system. There's another glitch that sometimes prevents the bow from firing when it's supposed to. All of that plus just one or two poor design choices makes it pretty frustrating.On a console, it's definitely worth the money. Do not buy the pc version; it's broken and ubisoft has no plans to fix it.			"

												This game took a couple of hours to really get used to.  The story is essentially about a man working his way back to his family after a catastrophe.  The colors are really, super bland (expected, I guess for the setting), but what took the most getting used to were the controls, they felt delayed (maybe it was me?).  I did enjoy some of the platforming-ish type puzzles to solve.  Because of the rarity of ammo, weapon combat could get intense and I never really got the hang of melee.  The dust mechanic was kind of cool (loss of stamina until you reached fresh air), but it wasnt enough to hook me.I suppose my whole feelings on the game could be summed up with this statement, ""I spent more time wishing for it to end than was spent enjoying it.""

												The gameplay is fantastic. The freerunning aspects are relatively realistic and fun. The fast paced tactical decisions in combat are difficult to get used to but rewarding when you beat them after about the fifth reload, assuming you don't mind retrys being a significant portion of your playtime. That said, the game uses a horrible retry system where you find the right to reload a save like a power up, and if you run out, it sends you to the begining of the level.  Had an amazing amount of potential, but appeared painfully unfinished. I tore through most of the game in four hours, then spent most of the next day looking forward to finishing it. When I did, there was only about 20 minutes of content left and I was left without closeure to the story and a lot of massive disappointment.    When the game ended it even presented me with a stat board full of trackings of things that were never even an option in the playthrough. The game is clearly an abandoned project and in its current state is too short to be worth getting into.			"

												This game has a lot of flaws, but it still manages to create a unique experience unlike anything you've ever played.Unlike most post-apocalyptic games, you don't have any zombies or monsters to fight. Your biggest enemies are the environment, the lack of resources and the other survivors.Getting places is hard. Roads are blocked and bridges are broken, and your climbing skills are the only thing keeping you alive. Problem is, you have a very limited amount of stamina that drains every time you climb or run, and when it's drained fully - you fall. As if that's not enough, dust storms make the air outside unbreathable, and when inside the fog your stamina will constantly drain until you die, or reach high ground.Resources are very limited, and you will rarely have more than 2-3 bullets in your gun. You will often have none. Combat is not based on who shoots faster, but on psychology and bluffing. Raise your hands to let the enemy come near enough for a surprise attack, or aim your empty pistol at him and tell him to back off up to a cliff, then push him over.This combat system makes you get very creative when fighting 5-6 enemies, since you probably wont have enough bullets to kill them all.Some survivors will only fight you if you get too close, and backing off will prevent a fight. Others will ask for your help, and you will have to choose wether or not to spare your very limited supplies.With this combat system and the constant pressure of the draining stamina, this game keeps you stressed throughout it all. And as if that's not enough - you have a limited number of retries before having to restart from the beginning of the chapter!The game is flawed, though:Controls can be a bit clunky while climbing, sometimes resulting in a pointless death and waste of retry.It's not always clear where to go, especially in heavy dust where you can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you might end up walking in circles trying to find the entrance to a building, and it can get quite frustrating.The story is very lacking. You learn pracitcally nothing about what actually happened and the story just seems to stop rather than end when you finish the game. While the game is semi-openworld, you have little to no motivation to explore. Yeah, you might find other survivors or some food and water, but is it really worth running around in a dust storm for?Overall, this game is a solid 8/10 and I highly recommend playing it.			"

												I still like this game. I like the story it tells. This atmosphere of catastrophe reminds me of real natural disasters. The ruined city drowned in thick dust fog, abandoned properties became miserable, and blazing sun turned unbearable. Besides the game shows how much humanity costs. It makes me think about it. It makes me love and appreciate my comfortable life. But the game has the only one flaw (for me, of course) - it's too short. And yes, I wish the story would have a sequel. I'd love to buy it.			"

												Despite reading mixed reviews of this game I was surprised it was actually this good. The world has been struck by earthquakes and it's up to you, a survivor, to try and find your family. The graphics are dark and moody; you can only see a few metres ahead which makes it difficult to differentiate friend from foe. It really adds to the tension. That, and the lack of bullets. You have to pick targets carefully, and even decide if you want to kill them. It's not always needed, you see, and you really need to preserve your ammo.There are also other survivors to be found and they might need your help. It's up to you. Helping them will grant you a retry. So in the event that you are killed you'll be able to try it again. Besides killing and helping people you'll be climbing around like the PoP and AC games, which feels natural by now, and is cool.Too bad the game is a bit short; it will take most people around 4-6 hours to complete. Yet another game that has to be experienced, people.[Rating: 81/100]			"

												If you're a fan of post-apocalyptic games then this is a must have. You play as a survivor of the apocalypse searching the forgotten city to find your family. This game shows quite a realistic view of what it would be like in an apocalypse with it's dark atmosphere, having to scavenge for food, ammo and survivors. I Am Alive is very similar to The Last of Us in many ways as they are both post-apocalyptic survival games. The combat in I Am Alive has a more strategic approach as you have to take in the amount of ammo and health you have, also whether the enemies have a gun or a machete or even armour. Also what was awesome was how you're able to use the environment to kill an enemy, e.g. Holding your gun out to an enemy who has only but a machete and forcing him to walk back into a fire or off a cliff.The overall gameplay gives you more of a restricted feel as you can't explore a lot of the areas and a lot is just blocked off. One thing that got my frustrated a lot was the camera view. Not being able to kill the right enemies due to slight knock of your mouse can really be frustrating. Another thing I didn't like was the amount of climbing you have to do as it just got repetitive and became a hassle.The game only took about 4-4.5 hours to complete and so in conclusion, yes I'd highly recommend this game if it's on sale and you enjoy survival horror and post-apocalyptic games.

												I found this game to be very enjoyable. I really liked the atmosphere, I thought the story was satisfying for a while but by the end I was left wanting just a little more, and I thought the environment was beautifully crafted. I do think this game could've used a little more color, though.This isn't the best game around, but I like it. I think it's worth the price that it currently sells for. If you are in need of an interesting singleplayer game to play, try this one. I thought the ""intimidation"" feature where you can scare off enemies by just pointing a gun at them even if its not loaded was pretty cool and original. Climbing in this game can be fun. This game is really just full of unique features that you won't find in most other games of the post-apocalyptic survival category.Other notes: the graphics are just good; not excellent, not average, but just good. The sounds reinforce the game's atmosphere pretty well. The AI can be tough to deal with at times. The level design itself is a puzzle at times.Again, if you are looking for an interesting post-apocalyptic singleplayer game to play, this could be the game for you. If you want something more action oriented or roleplay-ish, you might want to skip this one. This game gets a 7/10 from me.			"

												A very interesting game with far better gameplay than I was expecting! I am Alive reminds me of the Tomb Raider games of old where it is you versus the city elements with small but yet very dangerous encounters. The story hasn't got much to it but the premise has some depth to it. I would easily recommend this to anyone looking for a game that is outside the traditional 3rd person action game. I Am Alive is all about climbing, exploring and scavenging your way through an urban wasteland. Fantastic experience :D			"

You barely make it out alive.Cons:- There were problems with the climbing mechanics. I wish it would have felt smoother and not so rigid. Also keys would not register at times.- Didn't really like the saving system, I would have enjoyed more control there.Verdict:It's a highly tactical post-apocalyptic survival game with a wonderful atmosphere. It's got a wonderful setting and some quite original features.			"

												Messy, sloppy controls, doesn't run well on a computer newer than it, doesn't teach you how to play very well, and has some weird expectations of you in combat. I like the *idea* of the intimidation based combat, but in practice, this implementation of it really sucks. Climbing, I frequently can't control the character accurately, so I end up needing to use spikes way too often since he thought dancing back  and forth was a better idea than going up or down.Of note, probably half of my gameplay time is from struggling to get video or game controllers to work.

												I Am Alive? More like I Am Alpha!Because it's a clearly rushed product that's not very well optimized, is ugly, is short as hell and ends strangely and abruptly.It's also one of the best B-games I've ever played.I Am Alive drops you into a world torn asunder by a cataclysmic event. You're just a guy looking for people from his past, trying to help those in need, and trying to survive in a harsh reality where everything's out to get you. Your main ability is climbing, and the climbing system of IAA is really well-done: it controls a lot like Uncharted or Tomb Raider, but with the addition of a Stamina system: the longer you climb, the more your bar depletes. If it gets to the end, you'll still be able to climb, but your maximum stamina capacity will slowly dwindle until you get to a resting spot. You can restore your max stamina with items, but it's a neat take on providing urgency to a system that's been used before. The combat is the second tier of the game, and it's also exceptionally well-done: the game utilizes an Intimidation system, which allows you to bluff your opponents using an empty gun while you try to control fights to your favor. Sometimes they'll call your bluff, and you'll have to either shoot them or go for a machete kill; other times, you might want to approach hostiles unarmed, wait for one to get close, and then attack with your machete, surprising everyone and giving you the upper hand. Ammo is scarce, and you don't want to waste a bullet: chances are if you miss a shot, you're about to die. The guns feel good, and the fact that unarmored foes die in one hit is an absolutely incredible way of finally adding realistic gunplay, which makes every encounter memorable. If you come across guys with guns, you either need to be unarmed and hope they come to search you or shoot them first. You will probably die a few times before you get the hang of things, and enemies flanking you might surprise you. You later get a bow, which leads to interesting combat encounters since arrows are recoverable and the bow is silent.The story, largely, is told by victims you save and the few friendly people you encounter on your journey and is well-written. The dynamic you have with the first friendly character you meet is the best, leading you to develop an emotional attachment to them. It's not going to win any awards, but it certainly helps to keep you motivated. The game's not without its flaws, however; the ending is rushed, unsatisfying, and leaves you with a lot of questions, and there are times when the checkpoint system can get very annoying. I played the game on Normal and it was pretty tough, but I never had to restart a chapter. There are segments where you wander aimlessly through the streets, hoping to find something climbable to either save you from the dust storms or lead you to the next destination. The game is also (not, in my eyes, a negative) very short (I clocked in at 4h059s) which could leave some people thinking they overpaid. I really liked my time within I Am Alive's world, and a fully-developed sequel or spin-off in the same world would be more than welcome. 8/10 Bows and Bullets			"

Has a habit of killing you off over trivial things;  every time you misjudge how to respond to a stranger, every time you climb the wrong way, every time you let go of the grapling hook a little too soon... dead.  That gets a bit old quickly.    I was content to suffer through it but then the game started crashing (which is very rubbish given the save spots are a bit too infrequent).

												I advice strongly that you do NOT buy this game.It is the most linear game there is, survival elements only go as far as ""eat to get stamina"", wich isn't survival imo.At first startup there was a bug that wouldn't even let you change resolution. Contacting Ubisoft for support resulted in weeks of the most noob support I ever encountered. ""Did you restart the game?"" ""Have you tried deleting and reinstalling"".Once I finally got it to work in a proper resolution(with NO useful help from Ubisoft what-so-ever) I really wanted to play and like it, but oh the horrible controls and game mechanics. Not to mention the still horrible graphics on max settings.Do yourself a favour and buy something else. Seriously.			"

												I first played this game right after reading The Road by Cormac McCarthy (which I recommend), and thus was recently exposed to a silent, vast, and depressing take on post-apocalyptic stories. Yet when I started this game up, I immediately got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at the main character for running his damn mouth off the entire time. ""Hey, I should climb up this bridge."" ""Ah, I almost fell into that huge chasm!"" ""I should avoid that scary looking guy whose visual cues are saying the same things that I am right now."" In the first 20 minutes of the game that I played, there was more monologing than the entirety of The Road, in which there were 200% more main characters. Maybe I just had my expectations up too high, but I believe that a setting like the one in this game should attempt to be truthful to what it intends to be instead of just a reskinning of Uncharted.

												This is a great game with a great idea behind it. However, its main downfall is its incompatibility issues with the modern operating systems to date. I've had it crash on me multiple times and luckily, I was on a checkpoint that was fairly close to where I originally was prior to the crash. However, the latest crash had me set back so far. This game has so much potential for those who can actually play it without any probability of a crash. Any way, aside from me bashing on this game's compatibility issues, it is a great game. It requires you to make use of your resources and to not make haste when faced with a potentially deadly situation. Ammunition is extremely hard to come by and killing someone with a machete isn't so easy. I enjoy that sense of tediousness to figure out which opponent actually deserves a bullet and thereafter, eliminate the other opposing threats. The concept of oxygen preservation seems extremely accurate and realistic in areas that contain a thicker volumity to its atmosphere. All in all -- great story, fair graphics, fair game. Just be advised that crashes will exist if you're on a more modern operating system.			"

												Two apocalyptic game reviews from me tonight. I'm in the reviewing mood:)Anyway first up is 'I am Alive' where a series of mega 'quakes has pretty much ruined everything. And your task is to seek your wife and child in your now destroyed home city, in 3rd person. The story and acting are nothing special but passable so we'll move on from there.The ruined city is well designed and looks as you would expect a city to look after a huge earthquake. It's bleak and dusty, and crumbly.. and as you can imagine you have to travel over and under it. At times having to scale whats left of huge skyscrapers which gives a great sense of height as you scramble from ledge to ledge. The setting and soundtrack give an excellent apocalypic feel. It feels bleak and depressing,It plays ok, but the combat is a bit clumsy. But you get used to it. And not everyone wants to kill you. Whether you help them all depends on what you are willing to sacrifice. It's not as linear as it seems either.Recommended!			"

												The forced saving system is the most annoying thing they could have done to the game! If you die, you have to go back to the last savepoint or even replay the whole level. If they wanted to make a hard game ... they should have made a hard game, not a game where you have to replay uninteresting scenes to even get to the harder ones after you died. You can not test different strategies to master a(n otherwise) challanging fight, unless you are willing to play the level SEVERAL times just to get to said fight. This is not making it a challange, it is just f***ing annoying...I was so looking forward to this game when I saw the first trailer of it ... now it is just a disappointment to me :(			"

Negatively, the story and voice acting are subpar and some of the gameplay mechanics get repetitive. However, outside of those quirks I was actually really engrossed by the game; the morality mechanics are interesting, the climbing is tense as hell, and the atmosphere is convicing for such a small game. For $15 it's a good price because it encourages replaying the whole game to beat previous scores, and during a sale it's definitely worthwhile to buy.			"

												It's not necessarily a great game but an interesting take on a third-person climber/survival set in a post-apocalyptic fictional city. There's not much I can say.The story is generic but there are some interesting gameplay mechanics. You can use a gun (even if the clips are empty) to threaten and instill fear among hostile survivors and either choose to loot or kill them, or potentially leaving them alone. But I saw repetitive it's gotten.But let's look back at the game's history. From what I remember, I am Alive was announced in e3 2008 (or 2009). It was shown with a CGI trailer. At the time, I thought this was gonna be a game similar to The Last of Us but I am Alive was delayed for so long. When it finally came out, we got this.The current I am Alive which is on steam and other platforms was released as a downloable only title. So it never became a full retail game as originally promised. "

Turned the music off and everytime I run, I hear some music that makes my ears bleed its so stupid/bad. I went in sound files to delete the damn music and I can't find it. Tried to find mods, can't find it. Please I beg to God, if there is any chance of me to ever recommend, or even like this game myself, do one simple thing...REMOVETHERUNNINGMUSICEFFECTS. Jesus I run every five seconds in this game and I hear the same notes 210948755698165893692 times in not even 2 minutes.			"

												If you like being a urban rock climber then this is the game for you. In total it seemed like I had about 2 clips worth of ammo throughout the entire game. This game is very short and in my opinion SPOILER ALERT has a ending that is lacking to say the least. I do not recommend this game.			"

												It's okay I guess. The whole point of the game is to figure out exactly the right way to interact with an environment that appears very complex but actually is simplified and abstracted to ""balance"" the ""strategy"" of picking which thing to do at a given time. I shouldn't have to say how frustrating it is that you can't climb over diagonal surfaces or rubble in a game that has such a sophisticated vertical climbing dynamic. For example, you might have to climb over the 100-ft high superstructure of a highway overpass at one point because you can't simply step up on the hood of a car. Shrug.			"

												This game is not very alive.Ever had a project starting with a good idea, and you never get far with it. One day you return to it and you can't get in sync with what you had in mind. That sort of thing is what this game feels like.Atleast I can say the premise and idea is good, but I really can't figure out anything else good to say.All characters are flat because the game is infatuated with setpieces (I hope you like grey!) and trying to force emotions and exposition onto the player. I find an older man coughing that needs an inhaler, and I move on since I don't have one. Logic tells me there's one close by and as I move on the man says ""I guess you want to help me but just can't yet"". There's no understanding of immersive dialogue here. When I get him the inhaler he starts to spout exposition like everything in the game seems to want to. ""Lemme guess, you wanna know more about the event right?"" No I'm looking for medicine.The very flow of the way everything comes at you is so unnatural. It feels like someone wrote a story that won't work so it was half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥into a game. Heck there's enough hipsters in gaming that some would say it's well done.It's like someone makes a little game and tells you to try it and say you can explore on your own. Although the moment you go left where they'd prepared an event to the right, the guy rips the controller from your hands and says, ""oh no no, you don't want that. Look over here is something cool""... In my exploring the game literally gave me a prompt ""You weren't supposed to go this way, turn back."" Gees.. let me just look around.From the very beginning the camera is a problem and game has tons of technical issues. Every gameplay aspect is so on rails, rinse and repeat.This game was looking interesting when announced way back, but it went through a lot of reworking and it's easy to see it's become a leather faced abomination. Everything game-like is lacking and drowning in the game's pretentiousness.I'd say i've already said too much about this game, when there's not much worth mentioning. I Am Alive is incredibly pretentious and poorly designed, executed and unfinished. The end.I don't enjoy slamming a game when it's gifted to me, but at the end of the day I gotta be honest.			"

												Sort of slow-paced thriller game.  The combat is weak, but it's an interesting spin on the usual mash-up of 'shooter' games.  You have to choose whether to run, shoot, stealth, or try to muscle out the fights.  Ammo is SO incredibly hard to find that it really makes you think about having a game plan before you just run in guns blazing.  But the combat is not why you play this game.  The environmental exploration, navigation, and stamina climbing are exhilirating.  Many times you're climbing hundreds of feet above the city streets, your stamina is inching closer to empty and you're putting forth max effort just to hang on before falling to your death.  That's where the game's strength appears.  The music and hud elements really get your heart pumping as you make quick decisions in this post-apocalyptic city.  Finally the element of helping various people around the city:  do you risk giving up your well-earned supplies to help out those around you in need, or will you need that when you're dangling hundreds of feet in the air and on your last breaths?  Overall 5/10			"

												This game is brilliant. The depth and immersion of this game is unbelievable. There's no zombies. No irradiated monsters. Nothing like that. There's just people. And they act like people. Some just want to defend their home. Others want your stuff. The way you fight is fantastic as well. You fight with psychology, rather than your muscles. You'll almost always be outnumbered. You almost always won't have any ammo. Use your mind, surprise the bandits, and make them -think- that you have a bullet chambered in that pistol you're pointing at them. If you go in, gun up, you'll find yourself dead before you can even -try- and threaten them.Overall, you'll hardly ever see the ruined city you're in. You'll barely be able to see a few feet in any direction. But then you'll climb up and out of the dust, and the world will just open up before your eyes.One downside though, is it can occasionally go a little funny with the controls. This is a game where at times, it's quite plain that it's a port. But the slight irking from having your character shimmy along a ledge to the right, rather than climbing further up a building, is quite easily forgiven once you take everything else into stock.I'd heartily recommend this game to anyone who is fond of the survivor Post-Apocalyptia genre, with a heavy emphasis on realism when it comes to combat and exploration.9.5/10			"

												This game is fun at first, but quickly you notice the broken animations, the clipping, and the fact that all encounters are the same, give or take 1 element. Then, that 1 element gets repeated to the point where you are sick of it. The stamina managing gets annnoying, and can be solved by soda and hooks they practically give you. Though there is rarely a clear path, the game gives you a pently for going the wrong way with characters say annoying things over and over, or invisable walls pushing back the direction you came. The story and animations is also poorly written, and for a protangist that has a little girl, he treats this one he gets like a stray dog. Honestly, overall underwelming and boring after the first 30 mins.			"

												'I Am Alive' blends together copious amounts of fog, blinding light, and a quadruple-tasteful film-grain effect.

												6/10As I started playing this the athmosphere seemed like another one of endless ""survive zombie apocalypse"" games. I didn't know much what is game about because I got it as a gift from dear friend. But after a few minutes it become clear that this is not generic zombie game. It does have an apocalypse element and though clues are given about what coused it the emphasis of the story isn't on that. The game nicely combines platform and a bit of puzzle elements with survive mode. You play as a very capable and  determent character who is out to find his family in a city that suffered cataststrophe a year ago. In the process you encounter other people, some friendly, some in need of your help and some that catastrophe drowe to crime and even canibalism.  You  are given some free  will and some of  your  actions will determin fate of others but all in all it is a pretty linear game that is focused on a protagonist story. General problems with the game is its lenght which is way too short for a game of that price, lack of free will in full degree and some very annoying bugs. Also save system is terrible. It is an interested play to kill few hours but far from perfect game.			"

												I am Alive is a realistic survival game. it looks like an adventurish action the way you control it, but your moves are always puzzling around how to survive.Please take under consideration that this is a really old game although it was out just recently. This title was being developed ever since 2003 but it was frozen due to lack of founding until ubisoft took it up.This said, the game is old. Which can be seen in various ways.Let's take this in parts.The grahics of the game are nicely designed. The engine's abilities remind of 09s to 10s games. So it's not bad at all.The environment is stanning IMO. You find yourself in a world that has ended. Nature's gone crazy. There are asphyxiating sandstorms all over and the element of dust and fog is everywhere.The dusty environment results into a vast way too back&white-ish area.Buildings, streets, inner environments too, they are all so dusty that you are actually staying in a literally desert colored city.There are meny nice ideas on the table. Earthquakes, fallen aircrafts, meta-apocalyptic views, half fallen skyscrapers, also nice places to hide, some nice areas to visit.My only one complainment from this part is that although my rig was enough to support the game, i had some rendering issues making my mouse view laggy without seeing the fps dropping (weird) GameplayI found the gameplay to be really really interesting, and actually the main reason I loved it.Realism. The whole time you are racing against the odds of running out of stamina. Climbing buildings with bare hands and walking through the sandstorm forces you to keep finding places to rest yoru stamina for some seconds or else you'll die.Also you have to keep scavenging to find canned food, water bottles, meds and a few more stuff. If played smart enough you won't have serious problems, though youw ill feel the challenge if it.Also guns. realistic circumstances as well. You start with a handgun and you barelly find bullets around. Your average ammo cap is goign to be around 2 shots. Most of the time you will use the gun to bluff against bandits and looters. A machine is going to be your main weapon, and a bow with only one arrow which can be retreaved from yoru victims. Also there's an unlockable shotgun when helping a survivor.The game really gives you ideas of things that could had been implemented. I am forgiving because of teh age of the game. Lots of elements could add to teh fun like more stealthy skills and attacks or using traps. This could have been one of the best surival games ever for me. StoryNow this is a dissapoiting part. Story is that you are just a guy surviving trying to find his wife and kid. The plot is that you end up helping a woman and her daughter find their way to safety. and stuff.Your main missions are like 3 or 4. Nothing else.The game was clearly cut off most of its material and concept. You can see that it's too incomplete. AverageThis is a pure example of taking a super awesome creation, and ♥♥♥♥ing its brains out due to producer lack of founding.The game could have been one of the most awesome titles of its kind, and it ended up being short, lacking story, and probably cut off most of its original elements ending up in a low priced easy to forget game.I feel really really sad for those who put teh efford to create the idea and start implementing it, at a time when meta-apocalyptic games were not even that mainstream at all, and then see their dream ending up as a scrap work put out for sale almost 10 ♥♥♥♥ing years later.I hope ubisoft decides to make a sequel or a prequel. Because the base of this thing right here has potential to give a much greater than average future creation.			"

												I did like this game. Beautiful environments and the climbing is fun. I do recommend playing on easy though. I found normal dificulty too frustrating; I couldnt master the itimidation feature at first and the save points are a killer.  I.e. so play on easy to enjoy the game the first time through.			"

												This game was great. I loved the post apocolyptic atmoshere that is created by the dust filled air and crumbling cityscape. Everything feels like it's going to fall apart around you. Seeing other people is terrifying as you don't know what they will do. Or if you can fight them off. Even if your gun is out of ammo you can bluff and point it at people and they will back away from you. Climbing a huge part of the gameplay and it is great. The only thing I di not like was the ending. It was just so suden as if they just stopped writing and attempted to create an ending which felt really unsatisfying. I really wanted to know more about what was going to happen in this world. In colnclusion, I Am Alive is a very decent game and short game. It had all the right ideas but it just did not deliver a conlcusive ending.			"

												Nasty, crappy little console game which looks and feels like it was made 10 years ago. How can a game this linear be classed as survival? You spend about 70% of your time looking for the right ""ledge"" with the climbing activator and if the baddies don't get you, then I'm sure a glitch will get you stuck, forcing you to reload while looking for the way through the level.I am ""Recommending"" you to stay away from this game.

												This game is not very alive.Ever had a project starting with a good idea, and you never get far with it. One day you return to it and you can't get in sync with what you had in mind. That sort of thing is what this game feels like.Atleast I can say the premise and idea is good, but I really can't figure out anything else good to say.All characters are flat because the game is infatuated with setpieces (I hope you like grey!) and trying to force emotions and exposition onto the player. I find an older man coughing that needs an inhaler, and I move on since I don't have one. Logic tells me there's one close by and as I move on the man says ""I guess you want to help me but just can't yet"". There's no understanding of immersive dialogue here. When I get him the inhaler he starts to spout exposition like everything in the game seems to want to. ""Lemme guess, you wanna know more about the event right?"" No I'm looking for medicine.The very flow of the way everything comes at you is so unnatural. It feels like someone wrote a story that won't work so it was half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥into a game. Heck there's enough hipsters in gaming that some would say it's well done.It's like someone makes a little game and tells you to try it and say you can explore on your own. Although the moment you go left where they'd prepared an event to the right, the guy rips the controller from your hands and says, ""oh no no, you don't want that. Look over here is something cool""... In my exploring the game literally gave me a prompt ""You weren't supposed to go this way, turn back."" Gees.. let me just look around.From the very beginning the camera is a problem and game has tons of technical issues. Every gameplay aspect is so on rails, rinse and repeat.This game was looking interesting when announced way back, but it went through a lot of reworking and it's easy to see it's become a leather faced abomination. Everything game-like is lacking and drowning in the game's pretentiousness.I'd say i've already said too much about this game, when there's not much worth mentioning. I Am Alive is incredibly pretentious and poorly designed, executed and unfinished. The end.I don't enjoy slamming a game when it's gifted to me, but at the end of the day I gotta be honest.			"

												It shows that this title went through development hell, which is an incredible shame. At it's core, it's a fantastic survival game. It features chilling atmosphere worthy of a space next to The Road. The gameplay is fun. It falls short in a few areas and is by no means perfect (it would be nice if there was a better stealth mechanic to the game). When it comes to the story, it's entertaining, but short with a very unresolved and abrupt ending---It feels as though the game's development hell caused only the first half of it to be completed.The exploration levels would be fun if it wasn't for the incredibly aggrivating and pointless checkpoint save/retry system. You could spend 20 minutes exploring Haventon collecting loot only to die and have the game revert to the beginning of the level without retaining any of your found items.All in all, there is enough here to make up for the pitfalls and make it worth playing, especially if it's on sale. It's a shame this game didn't do well for the studio. I would gladly play a sequel that was given a proper development cycle.			"

												As a fan of the post-apocalypse genre i'll have to give this game a thumbs up. PROS:There aren't many First Person Shooters within this genre that actually simulate how it'd be to live in a completely devastated urban environment, this game attempts to bring you that feeling and does the job somehow well. Instead of going around wielding dual machine guns and spray-n-praying like a rambo, you should focus on conserving almost everything you have due to the scarcity of in-game goods.CONS:Windows 10 users will suffer with glitchy mouse tracking.

												I haven't played this game in months. It just sits their, idly, in my Steam library. I remember I bought this during my very first Steam sale, it looked intresting and I was up to play. What I did not expect was a dull storyline (At least for the first 95 minutes of the game, afterwhich I haven't played anymore), silly controls that often led me to fall off tiny ledges, and boring and monotonous gameplay. A few of the mechanics, like how to react to multiple or single people at once when they come up to you is intresting, but after doing it for the 5th time in 30 minutes, it quickly becomes boring and repitive. There are much better options out there.			"

												I do not like this game. Played for about an hour.The filters are ugly. The graphics are terrible.3rd person view. YUCK.Controlling the character is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Especially when in any conflict. I'm not sure what the hell they were thinking when they designed the controlling.  Maybe it would be easier with a controller? I don't know.Just to note: some people really like this game.

I've been playing for 6-ish hours and while I'm enjoying the story, I'm still not thrilled with the game play. My mouse becomes very slow to respond AND I've had my character get stuck in a walk TWICE with no way to stop other than powering off my computer...which leads me to believe my computer becomes so non-responsive that not even a ctrl-alt-del works.

												The graphics are alright, nothing to write home about but not horrific.The mechanics are interesting, I like the intimidation part and having to think about your actions (somewhat), I played it on survivor mode and it was hard... up until the hotel. Once I got past the hotel I managed to down everything with one arrow, until I got to the pier and got a second arrow at which point I didn't need a gun and ended the game on a mountain of ammo, the pier mission was also incredibly short, if they thought having large battles with a bunch of enemies would provide difficulty or make it all seem longer then they were wrong.The items were all but useless, I could've started up my own community and fed them for years by the end of the game I had that much crap.Saving people was... alright I guess, but having to trek the entire city to go back to someone you saw at the start of the game just before finishing the game to give them a tomato is taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥I hate the way they separate segments of a mission, and that I never got to see what those horrific and scary looking mutant-ish shadows were in the dust clouds.And the ending, my god the ending. While I won't join everyone in saying it's the worst ending in history, as we know that's not true. It did seem very rushed and I expected it in all honesty and it leaves a ton of loose ends.Having said this, I believe it works very well as a cliffhanger, people complain that it gives you no closure and leaves you confused but that's what it's supposed to do and it does it well, I think that it leaves plenty of opportunity for another game.To summarize, I do believe it is a good game and I respect what they were trying to do, and I enjoyed the mechanics (Except the ♥♥♥♥ing dust, nothing but a godamn hassle) I would suggest people pick it up and play on survivor for the experience of a tough game with nice platforming and a plot line tha			"

												Another game port from console to PC from Ubisoft, another failure they refuse to fix.For the amount of time this game has been out, its rather disappointing to see such a good looking game go down the drain. Input lag, unstable areas that even an R9 390 cant handle and broken parts that make the game just unplayable isn't a good sign. I never played this on console, however after plugging in a controller, I still found the game to stutter and most of the time not even register many button presses. This caused me to fail some missions, not due to difficulty, but due to my button presses not being registered by the game. After revealing the controller to not be the fix, I moved back to mouse and keyboard. Certain areas will almost appear as though the game has switched your DPI down automatically as dragging the mouse around stops working momentarily. This issue I found most annoying.My opinion would be to buy this game only if you're a Ubisoft fan, and don't intend on playing it or can overlook these issues, but to everyone else, the game is too broken to enjoy. I was lucky enough to pick up this game at 80% off, but still feel ripped off. If you do buy/have bought it, I'd recommend requesting a refund or else it'll end up being another addition to your steam library that will get uninstalled and never installed again.			"

												I felt like the objectives and areas were far too forced and like I didn't have the options that were portrayed in the trailers. Finding and using bullets only one at a time was contrived and made it obvious (I clearly currently have this single bullet so that I can break that single lock to go to the next space) and obligatory. The multi-level movement was difficult, contrived, and overall didn't feel right. As cool as it was to be rewarded for hanging off a building by a sewer pipe by being given access to the next area, dying six times because you didn't see and aim for the sewer pipe many seconds before the roof you're balanced on collapses for no reason is excessive. Honestly, I felt like the game's movement could have been replaced by a point and click system where the screen is presented to you all at once, then your monkey-man character climbs six stories up an elevator shaft with a child on his back because you clicked a single button. I wanted to absolutely love the game and was overall not just disapointed that it wasn't great, but crushed that it was actually bad.			"

												""Hidden gem"" my bum bum.I stopped enjoying this one 30 minutes into the game, maybe even before that point.In general this is a usual Ubisoft game - rushed, glitchy, feels unfinished, at times simply annoying.Obnoxious camera with broken sensitivity if you're using mouse and keyboard - I had to switch to a controller 'cos I simply couldn't handle it. There are two different sensitivities for when you're running in 3rd person and when you're simply walking. Only the second one can be changed, which results in the camera being utterly glitchy when you're running with high sensitivity options.Weird and annoying retry system that makes close to none sense when the game restarts you a second before you pick up another retry. Now, if you somehow still want to play this game, I'd suggest starting on easy. I went with survival and switched around 2h to easy simply cos of the game being made so poorly.Combat is.... it's something that made me rage internally at least a dozen times, even after switching to easy. It's this... I don't even... It's a mess. It tries to be realistic but fails so many times due to it feeling rushed and glitchy (as the whole game). At times you will kill 1 out of 3 guys and be left pointing your empty gun at 2 of them. Now if you don't have anything else and are forced to melee, you can already restart since if you want to kill one of the remaining two bad guys you will have to go into this QTE which resolves around you MASHING one button but since it takes around 3-5 secs to finish that, the last enemy will just rush to you and interrupt that leaving you basically dead. The only thing that you could do in this situation is spam ""back off"" till one of them is at the end of the map so he won't be able to interrupt you. Or somehow try to be stealthy (there's no stealth system btw) and pray to the RNG gods as well as the bugs gods. It's possible to do but in no way fun. Add to that some delay when pulling gun at enemies - sometimes they'll still feel brave even though you can shoot them easily. The delay is usually around 2 secs and can result in your death most of the time. Oh, and yes.. At some point the game introduces the ""kill the though guy, rest will surrender"" mechanic which worked... you've guessed it.. once. You will never do this because your priority will be to kill the guys with guns first and pick those up as fast as you can so that you don't have to waste more ammo on other enemies that will pick up said guns and be the threat again.To finish the combat bit I will add that AI is just.. marvelous. In this one instance I SHOT 2 people but one of the enemies felt somewhat brave and went with the line close to ""Can you even shoot? I bet you won't have the balls to."". Yeah...The game doesn't feel fun in general. It's like a chore... I'd understand the game being difficult, but the game being difficult 'cos it's an unfinished piece of Ubicrap? Sorry, no. Story is.... uninteresting at best with the ending being a huge middle finger to your face and a cliffhanger saying ""want to actually finish the game? Buy the next one."" (which afaik will never get made). Not to mention that what you're doing has hardly any meaning for the main protag. The game is a pack of side quests resolved around other people and their problems. You're always helping someone, everyone else has 2 left hands and you're this knight on a white horse. Meh.Not a single interesting/likeable character. Protag is this shell of a character, stating the obvious for the most of the time and following commands of other people. The kid with the head that's 50% of her body in the first cutscene is your typical sick child needing rescue with 0 personality, same as her guardian and mother. Not to mention people you can rescue/help. I really wanted to shoot that starving woman who said she wouldn't touch the meat but wanted 2 cans of vegies out of me. For the record, there were 2 types of meat in the game - human meat and rat meat. Afaik she didn't state which one is a no-no for her so... yeah...""So, Extinox, have you enjoyed anything in this game?""Actually yes. Not greatly but I still enjoyed it, I guess. Climbing was somewhat fun. Of course not at all times 'cos of well.. glitches but it was mediocre and thus better than the other parts of the game.EDIT: Oh, I forgot to add how it somehow uses 90% of my CPU most of the time and how sound is broken if you're running 5.1. The middle speaker will simply produce no sound. I will never forget the moment when there was a storm going on around me but when I set my camera to a specific angle, I wouldn't hear anything.			"

												I am SO VERY HAPPY that I purchased this game as a Halloween special, I think I paid $3.00 for it. I have a special liking for post-apocalyptic games, but if I had paid full price for this I would have been very upset. The game starts off promising, with a bleak color scheme and appropriate moody music as you're placed in the shoes of a character who's arrived at his home town, and is trying to find a way to his dwelling. You have a gun but no bullets. OK, fine. Mad Max didn't have bullets for his gun half the time, but it was still an unforgettable experience of a movie. You come to a bridge which has been blown to pieces, and the tutorial system helpfully prompts you to jump the gap here, climb the post there. OK, fine. Normally I have little patience for jumping puzzles, but Half Life had its share, and that was one of the best games I ever played.And this is where the game betrays its console roots. And no, I'm not a PC purist. I own a PS2, and PS3, and a Wii. I grew up playing Nintendo. There are some wonderful console games out there. This is not one of them. Here is why: While climbling, you have a stamina meter. OK, fine. Realistic. No one can hang by their fingers indefinately. You have to climb smart, or you'll run out of energy and fall. But, the game doesn't merely expect you to use common sense. It presents a jumping/climbing puzzle that demands perfection. You have JUST ENOUGH energy to make it where you need to get to. If you waste ANY time, even so much as a tenth of a second, you're going to fail. And fail. And fail some more. After ten tries I was able to get close to my objective. After ten more tries I was able to begin a final reach to the sanctuary of a ledge. And that's as close as I got. After the seventh time of running out of energy and falling to my death within that final reach, I gave up. Any game that throws a puzzle like this at you, a puzzle where literally one tenth of a wasted second counts, at the very beginning of the game... Well, to quote Eric Cartman, ""Screw you guys, I'm going home."" Some players would view this as a challenge. More power to them. I view it as frustrating and as lazy game design.To be fair, I'm not doing this game justice by reviewing it after only an hour of gameplay. But I say if the first bite of a sandwich contains excrement, you have no one else to blame if you take a second bite. Or, God forbid, finishing the entire thing just because you paid good money for it. And scanning other reviews has indicated that this opening puzzle of frustration is only the tip of the iceberg.  The funny thing is, I've spent far more time writing this review than such a game deserves. But if I save even one gamer from throwing away $15.00 on this, then my work is done here.			"

												After about an hour of playing this game, here is my view of it:[5/10] Graphics-wise, it's extremely white/bright and has that horrible grain effect that doesnt let you fully enjoy the beauty of the map that isn't actually there.[5/10] Sound-wise, The audio was all over the place. I suppose the support for 5.1/7.1 surround sound was horribly done in the game, because any people that talked were always somewhere else than from where the sound was coming from.[3/10] Controls-wise, the controls are a little irritating, and for me, getting the camera to move at all was a challenge. I would be dragging my mouse across my entire desk just for the game to recognise that I wish to turn (no, it isnt the sensitivity, something is stopping the camera from moving). This may just be me, but it made it un-playable and ruined the game within the first 5 minutes.[1/10] Combat-wise, absolutely lazy. Ammo is extremely scarce, from what i've seen (and from other reviews), you constantly have only one bullet at your disposal. The only way to melee people is to get up-close and personal to them. while everyone is attempting stabbing you in the sides, you gotta walk up and press 'E' to attack. (I may be missing another form of combat/control, but trying over and over I couldn't find anything, correct me if I'm wrong).[6/10] Story-wise, somewhat enjoyable. Even though the start is a bit cheesy, the story seems to have more pontential than anything else in the game. While only an hour in, however, I can't say much about it.[3/10] Options-wise, there are almost no customization settings what-so-ever. In the video settings, you can change the brightness, the resolution, the aspect ratio, anti-aliasing, the graphic quality itself (low, medium, or high), FXAA, or VSync. This menu leaves you no room to really adjust the graphics for that 'high quality' look. The audio settings is just the volumes of main, music, voice, and sound effects. This doesn't bother me as much, but I was hoping for some options for surround-sound, coming from a semi-stealth game.Overall I would say this game is about a 4/10 from my view of it within an hour of game-time. I may be missing more good things or bad things about the game, but so far this game wasn't worth it.			"

												Bought this game when it was on sale for Halloween. For three dollars, yeah it'd be worth it. For full price? No.In short, it's very simplistic and feels very lazy. The characters are laughably simplistic with very little background ever established... which would really help given the main character seems to have the skillset of an Assassin from the Assassin's Creed franchise. I really would like to know how he's able to scale bridges and parkour on the level he does.For a game about survival in a post-apocalyptic world there's very little actual survival and more on-rails walking engagement to engagement. You can't scavenge from the rubble, can't check inside containers or trash cans. This by itself hurts immersion.What totally kills the immersion is the fact that even the fights are puzzles. You have to kill certain enemies in certain ways and in a certain order or you're dead before you know it. Stranger still is the ability to carry just one bullet for your magazine-fed handgun. There's no simple melee, no way to counter someone running up on you and no way to grapple someone less than a foot away from you with a firearm.Even the animations are lazy. There's a scene wherein the main character is carrying a child on his back and ends up having to use his machete to break a chain. Our hero then sheaths this machete into the child's character model.In conclusion? Boring, frustrating and not worth it. For a much better urban survival experience I'd reccomend the Fallout franchise.			"

												Was really excited for this game and picked it up during a sale. Initially I tried to run it on my Win7 64bit (GTX460 / 12gb RAM) and it just crashed after a few minutes regardless if I was in the game or in the menu. Gave it up for dead after loads of troubleshooting.Now a year later I tried to start it up on my gaming laptop (Win8 64bit / GTX860M / 12gb RAM) and it would not detect the controller, has 5fps at any resolution over 1024x768, and everything stutters to the point of lag even if I'm running it at 800x600 on lowest settings. Gave up again after some troubleshooting.The game not working on two completely different builds with different OS's is really lame. Think its time to give it up for good. :(			"

												What you can expect from this game: Lots of ClimbingGreat Apocalyptic SceneryExcellent Twist EndingSmooth Visual Gameplay ExperienceThe gameplay tactics in I Am Alive are like none other in the sense that you receive so little ammunition for anything, and by increasing the difficulty, you're left with less. The climbing experience leaves something to be desired, mainly because of how repetetive it becomes when one runs out of stamina and supplies, but if you've already played the game through on Novice difficulty, you should know when to use supplies and when not to. All in all, this game definitely passes for the following genres:-Post-apocalyptic-Survival-Exploration-Mood Altering AtmosphereThanks for reading.			"

I'll need more to get all the achievements unlocked of course, and that's where the game fails, cause honestly the replay value is low if the story is weak. 8/10.

												I Am Alive is easily one of my favorite games, it has a decent plot and fairly well acted voice-overs. The gameplay is a mix of Resident Evil style scavenging and Prince of Persia-esque climbing sections.   Your characters stamina bar plays a huge part in how you play this game. Most every action causes it to drain. Running, climbing, and struggling to break locks. When you enter the areas the NPC's refer to as ""the fog"", which is dust and ash in the air caused by storms your stamina constantly drains. Do you risk a few more moments searching dusty streets for vital resources, or climb back up to saftey and let it recharge? You will find yourself constantly watching it well into the later ares of this game.  You will come across other survivors and you must decide what to do. Some may be hostlie, some may need help, the intimatation combat is very well done in this game. You are actually able to hold hostiles at gunpoint even when you may not have any ammo. Don't wait too long to act or they may realize your gun is empty and attack.   I am currently on my second playthrough of this one and still get the feelings I got when playing it the first time.  Fear, panic, sadness... all are present here throughout the entire game. You never feel overly powerful even after getting some of the better gadgets and weapons. The downside to this game is the rather low resolution textures. However seeing that this is and always has been a $15 dollar title, It can be forgiven as the game is thouroughly entertaining.			"

												Well, many bad reviews about this title, isn't it?I took some times to read a few of them myself before writting down these lines. Wanted to see the argumentation on them.Seems like many of you guys forgot a thing, not Ubi nor Steam tried to sell you this game as a 60 bucks AAA titles!This title is the result of Shangai Ubi department and was promoted and sold like half an indie game.What does that mean? Well you paid 15$/euros for it, even cheaper if bought on sale and the game worths its price.Yes it has the usual UBI patern. Gameplay is very similar to prince of persia titles for the climbing and accrobacies.Graphics are not top-notch and maybe the story-telling is not at the same level than a Walking Dead or other games of this vein.But the game is fun to play. THERE IS a story anyway. Thing that is not always true in every survivals these days.combat mecanics are repetitives, but what combats are not, right?Does FPS allow you anything else than change your weapon or shoot at a different part of your adversaire's body?Our guy here have just a few and the difference and challenge when fighting a pack is to see who to shoot at first. That's a point many seem to have missed. You got a leader or one of the bandit have a gun, bring him down first, others will be calmed down and more easy to kill.Bugs?Didn't find any fault that was not mine, missed a timing on a jump or misspressed a wrong button. Those are bugs of gameplay people are arguing about.Man, never buy a prince of persia game, I think you would throw your computer by the window...So at the end, what the game is?A good survival. Short but cheap, with a nice story and is fun to play. Sometimes hard, never impossible.			"

												DO NOT BUYThis is the worst survival game I have ever played. Where do I even start...Bad controls. For example, you run using a left mouse button! The left mouse button! Yes, you can change key bindings but the same button is used for shooting, so you either have both running and shooting on LMB or none of them.And this is even better: You can jump and climb only on specific spots where the developer allowed you to. Forget basic logic - you can climb this truck but not the same truck over there. You can grab this ledge but not that one. This turns the game into a guessing game. Guess where's the path the level designed made for you, because you can't go anywhere else!The savepoint system. There is only one hard savepoint at the beginning of each chapter. So if you leave the game too soon or the game crashes (happened multiple times to me), be prepared to replay last 20-30 minutes.There are also more soft checkpoints that you can use to spawn after death but the devs had another great idea - let's severely limit the number of respawns and if you spend them all, replay the whole chapter! Isn't it a great idea in a trial&error game where you can hardly predict or plan anything during your first playthrough? Splendid! Thankfully, the easy mode has unlimited respawns.The savepoint system has one other major catch. It also your saves your stamina capacity, health and ammo. And this brings the last ""tiny"" problem with...The stamina system. This is the thing that made me quit the game for good. I'm fine with a stamina bar that you need to recharge by resting a bit. But here, if you spend all stamina points (which is often unavoidable in this game) you maximum stamina capacity starts to decrease. And the capacity doesn't recover by itself, you need to use very rare consumables to get the full stamina back.So it's pretty easy to end up on a savepoint with only 20 % stamina bar, no consumables, and a long climbing sequence or a dust storm ahead. At this point your're done because it's impossible to continue, you die or fall almost immediately. Restarting the checkpoint doesn't help because it doesn't restore the stamina bar. And in my case the checkpoint was also a chapter savepoint so restarting the last chapter didn't help either. My only choices were either to restart the previous chapter and replay everything again (risking the same problem in the end), or to delete this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥from my computer.I chose the latter.

												I Am Alive might be one of the most ambitious and under-rated XBLA games of all time. The niceties that are usually reserved for AAA gaming experiences are all present here. The soundtrack is stunning, the gameplay is innovative, and the atmosphere is remarkable. That said, there are some problems with this game that do need to be addressed. For one, there's a grainy filter that runs over the screen for the entire game. This isn't a glitch, but a purposeful design choice by the developers, presumably to make the game feel more gritty (or something). I don't quite understand the need for it, and it makes the game look pretty ugly.There's also a stamina bar that slowly drains as you exert energy in the game, either by climbing buildings or traversing through the thick fog in the streets. When the bar gets about halfway down, the un-settling sound of shrieiking violins will fill your ears, indicating that your character doesn't have much longer to survive. This cranks the tension up to 11 during moments that might otherwise be a monotonous trudge, but by the 9th or 10th time it happens, you'll be looking for any excuse to avoid making your stamina drop. By the 50th time, you'll be taking off your headphones, setting them on your desk, and shaking your head in dissapointment. Sure, it's scary, and the sound sends chills up my spine, but there's no relief from it. That dreadful buzz will accompany nearly every moment of this game. It begins to feel like a cheap way to add horror into a game that really isn't that horrifying.Other than that, I Am Alive is captivating. The ""intimidation"" style combat feels excellent and believeable. Enemies will cower under your gun while you're pointing at them, but if you don't shoot for an extended period, they'll start to think you're bluffing, and they'll rush you. If you shoot while you're out of bullets, enemies will take note of it, and seize the oppurtunity to slice you with their machetes. It's a decently in-depth system for a downloadable title, and it makes you seriously consider each encounter carefully.Overall, I Am Alive is an impressive game. The story is simple, but well-told, and the character dialogue sounds natural. Shout-out to the voice actors as well, who do some amazing voiceovers for these characters. Their contribution to the game makes the world even more believable, and one that you'll want to get lost in.			"

												+Atmosphere: Grey, dusty, bleak and dark. Just like a post-apocalypse should be.-Movement/Exploration: Most of the game time is spent trying to navigate, run, and climb your way from point A to point B. Frustrating for many gamers, but logical and realistic enough.-Equipment: Not much diversity, but then again, you ARE in a city that's been a wasteland for many months.+Story: The main character is an office worker, not an ex-navyarmy overpowering rambo. He wants to meet his family, not save the world. The enemies are everyone that doesn't need anything from youNo Zombies.The teaser at the ending left me itching for the sequel; though I must admit I expected a more fulfilling ending.++Stamina: Almost every action requires stamina, so excessive movement is a no-no. If you run out of stamina during a physically demanding task, you start using your health as stamina, which isn't far from what happens in real life.+++Combat: One enemy is doable. Two are iffy. Three require tactics. Any more without a bullet would be suicide without climbable ledges to run to.Fighting has the most realistic mechanic I've seen in a survival game. Feints and bluffs are the only means with which you may survive against overwhelming numbers (>2=overwhelming).Overall: The best cross between a survival simulation and a survival game I've ever tried.

												Doggone this game pisses me off, primarily because the save system is so erratic and unpredictable.  I ended up doing the same things over and over again, simply because I don't have countless hours to wander around until I can finallly find a save point.  Even then a found save point is no guarantee that, if you log off entirely, that it won't throw you back to some vague save point from the past.  Very very frustrating with no sense whatsoever.  That coupled with the mouse usage in a fight or when lifting a door - you have to tap the LMB furiously to accomplish your task and believe me you can't do it with just your index finger resting on the LMB.  NOOOOO!!!  I have to hit ""E"", grab the mouse with my Left hand, then using my Right index finger, pound the LMB into submission.  And half the time that doesn't work either.  Games should be FUN, not endless repetitive work, so I'm giving this game a resounding thumbs down.  It's not a pretty game, the graphics and landscape interaction are minimal, and most of the time everything is shrowded in fog.  Pointless, simply pointless.        If you insist on playing this game here's a suggestion.  Play it on EASY.  The reason to do so is simple.  On any other level the only way you get to continue after you die, and you WILL die many many times, is if you accumulate ""Replays"" by saving somebody.  This is the ONLY benefit of saving somebody!  On EASY you get INFINITE REPLAYS.  That is the ONLY change in the game, so why not?  You control the game; the game doesn't control you!  Otherwise the game consists of saving the same characters OVER AND OVER AGAIN to accumulate replays to move on.  FRUSTRATING IN THE EXTREME.  If your ego or pride won't let you play on EASY, even tho it makes no difference any other way, then you get exactly what you deserve.			"

												This game is highly underrated and has been given a questionable rating.This is possibly the top game in terms of a post-apocalyptic setting and gives players a pure believable survival experience. It's atmospheric setting in a darker world that we all know, and a plot to keep us enticed until the end shows us a gripping; captivating; depressing; miserable; and almost always utterly brilliant game. The crafty and clever use of a dust-filled city may make up for the graphics that have been questioned but I am quite comfortable with how they are regardless.An interesting feature, which I would love to see more in games, is their use of the gun. We can stick people up. Literally, if you want something in this world you can point your gun in their face and watch as they cower. You can do the right thing and help people with supplies that are scarce, or rob them.Do not underestimate the scarcity of supplies because as I said before, it IS the most believable survival experience.I actually felt like I robbed them for getting this on sale :/Epic game and I am still looking for another game like it. 9/10			"

												While the game did contain a few good parts, and had some pretty neat mechanics, it was extremelly easy to get lost and it was very difficult to advance through many areas, especially with the extreme lack of essential parts to your survival (Which you ended up needing five times as much as they were provided).  The characters are mostly extremely plain and gameplay is usually very slow.  I understand the setting, but despite that, they could have at least given you a tiny bit more of what you needed when you needed it, to avoid having to backtrack.			"

												Criminally underrated, the story is atmosphere and setting is very much like the movie ""the road"" which was hard to watch, this has much of the same feel but there are some great moments between characters that you come to actually care about.  There is something really thrilling about walking around realizing you dont have but one bullet in your gun and comming upon 3 guys who you dont know if they will be armed or not, you can scare them with your gun and they wont move but if you wait too long they will realize you are empty and charge you.  Really tense, first propper survival horror game I think I've ever played.			"

												All around good game. Graphics aren't spectcular, but its not really a problem. Has the atmosphere of the Last of Us, but thats about it. Gameplay is best described as a puzzler. You have to think before you act otherwise youll more than likely die. I don't really like that one mistake makes it 99.9% you'll die, but I guess that's a bit more realistic. Some moments seemed really challenging, and were almost too difficult at times, at least in terms of combat. Climbing aspect was fun and a good way to challenge your mind. However in terms of control, it could be unresponsive. trying to slide down a pole could cause you to move left or right several times instead, (which if you play you'll understand why it can be frustrating) and aiming, shooting, attacking could also freakout at times, but mostly aiming because of accidental switching between targets. Armored enemies were kind of OP because there were only two weak points, and because of tedious aiming capability made it hard to be accurate. Stealth was hardly even an optin because as soon any of the characters are in visual range they react, and most are placed in a way that makes it impossible. Player interaction with NPC's was limited to combat, or helping them out. the decision making was kimited to ""Do I have the item they need or not, and am I willing to spend the time to get it?"" And finally the ending seemed abrupt, and was a cliffhanger that made no sense. However the characters were enjoyable. I'd say maybe 6 or 7/10			"

												I normally like the games I play, but this game makes me so frustrated. I mean, the story to it is good, but the limitations with the bar on the top makes me so annoyed because it goes down too quickly and it makes it hard to do anything, esepcially outside when you have to be in the dust. I know that's the point; make it hard to survive out in the dust, but it makes it hard to keep pushing through the game when you're constantly dealing with it every second of every moment. Then you have to deal with being constantly screwed if you're outnumbered and you have no ammo ect and there's no way around beating the guys you're up against when it's 2 against one. Sure you can fake them out when you can, but you are still screwed if there are no options of getting ammo at that moment. I had my game on normal for 45 % of the game, but then I changed it to easy to see if well, if it would be easier and it's not, really. If you're outnumbered (2 to 1, 4 to 1 ect) you're still screwed if you only have 1 or 2 bullets and only 1 arrow.  So, I won't recommend this game to anyone because most that I know who play games, probably won't like how it is either. The good part of the game is how it looks, I like the direction it went with the artistic type of aspect and the story is good like I said, but other than that, I don't really like this game, and I also can finish most games, even when it's tough to get through... but this one, I'm ready to quit because it makes me rage too much with all of the limitations ect. Sorry, but I'm just being honest.			"

												Hands down one of the WORST ""survival"" games I have ever played. Game pretends you'll get to make choices but it is 100% linear. Everybody must die and on top of that killing people is hard. I get a machete very early on and then dont even get the ability to freely use it to kill people. Furthermore every time I die and reload the game crashes with a new error every time. You'd be an idiot to buy this game and will only play it again if somebody pays me.			"

												The game I am Alive was made by Darkworks from 2005-2008 and switch midway through to Ubisoft Shanghai And was released in 2011 on Xbox live arcade,PSN,and Microsoft Windows.For a game that was in development for over 5 years this game should be close to flawless but instead the game is incredibly bland and feels like it was made in 2 days by one guy.this is a post apocalyptic game after some thing caused the world to go to hell,Whatever caused this series of events to happen isn't explained at all.You play as Adam Collins a man trying to find his family after he went on a buisness trip across the country before everything went down.At the start of the game you watch a tape recording of him talking to who ever can find it and tells them what he has with him,He has a Bag,rope and a gun which he hasn’t used yet,but fires like a pro during gameplay.Without spoiling to much the the story is really just about him finding his family.The gameplay in this game is god awful.The camera switches from 3rd to 1st person,the enimeis dont die by a machete to the face or a bullet to the heart ,the gun is useless,the controls are afwul,the A.I is rediculous,the story is bland and boring, the stamina is so bad if you run for 2 seconds you become very tired or if your climbing you just fall off and die.This isnt a game its a joke.The only real “good” thing about this game is the world is very well done and the graphics are good.The price i would reccomend buying this for is if and only if this game becomes free to play.Overall I would have to give this game a 17/100.Thats being generous.

												The only good thing about this game is the cinematics and hold ups besides that it's got nothing going for it; It has none of that scavenging/survival feel to it because nothing is off of the plot line besides one or two survivors who are too lazy to move.The poly textures on the non interactive props is embarassing; skeletons made of 1 poly which don't even look like skeletons EVEN when my graphics quality is at high/ultra.The unexpected lag spikes; I fiddled about with the settinsg for over 15 minutes and I still got lag spikes (even when I went low-quality, no shadows, no light flare, no pixels and no motion blur)The stamina bar/food and drink system doesn't make the game any better, if anything it makes it worse; the guy looks like he goes to the gym but he has the stamina of a fat man walking to the shop AND to top that when you go critical it means ""furiously"" clicking and when you stop your stamina has permanently depleted by a fraction unless you eat a pack of crisps or a candy bar.... logicThe stand ups; GREAT when you do it, rubbish when they do it to you; because you're always in 3rd person mode until you draw a weapon you see just how clunky the animations are (e.g. walks past small Asian lady with a gun, in 0.01 of a second he snaps 90 degrees to the left and faces her with his hands up until he gets ""out of her sight"" aka over 20 foot away from her)Looting; when looting dead enemies which had infinite ammo for some reason you're lucky to get 1 bullet 1 out of every 5 kills. When going into abandoned buildings all you find is 2 food packs, 1 or 2 bullets and a note which IS related to the plot (there are absolutely NO subplots or side plots)Sensitivity; the sensitivity was through the roof on this game for the mouse, I had my mouse set at its lowest setting and I had the in-game setting at its lowest but still moving my mouse an inch was a 360 BUT that can only be said for the x-axis, the y-axis on the other hand took my mouses HIGHEST setting to look fully up/down.Intimidating; you had well over 10 encounters with ""bandits"" but yet Ubisoft thought 3-4 voice commands will suffice.Attacks; when encounters with bandits happen you're held at gun point, dude with the gun walks up to you and starts pushing you backwards, QUICK TIME EVENT, you slash the dudes throat but there is no gore...disappointed. And although you have a combat knife you never think to use it in combat cos only real men fight with fists and empty guns.General observation; the character has been designed with a role coil going round his chest but he never thinks to use it.Jumping distances; constantly changing and always making no sense, there were more than 5 occasions when I thought I could make that jump, NOPE you need to climb this 100 foot tower, then go over the 30 foot connector and then along a 50 foot wire and back down a 100 foot tower to progress...... 10 metres.I'm not saying this is a bad game.... I'm just not saying it's a good game... because of it's 1 or 2 (million) faults			"

												This game is nearly everything I wanted from a Post-apocalyptic game! It was still a whole lot different than I imagined, but in a good way. Unfortunately you can definitely tell that this game wanted to be more than it is, as it is missing some stuff which would have made this game even better; but I'll get back to that. It's a good game that shows us that Zombies aren't the threat in a post-apocalyptic world (not that there are zombies in this game) but that people are threat. In this game you might hear someone crying for help, but it could just be a trap set in place so they can rob you of well you're life. So you have to beware of who you help and don't help. Also since items are very scarce, you have to ask yourself if you want to help this person giving him/her your last health pack or do you keep it for yourself. These are great questions but to my dismay the choices you make don't really impact the game. If you for example help someone, they usually just say thank you and you get an extra retry.  In fact the only reason to help someone in this game would be to get the achievement for helping all victims in the game. If however helping someone would impact the story line; for example the person you saved ends up helping you later in the game or perhaps you helped the wrong person, and that person later then screws you over in the story. Well I think you can imagine that would have made the choices in the game so much more interesting. Now theyre just NPCS that stare at you after you help them...well umm great. So yeah theres a lot of potential for this game to be the best post-apocalyptic game ever but it unfortunately just misses the mark. I also feel like the fighting options are quite limited but maybe im just bad at the game. Either way I still found it a really enjoyabel game to play, and I do think I will replay the game again at some point just to save all the victims in the game. However the missed potential in this game stares at me with every NPC you save (they literally just stare at you). It's just such a shame no one has tried to improve on this concept because that would make the best post-apocalyptic game ever!!!In conclusion, you should get this game! but feel free to wait for a steam sale. As long as you play 6 euros or less, it is worth it as you will definitely get 6 hours of gameplay; even from a rushed playthrough!			"

												Rough around the edges but the focused and subtle nature of the plot focuses on characters first and the world second. You can see the result of everything that has happened in this world and the effect it's had on humanity. Bleak and brutal in nature with combat serving more a puzzle than a moment to moment thing. I am Alive manages to do a lot with very little, excellent use of found footage to push things forward.			"

												The game starts off very linear and looks to be a little generic, however the first combat scene gets interesting and you see a fighting mechanistic unlike any other game (persuasion/trickery). As you wonder the streets you look for your lost family after a terrible global accident. You have spent the last few years traveling all the way from the East Coast of the U.S to the West Coast to find your “possibly alive” family. When you reach your home you find it empty and no family insight, however see a little girl looking for her mother that seems to look like your daughter. Deciding you have nothing to lose (and maybe a little desperate) you follow her. You soon find out that her mother has been taken by bandit and that the little girl is very ill. Your only “friend” is Henry, the man that is looking after them... It's up to you to save the girl and the mother and hopefully find your family.-=Scoring=-Gameplay 9/10Story: 9/10Creativity: 9/10Graphics 7/10			"

												This was a great game, it had a very intersting setting with graphics that just worked. The controls were easy to learn and very comfortable over all. The game play itself was fun, and not overwhelming. It was a little restricting at times when it comes exploring, and the combat does get a little reptitive when you find your comfort zone and learn how to subdue your enemies.This easily a 7.5/10, I rated it a little lower only because it took very little to complete the game and I felt like it could have used a little bit more tricks and unique moments. I would probably wait for a steam sale to pick it up simply because at 14.99 (USD) it just feels a little short to jusitfy it's price tag.The hours I have on record are playing through it twice, and I was on hardest dificulty may I add.

												I really dig this game for a lot of reasons, but foremost is the combat. Here's how the last encounter I had went when I finally nailed it after running low on the hard-to-come-by retries.I walk into an area and am surrounded, 2 guys behind me and 3 in front. I quickly note that 2 of the guys are armored (one being behind me), the second man behind me has a gun, and the other 2 simply have knives. I also notice a bonfire in the corner. Then I make my plan and execute.First I back up without revealing that I'm armed or willing to fight. However, the guy who approaches me is the armored guy who was behind me. Since he's armored, I can't kill him with a quick knife. So I continue backing up for a couple seconds until the only guy behind me is the one with a gun, and then I strike.I attack the gunman with my surprise strike, killing off the gunner and leaving the 4 others in front of me without a way to get between me to the dead man's gun. I then have to immediately toggle to precision aim, and aim quickly to shoot the armored man who was harassing me before he slashes me and while the other 3 enemies approach.Once I shoot the first armored man pointblank, I can quickly cycle between the 2 unarmored men and convince them to start backing up, realizing that I have a gun with ammo. The 2nd armored man continues approaching with his bulletproof vest, so I have to quickly switch to precision aiming and shoot him in the head.At this point there are 2 men with knives left. I tell them both to keep backing up, separating them and forcing one to back up to the fire. I then kick the poor man into the fire to die, and quickly turn as the final man starts sprinting at me when he realizes I'm still looking to kill. I choose to save the 1 round of ammunition that I have left, and catch him in a one-on-one knife battle, knowing that I can finally win it without his buddies around to save him.I walk away from 5 dead bodies with only 1 round of ammunition left, wondering how I can make it out of an even larger battle next time.I highly recommend this game. It has its flaws, but it's easy to look past them with combat as thrilling and intense as this.			"

												Let me begin by saying when first seeing the original announcement trailer for I Am Alive, I was extremely excited. The concept was very interesting and while it seemed to be an action game there were large psycological aspects to the play style that could make for a dynamic and unique game. After a long while I had forgotten about the game and assumed it to be vaporware only to suddenly find it alive on steam, no pun intended. I immediately seized it and excitedly dove right in. Disappointment set in quickly and I now wish it had stayed lost, maintaining my fantasy of what it might have been.  I Am Alive is a post-apocalyptic survival game. Food, resources, and ammunition are scarce and people have devolved into animalistic cliques who follow a kill or be killed morality. You come in one year in the aftermath of a great earthquake which has destroyed your home town of Haverton. Looking for your wife and daughter you meet with Mei, a young girl who you connect with and decide to protect. My first qualm with this game comes with its flimsy plot line. The game immediately begins with a clear set goal in mind and then immediately falls off track and begins following a long series of tangents to a quite unfinished ending. Along this way you meet various crooks and characters of whom you only learn of three names leaving the rest as expendables with whom you make no connections. Rewards for helping these people are generally bland and unsatisfying despite considerable effort and padding in order to help them. Worse, while many could easily have something interesting to say or do, they rather instead go straight to a generic need item, recieve item, thank you formula. Enemies are just as bad, consisting of roughly 4 or five different character models and all resulting in the same action to solve the problem, kill the one with the gun first, kill the rest second. The game gives the appearance of giving options without presenting the other choices. There isn't really a diplomatic way to deal with enemies (ordering to surrender, bribing them to leave, tying them up), and if you're lucky after killing half of them, one may offer to let you knock him unconcious. My initial interest in this game came from the idea of having alot of ways to handle enemies and being given the choice between the easy way, murder, and the hard way diplomacy and mercy. Items are scarce in the game, but not very scarce apparently. There are some 20 different items in the game all performing some combination of the same three functions, restoring stamina, restoring strength, and restoring health. While a particular item may be scarce there seems to be no end the items to fill any one of these purposes. If you only have a single soda can you most likely have come across 6 or 7 water bottles, for example. Each of these items at some point can be used to help a victim solve a problem but it is frustrating when you do not have an item on your one chance meeting with a particular victim. In many cases its even more frustrating when an item serves no other real purpose but to help this victim, despite the item being readily available (cigarettes and wine). Along with this many of the victims seem to need this item only for the purpose of giving an item something to do (again cigarettes and wine). It again adds to the unfinished feeling the game gives.The environment in the game is . . . well, gray. Exteremly gray in fact. I understand the idea of soot and ash covering the town making it this way but there is a serious lack of any color in this game indoors or out. I mean orange fire, yellow dust, red brick,  and blue water bottles should not be outside the realm of possibility. I originally thought that my character was severly injured and this was some sort of indicator of his deteriorated state, similar to other survival games, however that is the entire game. While the intent was clearly to give the player the feeling of depression washing over the city, it goes from sad to boring quickly. Action scenes feel drab and uninteresting when not only repetetive  but also made up of a single constant color throughout the short five hour playthrough. Did I mention short? Cause five hours was the entire game, padding and all. The core gameplay of I Am Alive could be broken down to one hour of actual play time and 4 hours of walking through dust cloud and climbing. While climbing mechanics in certain games such as Uncharted or Tomb Raider have been made exciting by quick time events, and active gameplay through the process, I Am Alive has made the sequence tedious. Adding the stamina bar would be an interesting twist on the game if it did not add to the padding between actual gameplay. Overall probably the biggest let down in game history, and that includes Duke Nukem. I hope the developers can sleep alright at night.			"

												I've had enough. This game brought me the edge of my patience. Although I like the post-apocalyptic genre, this game sucks at ""survival"" concept. If I had wanted to play a platform game, I wouldn't have played this. I agree that the game has new things like limited ammo, strategical choice of killing enemies, stamina etc. But it shouldn't have been based on just climbing and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stamina. Soundtrack and ambience music are cool; however that tension track whenever stamina decreases made me sick. Let's continue with the camera angles and character movements which were unsatifactory. It was hard to focus on enemy sight and game controls generally reacted late. Checkpoints saves were terrible. Although having retries when helping victims seems a good idea, losing all of them causes you to start over the chapter. The game setting was very good but those blurry graphics do not appeal to me. The story was cliche but I wasn't on that point actually. Sorry ""I Am Alive"", I really wanted to love you.			"

												This game is for serious post apocalyptic fans only.  I really wanted to love it but I just can't recommend it for the average gamer.ProsGreat level design, atmosphere, and texturesOkay story...good dialogueConsHorrendous controls (total console port)Camera control issuesFighting system is teh suckVery hardThere are some interesting ideas with the combat; the main one being you can use your gun to psych people out eventhough you may not have ammo.If you play this, I recommend doing it on Easy so you doing spend eternity replaying chapters.  It kind of being a sandbox (in that there are generally several ways to get to the same place) it does not allow for exploration very easily.The main mechanics are completely derived from the PS2 game Disaster Report, which in my mind created this genre of Tomb Raider platformer + management of health + disaster scenario.  Which is a good thing.  It means you really need to plan your actions especially while climbing. If you like climbing stuff and post apocalyptic environments, then it should be good. Otherwise, I would not bother.			"

Its like the last of us and uncharted had a love child, the survival elements, environment and level design is very last of us but there is alot of climbing and puzzels like uncharted, every bullet matters, If you like either Uncharted/Tomb Raider or Last Of Us, this is a great game to pick up, while I was initally frustrated with the game crashing twice, near the start, I am glad, I pressed on, its not the best on Windows 10 due to the 2 aformentioned crashes, but I had no problems after that point			"

												Sadly I really wanted to like this game but could not.Graphics: Outdated but decent enough. There is a lack of colour, very drab. I can understand this type of art direction but in order for it to be effective you need some occasional constrast... of which there is none. No bright red blood. No yellow hues from an explosion. Not even the flashback/video cut scenes have much to offer.If the desire was to depress the player then the project manager succeeded.Audio: The sound design is nothing to write home about nor write much here in the review. The music is barely noticable and not in the good subtle way. The voice acting is fine and the sfx are okay but just okay.Plot: Fairly straight forward, no real twists or anything that would raise an eyebrow.Gameplay: A port and somewhat poor. The controls work fine once you fine tune but I got bored fairly quickly. I played about 2 hours on my pc and another 4 on a friend's. It just didn't grab me sadly. I did like the idea that bullets are extremely rare but what I don't understand is why people don't create other projectile weapons. A bow & arrow is simple and easy to make as is a crossbow, sling, throwing knives made from sharpen metal scrap etc. etc. Just seems weird that everyone only has melee weapons.If it's super cheap and you want to play you can finish it in 6 hours but I found it rather disappointing given the original CGI trailer I saw back in 2006 for PS3 games... it could have been something really interesting. Oh well plently of other post-apoc games out there.			"

												Brilliant premise, flawed mechanic, unfinished game (the entire ending is shortened to a 5 second clip with most of the story still open), short playtime. If it's really cheap, like 5$ or less, it's worth the experience of seeing what game COULD have been, but the ultra-liniar, watered down, unrealized ambition that you get won't be worth more than that.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!It's constantly crashing (Not only for me but for a whole lot of people), which will never be fixed since the developers aren't planning on releasing a patch for that issue. What's exactly bad about this is the fact that checkpoints are pretty far apart - which means you are required to replay easily more than 10-15 minutes of the game. Another crash within that timeframe is very likely. That's pretty sad actually since the game was a lot of fun on the consoles.			"

												I saw this game as a good apoc/survival game. BOY WAS I WRONG. this game is beyond difficult. The controls are terrible, its unbalanced in the NPC favor half the time. A great example is that you aim by looking, its great in theory, but move your mouse just one nanometer to the left and all of a sudden you shot at the wrong person and ,, you're dead... OH, dont even get me started in when you have to deal with 3 or 4 people and you only have one bullet. OH you want to run to take cover so you can heaI? Also here's another question. I picked up a pistol and ONE bullet, how is it that the same pistol that gets picked up by another guy, he gets three shots off? SAME GUN SAME INSTANCE, only difference is HE picked up the gun and not ME. Oh, and when you get to four people.. dont even get me started on that unbalanced. here you have ONE bullet, one blade.. and now you have to deal with -sigh-  Oh. and before you say go on easy mode.. This is easy modewould want a refund but that is unlikely. I would give 1 star but even that is too high a raiting. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. PS: All hate or flack I get due to this post will be removed. Thank you			"

												Let me begin by saying when first seeing the original announcement trailer for I Am Alive, I was extremely excited. The concept was very interesting and while it seemed to be an action game there were large psycological aspects to the play style that could make for a dynamic and unique game. After a long while I had forgotten about the game and assumed it to be vaporware only to suddenly find it alive on steam, no pun intended. I immediately seized it and excitedly dove right in. Disappointment set in quickly and I now wish it had stayed lost, maintaining my fantasy of what it might have been.  I Am Alive is a post-apocalyptic survival game. Food, resources, and ammunition are scarce and people have devolved into animalistic cliques who follow a kill or be killed morality. You come in one year in the aftermath of a great earthquake which has destroyed your home town of Haverton. Looking for your wife and daughter you meet with Mei, a young girl who you connect with and decide to protect. My first qualm with this game comes with its flimsy plot line. The game immediately begins with a clear set goal in mind and then immediately falls off track and begins following a long series of tangents to a quite unfinished ending. Along this way you meet various crooks and characters of whom you only learn of three names leaving the rest as expendables with whom you make no connections. Rewards for helping these people are generally bland and unsatisfying despite considerable effort and padding in order to help them. Worse, while many could easily have something interesting to say or do, they rather instead go straight to a generic need item, recieve item, thank you formula. Enemies are just as bad, consisting of roughly 4 or five different character models and all resulting in the same action to solve the problem, kill the one with the gun first, kill the rest second. The game gives the appearance of giving options without presenting the other choices. There isn't really a diplomatic way to deal with enemies (ordering to surrender, bribing them to leave, tying them up), and if you're lucky after killing half of them, one may offer to let you knock him unconcious. My initial interest in this game came from the idea of having alot of ways to handle enemies and being given the choice between the easy way, murder, and the hard way diplomacy and mercy. Items are scarce in the game, but not very scarce apparently. There are some 20 different items in the game all performing some combination of the same three functions, restoring stamina, restoring strength, and restoring health. While a particular item may be scarce there seems to be no end the items to fill any one of these purposes. If you only have a single soda can you most likely have come across 6 or 7 water bottles, for example. Each of these items at some point can be used to help a victim solve a problem but it is frustrating when you do not have an item on your one chance meeting with a particular victim. In many cases its even more frustrating when an item serves no other real purpose but to help this victim, despite the item being readily available (cigarettes and wine). Along with this many of the victims seem to need this item only for the purpose of giving an item something to do (again cigarettes and wine). It again adds to the unfinished feeling the game gives.The environment in the game is . . . well, gray. Exteremly gray in fact. I understand the idea of soot and ash covering the town making it this way but there is a serious lack of any color in this game indoors or out. I mean orange fire, yellow dust, red brick,  and blue water bottles should not be outside the realm of possibility. I originally thought that my character was severly injured and this was some sort of indicator of his deteriorated state, similar to other survival games, however that is the entire game. While the intent was clearly to give the player the feeling of depression washing over the city, it goes from sad to boring quickly. Action scenes feel drab and uninteresting when not only repetetive  but also made up of a single constant color throughout the short five hour playthrough. Did I mention short? Cause five hours was the entire game, padding and all. The core gameplay of I Am Alive could be broken down to one hour of actual play time and 4 hours of walking through dust cloud and climbing. While climbing mechanics in certain games such as Uncharted or Tomb Raider have been made exciting by quick time events, and active gameplay through the process, I Am Alive has made the sequence tedious. Adding the stamina bar would be an interesting twist on the game if it did not add to the padding between actual gameplay. Overall probably the biggest let down in game history, and that includes Duke Nukem. I hope the developers can sleep alright at night.			"

												I've had enough. This game brought me the edge of my patience. Although I like the post-apocalyptic genre, this game sucks at ""survival"" concept. If I had wanted to play a platform game, I wouldn't have played this. I agree that the game has new things like limited ammo, strategical choice of killing enemies, stamina etc. But it shouldn't have been based on just climbing and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stamina. Soundtrack and ambience music are cool; however that tension track whenever stamina decreases made me sick. Let's continue with the camera angles and character movements which were unsatifactory. It was hard to focus on enemy sight and game controls generally reacted late. Checkpoints saves were terrible. Although having retries when helping victims seems a good idea, losing all of them causes you to start over the chapter. The game setting was very good but those blurry graphics do not appeal to me. The story was cliche but I wasn't on that point actually. Sorry ""I Am Alive"", I really wanted to love you.			"

Nothing special if you ask me. You constantly low on ammo and supplies... You climb big collapsed skycrapers, fight for survival, scavenge, loot, try to survive through dust fogs...One thing that I didn't liked that this game is short. You can complete it on highest difficulty in 4-5 hours (if you know where to go, how to deal with enemies and where required items to save survivors are) in 120% game progress.			"

												At first I thought this had a lot of potential and even recommended it to others. It turned out to be limited, pretty shallow delivery on some potentially deep concepts. I wanted to like it but it really disappointed. Note to developer; don't make it hard for the sake of difficulty. Also, if I want to go back to a place I know might have resource wht can't I? In a real life scenario- I would! I sure as heck wouldn't limit myself is such a hostile situation. In short don't pay for frustration.			"

												A post apocalytpic survival game. As i play this game i feel it had so much potential but so poorly executed maybe a remake would be better for this game with more options and choices as this game showed great potential. 1 good thing i feel for this game is that there are no zombies , its realistic.1 thing i really didnt like is its color its all grim, grey and dark.Its 50-50 game buy when in sales .

												NOT SO EXCITING.Most of time, something like Prince of Persia, because of climbing and so on but, with WAY less quality than Prince of Persia or Assassin's Creed, by example. ♥♥♥♥ing mobile cameras in third person, as in Tomb Raider, by example, with typical issues with such a approach.Slow and, most of time, boring. Bad control's response time, difficult to accuratelly do what you are trying to do. WEIRD COMBAT CONTROL. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons, no bullets, when you are facing more than one people with guns, you are dead, while trying to resolve your fight with some others with a machete.IMHO, it doesn¡t worth having it. Look for anything else, with more rythm and better control.			"

												This is the first time I've had fun with a linear game like this. Even though you dont have several choices in your path and area to move ahead, the choices come during your interactions with other people. ""Do I use my last first aid kit on these injured strangers?"" ""Do I need to use this last bullet to survive?"" ""Which one do I use it on?"" etc. Although the graphics aren't incredibly detailed and flashy, it's still fitting for this game. The climbing and jumping is kinda fun, but nothing as free as something like Assassin's Creed. Look at the price for this game though. Totally worth getting if you like post apoc games.			"

												Wow. As far as I'm concerned, this game is severely underrated. Get it.Yes, it does have bits and pieces I don't like - the entire world is grey-brown-depressing, but then again, this is about a global apocalyptic event that destroyed the world as we knew it. I found myself looking up to the (red) health bar from time to time for a contrast, however.But it is surprisingly well-done. The music is good, and while the circumstances of ""The Event"" are never detailed, the repercussions are. Society has vanished and mankind is showing just how little it takes for everything  to deteriorate further. There's a shortage of everything - you feel like kissing every bullet before firing it at someone. Luckily (but a little late in the game) you will also find a hunting bow, with its arrows being re-usable.The only thing I don't really like is the ending, but for the sake of this being a recommendation, I won't spoil it for anyone. It is by no means a bad ending, just leaves me wanting more.			"

												I just finished this.  $15 for a 6 hour true surivial horror/apocalyptic game is a great deal.  The game runs flawlessy maxed out on my laptop and controls great with a mouse and keyboard.  The combat is something different and unlike anything else and the fatigue climbing system isn't that bad either.  The graphics really bugged me at first but the thick dust (somtimes you can't see more than a few yards infront of you), and film grain grew on me, it gave it a very eerie feel.  With a little more polish and time this could have been a great new IP but it's still great.   I'd say it's a must buy if you're a fan of surivial horror or apocalyptic games, especially at this price...and I can see myself playing through it again soon on harder difficulties.8/10			"

After that, this game was a lot of fun. To those complaining about the gray colors, you're in a crumbling city with volcanic ash blowing in constantly. Naturally it's going to have some discolored elements to it. I think this is what gives the game it's visual appeal.After fixing the problem with my gamepad, I no longer have any issues with this title. I would recommend it to friends.			"

												I Am Alive is such a peculiar game. It's one of those games that I play, and don't really enjoy, but want to keep playing. I mean, The game is very ambitious, and I'm having some amount of fun with it, but there's just some things about it that you can't help but think how this game may have benefited from some different design choices.I enjoy the challenge that the limited continues provide.  It makes you want to play the game more carefully. I feel like the game rewards you for exploring, as you find additional items, and sometimes survivors to help, which will give you an additional retry, but it also punishes you by making your stamina go down, making you almost not want to explore.It's little things like that where the game is sending you mixed messages where it starts to feel like a chore to play. Yet, then I end up raiding an area with a whole bunch of enemies, and I have to carefully pick & choose my next move, trying to make people surrender, or pushing them far enough back to kick them off a ledge, or getting close enough to stab them with my machette. all the while, I'm making sure I do them all in the right order and quick enough in order to avoid getting hit, and conserving my ammo, which is very precious.  Some might find this tedious and complicated, but I find it tense & exhilirating.After you get through an area, just fighting group after group of guys, the game just makes you feel like this awesome Mad Max kind of character, and it's those moments, and the story (which is somewhat basic but kind of intriguing) that keeps me coming back to it.The game is definitely not for everyone, and it has it's flaws... but for people who enjoys survival horror games, or just games with interesting systems and mechanics, I'd say to definitely check it out.

												Pretty bland game play. Don't know if im even going to bother finishing it. The combat is horrid I mean seriously horrid as in its more of a puzzle then a fight since you get insta killed unless you follow the particular kill order the game pounds into your brain during the tutorial. Combat is in no way skill based you can not kill a fellow human being unless its 1v1 because each kill involves an annoying qte that takes 5-6 secs and leaves you totally vulnerable. Also health items are insanely hard to find and with no health regen you are going to be seeing alot of gray blurry screens unless you are really careful. Also platforming which reminds me of a kind of cluncky AC game are ruined by the stamina meter which makes every climb an annoying timed puzzle. Finally the story isn't exactly thrilling with everything being a bland fetch quest :P.Overall this game has become a chore to play and I strongly recommend people to avoid it.			"

												Reasonably bleak postapocalyptic tale that spent ages in development hell. It definitely shows, since the game has multiple gameplay issues and weird design decisions. Even though I got frustrated on several occasions, I kept playing, so they did something right here.I really dug the lo-fi aesthetics, extremely muted color palette, and generally enjoyed the plentiful traversal problems and the pseudo-open world. Combat is the weakest link here, but in a 4-6 hour experience it doesn't became a serious nuisance. Not a bad game overall, just not great either.			"

												I played about half of this game before getting sidetracked by other games. I have not yet returned to the game, but plan to eventually.There are three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Survivor. I started out playing on Easy, but it was an unsatisfying experience. Then I played on the Survivor level, which was quite challenging, but more interesting and fun since resources (bullets, food, medicine) were scarce and I had to think carefully about whether or not to use each and when. The two biggest challenges were conserving my stamina as I climbed around and battling other survivors when they appeared in groups.The game does have a few problems. Most significant is the checkpoint save system. You cannot save your progress in the game yourself. Instead, the game saves your progress once you pass certain predetermined points. It's difficult to tell when these points will occur (or even when they have occurred) and they don't always occur when you might expect. They're also too widely spaced. This has the effect of intensifying your desire to push forward, but it also means you'll spend a fair amount of time retracing your recent progress.The control of your character, particularly when climbing, is sometimes glitchy and too unforgiving. There were many instances when I attempted to change direction during a climb and failed to do so because the character doesn't react quickly enough to the controls. The stamina mechanic, which limits the time you can spend climbing, can make this problem frustrating.You do not have complete freedom to take actions like jumping, climbing, or crouching. You'll be able to climb a fence or jump up on a crate in one area but you won't be able to do so in other identical areas. This intensifies the feeling that your progress through the game is predetermined and ""on rails"".Despite these problems, the game is engrossing. The visuals, voice acting, and atmosphere do a good job of drawing you into the game's post-apocalyptic world. Overall, I'd say the game serves up adequate, but not stellar, entertainment value. I bought the game during Steam's winter sale for $5 and so far feel like I'm getting my money's worth, but I don't think the game is worth more than $10.tl;dr Play the game on hardest difficulty for the best experience. The game's advantages (engrossing atmosphere and novel gameplay mechanics) are held back by some faults (a checkpoint save system, control issues, and lack of freedom) that result in the game being a fair, but not fantastic, value. Worth it for $5 but not at more than $10. "

												A very middle of the road game, everyone thing about it was extremely mediocre. It was fun at times, but other times it was tedious and boring. A solid 5/10, a 6/10 once I removed the black and white filter. I only spent $5 on this during the 2012 Winter Sale, I suggest you don't pay any more then that.			"

												In my opinion you should avoid this title. I couldn't get really far because on PC the controls aren't smooth and well define it's hard to define but  bottom lane it made the game unplayable. The look of the game is pretty cool and the idea behind the game is well thought of so if you find a way around the control the core of the game is pretty nice. 4/10			"

												Pros: Clever ""threaten with gun"" mechanics that make confrontations tense. You can practically taste the bleak, hostile and claustrophobic post-apocalyptic world. Climbing mechanics that are closer to Prince of Persia than Assassin's Creed, and add further tension and intensity with a Stamina meter and the chance of a lethal drop every few steps. The survival aspect is well-done, with exploration being about equally likely to lead to more of the sparse number of much-needed inventory items, as to another potentially deadly confrontation. Largely captures the grey moral nature of the post-apocalyptic world, like the movie The Road; no one can trust one another, and someone pointing a gun at you and/or threatening you may not be looking to kill and/or rob you, they may just be scared. Challenging. Once you've slid down a slanted skyscraper, jumped the gap in a modern bridge or barely made your way through a collapsed building, you will never again feel completely comfortable in our otherwise seemingly strong, sturdy buildings.Cons: Unless you're playing on Easy, the Retry feature is pretty ridiculous: you have to complete a level without running out of them(in spite of the trial-and-error nature of much of the game), meaning without making very many mistakes(you can earn extra Retries), or you have to start it all over - and trust me, in this, you will make mistakes. Once you've completed a level, you can do it over, but if you go back to a level before your current one, it will delete your progress beyond that level(forget about replayability)! If these aspects were something hardcore gamers could activate to challenge themselves, that would be fine, but with it being the way the game is designed, it loses a lot of potential fans. Ending is unsatisfying. The last third of the game is prepostorous - it's as if it was developed by someone else, and they thought it was a regular shooter, rather than a ""make every last bullet count"" survival game.My recommendation: Give it a go if you love at least one of the following: Prince of Persia style climbing, a survival challenge, dark post-apocalyptic fiction and unconventional approaches to taking out enemies.

												Me not really being a fan of the Adventure genre and getting this fairly cheap on sale, I didn't expect much from this title but I was surprised by a few things in this game. For a game that contained no monsters, zombies, aliens, killer machines, etc... it was still pretty creepy. Graphics were artfully done. Level design was great, though does get cheesey at times with how they limit your movement. Sounds were phenominal and really absorbed you into the suspense. (with out revealing anything) The storyline had a dark and a good message. On the other hand, I got 8 and a half hours out of this title before completing it on normal and does not offer much replayability. A minus for me. The next problem I had is that it is still a little glitchy and spontaneously assimilating with a rock face (or building, etc...) really puts a dampener on game progression (it sucks). Controls were a little touchy but you kind of get used to it. All in all, I'd give this game a 75% (solid C).  I hope Ubisoft considers making a 2 to pick up where this one left off and corrects the this issues that this one had but an all around decent game. Rox recommends (buy on sale)!			"

												I just finished this.  $15 for a 6 hour true surivial horror/apocalyptic game is a great deal.  The game runs flawlessy maxed out on my laptop and controls great with a mouse and keyboard.  The combat is something different and unlike anything else and the fatigue climbing system isn't that bad either.  The graphics really bugged me at first but the thick dust (somtimes you can't see more than a few yards infront of you), and film grain grew on me, it gave it a very eerie feel.  With a little more polish and time this could have been a great new IP but it's still great.   I'd say it's a must buy if you're a fan of surivial horror or apocalyptic games, especially at this price...and I can see myself playing through it again soon on harder difficulties.8/10			"

												I Am Alive is a bleak, depressing game. This doesn't make it a bad game. In fact, I think the atmosphere is quite good. In terms of the game itself the story is quite simple. A catostrohpic event happened while you were out of town. It has taken you a year to get back to your town and you are now trying to find your wife and child. On your quest to do this, you become connected with another family and you complete missions for them.The game is brutally hard even when not on the hardest difficulty. You have scare resources and you have a stamina meter that prevents you from climbing or running forever. Also, saving the game only happens at random, spread-out times that are not controlled by the gamer. I imagine this is one of the main reason the game got beat up by critics.Overall, I loved it even though it was completely bleak.			"

												Set in a dark and dusty post-apocalyptic world, I Am Alive is pretty damn gritty. When you first boot up the game you may think the developers are aiming for a monochrome art style to reflect the emptiness of the world and the protagonist. Nope - it's just really, really dusty. Everything (seriously, everything) in the game is black, white, brown, or somewhere in between, with occasional splashes of red (to create an industrial feel as well as the obvious reason). Follow the exploits of Professor Brian Cox as he tries to find his family, help fellow survivors, and explain the Pauli exclusion principle to increasingly ignorant and hostile thugs. At times, this is deep, rewarding, and engaging stuff.Unfortunately for the Professor, his resources are somewhat limited. Our Lancastrian hero's weaponry is limited to his machete and a pistol. However, the latter seems to be used more as a mechanic for conserving resources than as a weapon, as bullets can only be found from enemies who have...guns! Combat can therefore become frustrating as confrontations with thugs are common and it's difficult to know who to shoot first and who to leave for a struggle kill with your machete.This isn't the only time tactics are needed for conserving resources, however, as Professor Cox regains health and stamina through the rare packets of food and drink that he finds perched on outcrops and crates by a fellow survivor who presumably didn't want to make things to easy for those after him. The game revolves around stamina and climbing as Professor Brian must scale increasingly dizzying heights during each episode. Despite his PhD in physics, the Professor's stamina depletes frighteningly quickly making each section of climbing a nail-biting game of tactics. Thankfully, as seen above, Brian can have snacks while hanging from girders to give him a boost. How this is meant to work in real life exactly I have no idea.So what happens when the Professor falls to his death, or some thugs grow tired of hearing about eleven-dimensional M-theory and slaughter him with machetes? Well, on ""Normal"" mode he'll be given three retries for each ""episode"" which will allow him to revert to a checkpoint a few minutes of gameplay back. It soon becomes apparent, however, that given the maze-like webs of scaffolding Professor Cox must negotiate and how difficult is to know which enemies to eliminate first on so few bullets, these retries really aren't enough. It's not uncommon to have to retry up to twenty minutes of gameplay following a clumsy death near the end of one ""episode"". The game only saves at the end of each 20-30 minute episode, so get ready to sit down for long periods at a time with this game.Although we're used to Brian gazing dreamily up at the stars as though he wouldn't hurt a fly, the game's moral direction is altogether more ambiguous. You're rewarded for helping injured survivors and reuniting friends and family, but more frequently you're forced into combat you don't want or need. I would have liked to have seen a less linear path through levels, with some scope for stealth and avoiding conflict.When the game works, it works well and flows nicely. Although some of the events in the game feel jarringly too convenient (early on an earthquake pushes over a building, allowing you to slide down the wall back to where you started form and the next checkpoint), a dark atmosphere draws you in and it's hard to resist helping Professor Brian back to the university in time for his next lecture on electron potential wells.

												I Am Alive was once a survival horror game with big dreams and high hopes. When first conceived, it was purposed to be set in an explorable, expansive, post-apocalyptic world with deep gameplay mechanics focused on human interaction in times of crises. But two years after its ambitious beginnings, the original developers, Darkworks, handed the project off to Ubisoft Shanghai. In its new home, I Am Alive was rebuilt as an arcade title with many of its intended features either removed or condensed. So how does it fare in its current state?I had not heard much about I Am Alive prior to release, but if its original narrative was anything like the final product, then the idea probably was not very good to begin with. The game takes place a year after America is struck by a massive earthquake known as “The Event.” You play as an unnamed survivor, separated from and in search of his family—at least, that is how the story begins. The plot makes a sudden shift early in the game and becomes centered on the protagonist helping reunite someone else’s family for the remainder of the campaign. By the time we reach the end credits, our protagonist’s personal mission has made almost no progress. Some may find this hugely unsatisfying, though I suppose in some ways, it is poetic and fitting to such a morbid game.While I Am Alive’s narrative is devoid of creativity, its gameplay mechanics fortunately are not. Being aware of your surrounding is pivotal to survival. “The Event” has left much of America uninhabitable, filling the atmosphere with ash and dust, and to escape the hazardous environment, you must scale structures high enough to reach fresh air. This process eventually loses its novelty after the first few times, but it deters players from rushing and encourages exploration. But the most innovate idea I Am Alive offers is the idea to threaten and bluff. I say “idea” because its implementation is just deeply, deeply flawed. During confrontations, you may raise your pistol, loaded or not, to halt enemies in their tracks. At this point, the ability to negotiate would have been a hugely welcomed feature, but alas, the system never gets deeper. The moment you look away, your enemies will attack, rendering threats extremely useless since you are forced to kill regardless.I Am Alive’s single redeeming element is its atmosphere, which captures all the greatest facets of survival horror. The thick dust at ground level obscures vision beyond a few feet from your character. The element of surprise comes from not knowing who or what you will run into until it is too late. Ammo is extremely scarce, and your character is fragile, so knowing when to flee or fight becomes essential. Dying NPCs taking refuge throughout the city convey a genuine sense of desperation and futility. This is survival horror done right.Atmosphere and missed ideas aside, nothing else about I Am Alive is very memorable. The graphics are bland, the soundtrack forgettable, and the animations clunky at best. There are side quests, but those are far and few in between. Remnants of Darkworks’ original ideas are still apparent in the final product, but all of them marred by poor execution. I sincerely hope that Darkworks’ vision will resurface one day, refined and in all its entirety. Until then, you should find your survival horror fix elsewhere.Grade: 2/5			"

												Feels like an interactive movie, not only in terms of ambience but also in terms of moral decisions. The game is based on 3 major concepts: A)  Carefully manage your human constitution and dexterity. I Am Alive does its best to constantly remind you that you  are human and fragile. A realistic moving/climbing system alongside a revolutionary psycological combat system play their part in this as well.B) Explore. But do so with consequences. You might find something of use or you might use all your supplies for nothing. C) Help others in need, however make sure that helping them doesn't jeopardise your own survival. Moral decisions are often in I Am Alive and the game does not really reward you for the right choice. There is no right choice and the only reward comes from your own morality and mentality of living.If you are a fan of I Am Legend, but you are too old for mindless zombie killing then this is the title for you.

												I am a survivor. I Am Alive. This game throws the player into a crumbling post-apocalyptic city, armed with pistol but no bullets. Resources are scarce, and survival is brutal. Combat becomes a game of deception and intimidation. Traversing a destroyed city will see you climbing everywhere you go, but the stamina system makes each climb potentially deadly. Success will depend on resource management more than anything else, as each bullet or bottle of water is precious. Some aspects of the game are quite repetitive or tedious, but this was not overly noticeable within the 6 hours of gameplay it took me to finish.			"

												I Am Alive is a survival game which focuses on heavy player choices and immersing the player. While i thought the game was really good and worth the money some may not and here is why:Dated graphicsClunky controlsAnd a buggy camera which sometimes won't move.But me being a fan of post apocalyptic themes i decided to look past all of this and what i saw was awesome, while not all will like that kind of gameplay i loved it. You are able to bluff enemies with a empty gun but some of them will stop up and say your full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and encourage others to attack. I thought that was a awesome thing i had not seen before, you also need to switch targets sometimes to keep them afraid of being shot. Another key factor is the extremely rare supplies which you need but you only have 3 retry's or you have to start over. Additional retry's can be aquired by giving away supplies and medicine to people, so that keeps the game tense.The soundtrack which i found really good is also a indicator for when climbing buildings since the soundtrack becomes more intense as you lose stamina. 0 stamina results in falling down and dying.Overall i found the game to be really good and worth my money since i played it three times. But keep in mind this is a arcade game so it only last for about 5 hours on average.Presentation: 7.0Graphics: 7.0Sound: 8.0Game-play: 8.0Lasting Appeal: 9.0Overall Rating: 8.5 "

												I am a survivor. I Am Alive. This game throws the player into a crumbling post-apocalyptic city, armed with pistol but no bullets. Resources are scarce, and survival is brutal. Combat becomes a game of deception and intimidation. Traversing a destroyed city will see you climbing everywhere you go, but the stamina system makes each climb potentially deadly. Success will depend on resource management more than anything else, as each bullet or bottle of water is precious. Some aspects of the game are quite repetitive or tedious, but this was not overly noticeable within the 6 hours of gameplay it took me to finish.			"

												Ok, just made it through the game, which seems to be a mixture of survival, adventure, climbing and TPS/FPS. Here's the results:Pro:+ Story. Grounded, realistic - not off-hook or with irrational twists.+ Setting/atmosphere. Dark and dusty, gloomy undertone without being pathetic.+ The voice-acting! A real big plus. Little Mei has the most realistic and beautiful voice for a kid I ever experienced in a video game.Cons.- Graphics. Obviously it's a console port. You have to live with that.- Game time. It only takes about six hours for a complete game. Well, as there are survivors to save, this time could be extended if you want to find and help them all (20 altogether). Otherwise replayability's low.- Controls. They are a pain. If you're used to play FPS games, you will have a hard time learning the controls. don't be frustrated to lose your first fights because you pressed the wrong buttons. It's a console game after all, maybe the devs did not want to screw up the game mechanics by changing controls on pc. who knows.Conclusion: You might have a look if you're into survival, like a gloomy atmosphere and don't expect innovative gameplay or experiences.

												Buggy mess of a game.  Couldn't even get past the opening tutorial levels without major issues.  When using the keyboard, the down button wouldn't work when I needed to slide down a cable.  I then switched over to my XBOX controller and got past that section just fine, but when I got a little further and confronted the stranger near the pit, the X button wouldn't issue commands (even though that was the button I needed to use in this situation according to the on screen prompt and the default controller layout).  What a waste of money this game was.  The graphics are also terrible.  Save your money and stay far away from this piece of crap.			"

												I'm a little unsure how I feel about the game overall. It's got some strong, cool stuff - the dusty visuals are great, and a lot of the gameplay is genuinely intense and suspenseful. Combat has some clever ideas, especially bluffing and false (or real) surrenders, though it's overused in the final chapters. There are some control annoyances (though the camera problem seems to be specific to the PC version). And the thing that bugs me the most is how the story claims to be about one man's journey to find his family, but really that's the backdrop for a story about one man's journey to find someone else's family.The game is cheap, though, so it could still be worth your time. The camera problem I experienced apparently isn't present in the console versions, so if you're interested, I'd recommend playing it on XBox or PS3.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2013/01/i-am-alive.html "

If you fail to solve the problem in one shot, you watch the main charactor die over and over and over... You get the point. If your play the easy setting it doesn't punish you for these failing. But, it you go to the more difficult setting you have a limited amount of retries. In the end it just was not enjoyable to play.			"

												Pro: Your decisions feel like they have consequences.Con but also a Pro: You often do not get to decide (unless death is a choice) and those consequences can make you look like a monster. Pro: The story is compelling.Con: The story telling is disjointed, lacking content and feels linear despite not moving the story forward one bit.Pro: Combat is intense (because of the story content in the mechanics).Con: The only combat scenarios not First-Person-Shooter (FPS) are Quick-Time-Events (QTE) and the game is lacking in mechanics for non-FPS resolutions to conflict.The game music pretty much tells you if there's an enemy nearby which detracts from any need to be subtle, secret or careful.Buy this game for the story.  The concept is good. The story is alright. The combat is rubbish. The execution needs considerable work and the graphics are not optimized. It's worth getting on sale for under $10 for the concept alone. The climbing, the environment, the story though lacking all tied together to push me foward. It felt like Tomb Raider in a post apocalyptic dystopian wasteland amidst the crumbling remains of a once bustling city.			"

												After a series of battles with 3 different groups of thugs, me armed only with a gun with 1 single bullet and a machette, I'm giving up on this game.  Like others have said, it is kill or be killed - there is no other option.  And killing others is downright tough!  EVERY encounter with thugs results in me dying at least a few times before I get it right, made all the more difficult by the camera, which is programmed to automatically focus on one thug at a time.  The result is that after I perform a surprise kill with the machete, the camera focuses on whoever is in my current line of signt, even if the remaining gun-toting thug is behind me.  So although I need to do a quick surprise kill + shoot the last gunslinger, I end up shooting some dude clear across the courtyard who is armed with a knife, and then get shot in the back of the head by the guy I was struggling to aim at, who was standing right behind/next to me - oh the ignominy!These battles have become so un-fun that I don't care to play the game anymore.  I might watch it on youtube, though, just to find out what happens :)			"

												I Am Alive was a really good Xbox arcade game, with a subpar PC port that costs way too much after 4 years.Graphically this game is beautiful, but at the same time is almost a direct port from console with no extra effort put in to make it look better on PC, meaning it lacks the full gamut of options a game intended for PC would have. The desaturated color pallette common to movies and games that share similar themes like Fallout, The Road, Rage, Book of Eli, Mad Max and other post apocalyptic media fits the game perfectly. Unfortunately, it also garnered the game a lot of negative attention from whining casuals who only see overall trends in gaming and don't judge games based on their merits.I Am Alive is the story of a guy who was away from home when weather disasters destroyed the world [ostensibly] and has spent every moment since trying to get back to his wife and daughter. The game combines recognizable platforming with beautiful post-civilization landscapes, but also features melee and gun combat more akin to a realistic survival game (at least until the latter part of the game where you get a lot of ammo). Ammo is scarce and healing items more scarce. Everyone you encounter is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trying to kill you, and even some of the people you try to rescue will try to trick you into being killed like a lot of random NPCs in Witcher 3 or GTA5 will do.The story is predictable, and I'm not sure if the title of the game is supposed to be ironic or not, but I wish that the Chinese sect of Ubisoft that developed this were working on a full fledged sequel or re-imagining. Really the negative aspects of this game are the low fidelity graphics and the awful controller support on PC - not to mention the obvious lack of Steamworks integration for things like achievements.  I really wish the controller mapping was functional, because it makes this game all but unplayable on computer.If you can look past that or use something like Controller Companion, this game is worth the time of anyone who likes platformers or post-civilization games.

												Absolutely a massively underated game. Yes its an xbox 360 port but with the new patch update and controller support, its quite beautiful in two ways. Graphically, yes its dated graphically but atmospherically it more than makes up for it. I personally really like the washed, sun bleached look. It all works brilliantly to be another character in itself. Bleak, dusty and desperate. You will stair in wonder at the sun glare and vista's through broken building windows, but despair about looking down to the dust soup below that you know you have to delve into.          The second positive is its combat is a really great attempt at different. You are taught to think about using the tools they give you with such an incredibly limited ammo supply, seriously limited. I have used the same one arrow for my bow in nearly every battle.           The added genius of a taunt option where you threaten with your pistol so that thugs back away at its sight and beg not be shot is great. However they will grow in confidence if you taunt to much and call your bluff realising that the gun is actually empty. Then they may attack, so will you machete, use the bow or run. You will die in this game, but each time it teaches you this is survival, so survive. It has a very standard but competent climbing and traversing mechanic which does its job well with good animation, although our hero does choose his own path occasionally.          If I have one gripe its that the save system is spread out quite a bit and when you have exhausted your in-between checkpoint tokens, gathered for saving civilians along the way, you will be sent back quite a way to a previous save point, and with this loose a lot progress that you may have made. This game rewards exploration if you wish to risk it but with such intermitant saves points it also holds exploration back somewhat which is its only slight issue. For a couple of pounds on steam, even if you pay a fiver i highly recommend this little gem. Think 'Shadow of the collosus' meets 'the last of us' and you are there.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, I really did! There are so many concepts that could have led to a good game but it just didnt work out after all.The character moves very clumsy and laggy, what would have been kind of an important part for a game where it is all about the movement. During the first 30 minutes the atmosphere was very nice but dropped quickly after. One thing that could have got me is the combat system, if it wasnt so repetetive and dull after a few fights. I might even have kept going if the story and encounters were any good but even that was too weak and slow.I did like the concept of stamina, climbing and the fighting mechanics but like I said, I couldnt just enjoy it after all and deinstalled it after 2 1/2 hours because it just wasnt worth the time.

												Every time I see this game in my library, I'm ashamed I payed money for it. Unless you enjoy excessively long and redundant climbing puzzles that are incredibly slow and boring, this game is not for you. Combat usually consists of... 1) See enemy. 2) Shoot enemy with gun. 3) engage in quick time event to kill the other enemies, mashing the same button over and over, hoping one of the other enemies doesn't decide they want to attack you while you are stuck in a QTE (Quick time event). ALL combat aside from firearms and sneak kills are QTEs.The exploration might be fun, if not for the blurred graphics to try to make it look better. The textures didn't look nice, so they just blurred everything. Oh yeah, the game has next to no color, so everything looks pretty similar. Movement is really clunky and the climbing is obnoxiously slow and unneccesary. Oh yeah, if you are having trouble with a section, the game will make it harder by lowering your max stamina. So in an exploration game, they discourage exploring while climbing so you don't get an obnoxious lessened max stamina, make everything look incredibly boring, and make the occasional encounter pretty underwhelming too. Ever get that feeling where you get an objective in a game and it becomes and irritation and a chore? That's basically this entire game. (Most of the exploration I found was just someone telling you to backtrack to somewhere you have already been. /:) I was incredibly disapointed by this game.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, I really did! There are so many concepts that could have led to a good game but it just didnt work out after all.The character moves very clumsy and laggy, what would have been kind of an important part for a game where it is all about the movement. During the first 30 minutes the atmosphere was very nice but dropped quickly after. One thing that could have got me is the combat system, if it wasnt so repetetive and dull after a few fights. I might even have kept going if the story and encounters were any good but even that was too weak and slow.I did like the concept of stamina, climbing and the fighting mechanics but like I said, I couldnt just enjoy it after all and deinstalled it after 2 1/2 hours because it just wasnt worth the time.

												My mother always told me that if I didn't have anything nice to say, I shouldn't say anything at all, and to that end, I can say that I thought the 3D platforming elements of this game were well done, if linear.  I constantly felt like I was in danger of falling off in a number of cases.  Unfortunately, there was one bit of ""danger"" music and it began to lose its punch after a while.  While there were a number of excellent city views in this game, a lot of my time also seemed to be spent with so much lens flare I could hardly see or with such an aggressive grain filter that it felt like I needed cataract surgery.  There were some interesting gameplay elements that became somewhat repetitive, but I felt like none of them ever really shined.  The exploration is fairly minimal, the plot is generic and never feels like it's really resolved, the survival aspect is somewhat tame.  I had an issue on my laptop where the ground would pop in and out depending on camera angle (I did not have this problem on my desktop, though my laptop more than meets system requirements as well).  There was one section that I was entirely unable to complete, but found a way to climb around it after a couple hours (much of it spent getting there from the previous checkpoint which was some way back as they are not very frequent).Ultimately, I think there's a market for this game, but it wasn't me.

												So.. they present you with a broken bridge, you have to climb along the side of the bridge to progress. There are any number of what look like obvious hand-holds, but only ONE handhold is actually usable in each section of the bridge, and there is nothing to say ""this is the one you can actually grab"" and meanwhile, you are running out of stamina rapidly, and then fall off and die because you ran out of stamina while you are trying to figure out where the game actually allows you to grab to try and get across this bridge.

												I Am Alive is an atmospheric apocalyptic survivor game shown from a third person perspective.  The visuals and music are haunting and the the voice acting compliments the eery mood well.  Unfortunately the game shipped in a broken state and shockingly the xbox 360 controller for PC does not work and there is no workaround short of using a third party program to map through your keyboard.  This is shameful especially considering the game is a port.  It's sad that a large publisher like Ubisoft would not rush to fix such a major bug.  Someday I Am Alive might be worth the price, but as it stands I recommend gamers stay away from this broken product.			"

ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANA English:Talking about this game ain't easy. It starts with the best premises: An immersive post-apochaliptyc atmosphere, a peculiar gameplay and a nice character story. BUT, it has an incorporated achievement system, so it doesen't use the Steam one. And that's a thing that i HATE. Because it makes achievements totally useless. The only reason of having an achievement system, it's to have them saved in your account, so you can then be satisfied and show them off. If you can't do that, they're useless. But that's the least. It doesen't investigate the catastrophe AT ALL. You don't know why, you don't know how. It lasts 6 hours MAX, counting the eventual failures. And the end is... is frickin fast. What do i mean for fast? Well, from the last mission onwards i had that feeling, like the developers had a short-term to finish the game, so they finished fit quickly and poorly. The last mission is just an enormus exaggerate and unrealistic fight with tons of enemies and the finale, well... You dead. Wanna know how? Wanna know why? lol, no, you dead. You just see your daughter (Or wife, i can't really remember) that found your camera, watches your videos and cries. And you?? Well, you dead, lol. ...So, the end isn't that great. No deep and too fast. And so much disappointing. That said, i can't really vote ""NO"" 'cause despite everything i enjoyed this little game a bit. Exluding the finale. The feeling i had, was of an hypothetical The Last Of Us, made quickly and on very low budget. If other than ""YES"" and ""NO"" there was a ""A LITTLE BIT"" option on the Steam reviews, i would pick that. But, for now, i feel forced to click ""YES"". (Sorry for my bad english)Italiano:Parlare di questo gioco non è facile. Inizia con le migliori premesse: Atmosfera post apocalittica immersiva, gameplay particolare e storia carina. Poi però ha un sistema di achievement incorporato, non usa quello di Steam. Ed è una cosa che personalmente DETESTO, perché rende gli achievement totalmente inutili. L'unico motivo degli achievement è poterli avere salvati sull'account e poterli mettere in mostra, e non puoi. Ma questo è il minimo. Non approfondisce il perché della catastrofe, neanche un po'. Dura al massimo 6 ore e qualcosa contando fallimenti vari ed eventuali, e la fine è sbrigativa. Cosa intendo per sbrigativa? Dalla missione finale in poi si ha questa sensazione, come se gli sviluppatori avessero una scadenza corta e avessero buttato il finale a caso in fretta e furia. L'ultima missione è semplicemente un gigante combattimento esagerato agli estremi, dunque poco realistico, ed il finale, beh.. Muori. Ma non è che vedi il personaggio che muore eh, semplicemente una breve cutscene mostra tua figlia (O tua moglie, sinceraente non ricordo) che trova la tua videocamera e piange. Fine del gioco. Tu sei morto, e non hai riabbracciato tua figlia. Come sei morto non si sa. Ma sei morto. Molto poco profondo e molto sbrigativo. E molto deludente. Detto questo, non mi sento però di votare ""NO"" perché nonostante tutto come esperienza di gioco non è stata catastrofica, tutto sommato, finale a parte, il gioco non mi è dispiaciuto. La sensazione che ho avuto, è stata quella di un ipotetico The Last Of Us creato di fretta e a basso budget. Ecco, se oltre a ""SI"" e ""NO"" ci fosse l'opzione ""FORSE"" per le recensioni, utilizzerei quella. Ma fino a che non implementeranno un'opzione del genere, mi vedo costretto a premere ""SI"".			"

												I Am Alive is boring. Everything about it is boring. There's nearly no color anywhere, boring characters, weak atmosphere, nearly nonexistant story, simple gameplay, and more. The graphics are pretty below average, and shadows are god awful. It's not fun to play through. It's hard to believe I ended up completing the game back on the Xbox 360.I think the main problem is the devs. Maybe a post apocalyptic story based game isn't their thing. This game has hope, and it sounds good on paper. You play as a man (I can't remember his name because he's such a weak character) that ventures back into NYC after a series of earthquakes collapses the city upon itself. It's a bit fun to traverse the city, but the climbing and stamina system is so bad, it's not that much fun. I think, in the rights hand, I Am Alive could've been a great game, but Ubisoft Shanghei failed to create a great game around some rather interesting lore. I got this game on a sale for $3.75, but I'm gonna get a Steam refund and probably use that on trading cards or something. Or wait and see if a good game goes on sale for that price.Should you get it? No, not really. Watch some videos first to see if it looks fun to you before buying if you're still really interested in this game. "

												Great concept for a game, its interesting, I like the stamina system and the enemy interactions are good however its really repetitive and the combat feels really scripted and boring.Enemy combat usually involves, observe who has a gun, surprise attack the gun person, quickly shoot the other gun guy with your one single bullet you managed to find and then get in a mouse button mash contest with the enemy with the knife. This is what anoys me with this game as its always the same and any attempt to try a different strategy usually results in you being shot once and killed.It could have been so much more fun, The graphics do a good job of looking apocalyptic and very end of the world and I am sure it is a good game for some players but for me it just doesn't get the job done at allI rate this 4/10			"

												A great post-apocaliptic game to enjoy, I Am Alive follows unnamed protagonist who tries to find his family in city Haventon destroyed by earthquake. As you progress you will be able to find diffrent resources like water and food, and later use them to replenish your stamina and health bar, so you will be able to move and climb up different hights. While the graphics look ok there is not enough to look at as whole city is in ruins and it's surrounded with moody glooms and dark colors. Gameplay is ok although it is repetitive.You will climb up different building to avoid death from polluted air, you will fight off bad guys with empty gun and machete(and later bow with arrows which is cool).There are also those who will ask you to deliver specific items to help them in return they will give you ""retry""so you will be able to continue game if you make a mistake during your playthrough.All in all it's very original game and should be given a chance to prove itself but 15$ is too much.7.5/10			"

THIS GAME SCORES [0 *1* | 2 3] = ~38% (25%-50%)(Might even only be 1of4, but I haven't seen enough of the game to judge.)""I Am Alive"" could have been good, but my experiences suggest that its game design in general is just bad.I get the ammo shortage idea, but the result the first time I came across it was this: 1) I had one bullet. Encountered a situation where I couldn't figure out a solution other than firing that one bullet. 2) Ten minutes later, I was at a fence or something, and crawling through the hole started a cutscene that I had no way of knowing would happen (So, my survival that supposedly depends on my decisions and how I balance stuff suddenly was very obviously tied to arbitrary game designer choices.), and when the cutscene was over, I was inside the fenced area and had only seconds to save my life. That's really bad game design by itself (just sucking me in there without a warning, when the rest of the game screams ""This is a simulation! You act and decide!""), but on top of that:The situation that unfolded seemed dynamic, but no matter how hard I tried to avoid it: I got shot dead. Running/hiding was no option. So, since I had used my one bullet already in a situation that called for it, I was now stuck in a ""5 attempts left ... no, 4 ... 3"" loop that was just pure frustration, and it was at that time that a suspicion grew to certainty: This game is actually bad.When I tried again, I respawned a lot earlier in the game, so in combination with the accumulated frustration and the reasonable estimate that the rest of the game would have more such crappy game design decisions, I abandoned it entirely. Would have been a refund, but back then we didn't have that luxury yet.Btw., the very gimmicky and tediously slow climbing-on-rails situations didn't help, either.			"

It stuttered constantly, had audio issues, and the input delay was so terrible that I couldn't struggle past the very first set of obstacles.

												So I wanted to see if Ubisoft Shanghai would've hired me for an accounting or marketing position. I have a nice and stable career, but I always romanticized to work in the gaming industry. I sent them my resume and went to their office for an interview - all just out of curiosity. They asked me if I played any of their games. I have not played any of their games because I only use one DRM (Steam), I don't use Uplay, Origin, the Windows' or Blizzard's DRM, etc. On my way out I asked if they could tell me the name of their games I could check out. They told me about their ""Tom Clancy's EndWar"" game, also they gave me a list of a bunch of local mobile games, and they mentioned their soon-to-be-released game ""I Am Alive"". A couple years later I finally checked out their game ""I Am Alive"" and I'm happy that I did not join that company! 


I pass their office on my way to work almost every day.

												This game has some nice moments of action, climbing, sneaking and more.You are almost everytime almost dead, out of stamina and totally out of bullets. You can be very happy if you have 1 of them.It's very good how you can interact with enemies and how they interact with you before you kill them ofc.Almost everything you do will reduce your stamina. No stamina means you dont have much health soon if you dont heal or take a rest.The story is a bit lame and has not the length i wish. You search for your wife and daughter but you find someone else and help them. Beside the mainstory you can help other people with medicine and stuff. This gives you more Replays which you need to stay in game!!!Some people say the game has a big Cliffhanger but i dont think so if you understand the end. But that's up to you.The game is not using his full potential. 6/10			"

												it looks like the areas in The Last of Us - but it´s some years older than it.""I am alive"" is a frustrating game because you WILL often die in the game.If enemies want to kill you, you only have a chance to survive if you collect and use wisely ammo for your first weapon - to use your weapon when it´s really necessary. It´s really necessary if three or four enemies attack you - then you have to be really quick. But i want to say again that it´s nearly impossible to defeat three or more enemies in one try. That´s the ""core-thing"" in this game - to be alive and kill nearly everyone who you see (but there are not so many people in the apocalyptic areas).I hated to repeat the positions in the game where i tried to survive and was killed again and again.That´s the reason why i was going to hate the game nearly - but the awsome story motivates me to play the game further and love it.(only play the game with the xbox 360 game controller for windows - otherwise it will be impossible to play it clean)The exiting ""jump-and-survive-missions"" at broken towers, bridges and railings make this game feel like you are a mountaineer (like Altair or Ezio from Assassins Creed), who risk his life to see his wife and little daughter. This game is one of the best apocalyptic and withal saddest games ever - made by ubisoft ! For me it´s one of the best games ever. It´s not too short and not too long ! Buy it if you like games with a good story ;-)			"

												Wow - I Am Disappointed.  Could be a fantastic game but the controls are . . . stupid.  Button mash to run faster, button mash for ""extreme effort"" while climbing, button mash to pry open locked gates.  Poor console port and no excuse for that these days.The game does have a great atmosphere and setting but with so-so graphics, poor gameplay and button mashing coupled with what should be great survival gameplay, sadly dumbed down to pick up the glowy objects and ignore everything else, this could have been a great game.SO much climbing - and it's slow and boring.  I sort of like the climbing stamina drain because, really, your arms would eventually get tired.  Then again climbing for such a short time causing exhaustion when you play a fit person who obviously knows how to climb is a bit silly.Ah, but it has a post apocalyptic feel so I had to buy it because I love the genre.  Sadly only a short time with this game is making me so frustrated I almost wish I hadn't spent 15 bucks.			"

												Controls are virtually unresponsive (a delay of 4-5 seconds, sometimes more) and the camera jumps around /alot/.  (I'm talkin' 90 degree rotations when I want to turn just slightly.) Pretty game breaking when my character walks into the side of a car and I can't get him to turn around at all. (I've had to restart the game many time because of this.)  I've played around with the mouse sensetivity and other settings to no avail so I'm forced to believe this is lag. I've tried every trick in the book at this point and many reviews I find say there is no fix. If anyone has any suggestions lemme know. This looks like it could be great if I can get more than 3 minutes in without having to restart.Specs if anyone is wondering, not sure what all to put here tho.OS: Windows 7 Home PremuimProcessor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2350M CPU @ 2.30GHz Graphics Card: AMD Radeon HD 7450MI know I don't have the best system, but I can play games like Skyrim and FalloutNV on high quality and they run super smooth.

												I didn't like it and I don't recommend it, you know why? It Ended. No, really. I got this game as a gift after putting it on my wishlist and had a certain few expectations about it as they advertised it- they had a viral marketing campaign for christ sakes. But, it falled short, I think they ran out of money?Anyway: looks wise, the game is ""what you expect"". This game does an alright job of immersing me in their world with combat, characters, and scenarios, but AGAIN it falls short simply because it didn't matter how many people I killed, ""there were always more."" This sort of generalization has a habit of ruining ""survival apocalyptic"" games for me.All in all: the game ended right around the time I was completely immersed in it. It blue balled me. Get it if it comes on sale, but I don't recommend it. Length has nothing to do with this, but in the end it's ""half"" a game.			"

												man, i tried to like this game, atmosphere is great and gameplay is somewhat different, when you have 1 or 2 bullets, you are very careful about choosing targets, although game is telling them everytime, fun and immersive nevertheless.but camera angles and very very bad controls just didnt let me enjoy it. also,i had many problems with those hooks on which you can revive stamina, i guess it's supposed to be like that but i just can't get through Skyscraper level because i just don't have enough stamina, perhaps it's just my problem. i recommend this game anyway if you are not afraid of clumsy controls.Maybe i'll finish it someday..

												A great post-apocalyptic survival game that's actually realistic. No zombies or mutants here, just the harsh environment and other people trying to survive. Food, items and ammo are scarce, and it really makes you think about conserving every bullet and morsel of food. Your actions in each situation can have big ramifications. Do you quickly draw your pistol and shoot a thug (and waste a bullet in the process), or threaten him with your loaded pistol and hope he backs off. Do you give your last can of food to a starving survivor, or keep it for yourself for when you need it the most. I found this game thought provoking and it left an emotional impact on me. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to play something more grounded in realism than the usual ""blockbuster"" style action game...			"

												People give I Am Alive a lot of crap for being short and linear (then they go back to playing CoD, oh the stupidity). I Am Alive is not as short as people make it out to be, but it isn't as long as a normal game (Think about if you took both Burial at Sea episodes and combined them, that's how long this game normally is). The gameplay mechanics are basic enough with a few gimicks (such as the bluff mechanic) and the AI is pretty solid. I also haven't run into any bugs like people are complaining about. All in all, don't listen to the majority of the people who say crap about this.7.5/10			"

												I would reccomed this game to others, but only if you get it on sale like I did. It was very suspensful and SUPER creepy. The layout and mapping system reminded me of Silent Hill Downpour, but the movement was a little like Assasians Creed. You are able to climb up skyscrapers, sparta kick people into firepits, use a crossbow, and much much more. Although, it was a little confusing on where you should go sometimes it was still pretty awesome. It was a shorter game, but there are some achievements that you can get.      The storyline was a little off. I wish that it showed more of him trying to get to his family instead of helping anothers. It left off on a cliffhanger, and I'm not too fond of it. Also, the checkpoints were your saving points. There is no place for you to save your game, becuase it automatically does so. That was probably the most annoying part of the game. (Besides the ridiculous solar contrasted rays of light in your eyes)      As for the items, there was always a supply of them. I never had any issues, except when climbing with the pitons. My only advice would be to use certain items sparingly (piton, bullets, medkits etc.) The other items (canned food/fruit, water, soda, painkillers, etc.) were always available if you looked around and scavenged. I ended the game with a lot more than what I needed.      Altogether, I thought that this was a very good game. It was really fun to play, and I would give it an 8/10			"

												Well, what to say? This game is prime example of missed opportunity for something extraordinary, but it failed on some crucial steps... but has shine on other. Game has some interesting and decent game mechanics and it plays good for most of time. There is occasional fighting with controls and weird key mapping on PC (you can change it) but nothing serious or unfixable. Atmosphere of game is phenomenal; torn up town looks amazing and feels real; even if at closer inspection lack of texture details and low poly models are quite visible, that is not ""deal breaker"".Main problem with game is story, ending and length; game can be finished in some 5h (I have repeat some areas to help all victims, so my overall play time was longer) and I got feeling like I just have started to play it. And even game it self went in direction like it will continue for at least 10h... but then it cuts and roles credits...Main character story never get's resolved while ending ruins any potential for sequels (I won't spoil it).Over all, game looks like it was rushed to be finished while production was still at 1/3 of development, so they just made cut there, made up some stupid ending and ""VOILA!"" game is done! And it's sad that potential this game had, was ruined in such stupid way...  And I can recommend it, but keep in mind what I have said; if that doesn't bother you and you want to feel great atmosphere game has, go for it (but get it on some BIG discount).Over all rating: 5/10			"

												Short but sweet, this is worth it if you can get it on sale. While the gameplay can be glitchy at times (often when I died, my gun remained in are while my body fell; once my body disappeared while playing), it's nothing that hampers gameplay.  And though the textures can be bland, the graphics are snazzed up by the fx, and look darn cool if you push this into the indie game category (which is really where it fits in to). For those looking for a Fallout fix, however, this is not quite the right game for you. This is not an expansive role playing game in which to emerse yourself. This game more of an indie gamers 'realistic' take on the post-apocalyptic genre (conserving ammo and supplies, tricking enemies. etc). I enjoyed it a lot, especially since it didn't cost me much to buy.			"

												My first review was a negative one, as it wouldn't run on Windows 8.1. Although you get a message of incompatibility during instalation on Windows 10, it runs perfectly. I'm truly enjoying it. Combat is a little rough on the edges, but the climbing is fine. The AI is decent. The best thing about it is that it's not ""shoot on sight"", from both player's and NPC's perspectives. Of course some will try and kill you, but others are just waving a gun at your face to protect their belongings. There are the ones who doubt you have bullets - a VERY common scenario - and just go berserk and you have to kill them anyways. Some even surrender.It's a post-apocalyptic ""save it for a rainy day"" Silent Hill. I like it and almost didn't buy it because of criticism. If you're into survival and Silent Hill, go for it.			"

The climbing and combat mechanics are very good and a bit diffrent than the norm, so they take some getting used to, but deffinitly add to the realism.  My biggest complaint is that the game feels very short, and the ending  leaves plenty of room for a sequil, but at the same time leaves unanswred questions .			"

												I thought I would enjoy this game despite the critics... I was wrong. It's not awful, but it's clunky and uninspired. You will soon enough realize you are far from the only one who is alive (I certainly didn't feel like a ''lone survivor'' for long... maybe 5 minutes of gameplay?), and the reason for the death of the majority of the population is never explained in any satisfying way. Though the game itself is only moderately challenging, the clunky controls and camera and awful combat make it fairly annoying to play. There is survival aspects at play here, and some work fairly well, but some game mechanics feel unnecessary or cliché. Last but not least, I Am Alive is very linear, which is very much a missed opportunity in this type of game. When you do try to explore, you are often reminded that ''you're going the wrong way'' or something along those lines.As I said above it's not an awful game, but there are so many much, much better games to play that I wouldn't recommend I Am Alive except if you are a complete fan of the genre and you've played every other game already, and it is on sale.

												I enjoyed the tense atmosphere throughout the entire game. The dialoges are honest and there is not too much nor to little talk going on between the charakters. There is lots of stuff to explore in a price-of-persia/Assassins-creed-like fashion that requires some thinking and planing ahead in order to acomplish. The small riddles are well hiden as well and deliver a pleasent feeling of satisfaction after you complet them.Without revealing too much of the story to you, all I want to point out is that after finishing the game for the first time, I felt like there is still too much to do to let it end there. :)The worst drawback of the game is the bad camera handling. Quite frequently the camera wouldn't turn according to the mouse's movement like hitten a wall with it. I really wonder why that failure still exists at this time though...If you get the chance to get this game at a cheaper price, I honestly recommend you to give it a try it's a hidden ""Double chocolate cookie"" ^^			"

Went to the lookout in the mall and was on my way back] because i cannot do anything i would expect from survival game, i have to follow beaten path and obey given orders. Go straight ahead and press buttons that are displayed on the screen.Game makes good first impresion raising the expectations bar but then takes it all away and instead of survival game you are rewarded with interactive movie.On top of that it is obvious console port with attached emulator to support pad controls. Unfortunately i couldnt run game with my pad because of that embedded emulator within the game. It is a minor flaw as i am used to play with knm but still...Game could be great but instead was disappointing. I hope somebody would grab this idea and create more interactive production.			"

												Overall, the game was good.        I Am Alive features unique survival gameplay that is able to stand alone among similar games in the genre. Resources are scarce, combat is challenging, and the world seems to have a heavy, oppressive feel to it.         The game features a clever climbing system where the player must utilize stamina effectively, and a unique combat system that attepts to humanize the enemies.         Although the gameplay is fantastic it's storyline is not. It is short, only four or five hours long, and left me dissatisfied and empty (this meaning that there was no clear resolution to the story). But, despite that fact, I would still give the game a  7/10 or 8/10. It is worth a playthrough. But wait to get it while its on sale.			"

												An excellent, relatively short game (5-9 hours) characterized by realistic-looking post-apocalyptic settings that are quite stunning to behold. The level of attention to detail is downright impressive and really helps to immerse you within its story that is rather simple at its core but is enhanced by endearing moments & characters that feel and act like living, breathing human beings. I found that I cared about the main character's plight and mission and was invested in trying to make this hellish future into a better place by saving an adorable little girl, helping to reunite her with her absent mother, encountering other survivors and aiding them when I could and murdering opportunistic SOBs that preyed on the weak and innocent, JUSTICE IS SERVED beeyatches! xDThe gameplay itself is well-balanced with platforming elements that emphasize managing your limited stamina during its many awe-inspiring climbing portions that have you scaling the side of unmaintained skycrappers, clambering across elevated scaffolding and more while using pistons to pause and recuperate at opportune moments. It made these sections feel tense, as close to reality that a game can get and a lot of fun.Finally, the combat is also quite well-done as you can make charging gang members halt in their tracks by whipping out a gun, frightening them into holding their hands up as you either use this opportunity to back them into hazardous elements of the environments which is always a riot to watch unfold or blast them apart with well-placed shots. This is especially fun as you can do this while out of ammo but take too long and your opponents will wise up and charge you.9/10			"

												I Am Alive is a game where you are not dead.To be serious, its a rather cool story, a little similar to The Last Of Us.You'll have to watch out for your ammo and your inventory items quite alot if you go high difficulty, which add alot of realism to it in some way.			"

												This is a great game that I enjoyed very much throughout my playthrough. It has a great dystopian atmosphere and despite some people's complaints, this blurry effect is so spot on that it makes you feel like you really are surrounded by dust (=the main reason why human life is facing extinction according to the plot). The only complaint I have is that its playtime is too short (about 6 to 9 hours long) and it feels like the ending was rushed a bit. But even so, this didn't ruin the great experience I had with the game.I would recommend it a lot to gamers that are looking for a great post-apocalyptic game. It is very reminiscent to ""Last Of Us"" but take note that this is a far lower budget release! PS: In case you see it on sale then this this is a no-brainer decision!			"

												Overall he game deserves some credit, it is fairly fun to play, the visuals are great and the story element is moderately engrossing. It is a short game which actually worked in its favor, I feel if it was longer it would begin to sag in relation to the story and entertainment level. It isn't without its annoyances, for instance the enemy encounters are incredibly frustrating. Every time you face a small group of enemies ( 3-5) and you follow the same strategy. I won't go into detail but I felt as if the enemies were in a FPS game while I was within the limitations of a story/adventure game. (why do they get to swing their weapons freely while mine is always blocked in the same way).  The combat mechanic works well if the enemy encounters were less common but given their considerable influence on the game I feel that they could have been more dynamic. I recommend the game because it is short and therefore  it's shortcomings aren't overwhelmingly frustrating.Simply put,Rating-6/10			"

												Before buying this game, I read the reviews like any normal person would. I found alot of people saying they hated the game. I did find quite a few positive reviews though and so I decided to go for it anyways. ( I think I only paid a few bucks for it during some sale )+ What I like:-Climbing/Stamina System    I love the climbing aspects of this game. I have to sit and carefully plan out my ascent or descent based on how much stamina I have at my disposal. Instead of blindly climbing like in Assasain's Creed, I have to think before I climb. This is the most realistic climbing I have ever seen in a game (in terms of stamina), and I love it so much.-Fighting    The fact that you can intimidate the enemy without any bullets and shove them down a hole is an A+ in my book! Seriously though, this game seems to have a similar theme, ""Think before you act"". I have found myself analyzing the enemy and finding who to kill first and how to do it. The intimidation that you can produce with an unloaded gun is spectacular and I find myself using it often.-Scenery     This game really sells the post-apocalyptic setting and between the dastardly ambushes and the unsettling music I find myslef on the edge of my seat.+ What I dislike    Honestly there really is not that much I truely dislike about this game. The limited retry is a bit troubling, but it forces me to take my time and analyze every situation. The fighting system is a little tough to get at first but once you get the hang of it, its not too bad.+ My Thoughts    I do indeed recommend this game. I would probably not have bought it if it had not been on sale, and I don't recommend paying $15 for it. If this game does end up going on sale then I recommend getting it, as you will most likely enjoy it as I have.    The trick to this game is to have patience and not rush into things. If you try to play this game like an FPS game, you will not enjoy it. This game is all about conserving the small pile of resources you have while trying to stay alive. It's a refreashing change from the FPS games I usually play.Thanks for reading my review,    TheBalmyScholar			"

												Seriously though, this is a really good game. People don't give it enough credit.It really is a shame it isn't as well produced as it promised; the graphics suck, the main character's face gives me the creeps. The movements are awkward and the AI is really weird. Like, you're armed, and you point a gun at a guy, he'll stop and raise his hands. As soon as you put your gun down, he'll make a run for you, even if you're still looking at him. And then, you pull your gun back up and he'll stop. The concept is really really good, though, specially because you can do that even when you have no bullets at all, and they will kill you if you try to shoot when you run out of ammo.The survival element is the best thing here. It's been yeeeears since I've played a game that really got me scared that, at some point, I wouldn't have any supplies left. The first survival games I've played were probably the only ones to give me that feeling. You can manage the health supplies if you don't risk yourself too much (you'll probably have some of them left by the end of the game if you do that), but bullets are really hard to find. The story is also quite good. It's simple (literally just a guy trying to survive and find his family), and I won't spoil anything, but it really has a good take on that ""main hero"" figure every game usually has. You'll (hopefully) get it at the end.Overall, I have a feeling, and I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, that this game would end up better than The Last of Us (given it has a similar concept of survival, except that it's way easier to survive on TLoU) if it had enough budget and less production problems. Saddly, this isn't what happened and the game has its technical issues, but I'd recomend it anyway. There aren't any problems that ruined my gameplay, so I believe it'll only make things look awkward sometimes at most. Even so, it's short and it's cheap by now, so I'd say go for it.			"

												There is enough freedom in this to be considered a game but still remains as restrictive as an interactive story. The devs have created a beautiful little portion of the city with only one path to progress the story. Sure, there are enough forks in the road to cause you to think you have some freedom of choice but it ultimately leads to the same destination. So long as you keep in mind that you are playing through an interactive story, this game will be satisfying from start to finish.			"

												Forget what IGN says about this game. Another great game from UBISOFT; there are some known actors and gameplay from SCC but that's fine. This game is psychological tension. Lots of moral actions to take but hard to do, because you have to find the items required for each individual that you perform moral actions with. There are some creepy elements in the game but they are not that bad, though the psychology can be really scary. Gameplay is realistic, really realistic, so take your time to play them. Short game but it's fun. Just don't play in the dark or at night. :) You'll have fun learning the deep scars of human or the great passions of people, fighting and finding your lost family members. Kinda like Heavy Rain, haha. A great game. 8/10, scary but great fun to play!			"

												Short but sweet, this is worth it if you can get it on sale. While the gameplay can be glitchy at times (often when I died, my gun remained in are while my body fell; once my body disappeared while playing), it's nothing that hampers gameplay.  And though the textures can be bland, the graphics are snazzed up by the fx, and look darn cool if you push this into the indie game category (which is really where it fits in to). For those looking for a Fallout fix, however, this is not quite the right game for you. This is not an expansive role playing game in which to emerse yourself. This game more of an indie gamers 'realistic' take on the post-apocalyptic genre (conserving ammo and supplies, tricking enemies. etc). I enjoyed it a lot, especially since it didn't cost me much to buy.			"

												People give I Am Alive a lot of crap for being short and linear (then they go back to playing CoD, oh the stupidity). I Am Alive is not as short as people make it out to be, but it isn't as long as a normal game (Think about if you took both Burial at Sea episodes and combined them, that's how long this game normally is). The gameplay mechanics are basic enough with a few gimicks (such as the bluff mechanic) and the AI is pretty solid. I also haven't run into any bugs like people are complaining about. All in all, don't listen to the majority of the people who say crap about this.7.5/10			"

												The game play mostly consists of 2 things: climbing and combat. Both are done a bit differently than usual.For climbing there is this whole stamina mechanic. The time you can spend hanging is limited and all actions drain it, some more than others, which can make things tense as your last strength fades and you are about to fall to your doom. So just plan your path when you can and rely on your wits when you can't.Combat is more tactical. A bullet is enough to kill. But those are rare and valuable. Thus it boils down to how many guys you can take out with the least amount of bullets. There are some options to achieve this, mostly through scare mechanic - pointing your gun at the enemy and manipulating them to some degree. Also, don't worry about missing your shots - the auto-aim is strong in this one.The story is simple and straight-forward. Optional exploring exists, but it's quite minimal. Visuals may look ugly at first, but the whole feel of it helps getting into the atmosphere. The one word that will come to your mind when reminded of this game will probably be ''gray''.If you have read this far and plan on playing, I can offer you these 2 tips: - Don't torture yourself too much with exploring the dust filled, lower streets. You will  get a gas mask  later on. - Helping the mysterious stranger will yield a cool and powerful weapon, which widens your combat options. Use it wisely.			"

												Overall, the game was good.        I Am Alive features unique survival gameplay that is able to stand alone among similar games in the genre. Resources are scarce, combat is challenging, and the world seems to have a heavy, oppressive feel to it.         The game features a clever climbing system where the player must utilize stamina effectively, and a unique combat system that attepts to humanize the enemies.         Although the gameplay is fantastic it's storyline is not. It is short, only four or five hours long, and left me dissatisfied and empty (this meaning that there was no clear resolution to the story). But, despite that fact, I would still give the game a  7/10 or 8/10. It is worth a playthrough. But wait to get it while its on sale.			"

												Although I'm not far into it, I'm prepared to say that this game is probably the best survival game I've ever played. The climbing/combat mechanics are totally unique, even if things don't work as planned all the time. I really enjoy the climbing sections, as they require a bit of strategy and energy management, so the solutions are not always obvious (but they're usually fair). The combat is great, too. Being required to intimidate and prioritize enemies adds some much needed nuance in the shooter genre. The story, from what I can tell, is well told which just adds to the whole experience. It's like Mirror's Edge, but slower and more deliberate. Check it out!			"

												An excellent, relatively short game (5-9 hours) characterized by realistic-looking post-apocalyptic settings that are quite stunning to behold. The level of attention to detail is downright impressive and really helps to immerse you within its story that is rather simple at its core but is enhanced by endearing moments & characters that feel and act like living, breathing human beings. I found that I cared about the main character's plight and mission and was invested in trying to make this hellish future into a better place by saving an adorable little girl, helping to reunite her with her absent mother, encountering other survivors and aiding them when I could and murdering opportunistic SOBs that preyed on the weak and innocent, JUSTICE IS SERVED beeyatches! xDThe gameplay itself is well-balanced with platforming elements that emphasize managing your limited stamina during its many awe-inspiring climbing portions that have you scaling the side of unmaintained skycrappers, clambering across elevated scaffolding and more while using pistons to pause and recuperate at opportune moments. It made these sections feel tense, as close to reality that a game can get and a lot of fun.Finally, the combat is also quite well-done as you can make charging gang members halt in their tracks by whipping out a gun, frightening them into holding their hands up as you either use this opportunity to back them into hazardous elements of the environments which is always a riot to watch unfold or blast them apart with well-placed shots. This is especially fun as you can do this while out of ammo but take too long and your opponents will wise up and charge you.9/10			"

												Well, what to say? This game is prime example of missed opportunity for something extraordinary, but it failed on some crucial steps... but has shine on other. Game has some interesting and decent game mechanics and it plays good for most of time. There is occasional fighting with controls and weird key mapping on PC (you can change it) but nothing serious or unfixable. Atmosphere of game is phenomenal; torn up town looks amazing and feels real; even if at closer inspection lack of texture details and low poly models are quite visible, that is not ""deal breaker"".Main problem with game is story, ending and length; game can be finished in some 5h (I have repeat some areas to help all victims, so my overall play time was longer) and I got feeling like I just have started to play it. And even game it self went in direction like it will continue for at least 10h... but then it cuts and roles credits...Main character story never get's resolved while ending ruins any potential for sequels (I won't spoil it).Over all, game looks like it was rushed to be finished while production was still at 1/3 of development, so they just made cut there, made up some stupid ending and ""VOILA!"" game is done! And it's sad that potential this game had, was ruined in such stupid way...  And I can recommend it, but keep in mind what I have said; if that doesn't bother you and you want to feel great atmosphere game has, go for it (but get it on some BIG discount).Over all rating: 5/10			"

												I would reccomed this game to others, but only if you get it on sale like I did. It was very suspensful and SUPER creepy. The layout and mapping system reminded me of Silent Hill Downpour, but the movement was a little like Assasians Creed. You are able to climb up skyscrapers, sparta kick people into firepits, use a crossbow, and much much more. Although, it was a little confusing on where you should go sometimes it was still pretty awesome. It was a shorter game, but there are some achievements that you can get.      The storyline was a little off. I wish that it showed more of him trying to get to his family instead of helping anothers. It left off on a cliffhanger, and I'm not too fond of it. Also, the checkpoints were your saving points. There is no place for you to save your game, becuase it automatically does so. That was probably the most annoying part of the game. (Besides the ridiculous solar contrasted rays of light in your eyes)      As for the items, there was always a supply of them. I never had any issues, except when climbing with the pitons. My only advice would be to use certain items sparingly (piton, bullets, medkits etc.) The other items (canned food/fruit, water, soda, painkillers, etc.) were always available if you looked around and scavenged. I ended the game with a lot more than what I needed.      Altogether, I thought that this was a very good game. It was really fun to play, and I would give it an 8/10			"

												A great post-apocalyptic survival game that's actually realistic. No zombies or mutants here, just the harsh environment and other people trying to survive. Food, items and ammo are scarce, and it really makes you think about conserving every bullet and morsel of food. Your actions in each situation can have big ramifications. Do you quickly draw your pistol and shoot a thug (and waste a bullet in the process), or threaten him with your loaded pistol and hope he backs off. Do you give your last can of food to a starving survivor, or keep it for yourself for when you need it the most. I found this game thought provoking and it left an emotional impact on me. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to play something more grounded in realism than the usual ""blockbuster"" style action game...			"

												Overall, the game was good.        I Am Alive features unique survival gameplay that is able to stand alone among similar games in the genre. Resources are scarce, combat is challenging, and the world seems to have a heavy, oppressive feel to it.         The game features a clever climbing system where the player must utilize stamina effectively, and a unique combat system that attepts to humanize the enemies.         Although the gameplay is fantastic it's storyline is not. It is short, only four or five hours long, and left me dissatisfied and empty (this meaning that there was no clear resolution to the story). But, despite that fact, I would still give the game a  7/10 or 8/10. It is worth a playthrough. But wait to get it while its on sale.			"

												Although I'm not far into it, I'm prepared to say that this game is probably the best survival game I've ever played. The climbing/combat mechanics are totally unique, even if things don't work as planned all the time. I really enjoy the climbing sections, as they require a bit of strategy and energy management, so the solutions are not always obvious (but they're usually fair). The combat is great, too. Being required to intimidate and prioritize enemies adds some much needed nuance in the shooter genre. The story, from what I can tell, is well told which just adds to the whole experience. It's like Mirror's Edge, but slower and more deliberate. Check it out!			"

												An excellent, relatively short game (5-9 hours) characterized by realistic-looking post-apocalyptic settings that are quite stunning to behold. The level of attention to detail is downright impressive and really helps to immerse you within its story that is rather simple at its core but is enhanced by endearing moments & characters that feel and act like living, breathing human beings. I found that I cared about the main character's plight and mission and was invested in trying to make this hellish future into a better place by saving an adorable little girl, helping to reunite her with her absent mother, encountering other survivors and aiding them when I could and murdering opportunistic SOBs that preyed on the weak and innocent, JUSTICE IS SERVED beeyatches! xDThe gameplay itself is well-balanced with platforming elements that emphasize managing your limited stamina during its many awe-inspiring climbing portions that have you scaling the side of unmaintained skycrappers, clambering across elevated scaffolding and more while using pistons to pause and recuperate at opportune moments. It made these sections feel tense, as close to reality that a game can get and a lot of fun.Finally, the combat is also quite well-done as you can make charging gang members halt in their tracks by whipping out a gun, frightening them into holding their hands up as you either use this opportunity to back them into hazardous elements of the environments which is always a riot to watch unfold or blast them apart with well-placed shots. This is especially fun as you can do this while out of ammo but take too long and your opponents will wise up and charge you.9/10			"

												Though interesting and very immersive, this post-apocalyptic survival does not allow for a lot of freedom. Areas are restrictive and not every solution a player has for a problem is supported; Knowing you can jump and climb doesn't mean a crate next to a fence will allow you to climb over that fence...and stuff like that. Extending that, it is a very linear game...The combat system and problems one is faced with are interesting though, and a player will have to bluff with an empty gun more than once. The developers also did a great job with the environment and allow the player to help people in need, if the player should choose to do so, depending on available resources.It is the kind of game I wouldn't play much, but do enjoy once in a while.

												Before buying this game, I read the reviews like any normal person would. I found alot of people saying they hated the game. I did find quite a few positive reviews though and so I decided to go for it anyways. ( I think I only paid a few bucks for it during some sale )+ What I like:-Climbing/Stamina System    I love the climbing aspects of this game. I have to sit and carefully plan out my ascent or descent based on how much stamina I have at my disposal. Instead of blindly climbing like in Assasain's Creed, I have to think before I climb. This is the most realistic climbing I have ever seen in a game (in terms of stamina), and I love it so much.-Fighting    The fact that you can intimidate the enemy without any bullets and shove them down a hole is an A+ in my book! Seriously though, this game seems to have a similar theme, ""Think before you act"". I have found myself analyzing the enemy and finding who to kill first and how to do it. The intimidation that you can produce with an unloaded gun is spectacular and I find myself using it often.-Scenery     This game really sells the post-apocalyptic setting and between the dastardly ambushes and the unsettling music I find myslef on the edge of my seat.+ What I dislike    Honestly there really is not that much I truely dislike about this game. The limited retry is a bit troubling, but it forces me to take my time and analyze every situation. The fighting system is a little tough to get at first but once you get the hang of it, its not too bad.+ My Thoughts    I do indeed recommend this game. I would probably not have bought it if it had not been on sale, and I don't recommend paying $15 for it. If this game does end up going on sale then I recommend getting it, as you will most likely enjoy it as I have.    The trick to this game is to have patience and not rush into things. If you try to play this game like an FPS game, you will not enjoy it. This game is all about conserving the small pile of resources you have while trying to stay alive. It's a refreashing change from the FPS games I usually play.Thanks for reading my review,    TheBalmyScholar			"

												I have been wanting this game for a long time after I first saw it on Youtube, this game was totally under the radar and it looked so good I just wanted it right then, but at that time there where only a Ps3 verion out, when it finally showed up to PC here on Steam I just grabbed it, so is it worth it? the game is certanly nothing spectacular and the graphics was a bit disapointing even if they are ok I guess, it gives that post apocalyptical atmosphere really good and it have a great story, you have to climb obstacles to move on in the game, sometimes it will be a great challenge because you just can't figure out how to do it. so you have to think your self trough it mostly. it is a climbing game simular to Tombraider, there are bandits on the way you have to take care of. there are no monsters or goblins in this game and was a fresh wind, the game tries it best to realistic simulate the end of the world, the controls are a bit broken and is the bad part of the game, other than that, it is a good game and is entertaining to play, I would recommend pick this game up on sale, if it wasn't for the awkward controls I would have given 7/10 but I will only give a 5 out of 10 for that reason, still it is a recommended buy if you can get it cheap. but I would only recommend it if you like the post apocalyptic genre, if not, there are better games you can blow your money on.

												I would say this game is at least a 7/10. It has an innovative combat system, to were if you aim a gun at someone who has no ranged weapon they will put their hands up, and this means that if there is a fire or cliff nearby, you can kick them into it. However, this gets clunky, and while ammo is scarce if you only pick it up yourself, shoot an enemy that has a gun and  you get your ammo back. A true flaw that feels lazy and unfinished is the story. Your nameless, however not silent protaganist will trust the sketchiest of characters, and the ending doesn't tie up loose ends. It feels as if it was unfinished, or that the studio was going to make a sequel and decided not to do it. Another gripe I have with the game is the stamina. It runs out when you climb, even when standing still on a ledge, which I know from experience is that is not true, and when you are in this ""Heavy Fog"" as they call it. It's just a lot of dust, and when in it, your stamina goes down, too.  Sure, a dust cloud would impair your breathing, but it wouldn't kill you if you were just walking in it.  I did enjoy playing it, but I want more out of it. It did feel a bit unfinished, and in this review I spoke mostly to the negetives, but if you get this game, you would find that there are plenty of positives, too. So. a great game, just with some glaring flaws. Or at least that's my take on it.			"

												This game had such great ideas going. It shows that the team was working on a small budget or a limited one, wich is a shame. With a little more the game could have turned out to be an epic one. The ending feels kinda off, but the journey there it is an amazing one. Highly recommend this one!			"

												I think this game is much better than the reviews it has recieved.  I played it on the ps3 a lot.   I think the biggest complaint is the non-open world.  It's true it's not  but there's a lot of games that aren't.  Taken for what it is though it's a pretty good game.  It's kind of got an uncharted type feel to it in parts ( the climbing and such).  You have to really conserve your ammo.  I have seen some people say that they have to kill everyone but that's not true.  Sometimes you can just hold your gun on them until you find an escape.  The graphics are pretty good but the colors are very grey,  I guess to add to the post apacolyptic feel.   Overall I thought it was a pretty decent game.			"

												Note: I only review when I finish the game.The game itself is very cool, original. The idea of imposing limits as fatigue and limited ammunition make it a different game, most focused on the survival side. It seems the game is a console port without many adaptations, because there are times the camera doesn't respond well to the mouse, but I've seen worse ports. I guess it is better to be player with gamepad. The end unfortunately is poor, looks like the game was finished in the half, but who knows it comes a sequel. 8/10			"

												A decent game that requires a lot of climbing. Combat is not the main focus here as melee combat is quite dangerous and ammo for guns are very very rare. Like ""1 bullet from a dead villain"" rare. From the same creators of Assassin's Creed, you're placed in a post apocalyptic world where you have to navigate your way through climbing, jumping and avoiding dangers.			"

												7.5/10 Updated Review for 2016The game Really isn't anything extrodinary. The game feels like an Assasins Creed bootleg but with a Apocalypse/Survival theme. The combat system is a bit awkward and linear but definitely not broken and even does a good job making the player really think about their decisions. It has a pretty Generic Story but makes up for it with interesting enough characters and voice acting. The game does subsequently leave you with dissapoint. Not because of the gameplay but because the story never really felt finished. There were many bit and pieces they could have chose to elaborate on in the story but unfortunately they don't. Overall there are many great ideas and concepts put into this game but it ultimately lacks on the execution. I still would recommend and had alot of fun but I would say don't pick this game up unless it's under $10; you can often find it on sale for $5. As far as length you can expect 8-10 hours			"

I compare this game to The Walking Dead; Less choose your own adventure, but more room to get out and play.When other games give it all away, or make it an impossible win, I am Alive forces you to plan ahead, manage your resources and keep your goal in your sights.  This game deserves better, and I would love to see a sequel.			"

Eu recomendo para testar se tiver barato, fora isso esse é um tipo de  jogo que pode ser dispensado.			"

												Short, but fun.  Play it with a controller.  Dont expect hordes of zombies, lots of guns, or ample supplies of anything.  But if you are frugal, patient, and play smart (this is not a run-n-gun game - kinda like Dead Space), you will be rewarded with a great experience.  The ending is a bit abrupt and may be unrewarding to some, but it didnt bother me.  A post-apocalytic game with no zombies or mutants = refreshingly minimalistic, and unique.  If you want pulse-pounding arcade action, this one isnt for you.  If you want a game that requires you to think before you shoot, and look before you leap, then go for it - especially if its on sale.			"

												It's an incredible idea, which in itself makes this game hugely interesting to play. That said, its execution is similar to what you'd expect a company to release if the project, as a whole, was always second priority to something else.Listen, if you liked any of the trailers, buy it. It's fantastic and needs to be experienced!Music, tone, tension and emotions are all delicately played with, and the climbing and exploration is top notch. It's just lacking a certain something that'll ever make you play it more than once.			"

												I thought I would enjoy this game despite the critics... I was wrong. It's not awful, but it's clunky and uninspired. You will soon enough realize you are far from the only one who is alive (I certainly didn't feel like a ''lone survivor'' for long... maybe 5 minutes of gameplay?), and the reason for the death of the majority of the population is never explained in any satisfying way. Though the game itself is only moderately challenging, the clunky controls and camera and awful combat make it fairly annoying to play. There is survival aspects at play here, and some work fairly well, but some game mechanics feel unnecessary or cliché. Last but not least, I Am Alive is very linear, which is very much a missed opportunity in this type of game. When you do try to explore, you are often reminded that ''you're going the wrong way'' or something along those lines.As I said above it's not an awful game, but there are so many much, much better games to play that I wouldn't recommend I Am Alive except if you are a complete fan of the genre and you've played every other game already, and it is on sale.

												A ""cinematic"" style game before the wave of cinematic style games that gamers have been being beaten over the head with these last few years. I Am Alive is very much driven by story and visuals but aside from that the gameplay is fantastic. It's FPS meets platforming with some lightweight puzzle solving that is all blended together seemlessly, realistically. Probably Ubisoft's only perfect game, and definitely their last truely good game made. Only downside is that much like a good movie it is over too soon. 2 sweaty palms out of 2.			"

Probably because the gameplay on any difficulty other than easy is extremely tough. Limited retries, very few resources and you often end up in tight situations.Not that it's not difficult on PC, but I personally found that a keyboard and mouse worked better for me. There's a lot that can be optimized in terms of controls but I know that's not gonna happen, so moving on.The setting is really good. Atmospheric, good music, good voice actors, decent graphics with a really impressive post apocalyptic feel.I'd recommend it to everyone just to experience the story.

												Kinda short and cliffhanger ending without a sequal .... really? BUT over all i actually really enjoyed the game, at times maybe a bit  repetetive in terms of gameplay mechanics (but in my opinion it was not too bad, it just could have been done better) and honestly it is not really ""survival"" game in my opinion but rather a ""survival setting"" in a post-apocalyptic world.I would still recommand it for the great atmosphere and interesting locations.For me it was a really good game in the end.

												I think this is one of the more exciting and challenging single player games out there.  Having to force yourself to conserve ammo and stamina to make decisions based on progression is a great concept.  Once I started I could not stop playing and it's just an experience.  The characters that you encounter along the way are weary of travelers that are trying to take their stuff or take them or kill them.  It's a well imagined disaster scenario and I will probably replay it again when I get the chance to!			"

												This game was stuck in developmental hell for 10 years until it finally got pooped out some years back.  It's not a great game by any means, although you can see the potential for it.  The climbing mechanic has been adopted by the Lara Croft reboot, and it's definitely not going to win any anti-sexism awards, but if you can find it for $5.00 it's a challenging, inventive game.			"

												Oh man... And I was so hyped about this game also. :(I think it has lot of potential: post apocalyptic games always do, but the color world is awesome, the atmosphere is nice and the graphics are not bad.But... everything else is. SPOILER ALERT!!! The first intro gives you a clue that you are not going to make it, so what´s the point even trying!? I mean come on! It´s a survival game! And yes a game where the main character dies can sometimes give it a little (or a lot) of that emotional richness that makes you remember the experience your whole life, but if your dead is not a suprise, it´s really just a bummer.In my opinion, it´s also too limited a game. In a survival game you should be able to explore a little, be creative with your choises, but in this game it´s very stricht what route you can take and what choises to make.I like the extra bit of nervousness when you start losing your stamina, but it´s also irritating when you´ll have the constant remainder of lost energy teasing you. I´d prefer if you didn´t need food etc. to gain the lost max. stamina, but enough rest would do the job and you could see the stamina-bar filling up. (And IF it´s already in the game, it´s not fast enough ´cause I waited for quite a long time to see, if the max. stamina would recover itself with time.)I think if the game would get more of an open world -feel to it, (and btw, the controls are confusing as h*ll. I mean rmb for pointing gun AND dropping down rom a hight, space for climbing AND jumping, lmb pressing and tapping for running and runnin faster? Why do you need to run faster, when you can just run?), so less confusing controls, maybe a little editing on the intro and MORE CHOISES AVAILABLE IN EVERYTHING and I think this would make a wonderful game. but for now, I think I will not be playing it for a long while.

												I bought this for next to nothing during a sale and I still wouldn't recommend it. Maybe if our TV's break, the internet gives up and I've played every other game i own to death then i'll pick this game back up.It has the makings of a good game and once upon a time I was excited to try it but it's just too dull and linear. It gives the illusion of freedonm but any diviation from the path is normally a dead end. It's a real pity as there are some interesting gameplay mechanics here. FYI I had played this game previously so I've played longer than the tmie stamp shows.I'd give this an overall 3/10 due to the idea behind the mechanics. This is with the mods that change the graphics, 2/10 without the mods			"

												♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing port. Runnin this on a 4790k, EVGA 1080, Z97 mobo, 16gb ram, and it stutters every 5 seconds. I've tried fixing the issue. Reinstalled it, edited the game file, switched to triple bufferring, v-sync enabled and disabled. Nothing fixe it. Would be great to play it but the stutter makes in horrifc. Anyone with a fix, comment and I'll try it. I'll update the review if it works.			"

 A Great Game If You Like Something Different and Don't Care About Graphics This game is actually pretty great, I was put off by the mixed reviews, but most of the reviews seemed to dislike the graphical style, but not have genuine criticisms for the game. So here is my list of the pros and cons of this game and whether you should buy it or not! Pros  Semi-Open world design Tense Gameplay Unique style and mechanics Unique Combat Morality choices More strategic stance on climbing gameplay Makes you conserve resources Death has real consequence Cons  Sometimes gets tedious While gameplay is interesting, it is quite clunky Mistakes are harshly punished Story is a bit lack-luster Characters are flat Not enough information is given about the backstory of this world Enemy AI can be a bit weird Some may find the art style (grey with only some things being in color) unimmersive The Graphics are not that goodSo those are the pros and cons to I Am Alive! I would recommend this game for someone who values a challenge and craves something new. If you do decide to pick this game up you want to buy it on sale and be prepared for a good experience, but nothing amazing. 7/10			"

												I remember this game concept and first trailer was awesome. Now I can say it's a real deception. Way too linear, the replay system is funny, the stamina bar while climbing was by far the worst. How do you get SO tired climbing a ladder which is clearly big enough for you even sleep there and you need to waste an item to rest?ALSO! I couldn't make it look nice, no matter the combination of presets.Do not waste your time or money.			"

												Its a nice take on the post apocalyptic.  Sometime the up and down climbing can push you to the left or right THAT was annoying.  As i got further into the game, the stutter got worse which made aiming a pain sometimes!Controls were fine and goodGraphics were goodStory was good (nothing special but it wasnt bad)OVERALLI found it to be a solid survival game that, above anything else, kept my palms sweaty and my muscles tense.

												Played this game not really knowing anything about it nor having any expectations and I was pleasently surprised because while the game is simple-ish and the graphics are pretty decent it more often than not just made you think about the end in a ""How will people be when all their comforts are gone"" way. Really enjoyed this and wouldn't totally be against having a sequel.6.5/10			"

												If you like post apocalyptic games, this MUST be in your list.Its 3rd person movements and its jump and run parts remind me on Tomb Raider (2013), what i played before this.But in THIS game you have only a few bullets. So THINK before you shoot around. During gameplay you get a BOW. ♥♥♥♥ YEAH. And you can reuse that arrows. You can even get a shotgun from the crippled Quasimodo guy.In this game you even climb a broken scryscraper to its top. You get many views from the destroyed city skyline. What a feeling!I enjoyed every passage of this game. And the ending is shouting for a CONTINUE !!!!!!!@ developers:GIVE US PART 2 OF THAT GAME PLEASE@ people who are not sure to buy this:Look on my profile in my screenshot section, i made some ingame screenshots!

												I have no Idea why so many people are torn on this game. Clunky gameplay? Sure in a few aspects, but that's no reason to give this game a negative. This game has immersed me in a atmosphere like very few other games have, I like their take on combat, it is psychological and does further to make it feel like a survival of the fittest apocalypse. It was very refreshing to play an apocalyptic video game that wasn't a ♥♥♥♥ing zombie apocalypse. It was a unique setting and situation. My only complaint is that the game was short, the story never truly finishes. It's a shame a sequel for this will not happen. Another complaint is that the main character was a bit bland but his story was very interesting.Overall Rating: 8/10Worth every penny for it's price.			"

												I am bummed™.  A simple game for a simple person.  You simply walk around exactly where it tells you, using each item as it's given to you and killing people as they threaten you.  You can simply walk around a simply destroyed town which is like a decorated hallway with no alternate passageways, or you can simply uninstall this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game and go play something worth anybody's time ever.
