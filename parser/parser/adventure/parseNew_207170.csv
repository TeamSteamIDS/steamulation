												The basic premise of Legend of Grimrock is that it is a modern take on the classic grid-based,dungeon-crawling,RPG games of old, like Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder etc. You start out with a party of 4 adventurers (arranged in a 2x2 formation)... in this case convicted as criminals and thrown into a secure prison.. and must explore the prison/dungeon to learn its secrets and find a way out. Movement is directional, plus rotate left and right, around a series of 2 dimensional grid based levels. There are various monsters to fight and puzzles to solve in order to progress through the game. Fighting is done by means of clicking on the items equipped in your characters' hands, often whilst performing a ""Square dance"" with the monsters to avoid letting them hit your partyThe graphics have been updated, especially the lighting engine, which is amazing, but repeating textures are still used widely, and the gameplay itself is very reminiscent of the early games. Objects are interacted with by click on the screen e.g. to press a button or open a door and items can be picked up and carried/used by your party of adventurers. The adventurers attack by left-clicking the items that are placed in their hands, and spells can be cast by choosing the right combination of runes for a spell the adventurer has learnt.There are 4 races:- Humans; Minotaurs; Lizardmen; and Insectoids, and 3 character classes - Fighter; Mage; Rogue. and you can either play with a default party, or create one of your own.According to Steam I have racked up 410 hours of playing time on Legend of Grimrock... mostly that is because a dungeon editor was released and I have spent a huge amount of time working on my own creations. I have however also completed the main game at least 3 times. Firstly with a hand-picked party of 4 characters, then again with a special unlockable solo character, and finally a hard,old-school playthrough with no automap. I've also spent a large amount of time using the Dungeon Editor and writing scripts to create my own levels/puzzles/spells etc. My first play through took 19 hours 35 minutes of playing time, which took 26 hours in total according to steam (including re-loads and breaks).Overall.. I used to love the old DM/EOB games and I absolutely love this modern take... And what's even better is that the designers continued to support their creation by giving the modding community a brilliant dungeon editor that allowed those of us with an interest to exert our creative muscles.

												An indie game that made an impact so hard that Ubisoft resurrected Might & Magic title (in the M&M X Legacy), after so many years of oblivion.An old-school dungeon crawler which is a perfect picture of how the progress goes.See, when somebody invents a new mechanic or some better technology, it doesn't mean we should wipe all that was made before. And sometimes older tricks are better than newer ones. Take the chess game as precedent. Or even better example: Horses. We still ride them, but now we don't need to drive them to death to catch up with something. Riding horses today can be educational, emotional, engaging boost of experience. It can even heal some poor hearts, you know.The Elder Scrolls Arena was much like the Grimrock by the mechanics, but eventually we've got Skyrim, which gives a completely another experience than that brilliant of game design we're talking there. The Skyrim can get you on the top of the world... but in the Legend of Grimrock you'll get much more emotions per time spended. And more challenges, both of fighting and exploring nature.Remember Tomb Raider game (2013)? The sequence where Lara found an old bow, and a good notation from Roth? ""You can have the best form and technique in the world, but it won't mean a thing if you can't focus""... Yeah, focus is the best thing that game can teach you about. There are so many hidden buttons, levers and other stuff, so if you're find it all, I'm sure you'll get your boost to perception. That's an education of kind, and we need something like that to experience at least from time to time.Well, do that. Buy the game and make sure you're finish it. It is not that long, but in my book that's a musthave item. My mark 9/10.			"

												Legend of Grimrock is a certain game of twenty years ago, dressed in modern clothes. The recipe for this turned out to be surprisingly simple - leave completely untouched form the core of the game, using new technology only where it is necessary.Legend of Grimrock has almost no plot. Yes, somewhere in the background, we have a story of four convicts who were thrown into perdition to inhabited by monsters and traps bristling labyrinth of dungeons. Throughout accompany us also to be found in various places notes made ​​by a man named Tooruma, who wandered through the corridors and halls before us. At each level during sleep appear ""visions"" with a few sentences. And that's basically all the elements of the story. Interestingly, it was one of the first elements so characteristic of the classic games of this type. At a time when the ""stimulus feature films"" are limited to a minimum, begins to work the imagination. With scraps of information, in an atmosphere of understatement, alone, almost automatically, we are trying to fill these gaps with our own conjectures. It builds sometimes much more evocative atmosphere than most told, ""film"" story. The gameplay is based on three pillars: exploration, solving puzzles and fighting.We move through the corridors and rooms in a classic style. Levels are divided into square segments. One press of the button allows traffic to pass a single field or a reversal in the direction of 90º.By far the biggest asset Legend of Grimrock are puzzles. At each of the thirteen levels we will get at least a few of them. Sometimes, their accumulation can be intimidating. All puzzles rely on the use of several of the same components. We have a mandatory collapse, levers, plates react to the pressure, the buttons in the walls, or portals. An absolute masterpiece of ingenuity is their use.Although there are not too many types of enemies, they are diverse and properly assigned, so only at the end of the game started to be missing ""something new"". I like the fact that most of them require the use of appropriate tactics. Additionally, this old-fashioned and a bit clunky combat system perfectly conceals imperfections SI, which knows only two tactics: to follow and the encirclement. Moreover, developers have used these qualities even several times in riddles. I must commend graphic design, but here also I have a few objections. It's basically the only ""modern"" element of Legend of Grimrock but it is used quite well. Textures, dynamic lighting, models of opponents and their animations look great.Legend of Grimrock is a damn successful - I would say that close to perfection - back to the already-forgotten genre. Thought even the most hardcore enthusiasts oldschool and implemented the option to disable the automatic drawing of the map. For players remember the ""good old days"" and exchanging hand-trended on a piece of checkered maps, is a wonderful gift.			"

												I love playing ""Legends of Grimrock"".  The game is a first-person, real time RPG with an interesting twist - you actually play four different characters!  The story begins with your group being tossed into Mount Grimrock.  Instead of dying instantly from the fall, you find yourselves at the top floor of a strange building.  You must move down floor by floor, fighting monsters, finding treasures, searching for secrets, and most of all, surviving.The game balances storytelling and action, as you find notes from someone who previously made this journey.  The notes provide invaluable hints to solving puzzles relevant to the main quest line.  And they also help with side quests, such as finding the Sword of Nex to complete the Fighter's Challenge (neither one necessary to finish the game).  I recommend this game to anyone who loves RPGs and solving puzzles.			"

												I have never played a game like this before and as my very first try at a first person dungeon crawler, I have to say this was a great experience. It might be newer and easier compared to the old ones, but this was a very good take on an old genre that is pretty much dead these days. The RPG elements are fairly light, but they definitely work and it was enjoyable to kill things and level up while finding new and better gear. The puzzles were great and generally enjoyable...mostly logic puzzles with some small hints. The vast majority of them made sense instead them being seemingly random like puzzles in some games.The entire environment is all tile-based, but looked very good. A few levels would look like mossy rocks and then a few floors down they would nice, clean stonewalls, while deeper down it would be even more different. The lighting is awesome as well. It definitely set the mood for this game. The music was decent, but nothing to write home about - mostly ambient stuff. The story wasn't bad, but it wasn't super in-depth either. It was decent enough to make you want to continue your journey though.I would have never played this game had it not been for a certain youtuber that showed me how awesome this game was. They ended up not finishing the game, but I'm very glad I finally finished it myself and I hope they do at some point as well. You know who you are!			"

												Fans of old school CRPGs like Dungeon Master and the original Wizardry series will get their money's worth out of Legend of Grimrock. Traps, puzzles, hidden caches of treasure, resource management, multiple character team... it's all here. Challenging and unforgiving, Legend of Grimrock will teach you early to tread cautiously and save often. The game includes a dungeon editor and built-in mod support, and the LoG player community is truly incredible.			"

												I had played this game for a bit in the past, less then a few minutes because I could never figure out how combat worked and would always get killed off from the snail. Then the other night I started it up again and tried playing once more not expecting to get far or play to long. However I found myself playing for over an hour and was able to figure out what I couldn't before, so here is my review on a very awesome game.The Legend of Grimrock, a game I bought on Steam a couple years ago during the 2012 summer sale event made by Almost Human Games[www.grimrock.net]. The game is an old school RPG that is not turn based but live action. In other words you are able to move, cast spells, select items from your inventory and rest without waiting for creatures to take their turn. As your trying to get your spell cast or looking for a throwing item in your inventory the creature will be attacking you and won't sit there and wait till your done.I really found this game to have that pen and paper D&D feel to it and I like the idea of selecting the option to not have the game do the mapping as I explore and then I can map it out with graph paper and a pencil (I didn't do this of course). The character creation screen is very simple with 4 races and 3 classes to choose from.  The inventory and character screen isn't complex or confusing but very intuitive and easy to figure out and understand.The spell's though are based on symbols and you have to select the right symbols or combination of to cast the spell. I found that you couldn't get the spell unless you found the scroll for the right spell but this could have been because I wasn't selecting the right symbol until I found the scroll.When venturing through the dungeon your characters will get hungry and there will be a symbol of food in there avatar picture indicating they need to eat. When you kill of creatures they will sometimes leave a meat chunk behind and you will want to get these to eat along with any food things you find along the way.During combat along the way some of your party member may die, take heart because they are not gone for good. You will be able to access their inventory while dead to. There will be these big blue floating crystals that when touched will restore your party to full health and energy and raid the dead. Remember where these ones are. Once they are used you will have to wait for a bit till it can be clicked on again.Now as for combat, where I originally had most of my troubles. To attack all you need simply do is right click on your hand under your avatar (wither their is a weapon in it or not). If your a spell caster you will want to keep at least one hand empty for right clicking to bring up the symbol window for spell casting.When you left click on a throwing weapon it will be attached to your mouse cursor and if you click with it again with your mouse pointer above the midline of the screen (the top half of the window) then it will be thrown. If you click below the midline (bottom half of the screen) then it get dropped on the floor. This is a keyboard and mouse type game and no controller support. Now that I have been able to find out something about the game and how combat works, along with the abilities to make your own dungeon's and storyline and the Steam Workshop to try some community based dungeons, The Legend of Grimrock is one game to have in your collection. Its worth a play!I give this game:ːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː			"

												Legend of Grimrock is a modern looking version of the old dungeon crawling genre.What is dungeon crawling? You might ask, well a dungeon crawler is a first person game where you play as an adventurer, or usually a party of adventurers that delve into dungeons, level up and complete quests, what makes dungeon crawlers so much different from modern RPG's  is that dungeon crawlers often use complex puzzles in their level design, making it more of a puzzle game than a grindfest.The game starts you off with a standard party of four characters that work well together, but you can create your own party of course!The characters you play are outcast by society and have to fight for their lives to have their crimes abolished on the mountain of Grimrock.The game looks simply gorgeous for a game in it's genre, even on my terrible terrible laptop it runs very smooth at the maximum graphical settings.The combat system is a bit like the old Final Fantasy/Chrono Trigger combat system mixed in with the Dungeon Master/Shin Megami Tensei combat, you can move about freely in a grid of squares, while your attacks aren't turnbased, they just have cooldowns.The challenge this game holds is above average, don't expect to blaze through it on your first playthrough, nonetheless it's a great game overall!The puzzles don't let you get stuck for a long time, they're quite clear about what needs to be done, which is a good thing in my opinion.I could whole-heartedly recommend you this title if you want to play a casual game with a decent bit of challenge, especially when it's on sale, then it's definately worth the money.If you're on the fence about this game, I'd say go and buy it, if you weren't interested before, this probably isn't your type of game, and I'd recommend you watching a let's play.

												Legend of Grimrock is an old-school dungeon crawling game which is inspired by games like Dungeon Master oder Eye of the Beholder.The game tells a story of four criminals whose crimes are forgotten by getting tossed into the maw of mount Grimrock. A massive mountain which holds a huge dungeon of untold horrors. No one has ever managed to escape this atrocity. No one but, well you might guessed it, you !You are in control of the four criminals. You can either chose a preset of four ready-to-go characters or create your own party. Once you are in the Dungeon your job is to find a way out. You can move your party from tile to tile and can only perform 90° turns to the left or right. This sounds quite simple and to many quite boring, but Legend of Grimrock does a fantastic job of keeping things fresh and interesting. As you progress through the dungeon you have to solve puzzles which become increasingly harder and sometimes force you to think in unconventional ways. But they are never unfair and can be solved with a decent amount of thinking and experimenting. The puzzles are the highlights of the game which are quite rewarding in most cases and keep you motivated as you progress deeper into the dungeon.The combat system is rather simple but still challenging. As already mentioned you control four characters which are always standing on the same tile. On the bottom right of the screen you got the avatars of you characters which are also used to control you characters. If you left-click on a equipped melee weapon you will perform an attack with this weapon. The twist about this system is that the upper row of your characters represent the front row on the tile you are standing. Characters in the back row cant hit targets with melee weapons / attacks (with a few exceptions). So you are forced to build a solid mix of beefy warriors / melee characters that stand in front and weaker but also very useful range characters that stand in the back and cast spells or use throwing weapons or other types of ranged attacks. If you have a mage in your party things really become interesting. The spell-system requires you to combine several runes in order to sucessfully cast a spell. And you have to do this during the fight in real time. So things can get a bit stressful if you fight off several enemies because you still want to use your other characters. There are no shortcuts you could use. You have to memorize the runes and the combinations to put your mage to use. To some of you this might sound disappealing but if you get the hang of it, it feels really great.Technically the developers have done a great job. Some light effects in Legend of Grimrock are really great to look at, the textures are very sharp, the animations of enemies are great and fluid.One of the downsides of this game is that it may lack a bit of variation. There are only 3 different looks in the dungeon. Some of you might think that this it no problem because a dungeon is a dungeon but even in that particular scenario you could do more than three different types of wall textures.All in All Legend of Grimrock is a great expierence if you like solving challenging but rewarding puzzles and if you love exploration because you get to explore a lot. There are a lot of secrets to uncover in this vast dungeon.			"

												This game is great for two reasons:1 - This is just a VERY good old-school dungeon crawler with high difficulty level, difficult puzzles and many, many secrets.2 - This game showed other developers that true old-school game still may be the best seller. Almost Human Games - thank you for that.VERDICT:If you're a fan of modern cRPG and want to see how all of that had started, you should play it.If you're a fan of Dungeon Master or Eye of The Beholder, I'm sure you already finished this and you know how good that is.Like this review?

												This game just rocks. I never played this kind of game before, so I can't say it's an old-school experience for me, but I can see what they mean.There are no auto generated dungeonsThe loot is carefully placed and hand selectedThe fights involve you being skilled with you directional movementThere are no shops or farms or anything, when you can't carry stuff anymore you have to discard something, so keep you inventory organized. Every item countsThere are secrets all over the place and it is actually rewarding to find themAmmo is scare, I found a total of 22 arrows and bolts in my play through, if you waste them, your problem (you can collect them from dead enemies)There is no auto-aim or anything like that - you need to run, choose your direction, click on specific runes and hit your weapons all that the same time! oh and noticed that hole in the floor, whaaaaaaaaaEverything is wrapped in really awesome graphic packageSo if you like a game that challenges you, that makes you think and explore. Get this one now!			"

												Want that classic dungeon crawling experience? This game is for you!4 characters each of them can be taliored to your whims or randomly selected. And you are tasked to escape your fate at Mount Grimrock.This game has everything a dungeon diving game as to offer. Secrets around almost every corner. That need and desire to explore every inch of the level you are on before proceeding. And if that wasn't enough you must maintain your character through feeding them and making sure they are level proper or else run the risk of losing them.Another plus to this game is that it has it's own modding community, which in my opinion are really talented. Thanks to the dungeon editor you can create, and craft your very own ""dungeon diving"" experience, and judging by some of the mods on the Workshop. You are going to have a fun experience.I recommend this game.			"

												A genuinely fantastic game that succeeds at everything it tries to do.The gameplay is great; the fighting mechanics are extremely simple, but the fights do present good challenge once you get into it. The atmosphere is fantastic, it feels exactly like going through a dungeon should be: dark, secluded, and frightening. Some of the puzzles are creative and fun to get through, although sometimes they like to replace puzzles with the ""find the tiny hidden button game!"" (< and that's really my only legitimate complaint about the whole game). They also do a good job keeping the dungeon from feeling too same-y. Although it is just one big dungeon, and it really feels like one big dungeon, you slowly learn more about the area you are exploring and the place gets more and more like a fortress the deeper you go. So there is a very solid sense of progression, even if you don't have any idea where you're going or even what you're going there for, which really adds to the overal mystery in that fantastic atmosphere I told you about earlier.If you want to play a game for action, this may not be the game for you. But dammit, if you just want to go through an atmospheric rpg dungeon adventure there is legitimately no better game for you.			"

												Playing this with the sequel in mind, it's a much simpler, more confined experience, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Where the sequel is much more open and encourages exploration, this one's more about overcoming the dungeon before you, going deeper and deeper, floor by floor, as challenges and rewards alike escalate. You won't get lost, but you'll find plenty of secrets if you poke around a little. It's shorter, but there's much less time spent wandering. Played without the sequel in mind, this is God's gift to dungeon-crawl fans, taking all the old-school things you enjoyed and decorating them in modern graphics and sound. It's not as hard, even on hard, as those older games, but it captures the spirit of them perfectly with solid mechanics and atmosphere. It's a fantastic adventure, even if the final act is a bit of a letdown, and well worth playing even if you've already played the fancier second game.			"

The game itself harkens back to the old dungeon crawlers,  for me the memory of the dungeon aspect in Dungeons & Dragons: Warriors of the eternal sun,  where you get or create a set group of characters and trudge about solving puzzles, unearthing secrets and battling the minions in the pit that were thrown into.A beautiful game a little finicky on the magic caster but a great look back at the old square based movement era.Highly recommend.

												I'm the biggest fan you will ever meet of tile-based rpgs.  Lands of Lore!  Eye of the Beholder!  YES!!  I've been playing Xeen since '92.Why doesn't someone make a game like that again?!!  No seriously, let me know if you see one, because that's what this game seems to be going for but it sadly misses the mark.  I would be more forgiving and I would even give this game a positive except that the mis-steps they took are downright bewildering.First what do I love about this title...It really is incredibly challenging.  The puzzles, battles, and resource management is unforgiving which is a nice throwback to the ""good old days"".  I love that they took that risk here, because usually it makes the difference between a grind and compelling, rewarding gameplay.  Grimrock is a nice reminder of the days when games weren't all just an endurance contest, and not everyone could beat every game given enough time.The first thing you'll notice is that this game is fun. Actually, really fun.  You can jump right in without any help and start adventuring.  The puzzles feel like first-person zelda and the written ""clues"" are a great homage to the first-generation of PC rpg titles.  I love the creepy dream sequences, and the customizable party pics are a great touch that is long overdue.  The biggest issue this game struggles with slowly becomes apparent with the combat system.  There is a gaping hole in what should be simple mechanics and functionality of the UI and especially combat.  The spellcasting system is pretty original, but the act of casting like other actions just doesn't jive with ""real-time"" battle.  Every battle quickly devolves into a scramble to CLICK ALL THE THINGS and it often leaves the player feeling cheated when things go wrong, especially considering how clunky the menus can be.  The frenzy of battle becomes a tedium of switching gear, passing potions around, and constantly equipping new projectiles.  There are no hot keys, you pretty much have to rely on the mouse for everything.  The cerebral aspects of the game (puzzles, carefully managing resources, distributing skill points) is lost every time you encounter an enemy, because battle feels too much like a chore rather than fun.  To excel in this combat system you have to play a perpetual game of hopscotch with your enemies as you desperately try to click the next action square that lights up at the right time.  In addition, the characters here can't seem to hit the broad side of a barn.   Had this game incorporated turn-based combat or at least an option for it, this game still wouldn't be a home run but this would be a positive review. I love that these devs dusted off an sadly neglected style of RPG, but other than a nice facelift there's not much else to see here.  I respect the risks they took here but the potential here is tragically lost in the tedium of the clunky and frenzied comat system and a general lack of polish.  You get 4 party members and there are 3 classes.  Scarce resources is one thing I respect, but for an RPG the equipment is so scarce that your characters are still half-naked 8 hours into the game.Thrown weapons, torches, and food all need to be perpetually ""maintained"", and inventory management becomes a chore.There seem to be no status icons, save for ""over-encumbered"", which doesn't even seem to function properly as the numbers don't make sense.  Maybe as part of the homage to old games they decided to add a dash of ""WTF"" just for good measure I don't know what else to chalk some of this up to.There's something here for those of us who remember this classic style, but this just feels like a poorly designed RPG reluctantly wedged into a brilliant dungeon puzzler.  Maybe it would be great on a tablet for poop breaks, but as a PC title it feels half-baked.  I haven't played the sequel yet but I'm hopeful that they learned some things from this release and improved on what is an intriguing foundation here.  I'm not giving up on this series.  Don't get me wrong, despite the mis-steps there really is a lot of potential here.I give it 2 out of 4 skeleton archers, with skeleton-shaped shadow lurking in the corner chattering ""tuuuuurn-BASED!!"" and another chattering  ""statusssss iconssssss...master warp portalsssssss between levels...one or two more classsesss......chchchchchchchhc""			"

												Now this is a real dungeon crawl. Getting past traps, monsters and locked doors to the stairs is the whole game. Story, Cut scenes and character motivation are all minimal. Heck the textures, loot and sound effects are minimal too. Some may be bothered by that, But I wasn't. I couldn't resist ""old school mode"",  Break out the graph paper and DIY, Even for the first time out. Doing so, Mapping became the central focus of the game. The ambiance of the dungeon also became more pronounced as you don't want to get caught with a pencil in your hand and not a sword. I've played the old Wizardry and Bard's Tales and have always enjoyed the act of mapping. And I enjoyed it here as well.Combat is real-time. So click on your weapon to attack or click on your hands to ready a spell, then select the rune pattern of the spell and then cast the spell. That's a lot to do for a mage, But then again, Casting spells should be more involved than swinging a sword. Turn-based would have been more “old school”, But may have lessened the importance of the ambiance as a result. The “Prepare, Attack, Move, Repeat” pattern is acceptable.I found less than 50 secrets. I didn't try that hard as such things have never been a strong motivator for me in-and-of themselves. Getting through the dungeon had some tough spots. The worst of which was having to redraw a badly drawn map followed by some investigation/experimentation. The best of which was being thrown in a room full of nasties with my escape route closed off. Only option...run deeper into the dungeon. But you don't have time to map when your frantically running away. For my party I decided to go sub-optimal and let a RNG choose my races, classes, initial attribute point allocations, traits (I did select a couple of racial traits myself) and pictures. I got 2 Minotaurs (A fighter and a mage) and 2 Insectoids (Both mages). Happily they all made it out alive. I'd be interested in taking another group of random criminals into the mountain.			"

												If you're below a certain age (around 25-30) you may be wondering why this game is in a tile format; why you can't just walk around freely in any direction like in Skyrim, for example. It's because this game is a modern take on old dungeon crawler games from the 80's and early 90's. They were made like this because of technological limitations but in my opinion they work just as well today as they did then and Legend of Grimrock captures the feel of that perfectly. You are 4 prisoners who have been accused of unknown crimes and tossed in to the dungeons of a mountain. As you were thrown in your crimes were absolved and if you can make it through the maze of tunnels, monsters and puzzles and come out the other side in one piece your crimes will be forgotten.You can choose from 4 races (human, minotaur, lizard or insectoid) and each has certain differences that make them unique. Minotaur are very aggressive and strong and so make great fighters, for example. There are also 3 classes to choose from: warrior, rogue and mage. As you level up you can further customize your characters by spending skill points, so as a mage you can choose to focus on fire magic and become very proficient in that, or you can spread your points out evenly and be good at all schools of magic. Similarly with a rogue you can choose between missile weapons, throwing weapons or fast melee weapons/backstabs with daggers and the like.The puzzles and monsters start off easy but get harder as the game progresses - all the clues to solve them are there though in the form of cryptic messages written on walls and notes left by other prisoners who have tried to escape before you. Each level has secret rooms that can usually be found by pushing a ""button"" - a loose rock hidden in a wall somewhere. They're not too difficult to find but you do have to keep your eyes open.I love this game and it reminds me of the good old days of classic dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder. If I was forced to say something negative about it (which I guess I am because this is a review) then it would be that some enemies are quite easy to defeat by hitting them and then sidestepping before they can hit you - though this is actually a valid tactic in games these. Even so, a mistake can get you killed, for example if you allow yourself to be cornered a troll - it'll wear your hit points down fast because they hit like a train. You need to give yourself room to manouver.I'd give it a 4/5. It's one of the best quality indie games you'll ever find, it is completely bug-free and it isn't a DLC/microtransaction cash grab like so many games are today. You buy the game, you get the full game. If you're tempted to try a Grimrock game I'd definitely try this one first. It's cheaper (because it's older) then the second one and if you like this then you'll definitely like the second one too, and if you don't then you won't like the second one.			"

												I underestimated this game when it came out, but now I have to admit that playing Legend of Grimrock was an amazing experience. This is the first game in 15years that got me stuck on puzzles, it reminded me of the time when puzzle games where among the most played, and well made, games. For those of you who played games like ""Eye of the Beholder"", Legend of Grimrock will probably hit you in the feelings like a 1/2 ton truck.***GAMEPLAY 9/10The gameplay is really simple, you move as if you're on a grid one step at time (up,down,left,right and rotate 90° L or R)You have 4 characters that move together in a square formation, so you have 2 on front and 2 at the back, note that this also mean that you have 2 on the left and 2 on the right, which might seem obvious, but will become a problem if you get sandwiched between monsters. The combat mechanic is simple, but challenging. Your front row can attack any monster with any weapon, the back row can only attack monsters with ranged/missile weapons, or with spells. You can only attack monsters that are facing you, but monsters can sneak on you and easily kill your back row, so beware of how you move when fighting more than one enemy.When you are not killing enemies, you're probably trying to solve puzzles. This is the core of the game : how to reach the end of the dungeon. Your wits will be challenged, sometimes lightly, sometimes harder, sometimes you'll find the solution to a hard puzzle in no time and some other times you'll feel the king of all dumbs by realizing you had the solution under your nose for 1 hour, but you didn't see it... true story.Why 9/10? I need to write this down. I'd normally give 8, game controls are good, game is challenging but not impossible, however, this +1 bonus comes from the fact that Legend of Grimrock resurrected the dungeon crawler mechanics that was abandoned long time ago. It demonstrates that old school can still kick asses. ***STORY 7/10Story is almost a MacGuffin, it's there just to set things in motion and to give you a purpose. You're thrown into this prison/dungeon to die, but some weird voice in your dreams tells you that you can escape if you reach the lowest level... and so it begins. While descending the levels you'll find some scrolls that give you information about Mount Grimrock, which add a bit of lore to the game. When you finally reach the lowest level ... well, you'll see. I enjoyed every single bit of the story, even though it's really simple.  ***GRAPHICS 7/10Graphic isn't great, but it's good enough. A bit more variety for what concerns the levels wouldn't have hurt, but I admit it's not necessary. I mean, Mount Grimrock is a prison and a prison isn't supposed to be about beautiful hallways and rooms, so it doesn't feel weird roaming 4 levels that look the same. No glitches whatsoever.***SOUND 7/10Game is almost silent, music is just a feeble echo in the background. The monsters grunts and steps are what you'll hear most of the time. When you play at harder difficulties it creates an effect on the player, hearing wierd noises behind walls and corner almost make you fear for the lives of your characters.3) TL;DROverall score 7.5/10 Legend of Grimrock resurrects the dungeon crawler genre. If you are old enough to have played this kind of games before, you should buy this game, and even if you weren't old enough, and puzzle game are your thing, you won't get disappointed.			"

												Takes all the good elements from old-school dungeon crawlers like Dungeon Master and executes them perfectly. The UI and general handling of the game is that intuitively that you know everything you need to know after the first minutes into the game. And the developers didn't make any major changes to the retro mechanics, but they polished them. Like you walk over a previous thrown distance weapon and it will be auto-equipped into the corresponding slot. I love such details.Only tiny thing I'd wish for is a hotkey to toggle secondary weapons, because in the heat of the battle it's rather annoying to switch to a distance weapon (currently they are basically spamming my inventory).If you like this genre this game is a must.

												Simplesmente estupendo. Há muito tempo um jogo não me prendia como LoG prendeu. Puzzles inteligentes, marcantes e bem construidos. Claro que deixei inúmeros segredos e passagens para trás, mas o que descobri enquanto estive pelos subterrâneos do Monte Grimrock me satisfez. E muito.Não vi falhas. Não vi bugs. Mas vi um grupo de devsenvolvedores com potencial para um futuro brilhante e o mais importante: que conhecem profundamente como criar ambientes desafiadores sem focar apenas nas capacidades físicas do jogador (mover ou apertar o mouse mais rápido do que a máquina requer). Souberam, de forma peculiar, exercitar o meu intelecto e capacidade cognitiva.			"

												Right off the bat im going to say that this game isn't for everyone.  You're definately going to have to be nostalgic about first person dungeon crawlers from the 90's to really enjoy this game.  That being said this game is fantastic.  The difficulty curve is great, the games starts out with easy battles and simple puzzles and builds in difficulty throughout the entire game to nerve wracking battles and extremely challenging puzzles.  The visuals are outstanding, but the same stone walled environments get really repetitive and boring after awhile.  The base game netted me around 20 hours of play, with steam workshop included though this game keeps you updated with plenty of fresh user created content.  If you love games like Dungeon Master and Might and Magic than definately pick this game up during the next steam sale.			"

												I'll keep this short. The game is fun and challenging. Combat needs some work, most of it you can cheese pretty easily. The majority of the challenge comes in puzzles--not combat. One puzzle is ridiculous, and could be a show stopper for anyone that doesn't hoard inventory items. The story was interesting, that is, right up until the end. Great atmosphere.			"

Dungeon crawler with grid-based movement & maps where progression requires a lot of attention to detail and figuring out cryptic messages, which tends to get very difficult along the way. Very enjoyable though the classes and races seem to be highly unbalanced for a single player RPG. For example the mage class seems to be pretty weak for the long run since there isn't enough mage-friendly armor around and there isn't much in the game to help them defend themselves.			"

												Wow.This is a WOW game.This game doesn't have cutting edge graphics, the audio is slightly better than average, and the genre is as old as, what, the 1980s?This game isn't great because of some stupid parlor trick. It's good because it's a near-perfect implementation of a specific class of game; the old PC dungeon crawler.If you love finding secret wall switches, solving puzzles and finding loot, and eating a giant roasted maggot-on-a-stick because you're desperate to eat, then this is the game for you.If you want a fantasy FPS with lots of jumping and airducking, this isn't for you, GTFO.Legend of Grimrock doesn't try and improve much on the old classic dungeon crawler game design, I think that works well for it, and I don't think they do anything really new or crazy that hasn't been done in dungeon crawlers before. They just put modern graphics and sound together into a game and implemented it well.The game doesn't have any music beyond the title screen, but the ambient background through the game is pleasant and detailed. Turn the volume up, because sounds of the dungeon will alert you to nearby foul beasts and secrets.The background story is compelling and interesting, but nothing too deep. Secrets are found in the dungeon, and a reason for being is evident, but they leave the details up to your imagination, which is probably for the best. You can't climb back up. Your only way out is down. The story is your journey along the way.The last few levels are spooky and the game has a very fulfilling final battle.Secrets are plentiful, so pay attention. There were a couple of puzzles which had me really baffled, including two that were required to proceed with the story. I don't recomend ruining the challenge for yourself by reading a walkthrough online, but if you get stuck in the story, it's there for you. The best thing to do is sit and think. With two specific exceptions that I can mention, most of the puzzles are evident if you just use your brain for more than thirty seconds.I do have a complaint regarding the final puzzle in the game (Minor spoiler warning): There are four items which need to be placed around a single block in a room. Two of them are pretty easy to figure out, but the small gear in particular has a non-obvious arbitrary placement location which should be fixed. Even if you have the right item on the right wall, you have to click it on a very specific small area that doesn't offer any clue that it's the right part to go in the right place.Also, the level 9 riddle room had me really stuck for awhile. I just didn't get the clues and had to randomly guess at it until I figured it out.			"

												A lot of people who were PC gamers in the late 80s and early 90s have fond memories of dungeon crawlers like Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder. This game perfectly reboots the rustic subgenre that many veteran gamers remember all on a modern engine with many of the familiar quirks. Throughout the entirety of the game, you’ll be descending downward into the unknown with a party of four to solve puzzles that become increasingly complex and fight a variety of enemies. Opening the iron doors on each level and finding secrets is also critical if you want to find good gear.  If you're looking for a dungeon crawler RPG that will send you down a nostalgia trip, then you’ve come to the right place. Even as someone who never grew up playing these types of games I can say that my experience with this game has been wonderful. I’d suggest this game to anyone who is looking for a fun dungeon crawling experience that won’t break the bank.			"

												Unlike a lot of others, I wasn't around for the golden age of PC gaming. Back when you had to draw your own maps and read the manuals that came with the game. But when I bought this game a couple summers back, it made me wish I had.This game has revived the dungeon crawling genre. It's fleshed out, interesting, and well done. Graphically pleasing and is one of the few games that has puzzles I enjoy. (They can certainly stump you) It's only flaws are the scenery can get a bit dull and the enemy AI is easily fooled (Only if you have four squares to dodge around. Otherwise, you're ♥♥♥♥ed, dude.) but it's certainly a good purchase if this is your type of game.			"

												This is an excellent game that takes me back to ""Dungeon Master"" and ""Eye of the Beholder"" that were so much fun in days long ago.Like those games, this game has pre-set dungeons that do not change and offer the same sets of mazes, the same puzzles and deceptions, the same monsters, the same rewards, and the same secrets ---- it is up to the player to navigate all of these to the conclusion.The idea, of course, is to escape the dungeon with your four adventurers. Tons of replay value here, and, with the easy gameplay involved, you just might find yourself in this dungeon for a ton of hours.The graphics are great, the puzzles (ranging from simple to completely head scratching) trump the combat aspect, the atmosphere is genuinely spooky, and the story is solid.Anyone looking for an old school dungeon crawler need to visit Grimrock. Very satisfying. Highly recommended.  "

												To start with, I bought this game on the 2016 Steam winter sale. I payed a little over a $1 US for it.. I wish like hell I'd bought the game at full price now. Almost Human, if you're listening, amazing job. I'm sure I'm late to the party thanking you all for a wonderful job well done, but I must say it.When I first saw Legend of Grimrock in the Steam store years ago, I vowed to get it someday and play it, but at the time I was playing Skyrim and thought I had better things to do than play a dungeon crawler. I was wrong and should have taken the opportunity to buy your game. This game keeps with everything I loved about Eye of the Beholder, which I played for what felt like an eternity. I've always wanted something like that game to come along give me another challenge, but Wizards never seemed to care much that there was one guy out here wanting more dungeon crawler games. I'm now done with the main storyline, and moving on to Legend of Grimrock II. I LOVE the dungeon editor for that installment. (Also, massive props to dukester70 for recreating the Tomb of Horrors in the first Grimrock game) I'll stop drooling all over the steam page, but guys, if you haven't played it and love good dungeon crawling, this is the best hands down. Graphics: 10/10, story: 7/10, gameplay: 10/10, replay value: ""Are you kidding me? If I wasn't playing your second game, I'd be playing this now!""/10Another note: I can't get enough of how magic works in this game.I'll shut up now.Buy this game.			"

												I’ve just completed the game in 24 hours and now I feel I should write a review about my experience.*INTRO*First of all, I never thought these games would be my type, and I didn’t even know that it was a ‘tile based’ so when I got into the game I was like ‘oh it’s like this is it?’ but as I brought the game I persevered with it, and actually found myself enjoying it.Also I want to state that I’m not a reviewer so don’t expect some top of the line review, I’m dumb as♥♥♥♥♥♥and can’t form a sentence properly so please don’t hurt me. :) *PUZZELS*The puzzles weren’t too difficult but as it got towards the end of the game they just became annoying, As in the starts is all about the combat with a few puzzles, but towards the end it just seems to be all puzzles and some of them are really needless, (Spoiler Warning Start) For example when you fight the end boss, you need to go to a portal, which the game never tell you too (I looked up a guide) and this takes you to a place where you get the weapon that can damage the boss, but instead of the game just letting you get the weapon you have to go through 2 puzzles the get 2 keys, they’re easy puzzles but it’s just seems really pointless and tedious, then when you think you have the weapon nooooooo, the game give you a fire elemental to fight which I swear down has 4x more health than the others, then after you defeat that guy there is yet another puzzle which is really cryptic just like 50% of the other puzzles towards the end, this part was just a little rant but I feels like you reading this needs to know. (Spoiler End)RATING: 5/10Fun and no so challenging to begin with but annoying and pointless towards the end at times*COMBAT*The combat I found to be fun but rather difficult and challenging at times, especially towards the end, and I can’t stress that enough, the end 2 levels are really challenging.You will find yourself just kiting enemies and walking around them ‘tactically’ most of the time, but they seem to ‘pre-fire’ there attacks as soon as you move like they know the tile which you’re going to land on, which isn’t a bad thing otherwise you wouldn’t get hit at all.It’s all really well balanced and fun, one of the strong point of the game in my opinion.RATING: 9/10Fun and balanced but not perfect*STORY*(Spoiler Warning I Think)The story in my opinion is well crafted, you’re a prisoner that gets thrown into a dungeon, and sometimes someone will speak to you in your dreams, there are a bunch of scrolls scattered around of the stories of other prisoners, and that’s all there is to say really, there is a surprise at the end :)RATING: 7/10Well crafted, but it’s not in your face so it doesn’t seem like there is one for 70% of the game.*GRAPHICS*I think the Graphics in the game are really good, but im one of the few people that couldn’t care less if a game looks good or not, but what you see in the screenshots is what you get so judge for yourself :) RATING: Judge for yourself/10*MECHANICS*Here I will just go over a few things in the game which I will bullet point-	SleepingThe sleeping is a really neat feature to get your characters health back, you will find yourself sleeping a lot be careful where you’re sleeping is safe as you can get attacked and it WILL scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you.-	Magic/SpellcastingIn my opinion this is okay at best, to cast a spell you have to right click the wand and you get 9 tiles of symbols, and you have to click the right combination of symbols to cast a certain spell, and as you can imagine in combat this can be annoying, but there are some useful spells and you find yourself getting faster as casting as the game progresses.-	FoodThere is a ‘survival’ aspect to this game as you have to keep your characters fed, but this really isn’t a problem, as the game throws food at you left right and centre and I never found myself running out, at the end of the game all my characters were full food and I had 2 crates (8x2=16 slots) of food items. There’s probably a few things I’ve missed in this review but I don’t usually review games to this extent unless I feels they deserve it and this one took me by surprise so it does, and also I’m not a reviewer, so if you’ve got this far then thank you for reading, I hope my review helped you decide to buy it or not, if you have bought it and you like it then I hope you enjoy as much as I do :)OVERALL: 8/10 "

												You approach the peak of Mount Grimrock in shackles. Whatever crimes you have committed, your punishment lies within the dungeons of Mount Grimrock. With the promise of amnesty, if you ever find your way out of the dungeons, you are thrown into the prison maze. Will you find your way out?'Legend of Grimrock' puts you in control of a group of four prisoners aiming to find their way out of an extremely huge dungeon. Naked and helpless you begin your journey. Search for secrets, find clothes, weapons and armours and continuously upgrade the abilities of your party members. Solve countless puzzles to disarm deadly traps and unravel the secret of Mount Grimrock.'Legend of Grimrock' is a wonderful game if you are willing to immerse into it. But it requires a lot of patience and endurance because it's a very difficult game. You can try to move through the dungeon as fast as possible, but you will fail because you constantly need to improve your equipment and abilities in order to beat the many enemies waiting for you in the dark. Since all the stronger weapons and premium armours are hidden in secret chambers, you need to search for them and find a way to access them. This can be tricky and time consuming. But since it's never easy, it's also very rewarding and a very satisfying element of the game.The game allows you to set up your personal party, choosing the race and abilities of your members or you can simply start by using a pre-defined group. As an old-fashioned dungeon crawler you can only move one step at a time in one direction. This feels a little strange at the beginning but offers nice possibilities during fights and feels good once you got used to it. The game is designed to be played with keyboard and mouse. I played the entire game with the Steam Controller, which was very convenient.  Pros:- great atmosphere- nice graphics- addictive- extremely good and varied puzzle design- many different and gradually stronger enemies- mysterious hints gradually reveal the story - rewardingNeutral:- the maze can be maddening at times but at the same time this adds to the claustrophobic moodCons:- difficult- somewhat disappointing end			"

												This is definitely an old school style dungeon crawler RPG and I can say that because I was actually gaming back in the 80s. The visuals were nice as well as the sound and music, but the game could be brutally difficult at times. I usually pride myself on not using guides and walkthroughs to solve puzzles in games, but this game caused me to have to do that a few times. I felt like some of the puzzles required you to make such large leaps of deduction that I found myself at times just trying random things, or trying different patterns until I got lucky and opened the door or found the secret. Also, the combat system could be a little off-putting and didn't fit with the theme of the game. Would four party members really do square dancing in a dungeon with an ogre? I beat the game and the story was OK, but even though I try to be a completist, I still left many secrets, treasure, and weapons unfound as I traversed all the levels of the game. Overall, I liked it but I will probably never play it again. It just got to grindy towards the end and I just wanted it to be over.			"

												It's not a terrible game, but it falls short of its predecessors. The Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder series were much better games than this one. Let me list the good and bad  points:-- Good --- The graphics are sharp. Thumbs up in this department.- The monsters actually behave differently depending on their type, giving you the idea that they aren't just sacks of hitpoints charging at you.- A lot of secrets to uncover.- Most levels have a healing crystal that will instantly heal your party and resurrect fallen members.-- Bad --- The magic system is terrible. Both DM and EOB had a rich magic system with a lot of useful spells, both combat and utility. This game has essentially 6 or 7 spells. (There are actually more than this, but in essence a fire arrow spell is the exact same as a lighting/poison/frost arrow, so I am calling it one spell.) Of these, the only real utility spell is a light spell. No healing spells, no create food spells, no detect secrets spells - nothing. This was my #1 biggest complaint with this game.- The puzzles are mostly of the 'hit a switch and race to this location to hit another one' variety. I want puzzles that test my cunning, not my reflexes.- Most of the monsters in the game are about impossible to stand toe-to-toe with. The game relies heavily on the 'attack and sidestep' school of combat. It's wasn't fun in EOB, and it isn't fun here. I understand it for a boss fight, but here it is necessary with most monsters, at least until you are way over their level.- THERE ARE NO HOTKEYS! You have to use your mouse to manually click each party member's weapon in order to attack. Come on guys - even Might and Magic had combat hotkeys! This is annoying with melee attacks, but downright aggravating when it comes to magic. To cast a spell, you have to right-click your wand, select the runes (up to 3), and then click again. Want to cast that spell again? Ok, 5 more clicks coming right up. All this while trying to sidestep and manage 3 other party members' melee attacks.My recommendation is go back and play DM or EOB. They are much better (although uglier) games. "

												LoG has often been presented as a homage or even a remake of Dungeon Master (DM). Its main gameplay strong point is its puzzles. There are a good bunch of them, very evolved and clever. But DM wasn’t really puzzle based. Moreover, the dungeon exploration is a lot more straightforward than DM ; it features a more linear and less mystified progression which requires none or only very little backtracking or roaming (except for 2 or 3 levels) ; the whole progress is made even easier by the auto-map system. And as LoG’s modern 3D engine lets you see more than 3 squares away, you almost never feel lost for the whole game.Another weak point is its combat system. It’s very simple and basically requires you to strafe-turn-strafe-turn non-stop while waiting for your attack cooldowns to reset. Even worse, if you have mages in your party, you have to enter complex rune sequences while you’re strafing & turning. It’s like that for hours till you beat the game. If you don’t strafe & turn around, the monsters will kill you very quickly.Presented like that, it seems to be very close of DM, but actually, DM’s combat was better :- melee weapons actually had 2 or 3 different attacks, so you had to think a bit and try out to find which one was the best in the present situation ; it wasn’t a lot better than LoG, but still it was more evolved and a bit less boring & repetitive over the course of the game- it also required complex rune sequences to cast spells, but as mana was pretty limited, we could cast much less spells, and often had to prepare the spells before the fights, so it was less annoyingAnyway, personally, I think this kind of system is really outdated, and today it’s possible to create more engaging & less repetitive combat systems, either by going in a more arcade direction, or a more tactical one (like Dungeon Guardians ;-) ).Another weak point is the story and its background. There’s not much going on there. But in the dungeon crawler genre, it’s not really penalizing.But there’s a last severe weakness : the ending level(s). Without spoiling much, let’s say it felt out of place, rushed, and not satisfying for the gamer (ie: no real sense of achievement).And still, LoG is a good game (great some people might say if they didn’t get bored by the combats). Mostly because except its puzzles, it has another very strong point : a great atmosphere, brought by a finely mastered artistic direction. So globally, we still get a good adventure in an oppressing dungeon.So in short, that gives :Awesome puzzles, so-so exploration, boring combats, weak ending, impressive visuals & atmosphere.			"

												The Legend  of grimrock is a 3-d dungeon crawler which is hard, rage causing, keyboard breaking fun. Yes i said fun, the game is fun, but when its not fun its frustrating. I like the game alot due to the fact that it reminds me of the game King's Quest, in the fact that most of your time is either puzzle solving or combat. Overall i like the game and i would say buy it for the diffulculty, which is also the reason why i think the game didn't sell as much as it should have made, because now and days people expect easy games like Call of Duty or Minecraft. So try the game out if you want,i can say wether or not you'll like it but hey atleast check it out on Twitch or Youtube......			"

												Well,I like this game and I don't. It invokes a weird mix of nostalgia and frustration spiced with a bit of 'is this it?'Let me explain: I'm an older player so I grew up with games like wizardry, Eye of the Beholder etc. That's the nostalgia part summed up. I've done it before and liked it.Now for frustration: unless you have the reflexes of a teenager, you are going to reload and reload until, by fluke, you pass the generously sprinkled reflex. I hate this stuff even more than jump puzzles in other games. And now for the spice: here and there you can find a new weapon, armor or spell. But they are few and far between and offer next to nothing but a bit more damage etc. Same goes for spells: there are 20 or so spells in the game and half of those nearly useless. So you spam the same spell to oblivion over and over again. Conclusion: pretty boring and frustrating.			"

												Legend of Grimrock took me totally by surprise. I bought it expecting some kind of mild distraction that I would drop shortly after picking it up, but even after only a handful of hours, I'm hooked. The gameplay is nearly identical to the dungeon crawlers of yesteryear (Eye of the Beholder, for example). And while I was never a big fan of those types of games, Grimrock is a blast to play. Exploration is entirely tile based, and simple as it may be, the grid-based format allows for some truly interesting map layouts. After the first couple of areas, it becomes quite easy to get lost, but this only adds to the experience. It's refreshing to play a game that doesn't lead you by the nose with quest markers and waypoints. ""Old school"" mode makes navigating the maze-like levels of Grimrock even more compelling by removing the map. The combat, at first glance, is very basic and shallow. However, like the grid-based level design, there is a certain amount of depth to be found in the enemy encounters. Since the game is so reliant on the grid system, navigating around mobs of enemies has a certain strategic feel to it. As the enemies become stronger, it becomes essential to position yourself in such a way that your back row doesn't get hit. This provides a pleasant tactical challenge to Grimrock's combat.Where Grimrock truly shines, though, is in its puzzles. It speaks to the game's elegance, that I, a person that despises games that have puzzles for their own sake, have loved every puzzle and riddle I've come across so far. Consisting of stepping on pressure plates in the right order, pressing switches in the right way, and using certain items on objects in the level, all of Grimrock's puzzles are well-planned and well-implemented. I never encountered a puzzle that I felt like I couldn't figure out. You are always given the necessary information to progress, and the puzzles are never reduced to just random clicking hoping to get lucky. Furthermore, there are tons of hidden switches and mini-puzzles that you can find that unlock hidden treasure stashes or high quality gear. Clever thinking and careful observation are always rewarded by the game.All of this probably sounds familiar to gamers who (unlike myself) are veterans of the old dungeon crawlers, but the presentation of the game makes it much more accessible to younger gamers and strangers to the genre. The graphics, while not mind blowing, are excellent. There is a high level of detail in all the textures. Even the enemy models are well done and interesting to look at. Additionally, the sound design is phenomenal. The ambience includes shuffling monsters, footsteps, and barely audible muttering. Combined with how dark the game is, the ambient sounds create a very creepy and foreboding atmosphere, perfect for the theme of the game. There were even a few times that I got so caught up in the sounds around me, I was startled by a previously undetected monster jumping at me from the edge of the screen.The game isn't perfect (there is no actual music aside from the title theme, the lack of combat animations may seem silly to some, and the distribution of gear is a bit questionable), but all in all, this is a fantastic dungeon crawler that everyone should try.

												This is a mixed review, but overall it's a game that is worth playing. I will mainly point out what I felt wasn't that great about it, so this might read like a negative review while it isn't.First of all it is a nice homage to the dungeon crawler days of Dungeon Master and Eye Of The Beholder. It's mainly based on the first and while I'm a bigger fan of EOTB I played my fair share of DM. I like the fact that you are restricted to tile based movement, but can use a camera to look around. If there was just a bit more to look at...My first complain would be that the presentation while being nicely drawn/crafted (especially the monsters), lacks in variety. In the 13 levels there are four different wall 'sets' and those don't even have enough variation in itself. I take this is due to the small team, but it certainly feels a bit sad to not have more variation. That being said there is a good amount of different monsters, but they have a common problem as well...The fighting system feels very close to DM (also the magic system), but the enemies feel a tad too damage 'spongy'. It's not that much, but over time the feeling that each enemy takes too long adds up. That changes slightly in the last levels when enemies require a bit more tactic. It's not too bad though and after getting used to it the skill system does really provide a decent way to build your characters.The puzzles are my main complaint. There are too many reaction/time based ones and while most of them are optional, some aren't. This means that you have to remember patterns and execute them without a flaw. This also happens in DM and EOTB, but it's far less and they are more forgiving. Granted most of the time if you fail a time based puzzle you 'only' lose some health, but it also adds up to the point were you just don't want to do it anymore.The last complaint is the final boss. He deals a lot of damage and can insta-kill you, but at the same time he doesn't have that many hit points or any ranged attacks, so with a tiny bit of tactic he's really easy to beat.That all being said, Legend of Grimrock is a very well done throw back to Dungeon Master and I enjoyed experiencing the 13 levels.

												Legend of Grimrock is a great example of an indie game that finds a niche that bigger devs and publishers have no interest in and does it well. It takes the gameplay of old dungeon crawlers like Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder and puts a nice coat of paint on them. It's surprising how well the idea holds up with only a few little quality of life improvements.Of course, Grimrock isn't for everybody. Most people are probably going to find it a little tedious to slog through same looking hallways while having to save scum in case a monster closet opens up on them.The tile based movement and ""click on a character portrait"" combat is less than smooth, but if you're the kind of person who likes Resident Evil with tank controls than you probably understand how restrictive design can be a good thing sometimes. It creates a frantic combat atmosphere as you try to coordinate moving around with attacking while setting up rune combinations to cast spells.For a certain kind of person, there's something engrossing about wandering lonely, abandonded hallways, solving puzzles and finding secret treasures. There's no soundtrack here, just the moan of an empty dungeon and the occasional skittering of an enemy that might be safely locked away or just around the corner waiting to pop out at you. There are no loot drops, if you want better weapons and armor you better make sure your puzzle solving is up to snuff as everything needs to be earned and a lot of things are squirreled away pretty deviously. Generally the game is pretty fair and you can get through with a minimum number of secrets found (I discovered a little over half) one puzzle that required backtracking for specific items that you might not think important to carry was annoying, but most puzzles that you need to solve to progress won't make you tear your hair out.If you're interested it may be better to jump to Grimrock II, which I've heard improves a lot on the formula here, but on its own this is still a solid game and a unique experience if you're not familiar with this style of game.

												Legend of Grimrock is a great game where you play as a little band of prisoners thrown into the mountain of Grimrock, which contains a prison deep within it's core, from which something is trying to escape.It took me 15 hours to complete the game (there are 13 levels). The game is super fun and engaging. The secrets are really enjoyable to find, and easy to recognise (but impossible to ""expect""). If you enjoy games like Binding of Isaac and Dark Souls, you'll enjoy dungeon crawling through Grimrock. The controls are a little unintuitive, but you get used to them. For this kind of game you need patience in your playstyle. If you don't have it, don't play the game.Thoroughly recommended.-Nilesy			"

												This game was a total surprise back when I played it.I love RPGs and Dungeon games, but never played the old school style ones. This was so refreshing from a gameplay perspective, it was one of the coolest games and played it to bits, did not leave and stones unturned, corners checked etc.From a graphical perspective it's top notch and, along the amazing sound, it create a really intense and immersive atmosphere.The puzzles were quite well done and the exploration part was amazing. You can feel so satisfied when you manage to find a secret switch, which leads to a secret door, which leads to a secret treasure :) The only thing lacking might be the story, which is very strait forward, but still... they did surprise me at the end level.The game kept me playing and wanting to go back until I finished it... and them some, due to fan created levels and possibility to try the game with different classed+increased difficulty (loved the pen&paper map idea).Definitely a must play for all lovers of Dungeon Exploring Fans.

												I was a huge fan of Dungeon Hack by Dream Forge when I was a kid. My brother and I used to create our own custom character and then play through the randomly generated levels and die at some point misserablely before we could reach the bottom. I believe grid based strategy and level design was lost with 3D, MMORPG, open world games, FPS, etc.My bro sent this to me for Christmas a few years back. I had a ton of fun playing through this and finally beating it. I bought Legend of Grimrock 2 when it was released.  The puzzles are probably the best part of the game, but the level progression and character customization is a huge bonus.I highly recommend this game! Plus, it doesn't have those Illustionary Walls that were killer back in 1993. :)			"

												Well, I must say, this is much, much better than all that Skyrim ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Old-school dungeon-grinding, with a bit of new-school twist.    For the record, I haven't played many games like this in, well, almost DECADES...so just to clarify, I'm not really up with what the dungeon-delving kids are into these days, bar the aforementioned Elder Scrolls nonsense and the very, very excellent Darkest Dungeon.  I am pleased to note, however, that this is more than a mere ""dungeon hack""...there's lots of puzzles and traps, and interesting and strategic ways to fight and handle monsters, so it's already ten times more intelligent than, say, a Borderlands game (not that that's any great feat, but bear with me).      In case you're wondering how it all works, your party moves through the dungeon in a limited version of a first person perspective (you can only move forward, left, right, and back; then turn to face in a different direction, ninety degrees at a time) and the combat is half-way between a turn-based approach and a more real-time urgency.   What this all adds up to, best as I can tell, is a bit of a best-of-both-worlds approach to dungeoneering: That is to say, it's not TOO much of a game of reflexes and/or hand-eye coordination, but still has more moment-to-moment suspense and atmosphere than one could muster with a strictly turn-based situation.     It also offers a nice middle ground between so-called ""casual"" gaming and something a bit more involved, not to mention a decent compromise between ""lighter"" fantasy elements and something a teensy weensy bit ""darker""...so if it's a game with that kind of balance you're looking for, then by all means, step inside.     Me personally, I was in the market for a bit of a nostalgic dungeon crawl with some slightly spiffier, more modern graphics, and that's precisely what I got; so for the price of three bucks (on severe sale) I was well-chuffed.  In all honesty, though, it's probably worth the full asking price even if you play it through just the once - it's certainly LONG enough! - and it furthermore has a fair dose of replayability, thanks to customisable characters and multiple difficulty levels and so forth.  It's far from the Second Coming, and gets awfully grind-y at times, but it's pretty darn good for what it is.  Know what you're signing up for, and chances are you won't be disappointed. Verdict: 8.5/10.			"

												LoG is based off the old school RPG’s from early PC days and I think there may have even been a few on consoles. I never played much in this FPS style when I was younger but that doesn’t take away how much fun this game was to play. You have a team of 4 characters and move through a grid based dungeon you were locked up in. You can create your characters with a variety of classes, powers, and skills to whatever playstyle fits you best. There are many floors to travel through and many secrets to find on the way. There are plenty of great challenging puzzles and enemies to keep you occupied for a good time.There is also plenty of replay value with different difficulties and even an old-school mode where you lose the AutoMap and you can pull out some grid paper and make your own. Then there is also the added Steam Workshop where you can install mods to give you more challenges and fun to last you a long time.The game is fantastic looking with some cool character design and great sound to go along with it. Going through the tunnels when your torch is flickering out and you can hear the skittering of an enemy somewhere nearby made for some cool moments in the game. I played through on easy mode as I’m new to this style of RPG and figured I could get the hang of it better. It was still a decent challenge and enjoyable for me. I would highly recommend Legend of Grimrock if you like the old-school RPGs or even just want to play a well-made fantastic game. This is Almost Human’s first game and you can tell they put a lot of love into it and it was only a 4 man team too. Don’t pass this game up.			"

												Legend of Grimrock aims to give players an old school dungeon crawl experience which harkens back the old Dungeon Master games, and it does an admirable job doing that. . Legend of Grimrock is a faithful addition to the genre, yet gives it a modern level of accessibility. This is a great dungeon crawler for new players to get introduced to the genre as well as for veterans to relive the nostalgic goodness of the old dungeon crawlers.All the ingredients that made Dungeon Master so great are here. The game has a simplistic presentation on the surface, but with a fairly deep level of gameplay underneath. The party begins with nothing, and the player must explore the dungeon and find items that will help the party survive including weapons, armor, and even food. Everything takes place in real time where the player must click each party member’s action buttons for the party members to attack with either melee, ranged, or magic attacks. Starving characters take severe penalties on their ability to fight, and the food meter is always ticking. This gives some level of urgency to find food to keep your party effective throughout the game. The player can make the game as difficult as desired by options like increasing the power of monsters (mobs), turning on ironman mode, or even turning off auto-mapping and bringing out the graph paper (now that’s old school!).Besides combat with the horde of mobs crawling around the multilevel dungeon, players will be engaged with the many puzzles obscuring the player from progression further into the dungeon or from finding the many secrets that the dungeon holds. The game does a decent job of rewarding the player for problem solving. There is always some hidden room or passage that may hold a useful item that will help the player. Item distribution and progression is somewhat flawed, though. You’ll often come across items that are obsolete the moment you find them because you found something much better already.There are three classes to choose from (fighter, rogue, and mage). Each class has a unique set of skills that the player can spend skill points on to develop the characters. You can come up with some interesting builds that suit your playstyle. You can have characters specialize in certain melee weapons or ranged weapons, you can have characters play more defensive with skills such as armor and dodge, or you can also have characters specialize in unarmed combat for some “kung fu” action. The magic system may feel somewhat clumsy at first and takes some getting used to. It is faithful to an old school feel, though, and an interesting system that gets away from a mundane menu system that is typical of spell systems. There may be some balance issues that make some attributes and skills more desirable than others, but just about any build you can think of is viable enough to complete the game.The visuals are what you’d expect from a dungeon crawler made in 2012. The ambient sounds, with the footsteps and growl of mobs on the other side of doors, walls, or around corners, create a spooky and claustrophobic atmosphere. It does a good job of immersing you in the dungeon and keeping an eye over your shoulder to make sure you’re not being creeped up on by anything.This is a cool game that I highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of dungeon crawlers and especially the old Dungeon Master series. This is also a good introduction to dungeon crawlers for those new to them. Get this game.A Warning to those who suffer from Arachnidphobia. The spiders in this game are creepy as hell.			"

												Grimrock plays like Eye of the Beholder with better graphics and actual depth of field. If you liked EotB, that's a good thing. If you hated it (or have no idea what EotB even is), this game is PROBABLY not for you. It doesn't feel like a modern game. It feels like an upscaled version of a game from the DOS era. The puzzles are vague and cryptic, there are no ""directional arrows"" pointing you where to go, very few map notations, you have to memorize (or write down) spells and recipes, and your supply of... everything is limited. If you do stupid things, you will die. The good stuff in the game is obvious (and I've mentioned some of it). There's challenging puzzles, the ambient noises are useful (you'll want good, bi-aural headphones), the classes/builds allow for enough flexibility to build the way you want, the magic system is great, the tileset is pretty, and the controls are sharp. Combat actually feels dangerous, and requires you to be aware of your surroundings at all times. It's exactly what you would expect from a well-reviewed game in the same format as EotB. I really enjoyed Grimrock, but it's not without flaws. The enemy AI is bad. Really, really bad. You can kite everything. It's practically required at points (and therefore I'm fairly certain it's an intentional ""feature""), but it feels and looks really stupid to dance around a 2x2 square stabbing wildly whenever the enemy walks into your line of sight. Some of the hidden switches (those specific to getting treasure, NOT clearing the floors) are very hard to find. It's not a bad thing necessarily, but if you want to get the best gear you'll likely need a guide. Inventory management is cumbersome, because you cannot have more than one character's bag open at a time. Before you begin, you don't know what kind of gear you're going to find, meaning you can dump a bunch of early points into, say, Armour on your Fighter, but not have any heavy armour to take advantage of it. This problem is particularly bad for mages, who rely on you finding hidden scrolls to learn new spells (or cheating and looking them up online...), and can have 20 points invested in a tree they only have the first couple spells for. You're never sure if you missed the scrolls, or if they're just further along. There are some weird things with items, too. Occasionally you won't pick up an arrow you fired, leaving you to go hunting for it after the battle (not fun). You can't use a mortar and pestle from inside a container, meaning all your Alchemy materials have to stay in a character's inventory (10+ bottles, 6 reagants, and the Mortar takes up about half that guy's bag). You find weird things all over, some of which you will want later and some of which are just garbage. It's impossible to know which ones are critical to your mission (or hunt for treasure), though, because there isn't any tagging. And it's not like the game ASKS for this sword you found to be in your inventory. There's no prompt saying ""No entry without sword."" It's a silent check that you either pass or fail, and without a guide you might never know it was even there. You'll notice none of the issues I had with the game are anything close to being ""game-breaking."" They're just minor, quality of life things (and most of them are things that, if changed, would dramatically decrease how difficult the game is). It really is incredibly well polished, especially for an indie game. If you're curious, I'd put the game at about 20 hours in length if you go exploring. It's far easier than EotB, both because the updated graphics give you better depth perception and because it has a built-in map+healing crystals. It's still challenging, though, it's fairly priced, and although not without flaws I would recommend Grimrock to anyone who likes old-school CRPGs. Just be sure to read the manual before you start, and always keep an extra torch or five handy. You never know when you'll need them.			"

												Finally a dungeon crawler for modern age!This is a lovely homage to the old school grid based dungeon crawler genre, easy enough to learn so the younger generation of gamers can enjoy it, but truly challenging enough what older gamers would expect.Well balanced, fun, proper achievements and hours of gameplay with an affordable price tag.Highly recommended for anyone who love single player adventure and rpg-games in fantasy style.Be aware though that if you never had played any grid based dungeon crawler games before, the controls will probably feel a little awkward for the first minutes, but just learn how to move properly and soon you will be dancing around the enemies :)(Sorry for any grammar errors, English is not my native language)			"

												Un RPG bien old school y hardcore. Tiene puzzles bastante complejos, sobre todo los que te llevan a las salas secretas. Graficamente cumple de sobra, muy linda iluminación. Jugablemente es excelente. Hay cientos de items: armaduras, armas, ingredientes para pociones, tesoros, accesorios, etc.. También hay unos cuantos enemigos diferentes, los cuales requieren cada uno su propia estrategia para vencerlos. Los modelados de la mayoría son muy grosos. Podés jugar con los personajes prefijados o crear tu propio grupo, configurando la imagen y nombre, clase, atributos y skills.Una joyita indie bien pulida y cuidada. El único punto en contra es que el enemigo final es patético y fácil de vencer, desentonando con el resto del juego que es más complicado.			"

The gameplay is fun and addicting. There is a lot of secrets and collectible items. The fighting is also real good. Although sometimes it might be a bit unfair, but hey it belongs to these games.The game takes a while to play through unless you know everything about it.The game is near perfect in its genre. Also the atmosphere is really good. For example the prison actually feels a bit creepy to roam around in.TOTAL POINTS: 9/10			"

I got hooked immediately and my doubts, mostly related to the grid-based movements and the need to play with a keyboard, vanished at the same time. The game is very immersive and the satisfaction one gets from solving puzzles, challenging but never impossible, and finding secrets keeps you coming back for more.

												This game follows in the footsteps of games like Eye of the Beholder, yet gets lost along the way.Mainly this game is trying to take an RPG and make it a strategy/ puzzle crawler, instead of a dungeon crawler.  In order to succeed at this game you can't fight monsters toe to toe.  The game seems to be designed in a way that you must exploit the game mechanics (taking a swing at a monster then retreating before it can attack) in order to survive.  This combined with constant puzzles instead of exploring, make this game a poor choice for anyone looking for a true RPG dungeon crawler game.Party creation is also mediocre, with a minimum selection of classes, and non dynamic races.  You also only get a 4 person party instead of 6 which also limits experience.The game also has a combat interface that is clunkier than I remember the Eye of the Beholder games to be.  You can equip two weapons on a chanracter, but can't use them at the same time.  Also the spell system tried to be inovative with a rune selection process to make spell casting more of a challenge in the heat of battle.  However, the spell interface needs to be opened each time and has some issues.Also food seems to be unevenly distributed in the dungeons, making me wonder if food was initially and after thought of the game, and then made into a major mechanic at the last minute.  It seems to be laid out that if you try and 'clean' the dungeon by exploring every inch of a level, your party will starve to death.  However since the game is based on puzzles to unlock the next dungeon, complete exploration is usually a must.			"

												Legend of Grimrock is an excellent, atmospheric, well-made RPG in the style of much, MUCH older gems of the early 90's. The square-based movement style, and D&D style stats and gearing up, as well as the different patterns and intricacies of every enemy makes every encounter challenging, but not overpowering.Legend of Grimrock has incredible atmosphere. In the tight, packed corridors, you feel constantly trapped in a labarinth of passages, doors and levers. With over seventy secrets, treasures and notes, Grimrock's focus on exploration never dilutes the main path, meaning that you can explore each area as much or as little as you want.Legend of Grimrock's puzzles are very well made. Some require pinpoint reflexes and timing, while some require a more calculated and steady approach, but none feel impossible save one or two truly evil puzzles. The difficulty setting, however, is a tad arbitrary. Difficulty affects enemy stats and your hunger bar, but aside from that it changes nothing. Playing the game on easy will give you a much more enjoyable experience, and will not mean that a death of a party member is permanent.That being said, I only experienced one game-over screen and that was due to my own misstep on the final boss (who is definately innovative, if a tad underwhelming).This game is an excellent purchase, and a guaranteed source of enjoyment for a good ten or so hours, provided you do a full playthrough, fifteen if you're unfamilliar with the genre. The exploration bonus character makes for another interesting experience, so it may be wise to play through the game twice over - perhaps using a guide to help on the second time around.In conclusion, Legend of Grimrock is a bonafide gem of a game, and I would reccomend this to any fan of RPG's			"

												In my world, Legend Of Grimrock would be called ""The reincarnation of Eye Of The Beholder"", or something of the sort, as I have really good memories of the first Eye Of The Beholder game from the early 1990s (although I never beat it), and Legend Of Grimrock looks just like it. Just recently I realized Eye Of The Beholder itself was a reincarnation (or what some people would call ""a clone"" or ""a ripoff"") of a similar game called ""Dungeon Master"" from the 1980s (which I've never heard of until recently), but 'nuff said about that.Back to Legend Of Grimrock -The game is a first person dungeon crawling Action/RPG. You play a group of 4 adventurers (aka convicted criminals, but nevermind about that :P), whose goal is to survive the dungeon by means of solving puzzles and fighting monsters while staying alive in the process. The default party consists of two fighters (one human, one minotaur), one wizard and one rogue, set in a fixed formation of two rows - two characters in front, two more behind them. You can choose which character to place where and change it while playing, but you can't change the formation. The idea is that the two front characters use melee attacks, while the other two need to attack from long range (either magic, throwing weapons such as knives, or missile weapons such as bows).Up until now (8-10 hours ingame), I'm really having fun. Technically, everything looks and feels good. There's nothing overwhelming about the graphics or the music, but they are definitely good enough. Come to think of it, there's hardly any music ingame, and I think it's a really good idea. The lack of music makes the game feel more realistic, and it lets you pay the worthy attention to the sound effects, which just like with Eye Of The Beholder, play an important role, as they serve as warning signs from certain enemies.  The controls are simple and intuitive (left click to move items, right click to attack when it comes to battles). Some of the puzzles are very easy, others are more difficult. I did find it necessary to look for help online in a couple of incidents so far, but I did manage to solve most of the puzzles myself (up to where I am at the moment, can't say anything about the puzzles I haven't reached yet). All in all, this game is fun. If you like dungeon crawlers, get it. It might not be a masterpiece, but it is fun to play.			"

												I know many people loved it, but this is not my kind of game.I expected the combat to be a bit more tactical, but because its active it seems to mostly involve turn-and-circle strafing most enemies and DPSing them down while avoiding being hit.  This isn't what I expected from an RPG, even an active one.  Theres not much back-and-forth, HP is there to make up for the mistakes you make or if you encounter too many enemies to easily achieve hit and run tactics.  Or for if you fall afoul of a trap.  Theres not much in the way of resource management, and the best solution is to backtrack to full-heal savepoint crystals for even minor wounds because the only reason to expend consumable resources is in dire emergencies and never to cover normal mistakes.  Character progression (from what I remember researching) seemed prone to the trap of making a useless build.  Its been awhile, so I could be wrong here and dismiss this if I am.Speaking of traps, I really dont like the puzzle and trap mechanics in this game.  Some of the puzzles are fairly obtuse, which could be okay except that you can end up just wandering forever not seeing a switch on a wall or the like if you dont look up a guide.  This is just true of some genres, even ones I love like point and click adventures, but the solution basically spoils part of the game.  In P&C games the puzzles are tied to a story.  A lot of traps aren't great because they're kind of like being exposed to a jumpscare.  'Haha, got you!'  Sometimes you die, sometimes you backtrack to a save crystal because you took somewhere between 1 to 99% damage, sometimes you backtrack because the trap diverted you, etc.  A lot of it is just trial and error, some of it is gotchas, but it never really felt clever or fun to me.Story is also lacking from what I saw.  Your characters have no backstory and you occasionally receive cryptic telepathic messages about a mysterious person who knows the mysterious truth behing the mysterious dungeon you are trapped in.  I didnt get far enough to figure it out, but I assume its just a premise to tie the gameplay together.  That can be okay, but I just didnt personally enjoy the story.A lot of people liked the game, but do your research first.  I like RPGs and have played them all my life, but this one wasn't  for me.

												What shall i say? It feels (and plays) like the ""good old times""-dungeon crawlers, yet looks modern with more than decent graphics and models.

But only if you liked them old crawler or these things sound interesting to you if you don't know them at all:- building a party you'll never really see except their portraits (get the fat pack from nexusmods!)- wander around a dungeon room by room and not step by step (no free movement)- fighting monsters with a simple click or casting spells by recalling the patterns (from easy to less easy)- rest to heal/refresh mana- use the mouse to find possible switches or something on wall/grounds (point-and-click-adventure-like)- solving minor puzzles of switches/traps/whatnot- die and reload :-)I really liked it (so much that i just bought it on steam just to support the developers. Hence my few playtime). And I'm no hardcore old-schooler, i also love Skyrim :-)			"

												I am not sure why this game has received the critical acclaim it did, because aside from bringing back the long-dead (at the time) genre of tile-based dungeon crawling, the design, mechanics and gameplay are somewhat mediocre.It is effectively a point-and-click puzzler with combat - however, the creativity of puzzles is hurt by the game's limited mechanics, and the combat is shallow and a huge chore. Legend of Grimrock would please neither fans of adventure games nor fans of dungeon crawlers, unless they are desperate for anything in the genre.			"

												This is a great modern game that succeeds in giving players a old school dungeon crawler feel while still manages to be creative.The Good:1) ""With a 95% positive rating, its likely you will enjoy this game."" - Captain Obvious.2) Good Graphcis3) Good Music4) Good RPG experience5) Creative and smart puzzles/riddles. What's a good dungeon crawler game if it didn't have good dungeon designs?6) Old school mode. I never had a chance to unds how playing a game while having to draw my own map was like. No longer the case with this game.7) Extras. Above sound track and concept art, there's actually reading material and quite abit of lore builing. Love the world map and descriptions of each races etc.8) Good combat, a true test of gaming dexterity and skill. 8a) You will soon realise timing is crucial. If you timed your attacks well enough you can put enemies in a partial stun-lock. consider enemy recovery time and your characters' cooldown etc. Very fun to learn how to exploit this.8b) I'll say that the combat is clumsy in a good way. You have to draw complicated runes to cast powerful spells. Potions can only be used from inventory. Weapons must be changed in inventory and dragging the icon. Attacks will only be made by right clicking on the correct location where the images of your weapons are. Your archer will have to swap between crossbow+quarrel and bow+arrow (thats 2 item swaps which takes alot of time). You have to pay attention to enemies' attacks and movement and then move your party accordinly to dodge attacks. All of that and much more are all in real time. No pause of combat. Opening maps and inventory only makes you open to enemy attacks instead of pausing the whole game or combat. All these makes this game awesome.The Bad:1) Story suck.. I don't actually mind since good story are usually more of a bonus. But the most rememebered and talked about games are the ones with great story. So I find this more a pity than anything else.2) Replay value. Kinda low since any difference in a 2nd try would be too little to justify the trouble to have to do the entire adventure all over again... Toorum mode was interesting though.All in all, good game sold at a low price. You're totally losing out if you gave this game a miss.			"

												LoG is a grid style dungeon crawler that has revived the genre from its dying lineage from such games like 80's Dungeon Master.  This 13 floor, heavy puzzled, medium combat gameplay title does an excellent job at presenting new comers and old to the maze like dungeon of the Mountain of Grimrock.  Most of the puzzles work around pushing lose stones that protrude out from the walls and the combat style is of dancing around in a grid motion around the enemy.  There is no tank and spank strategy here unless playing on easy difficulty.The game will take 20+ hours to complete depending on whether or not you spend the time to do the puzzles and/or find all the missing treasures that can be used for achievements or just upgrading you characters with better equipment.  The graphics are well done and the animation is quite well too.  There is an unlockable character that you must find in the dungeon which will let you run a new game once found with all new traits that will be different compared to the games regular 4 person party you've played with.  If enjoyed this alone is great replay value that extends the life even further to this gem.Looking for a great grid style dungeon crawler look no further to The Legend of Grimrock!			"

												If you like games such as Kings Field, Stonekeep, etc. This game is for you. I was a little confused with the controls at first, but they are easy to get the hang of. I suggest making your own characters as that is fun in itself. The dungeon has many secrets hiding surprizes, and hidden rooms galore. You will have to look very carefully, and some puzzles may stump you. Combat involves strafeing, plus timing your attacks so you take the least amount of damage. There are blue crystals hidden on each floor that save your game, and heal diseased characters if you happen to get caught by a trap like i did my first time playing. In short, i do recommend this title.			"

												I usually don't like playing dungeon crawler games but this was different. This game is a great deal of fun and with a interesting twist of playing as four charaters, or one if you so choose. (It's REALLY hard though.) I really like how I never felt forced to have rogue or a mage in my party. Sure it's easier with a least one mage and very hard with no warriors, but you can still play it as you want. You're never locked out of a area if you don't have a rogue to unlock the way. As for the story its a little sparse compared to games like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, but there is enough of a story to get behind and a mystery to further pull you along. You up your own idea's to it if your the imaginive type. The Puzzles are a bit hard especially if you are running this on weak computer. (some of the puzzles are timed) Even so I would Highly recommend this game!			"

												This game was a lot of fun and provided a good amount of entertainment for my buck.  It reminded me of the old rpgs in flavor, like A Bard's Tale for the old Apple IIgs.  The combat was fairly easy once you figured it out, but puzzles still keep it intresting while limiting your movement during combat.  All and all worth picking up.			"

												Pure dungeon crawling goodness. This is not dragon age. It is repetitve, a bit on purpose since it's a dungeon crawling game.You begin your quest half-naked and you try to get out of this maze. Oh, and your torch burned out. Woops.It's dark and you hear something coming your way. So it's hack n slash everything, try to resolve some puzzles. Loot what you can.So far I did not see real role playing.I say if you are into ''classic'' dungeon crawling this is a must-play.  "

												★★★★☆Ah wow now talk about a good game,  I was not expecting this game to be this good, I have never played a game with this old retro PC game feel to it so it was a completely new experience to me. So without any nostalgia altering my perception of this game I can honestly say that this is an awesome game, the character types ,the secrets, the progression , it’s all done really well, and I would recommend this game to everyone out there , especially if they haven’t played a game with this gameplay style. Really good game, it allows you to import your own pictures for the portraits of the heroes thus making it a more fun experience, In my team I had Dark Blade (YuGiOh), a Tauren (From Warcraft), Dark Alchemist (From Torchlight 2) and a Argonian (From TES obviously) so I had a unique personal experience XD .Anyways enough talking, buy this game now ! good game , good games must be bought and played !4/5!

												Legend of Grimrock is best summarized in its manual: ""The game features dungeon exploration, puzzles, secrets, combat, magic and role playing elements.""The game's enjoyment comes from navigating the dungeon, avoiding traps, finding hidden switches and looting treasures. Combat is fairly simple, it consists of avoiding attacks by maneuvering around your adversaries, and the only tactical element is picking a place with enough room to do so (also being mindful of pits and other enemies cornering you). All in all combat is just another puzzle element in this game, the experience points and skills you earn a different form of reward.The game's overall difficulty is rather involved but lenient, it requires patience and attention to detail. There is a lot of diversity in puzzles, I've never come across two identical ones. They will test your memory, reflexes, and creativity, so you are bound to appreciate some of them while finding other tedious or unremarkable. Only in two instances did I get stuck. On the other hand the designers can be quite devious at times when it comes to traps, especially towards the end of the game. Some might find it frustrating, but I see it rather as playfulness and awareness of the exploits used in that genre of games.The game's visual and sound design, while polished, lacks diversity. Being quite lengthy (20-30 hours depending on difficulty/old school mode settings), but only comprised of two different kinds of environment (with a third on the tiny last two levels), the game can seem quite bleak after a while. The loot also becomes more scarce and less exciting, supplies more numerous, making it less rewarding to search for secrets. The lack of new enemies and puzzle elements adds to an overall fatigue building up until the two bottom floors. The final boss requires mobility and precision, also some ingenuity but most of all calm. It reinvigorated my enjoyment of the game, as the end fight was unexpectedly innovative.			"

												I wasn't really sure if this type of game would really be something I'd enjoy, but now that I've completed my first playthrough I can say I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The combat is well designed and varied, and it is simple enough for anyone to pick up, but there's still a surprising amount of depth to it as well. The puzzles were also very well done, never feeling illogical or unfair. However, they were still challenging enough that completing them always felt rewarding. Overall, Legend of Grimrock is a great game that takes an old formula not really seen in video games these days, and creates something unique from it.			"

												Every now and then there comes a game that tries to revisit genres that have fallen by the wayside as the video game industry continues to change and grow. Dungeon crawler games, for the most part, happen to be one of those genres. So when I first saw images for Legend of Grimrock I couldn’t help but be excited.When I was a kid I spent a lot of time playing the old dungeon crawler games. I still vividly remember such titles as Dungeon Master and Dungeon Master II: The Legend of Skullkeep. Given how much time I spent playing those games, and loving every minute of it, I was hoping that this new game would live up to the games in whose footsteps it was following.I’ll tell you right now, I have not been disappointed.Legend of Grimrock is everything it is supposed to be. It is an old-style dungeon crawler modernized for today’s gaming world. While such a game can be limited in terms of graphics and art style, Almost Human, the indie developer behind the title, has executed it perfectly. The game looks great and the various creatures’ appearances are fantastic given the limits of the genre.Read the rest of my review at Press2Reset: http://press2reset.com/reviews/review-legend-of-grimrock/ "

												This is a great tribute to the first person RPG's of yesteryear, such as Dungeon Master and the Eye of the Beholder series.  Combat is difficult, and requires careful maneuvering as well as the right builds for your characters.  Some of the puzzles are fiendishly difficult, but all of them are fair, and I only had to go searching for solutions a couple of times on my first play through.Graphically, the game does what it sets out to do very well, though the tile sets and enemy types are all limited.  Even so, the look of the game, combined with what turns out to be a surprisingly good sound track add to the intense atmosphere of the whole experience.  The whole thing gives off an almost 'survival horror meets fantasy rpg' hybrid, and one that I greatly enjoyed.  I recommend it highly.			"

Younger players might be disappointed in the gameplay mechanics so know what you are buying.  Great game, great puzzles, and great nostalgia.*Update* completed the game.  Seriously hardcore stuff and very unforgiving.  Due to a lack of time and sometimes general frustration with certain puzzles, I supplemented with a walk through.  Without the walkthrough, this game would had taken me months like I did with dungeon master or quit entirely.  Overall, very enjoyable.  Well done.			"

The reason I stopped playing this though is I needed to place certain items in the walls at certain areas and I left the right ones somewhere else because I wasn't going to use them. Because of this reason I would horde items. You shouldn't get bored with this game when you play it. P.S. Keep an eye out for those secrets.			"

												This game is great! It is a spiritual sequel to the old game Dungeon Master from the 80s, but with modern graphics and updates like better AI and an automap. If you like dungeon crawls, get it. You wont be disappointed.Its a dungeon crawl like Eye of the Beholder. Graphics are very nice with the traditional square tunnels and chains hanging on the walls, moss ect. Theres alos the occasioanl cool statue or art on the walls as well. Step, turn, strafe and so forth. The puzzles ramp up in difficulty nicely. They are the typical find keys, secret buttons, pull levers in order, run quickly, and so forth. But defintely not stale. Theres also some interesting and unique ones too.  Combat is heavily reliant on the step dance just to survive, a feature I'm not too thrilled about. Unless youre a minmaxer, going toe to toe with an enemy of the appropriate level (on Normal) is not recommended. Youre going to be freezing the enemy and/or dancing all over the place if you want to stay alive. The enemies hit hard. I would say that this is the games major flaw, as I'm way more of a fan of toe to toe melee than swinging and running all over the place till the enemy dies. Its too bad cuz the AI is nice for a square based dungeon crawler. The enemies will actually try and sneak up on you.DMs levelling system was better too. In LoG, theres 4 races and 3 classes. Minotaur, human, lizardman, and insectoid, and mage, rogue and fighter. Once you pick, you're that class. Fighters cant learn magic, and mages cant fight (or seem to do much of anything). And you get XP, just like typical RPGs. Contrast that with DMs ""practice a skill and level in that class"" style and it just seems...lesser. Also, the game really lends itself to specialization. Pick 1 weapon, 1 magic school. Jack of all trading as far as class skills seems to really hurt in the late game. The sounds and music are nice, typically dungeon-y without being too intrusive. There really isnt too much of a plot in the main game, but thats not why you're here. You're here for the awesome exploration, wondering whats around the corner and seeing if your condemned prisoners will ever win their freedom.All in all a great game and definitely worth picking up for any dungeon/RPG fan. Theres a custom dungeon I have, not sure if I d/led it or it was installed in a patch. Its really great. Uses the same assets, but theres a lot added. For instance, theres way more story. Your character actually speaks to his/her self and when you find more party members, you can chat with them. And you only design one char, picking from the 4 races, but also 4 classes, each with 4 subclasses all slightly different.			"

Reminded me of Portal but with a D&D twist.+Graphics, dungeons, and monsters all look great.+3 classes to choose from (Fighter/Mage/Rogue), each with different skills+Create your own party of 4 characters, even import portraits if you like (takes a little know-how)+A decent variety of skill choices and couple weapon choices per class, with adaptability through leveling+Story and puzzle elements blend together well, some challenging puzzles+Unique spellcasting system using runes like a combination lock+Lots of secrets to uncover and feel rewarded with both equipment and achievements+Probably the most impressive part is that it comes with a dungeon editor - play others' or make your own!-Few default portrait choices for characters-No animations or models for your characters themselves, no voiced dialogue-No cross-classing for any skills/abilities-No shops or salvage system makes looting feel pointless/lackluster at times-Availability of some items unnecessarily punishes some skill choices-Spell system can become more of a chore in combat as the game goes on			"

												The first levels are thrilling. It was my childhood's ""Eye of the Beholder"" all over again, oh boy! Then the flaws started to creep out. First, as you progress you'll find out that dancing around is a necessity to survive battles. No matter how good your builds are, you characters just can't take hits. That's so hugely silly. Just picture that party of four misfits madly sidestepping around.Which brings us to the stats system. Some attributes' effects are nonsensical and unbalanced. As a result, optimal builds are ridiculous. End game heavy armor on a minotaur will never equal in survivability to puny rogue with evade investement. Heavy axes never equal the devastating power of thrown weapons on a minotaur with nil investment in dexterity.Lastly, the puzzles are obtuse, arbitrary and frustrating.I don't really understand all the glowing reviews. I'm still hoping to find a good old enjoyable dungeon crawler.			"

O boss final é o único monstro que deixa a desejar, realmente esse inimigo fora feito com preguiça, mas o resto dos monstros são impecáveis, os itens também são impecáveis. Dependendo do modo de jogo em media o jogo dura 20 a 30 horas, caso você explore,caso você não explore duvido que você zere.

												If I could describe Legend of Grimrock in one word, it would be grueling. Yet this isn't necessarily a negative. This a constant trek through a single dungeon, with little respite or change in scenery. You constantly have to worry about health, energy and food while fighting enemies, evading traps and solving puzzles. But it feels rewarding in a way. You really need to pay attention and work out scenarios to go foward. Though an obstacle may seem impossible at first: an unbeatable enemy encounter or an unsolvable puzzle, all you gotta do is step back, prepare and use quick wits to get past it. Time and time again you'll pull through in the search of the next floor or secret loot. The controls are a little awkward at first, especially the rune-based magic system, but I feel it's part of the charm. The combat is simple, but requires you to be quick and composed while paying attention to enemy patterns. The puzzles do a lot with very little, simple switches and floor pads are used to create some clever riddles without delving into Myst or La-Mulana tier arcanery. The biggest drawback would be the low production values, due to the small developer. There are only 3 tilesets for the dungeon, one of which you barely see. The main menu theme is great, but the actual game has mostly one ambient track, which is effective for building atmosphere but can get tiring after awhile. Overall, LoG is a great game for those wanting a tribute to the old school dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder, or anyone wanting a somewhat challenging change of pace.			"

They are wonderful games into this genre with so many secrets to find, loot to gather, treasure to take and enemies to fight. Honestly, I'm tempted to add the ""Horror"" tag to it for how much it made me nearly crap my pants when I turned a corner and an enemy jumped at me. But yeah I fully recommend this and the sequel.

												Very good for classic gamers. If you ever played Eye of the Beholder or Lands of Lore, you'll feel right at home. :)The premise is similar: here, you have a grid-based first person RPG with real time battles. You control 4 characters, 2 in the front row and 2 in the back, and explore a huge dungeon full of monsters and puzzles. Its VERY similar to the first Eye of the Beholder, but with a better interface and an automap feature (that can be disabled, if you feel like it).The graphics are great, the enemies are varied and the challenge is quite high. And the puzzles... Ahh, those can range from ""I had to think a little"" to ""WHAT THE HELL DO I DO HERE?!?!"". And believe-me: they are FUN, and give a feeling of accomplishment when you finally solve them. The sound effects are great, with realistic ambient effects that give a nice scary mood to the dungeon crawling. The only issue I have is that the game doesn't have music. But thats not a BIG issue (EoB  also didn't have music. ;) ).Anyway, this is one amazing game. Can be frustrating if you don't like puzzles too much, and the battle system can become repetitive after a few hours. But hey, its an amazing game that can take more than 20 hours to beat, and you can even download usermade dungeons to make the playtime even longer.This game is very recommended. ^^			"

												Classic D&D squares! Heavy class based characters! Dice rolling!LoG is basically D&D on screen. You move according to the squares on the floor, so basically in only predetermined steps. Enemies will also move the same as you. Game tends to be puzzle heavy. Every puzzle, is aquainted with a scroll giving a hint towards solving it. You attack by clicking on your character's weapons and continue moving forward. You will have to maintain spells, items, weapons so on and so forth. No actual game bosses just the end game stuff (WHICH IS HILARIOUS AND AWESOME)Too bad there's no New Game Plus to restart your old characters, but you can reuse them on community created maps. Uses Steam Workshop. Music is outstanding. Would kill aga... err play again.			"

												No surprises here.  This is a classic dungeon crawl with some modern touches to it and a hell of a lot less typing.  In the vein of some really old-school games like Bard's Tale, Wizardry, and even Ultima Undeworld, this is an 80s-style RPG.Thankfully, the devs were kind enough to provide an auto-mapping system, but if you want to go hardcore, they've allowed you to do that, too (bust out some grid paper).  Lots of secrets to find, some brutal difficulty at times, and some fun but none-too-hard puzzles will challenge you as you attempt to escape the dungeon.  Oh, and it's loaded with monsters.			"

This is one of those games that make me wonder if i would enjoy D&D because although its simplified, it pretty much has the hallmarks of a on-paper western RPG. Interesting and fun, you will eagerly anticipate each new puzzle or secret as you traverse deep into the bowels of a maze-like fortress.			"

A Paladin’s Review: Legend of Grimrock: Fun Old School Dungeon Crawling With A Creepy AtmosphereGenre: 1st Person Old School Dungeon Crawling RPG. Developed and Published by: Almost Human GamesPlatform: Windows, MacOSX and LinuxBusiness Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsLegend of Grimrock (LoG) is a RPG dungeon crawling adventure. It mixes old-school dungeon crawling with modern graphics and design. It focuses on survival and puzzle solving with some combat. Combat and travel is executed on a grid-based system. You and the enemies move forwards, backwards and sides in squares, an old-school throwback.The StoryThe game takes place in a world known only as The Northern Realms. You play as a group of four prisoners of varying races. These four prisoners have been sentenced for their crimes against the King by ""The Court"". Your sentence is to be thrown into the pit at the top of Mount Grimrock and once at the bottom of the pit, you'll be pardoned of your crimes. The only problem is, no one has survived the depths of Mount Grimrock. Can you survive past the creatures, traps and challenges before you? Well, your going to find out soon enough. Your mission is to do just that. You have to find out a way out of the place. Solve the puzzles, unlock the mysteries of Grimrock and survive. You're also being talked to in your dreams by someone...or something. The story is mostly told in dream sequences and scrolls left lying around in the dungeons. From these scrolls, you'll get clues to what's going on in the depths of Mount Grimrock as well as vague hints about the outside world.Combat and PuzzlesLoG features combat, puzzle & riddle solving, RPG elements and exploration. Combat is tile based and in real time. Since it has this tile movement, your enemies must be directly facing you to attack. They're unable to attack at a diagonal from you. The combat system is a bit quirky and wonky. It takes quite a bit of practice to get used to fighting on what is essentially squares and being able to only face four directions. Not only that, it's in real-time, so creatures may come out of no where and take you by surprise. For the most part, the combat doesn't have a lot of depth but it's surprisingly enjoyable. Since you can't take too many direct hits from enemies, as they hit like a truck, most of the time will be spent sidestepping around enemies and poking them to death with spells and weapon swipes. This also means that getting caught in a surrounded by creatures will lead to a quick death. This can be a frustrating part of the game and it can happen almost too many times for comfort. However, it usually felt like I had gotten myself in that bad situation, not the game. So, you need to be very self-aware of your surroundings and survive as best you can. Fortunately, there's a finite amount of creatures on every level. Once you kill them all, you're given free reign to walk around and explore the level on your own terms. Still, I will say that the combat system stands on a razor's edge. At times it can be far too easy and others it can be far too frustrating. This is the type of system that if it strays just a little, will cease to be enjoyable. There's also has a variety of different puzzles and riddles you must solve to not only advance but to find hidden secrets. Switches, levers, camouflaged buttons, defeating the right enemies or finding keys are all items used to impede your forward progress. Still, figuring it out is what I enjoy most about LoG. Even if it is tempting to use the Internet or Steam guides to solve a particularly tricky puzzle. (Which I did do that a couple of times. I know, I know). LoG definitely shines when it's about puzzles and less so when you're in combat. So, if you aren't a fan of puzzles, then you might not enjoy LoG that much. VisualsThis game is a looker. Everything has a fidelity and crispness that you wouldn't expect out of such an indie project. The creature designs and animations are very well done. It was impressive how lifelike some of the attacking creatures looked when they attacked. Even if a lot of the animations are reused, I still think of these creatures being real, of having substance. The lighting system in this game is excellent, with shadows playing lifelike over the walls and creatures as you move about. It all sells the experience of being in a dark, underground dungeon.Audio and AtmosphereWhile LoG has an awesome intro menu song that pumps you up for action, there isn't any music in the game itself. Instead, the game has whistling, quiet winds and other sound elements that sell the atmosphere of LoG. This sense that you're in an underground dungeon that is out to kill you. That every step forward is both a step towards ultimate freedom and possible death. Just to really sink it in, they let you hear the footsteps of potential enemies nearby. As though at any time, they might pop out of the wall and split you in two. But you wanna know the best part? There are some enemies that stand perfectly still until it's much too late. Think on that for a while.PC Settings and MoreLoG comes with all the graphics, audio and keybinding settings you'll need. Resolution options are plentiful and it can display in fullscreen, windowed borderless and windowed. V-sync has a enabled/disabled setting. Texture resolution, filtering, shadow quality and SSAO quality have low-medium-high sliders. There's also separate audio sliders with mute options. Autosave can be turned on/off with other minor settings included as well. Keyboard controls can be completely configured if needed. You can also enable a touchscreen/tablet mode which is pretty neat. There is no FOV slider and this is probably intentional for game balance. I can't say for certain if the FoV is fine or not but I think the grid-based movement will prevent any motion sickness from becoming an issue. It should be noted that Steam cloud isn't enabled for LoG. Final ThoughtsI really enjoyed exploring through the depths of Mount Grimrock. The creepy atmosphere is ever present as you crawl through empty halls expecting danger to popout at any second. The combat is pretty good as well but it can easily tip towards too easy or too frustrating. Legend of Grimrock was an unexpected treat and pleasure for me to play through. It isn't often that I find a game that just clicks with me like this one did. While a few of the puzzles were a bit of a hair-pullers, some of the riddles moreso, I didn't feel like they were too opaque or difficult to figure out. Though it's really tempting to just use the internet or Steam guides to get all the answers. Even so, there's 20 hours of content to enjoy.

												You get more than you'd expect, especially for a game that's under $15.  The world designed well, the leveling simple yet unforgiving, and the option for a ""hard"" and/or ""old school"" mode make the game all the more challenging.  Completing the levels is very satisfying, but don't dawdle in a level too long for food is scarce on the lower bowels of the dungeon.			"

												Fun and very addicting. A good mix of puzzle/trap and monster battles. The only trouble I see is that once you have completed the Grimrock dungeon and found all the secrets and treasures, there is not much of a point to playing it again, other than to test different character builds. However, with a free map editor now released, there is already no end of user-created content to test, which I can only hope will live up to the legend that is Mount Grimrock.			"

												LoG harkens back to classic turn/grid based Dungeon Crawlers with both superb graphics, gameplay and even freelook.  Don't be fooled by the trailer and teaser videos though.  You can play through the game at that speed but you will almost definitely get killed if you try to rush through it.  Take your time and don't charge head-first into enemies.  Watch out for traps...and use them to your advantage too!  Enemies will trigger spikes and trapdoors as well.If you're a fan of old school dungeon crawlers, it's definitely worth the price but if you can, get it during a sale or watch out for game bundles featuring LoG.

												Fun, old-school dungeon crawl in the style of Eye of the Beholder.  Despite the fact that it gives you options to play on 'Normal' or 'Hard', I'm finding that 'Normal' is quite challenging enough!For difficult encounters, I suggest kiting. In LoG, that means running away while throwing stuff (including spells). Torches can be thrown if you run out of more pointy things.Rest often. Food seems to be pretty plentiful, and it seems that actions (like fighting and exploring) make you more hungry than resting.			"

												I started Legend of Grimrock 'cause it was on a friends pc and he hadn't tried it. I finished Grimrock because the game balances action and puzzle in the grid based movement style of older rpgs. This is a game that can be very easy and yet also rather difficult.The plot is that you and your colleagues are tossed into a dungeon for crimes unknown with a simple objective: escape and be free. As you go deeper however the true purpose of the building becomes a growing mystery. Through puzzles, traps and battles you must reach your objective at the bottom of the dungeon where lies your escape and possibly some answers.The game uses a tile based movement system where you and your group of four move in real time but only in the four cardinal directions. You control each of your party individualy, managing each of their separate inventories, attacking with each in their own time and chosing what spells (if any ) they will cast.I enjoyed this game, but I don't believe it is for everyone. Though I think the grid system worked well in the claustrophobic enviroment, many may not like the idea of not having full three dimensional movement. The game also ramps up in challenge rather quickly and can be unforgiving, especially if you dont save frequently. The challenge motivated me but it may turn others off. Others may not like the fact that many of the secrets are almost invisable or will require a few trips to the wiki to get but I found them fun to guess at.			"

They are wonderful games into this genre with so many secrets to find, loot to gather, treasure to take and enemies to fight. Honestly, I'm tempted to add the ""Horror"" tag to it for how much it made me nearly crap my pants when I turned a corner and an enemy jumped at me. But yeah I fully recommend this and the sequel. It gives me that itch to play it when I stop and in my books that makes it a great game			"

Its the type of game you usually try to avoid because it somewhat seems impossible but in the end when you finished through it, you are even more happy and at the same time sad it had to end. I wouldve loved something in this manner but randomized so that every playthrough follows a different path and maybe even outside of dungeons and in snow caves or whatever.

												An excellent old-schoolish dungeon crawler that manages to capture the excellent atmosphere and spirit of such games as Eye of the Beholder, Stonekeep etc. The game looks neat and offers a good bunch of puzzles, some of which are even quite tricky.			"

												8/10Fans of oldschool dungeon crawler games will most probably love Legend of Grimrock, as it is an extremely well done dungeon crawler game.While the game only has 3 classes, the different choices in skills make it possible to have multiple builds for each class - thus, there are multiple choices for how to build each of your 4 characters.Combat is specially good in this game because, although the party can stand still and fight one monster, movement can be used to an advantage and, sometimes, it must be used, which adds to the level of challenge of the game. Managing items - weight, ammount and which items are or will be useful or not - is also a challenge by itself.Multiple secrets in each level - and also in the game itself - add a LOT to the game.The game, however, lacks in variety, both in items and enemies. There's little variation between equipment beyond their base values, with a few exceptions of weapons with special effects, and enemies repeat a lot throughout the levels.Leveling up is also somewhat limited - I had the impression that I could get to the end of the game having one character max one skill while also keeping one or two other skills at somewhat decent levels, but I couldn't. And, many times, focusing entirely in one skill is not as good as it seems.The biggest issue I had with the game was the last fight, mostly because it seemed badly designed to me. It's hard to explain without spoiling the fight, but I think people who have finished the game might understand why.Despite its downsides, it's still an amazing game - and the level editor also adds a lot to the game, with some really interesting potential from the player-created levels I've seen.

												Do you like grid based dungeon crawelers? The ones where you and your enemies move square by square and do the  sword dance in a 2x2 around each other? Then get this game and its sequel. They are wonderful games into this genre with so many secrets to find, loot to gather, treasure to take and enemies to fight. Honestly, I'm tempted to add the ""Horror"" tag to it for how much it made me nearly crap my pants when I turned a corner and an enemy jumped at me. But yeah I fully recommend this and the sequel. It gives me that itch to play it when I stop and in my books that makes it a great game			"

												Fun and very addicting. A good mix of puzzle/trap and monster battles. The only trouble I see is that once you have completed the Grimrock dungeon and found all the secrets and treasures, there is not much of a point to playing it again, other than to test different character builds. However, with a free map editor now released, there is already no end of user-created content to test, which I can only hope will live up to the legend that is Mount Grimrock.			"

A Paladin’s Review: Legend of Grimrock: Fun Old School Dungeon Crawling With A Creepy AtmosphereGenre: 1st Person Old School Dungeon Crawling RPG. Developed and Published by: Almost Human GamesPlatform: Windows, MacOSX and LinuxBusiness Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsLegend of Grimrock (LoG) is a RPG dungeon crawling adventure. It mixes old-school dungeon crawling with modern graphics and design. It focuses on survival and puzzle solving with some combat. Combat and travel is executed on a grid-based system. You and the enemies move forwards, backwards and sides in squares, an old-school throwback.The StoryThe game takes place in a world known only as The Northern Realms. You play as a group of four prisoners of varying races. These four prisoners have been sentenced for their crimes against the King by ""The Court"". Your sentence is to be thrown into the pit at the top of Mount Grimrock and once at the bottom of the pit, you'll be pardoned of your crimes. The only problem is, no one has survived the depths of Mount Grimrock. Can you survive past the creatures, traps and challenges before you? Well, your going to find out soon enough. Your mission is to do just that. You have to find out a way out of the place. Solve the puzzles, unlock the mysteries of Grimrock and survive. You're also being talked to in your dreams by someone...or something. The story is mostly told in dream sequences and scrolls left lying around in the dungeons. From these scrolls, you'll get clues to what's going on in the depths of Mount Grimrock as well as vague hints about the outside world.Combat and PuzzlesLoG features combat, puzzle & riddle solving, RPG elements and exploration. Combat is tile based and in real time. Since it has this tile movement, your enemies must be directly facing you to attack. They're unable to attack at a diagonal from you. The combat system is a bit quirky and wonky. It takes quite a bit of practice to get used to fighting on what is essentially squares and being able to only face four directions. Not only that, it's in real-time, so creatures may come out of no where and take you by surprise. For the most part, the combat doesn't have a lot of depth but it's surprisingly enjoyable. Since you can't take too many direct hits from enemies, as they hit like a truck, most of the time will be spent sidestepping around enemies and poking them to death with spells and weapon swipes. This also means that getting caught in a surrounded by creatures will lead to a quick death. This can be a frustrating part of the game and it can happen almost too many times for comfort. However, it usually felt like I had gotten myself in that bad situation, not the game. So, you need to be very self-aware of your surroundings and survive as best you can. Fortunately, there's a finite amount of creatures on every level. Once you kill them all, you're given free reign to walk around and explore the level on your own terms. Still, I will say that the combat system stands on a razor's edge. At times it can be far too easy and others it can be far too frustrating. This is the type of system that if it strays just a little, will cease to be enjoyable. There's also has a variety of different puzzles and riddles you must solve to not only advance but to find hidden secrets. Switches, levers, camouflaged buttons, defeating the right enemies or finding keys are all items used to impede your forward progress. Still, figuring it out is what I enjoy most about LoG. Even if it is tempting to use the Internet or Steam guides to solve a particularly tricky puzzle. (Which I did do that a couple of times. I know, I know). LoG definitely shines when it's about puzzles and less so when you're in combat. So, if you aren't a fan of puzzles, then you might not enjoy LoG that much. VisualsThis game is a looker. Everything has a fidelity and crispness that you wouldn't expect out of such an indie project. The creature designs and animations are very well done. It was impressive how lifelike some of the attacking creatures looked when they attacked. Even if a lot of the animations are reused, I still think of these creatures being real, of having substance. The lighting system in this game is excellent, with shadows playing lifelike over the walls and creatures as you move about. It all sells the experience of being in a dark, underground dungeon.Audio and AtmosphereWhile LoG has an awesome intro menu song that pumps you up for action, there isn't any music in the game itself. Instead, the game has whistling, quiet winds and other sound elements that sell the atmosphere of LoG. This sense that you're in an underground dungeon that is out to kill you. That every step forward is both a step towards ultimate freedom and possible death. Just to really sink it in, they let you hear the footsteps of potential enemies nearby. As though at any time, they might pop out of the wall and split you in two. But you wanna know the best part? There are some enemies that stand perfectly still until it's much too late. Think on that for a while.PC Settings and MoreLoG comes with all the graphics, audio and keybinding settings you'll need. Resolution options are plentiful and it can display in fullscreen, windowed borderless and windowed. V-sync has a enabled/disabled setting. Texture resolution, filtering, shadow quality and SSAO quality have low-medium-high sliders. There's also separate audio sliders with mute options. Autosave can be turned on/off with other minor settings included as well. Keyboard controls can be completely configured if needed. You can also enable a touchscreen/tablet mode which is pretty neat. There is no FOV slider and this is probably intentional for game balance. I can't say for certain if the FoV is fine or not but I think the grid-based movement will prevent any motion sickness from becoming an issue. It should be noted that Steam cloud isn't enabled for LoG. Final ThoughtsI really enjoyed exploring through the depths of Mount Grimrock. The creepy atmosphere is ever present as you crawl through empty halls expecting danger to popout at any second. The combat is pretty good as well but it can easily tip towards too easy or too frustrating. Legend of Grimrock was an unexpected treat and pleasure for me to play through. It isn't often that I find a game that just clicks with me like this one did. While a few of the puzzles were a bit of a hair-pullers, some of the riddles moreso, I didn't feel like they were too opaque or difficult to figure out. Though it's really tempting to just use the internet or Steam guides to get all the answers. Even so, there's 20 hours of content to enjoy.

												What a fun little game this is! It is a very lightweight game which offers a surprising amount of dungeon crawling enjoyment! I think it's beauty lies in it's simplicity - it's basically just a 2D grid environment with 3D perspective graphics. Your party of 4 adventurers take up one tile and can only move one tile at a time either north, south, east or west. Combat is basically hack n slash but there is quite a bit of timing involved and strategy with how you use your 2 'front row' characters who can melee directly as opposed to the 2 'back row' characters who can either use ranged attacks/magic or perks to do melee attacks from afar. But sometimes you might find yourself cornered where monsters surround you and take big bites out of your typically soft back row guys. There are alot of interesting puzzles some of which can drive you mad trying to figure them out! I really also like how food plays into the game (your guys need to eat!) and how items are very scarce.			"

												Legend of Grimrock is well crafted and attractive RPG that uses retro style gameplay system putting the player in control of a four character party. Some may find the keypad based navigation to be a chore, but older gamers may recognize the old school sensibilities present in the choice. The game plays like an HD version of an original Might and Magic, which is great for nostalgic gamers and newcomers alike. Although the game does not have all the bells and whistles of a AAA title, at its' core is a solidly built, well thought out game that offers the player hours of strategic fun. The Steam Overlay and widescreen are supported, but unfortunately it is not controller enabled. If you are looking for an RPG title that focuses more on strateguc team building and puzzle solving over click based action, Legend of Grimrock is a great buy.			"

												There is a significant amount of customization available for your squad, but not to an extent where it turns you away. The combat is fast paced and hectic, more than 1 monster can quickly surround you (then proceed to destroy you) if you aren't careful.This game feeds my inner min/maxer, but also gorges the curious puzzle-solver inside. There are many secrets hidden around, and fairly difficult puzzles have to be solved to progress forward.This is an exceptional game.			"

												I didn't know what to expect from this game, I only knew it belonged to a genre that diverges from what I usually play, but a few minutes in and I was in love with it. The secrets, the combat, the atmosphere, it sucked me in and I just had to complete it, and so I did. I'll share my experience now. About it's mechanics, you control a party of 4 characters. You're able customize their race, class, attributes and set custom portraits, I myself made an epic party with my closest friends. The battle formation is a square, so 2 characters lead and the others stay in the back, this encouraged me to balance my party members with melee or ranged attacks. The combat happens in real time and you can only move in tiles, each character have two available slots that you can place weapons, potions or other items into, you click these slots to perform actions, ones that depending on your char skills may ""cool-down"" faster. ( One of my chars had max level sword ability, so he could strike twice as fast ). I enjoyed the combat A LOT, and after a while getting used to, you'll be predicting enemies actions and flanking them. Just be careful not to end up cornered, I can still.. hear.. their.. screams.. *arghhhhhh*. There are potions to be crafted, magic to be discovered, secret areas which may grant you powerful unique weapons or a headache in case you didn't save often. Puzzles are well crafted, I didn't feel the need to ""google"" my way trough the game, though one or two times I was stuck searching for a solution. The graphics are Okay considering you spend all your game time inside of a dungeon, there will be variety as of three or four ambient styles for about 10 levels and another metal based theme at the end game. It does a good job making you believe that you're really trapped inside a place and there is no way out, they nailed atmosphere! Sound is of good quality as well. I don't have anything bad to say about this game, honestly. The dungeon's ambiance may get repetitive for some people, or the combat may be hard to get used to, but I enjoyed the whole game since each level is clever and has it's own set of characteristics, puzzles, etc... Can't wait to play the second game now! tl;dr+ Puzzles and more puzzles+ Replay value ( try new builds or custom maps! )+ Length, not too long, not too short+ Nostalgia aspect for some people- Managing consumable items during combat can be a painfull thing			"

												This is a first-person RPG in the style of Eye of the Beholder.  The plot is simple but appropriately so.  You are four convicts who have been exiled to Mount Grimrock.  You receive a pardon upon being exiled because nobody makes it down and out of the mountain.  Ever.  This game is an epic dungeon crawl and it knows it.  You need to find light sources or you will die.  You need to find food or you will die.  You need to manage your inventory and weight loads or, yes, you will die.  The game is pretty tough on the normal difficulty and you can ramp it up with a hard mode as well as an old-school mode where you must create your own maps out-of-game.  The itemization, art direction, and music all contribute to an ambiance that other games from top-tier studios would be wise to emulate.  It is not without its flaws.  The combat system is rather clunky and the grid-layout of the game allows many enenmies killed through mechanical exploitation.  The real difficulty is in the carefully crafted puzzles that push the limitations of the grid-based system to new levels of awesome and often require precision movement and perfect timing.  This game goes on sale often but it is worth it at full price.			"

												People who remember Dungeon Master I / II, Black Crypt, Lands of Lore will enjoy this game for its nostalgic value as well as being a fun game on it's own.  People who've never played those old school games will still like this game for being different, fun, and not always easy.  Puzzles don't all have obvious solutions, enemies don't always fall so quickly, and a simple hole in the floor can put you in worse trouble than the trouble you were running from - or lead to better armor.  Party member options are somewhat limited, choosing skills when leveling up can make things either easier or more difficult for you, and food and torches become precious.  But this all enhances the challenge of the game, there are even modes that don't automap for you and make enemies harder to kill.  Even the instructions won't tell you everything, you have to learn how to find secrets on your own.  But don't worry, you can still save anytime, unless you'd rather limit yourself to the use of saving stones.			"

												This is a first-person RPG in the style of Eye of the Beholder.  The plot is simple but appropriately so.  You are four convicts who have been exiled to Mount Grimrock.  You receive a pardon upon being exiled because nobody makes it down and out of the mountain.  Ever.  This game is an epic dungeon crawl and it knows it.  You need to find light sources or you will die.  You need to find food or you will die.  You need to manage your inventory and weight loads or, yes, you will die.  The game is pretty tough on the normal difficulty and you can ramp it up with a hard mode as well as an old-school mode where you must create your own maps out-of-game.  The itemization, art direction, and music all contribute to an ambiance that other games from top-tier studios would be wise to emulate.  It is not without its flaws.  The combat system is rather clunky and the grid-layout of the game allows many enenmies killed through mechanical exploitation.  The real difficulty is in the carefully crafted puzzles that push the limitations of the grid-based system to new levels of awesome and often require precision movement and perfect timing.  This game goes on sale often but it is worth it at full price.			"

												People who remember Dungeon Master I / II, Black Crypt, Lands of Lore will enjoy this game for its nostalgic value as well as being a fun game on it's own.  People who've never played those old school games will still like this game for being different, fun, and not always easy.  Puzzles don't all have obvious solutions, enemies don't always fall so quickly, and a simple hole in the floor can put you in worse trouble than the trouble you were running from - or lead to better armor.  Party member options are somewhat limited, choosing skills when leveling up can make things either easier or more difficult for you, and food and torches become precious.  But this all enhances the challenge of the game, there are even modes that don't automap for you and make enemies harder to kill.  Even the instructions won't tell you everything, you have to learn how to find secrets on your own.  But don't worry, you can still save anytime, unless you'd rather limit yourself to the use of saving stones.			"

												THESE GAMES ARE AMAZINGwhen i was a kid, i was a huge fan of dungeon crawlers. and for the past 10 years i have never found a good dungeon crawler the was like the old classic ones. yes i had diablo, but i wouldnt call that a dungeon crawler. i would call that a dungeon raider cuz in that game you usualy raid dungeons. im talking about grid movement style ones. i couldnt run the old ones on ym pc for some weird reason and i have a pretty good pc. i found out about this game through pro jared and baught both games instantly and i feel i mad a great choice. these games are exacaly what i wanted with1. classic gameplay that feels like the old dungeon crawlers 2. have old options like having the option to have no map so u have to use grid paper so you have a HUGE challenge and makes you feel more in the game actuallly marking and recordin things that u find (but u can turn on the ingame map)3. being able to MAKE YOUR OWN DUNGEONS4. being able to download other dungeons made by fans5. a great modding comunity 6. being able to make your own gameplay items, weapons and enimies (but u cant make them in the actual game but u can make dungeons in the game with the dungeon editor that comes with both games)7. classic party set up like being able to change the postion of your heros and manage their inv while doing anything like in combat you need to switch weapons well you can 8. great and challenging dungeon crawler puzzles that feel like your actually using your smarts to figure them out (especially late in game) and much much moreif your a fan of those classic dungeon crawlers or want to get into themor your just a fan of rpg's then theses are the games that are made for you10/10			"

												LoG harkens back to classic turn/grid based Dungeon Crawlers with both superb graphics, gameplay and even freelook.  Don't be fooled by the trailer and teaser videos though.  You can play through the game at that speed but you will almost definitely get killed if you try to rush through it.  Take your time and don't charge head-first into enemies.  Watch out for traps...and use them to your advantage too!  Enemies will trigger spikes and trapdoors as well.If you're a fan of old school dungeon crawlers, it's definitely worth the price but if you can, get it during a sale or watch out for game bundles featuring LoG.

 Legend of Grimrock My first Dungeon Crawler I've ever played and I have to admit it makes much more fun as I've thought while I saw a little part of a Let's Play. GamePlay: The Game is in 3D but you can only move ion tiles and turn 90° around. (except for the free mouse view)Move: w,a,s,d as you know it from the most games.q,e for turning 90° left or right.Your party is made out of 4 individual made Characters.2 Front Row - advantage: Melee attacks reach the enemies; disadvantage: Take the hits of front attacks.2 Back Row - advantage: Save for front attacks, may get hits from back or side attacks; disadvantage: cannot reach the enemy with melee weapons. (Of course there are some exceptions)You can choose between different breeds which have their own benefits and these players can be signed as: Mage, Warrior, Rogue - to gain skills of their speciality.★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Graphics: Looks in my opinion fairly nice. No complain!★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Story: hmmm... Not really an impressive story. Get thrown into a Mountain and you have to escape...The helping ""thing"" in the dreams and all the notes of toorum makes it a bit more interesting.★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ Leveldesign: It is impressive to see that they got 71 secrets on 13 different Levels. I didn't get even 50 at my first playthrough. As I said, Impressive work. Nice riddles...★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Music: Well... the theme Music at the Menu is amazing. <3 But the whole game has no other soundtrack, at least no soundtrack I've heard... Not even the Boss has one and that was a bit disappointing. Still 4 Stars for that amazing Menu Music!★ ★ ★ ★ ☆All in one it was a bunch of fun I had with this Game, even it was sometimes pretty unfair. :<Well... Doesn't matter. This deserven a ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ rating from me. Well done!			"

												Recently, I've played a bunch of puzzles games and a good friend told me to play Grimrock because of the puzzles... But to me, it was mostly the gameplay that I really liked about this one. I really loved fighting in this game. It started so slow. I wasn't even sure I was liking it at first, but after an hour or so. Bam. I was in. I was in it for good. Nothing else really interested me. All I wanted was to level up, gain abilities, gear my characters, kill more stuff, walk further, discover more secrets, and of course get confused by the puzzles.Grimrock is a perfect example of a typical indie game that takes an old 90's (even maybe late 80's) gameplay design and redo it in our modern era. It is kind of a slow game. Every time you move is tile by tile and when you attack or so you click on the attack, do it on front of you, wait for the cooldown and repeat. But in the end, it's only like if it would be a turn based combat system, but sometimes, you can get a turn faster than your opponent. Also, it gets pretty hard. You can facetank the first level or 2 but the gameplay gets pretty crazy pretty fast. You discover new types of weapons and new monsters. You have to kite them in order to survive. They are hard. You have to act fast and think fast too. You are not always fighting in the same environment. It's a really great mechanic. Any limitations you may have, the monsters have them too. You have to learn their pattern, and execute yours.There is just so much stuff to discover. The whole world is begging you to find the hidden stuff everywhere. You will have to face really hard puzzles just to keep going on the main tract. They always comes with clues, so it's really fair. But some of them are really obnoxious and if you are not in it for the puzzles, you might want to consider looking for a guide. Or maybe just relax and take notes for an hour or two because some of the puzzles really require you to do so.It might be a good idea to look for character guides too before starting to play. The way you build and play your character really matters. Like you might completely ruin your run if you put stats in stuff you end up not using. The game gets pretty hard later. You have to have good gear and especially specialized characters. So if you consider playing, but you only have time for 1 playthrough. Do a bit of research, look out recommendations, and get the game because it is really fun to play.I give it 8/10. I can't wait to play the second one !			"

Like e.g. trying to remake Total Recall or Conan the barbarian or trying to modernize Simon the sorcered (as in 3D) or reimagin Star Trek?Well... this is NOT like that. This is more something like... get The Elder Scrolls 1 and 2 and rebuild them wiith Skyrim's engine sort of thing.If you like dungeon crawlers of the eye of the beholder flavor, lands of lore flavor, bards tale flavor (you get the idea) then you will lose it with this one because it is one of those games, built for modern machines. The gameplay is identical and this is a HUGE pro. Do NOT skip this game . It is absolutely fantastic.			"

												Legend of GrimrockA 3D take on a RPD board kind of style. The game is based in a dungeon which is situated inside a mountain, Your 4 characters are prisoners and your only chance of survival is to escape the dungeon.You slowly progress floor by floor down a grid style environment. It is in a way turn based but it does it very well. The controls are very easy to learn and everything is taught to you pretty early in the game.The art style  is very typical of a dungeon rpg you have the vines hanging from the walls and the cobblestone bricks but for a dungeon it can look very pretty the monsters especially have been made very well with their stationary movements and attacks.One of the only issues I had with this game was that some of the puzzles I just didnt understand or they just werent obvious so I had to check some youtube videos but that could just be down to my own incompetence.I rate it a 8/10 Definately check out the sequel as well!

												Proof you don't need a D&D license and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ soap opera story. Just make a great game and leave it at that.Grimrock is a modern dungeon crawler that puts age old mechanics to good use. Your goal is very simple. Guide a party through a nasty dungeon while avoiding traps, fighting monsters, collecting better equipment and leveling up.The game is comfortable and easy to play despite the difficulty ramping up after the first few levels. For those who enjoy exploring and getting lost there's an option to switch off the automap. There are secret areas aplenty and some puzzles require a bit of thinking. Most of the time it's enough to just look everywhere and figure out how to make use of things like pressure plates, teleports or timing mechanisms.The enemies are quite cruel and your party will become overmatched pretty quickly. Fortunately it's possible to close gates and block off some areas, and it's not necessary to kill everything. If you must kill things to progress, usually there's a way to make use of the dungeon itself and make it easier.I have played a lot of dungeon crawlers and have liked some of them. Ishar 3 was good though i never finished it. I loved Captive but finished it even less... Albion was interesting, though not exactly a classic example, and neither was Whale's Voyage. Hired Guns was incredible for it's time and hard as hell for good measure. Never could get into Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder much, though EoB was ok. Anvil of Dawn was pretty impressive. I think there's a few games i forgot, but anyway...Maybe i'm weak for Hired Guns a bit more but Legend of Grimrock is the most awesome of the bunch!			"

												Feels like a simplified version of Might and Magics III with better graphics.The character progression is oversimplified compared to that old classic, but the secrets doors and traps seem to be the main focus here. The whole game happens in some sort of underground prison/maze. If you really want nostalgia/challenge, use the ""old school mode"" and you will need to draw the map yourself, like in the old days! Aaaah how I miss that... not. Gearing is easy, but often requires you to find a bloody secret door with the last piece of your set. Or many secret doors. That's the spirit though!Achievements are okay to do, I wonder why few people got it 100%.			"

												Excellent game which requires you to think otherwise you can not get easily through enemies. You would mostly want attack one enemy at time, as getting surrounded leads to quick death of your 4 heroes. At the start you can choose your own three classes: fighter, rogue & mage and there are also races which make some advantages over others. I let it by default. Game is very similar to old M&M. Movement is chess-like, only step by step. Your party occupies one square, you can get trapped, you need to figure out the way out and solve puzzles (read your puzzle & try to understand its meaning & use instinct for solving). The game is though pretty simple to understand and I can only recommend the game to every RPG player who likes strategy, chess or puzzles.			"

												BEATEN! Total playtime for playthrough - about 14 hours.Classes chosen: 2 Minatour Melee/ 2 Wizards (ice/fire primarys)Legends of Grimrock is a VERY old-school dungeon crawl experience. Tile-by-tile this game is tense and full of failure (but topped with rousing successes). It is hard but fun. It also, interestingly, includes a lot of environmental puzzles.

												 Legend of Grimrock is a old school dungeon crawler offering intense combat, puzzles, exploration, and most of all survival. This game actually reminds me of Shining In The Darkness. Legend of Grimrock offers some really neat features like the ability to eat so you won’t starve. This might throw more casual players off the game because you’ll be managing a entire party and you have to make sure each person/thing in your party is well fed, has plenty of health, weapons, armor, and torches before you decide to continue on your descent into this maze like prison that you’re trapped in. The character creator in this game is awesome. It’s very old school like dungeons and dragons. Basically you choose a portrait, decide on what class you want that character to be, then choose their strengths, and traits. No one character will be good at everything so be careful on what you choose. I always have two warriors, a rogue, and a mage in my party and i’m doing pretty good with them.  The way you learn magical spells is by finding them on pieces of paper scattered around the dungeon. These papers will have the correct way for you to cast the spell. You can also randomly try and cast them but when you’re in a fight you really don’t have time to experiment with your spells. As you find weapons and armor throughout the dungeon you’ll be faced with a choice. Who will you give them too? This is what I love about this game. You won’t find enough equipment for everyone and you have to decide who you want to have them. I usually get my warriors set up for battle before anyone else. I gave the bow to my assassin, staff to me mage, axe to my minotaur, and sword and shield to my human/warrior/tank. Combat in this game is also very old schools. You click on your weapon to attack the enemy in front of you and watch as your sword cuts through the enemy. It’s very basic and easy to learn but it’s up to you to strategize and use tactics when you encounter a large group of enemies.   You don’t want to get surrounded in this game and risk losing one of your party members because they will not come back. Once they die they’re gone until you can find a giant sized blue crystal to revive them and that’s not always easy. In order for you to recover some health you can either rest by pressing the R button or by using a health potion that you’ll eventually find. You can also heal with a magic spell but I wouldn’t advise that since it’s not all that useful. The best ways to heal are by resting, or using a healing potion. When you rest your characters will get hungry so you’ll have to feed them. It’s up to you to decide when to rest and if you have enough food to eat when you’re done resting. ugly Graphically Legend of Grimrock is a good looking game. All of the enemies look good, and the dungeon itself is dark, gloomy, and creepy like a dungeon should be. The sound effects, and soundtrack all help build up to the creepiness that the game has. You’re all alone in this place and I think that adds to the tension while I play the game. Legends of Grimrock isn’t all about looting and killing things. It also has some pretty good puzzles for you to figure out in order to advance to a secret area or get to the next area. I’ve been stuck on more then one occasion trying to figure out the clues to the puzzles when the answer was staring me right in the face. Legend of Grimrock is a amazing, old school dungeon crawler that should be experienced by everyone that loves games that does not hold your hand. My final verdict for Legend of Grimrock is a 10/10! This game took me back to the 90′s with it’s play style and hardcore, no hand holding gameplay. The puzzles are a nice change of pace and knowing that the only way to bring your lost party member back to life is by finding a giant blue crystal really appeals to me. It’s old school and a lot of fun. This game is by all counts Legendary and easily earns my recommendation.  For more of my reviews you can find me on drakulus.com and johnheatz.com.			"

												BEATEN! Total playtime for playthrough - about 14 hours.Classes chosen: 2 Minatour Melee/ 2 Wizards (ice/fire primarys)Legends of Grimrock is a VERY old-school dungeon crawl experience. Tile-by-tile this game is tense and full of failure (but topped with rousing successes). It is hard but fun. It also, interestingly, includes a lot of environmental puzzles. On one or two occassions, the genre sorta made these a bit harder than they might otherwise be, but overall they are not an issue.PROS:- Old school dungeon crawling- Character creation. Too many mixes to have them all.- Good monster/level design- A good challange- Steam workshop!

												Grimrock keeps you up. It's tough as nails, but it scratches that dungeon crawler itch... That ""Eye of the Beholder/Dungeon Master/So many late 80's early 90's games it's hard to count"" dungeon crawler itch. And unlike its roguelike cousins, grimrock is a meticulously plotted and paced experience.I'll admit I probably spent more time playing this than was strictly necessary, but I combed every wall for hidden switches, I slashed every tapestry to see if a cubby of treasure hid beneath, in short, Grimrock hid dozens upon dozens of little wonders and I couldn't help but go seek.My only criticism is, I think a new game + would have been amazing. Being able to play through the game again at a harder difficulty with your entire party and all its equipment would've rocked. But other than that...  I loved it. If you like your games difficult and intelligent, your monsters menacing and your character progression rewarding, buy this game.			"

												A classic RPG in the style of Eye of the Beholder and other first-person RPGs from the early '90s. There's about 25 hours of content here, and its all worthwhile. Much of the game involves trap puzzles. There is no grind or repetition here -- your character will progress at a reasonable rate to match the challenges of each level, and each level offers new and interesting challenges. The game has a retro feel with modern graphics, and doesn't drag on forever like many other RPGs. Much of the fun involves hunting for secrets (and there are many).There's essentially no replay value here, but your first playthrough will give you more than your money's worth. There are no unskippable cutscenes to destroy the fun.			"

												I liked Legend of Grimrock for what it was (a basic dungeon crawler à la 'Dungeon Master') but for someone looking for a more critical review, I'll list what I missed in the game regarding:Combat: very simplistic and monotonous. It can be described in 5 words: ""Sidestep > Turn > Click attack/spell."" You won't be doing anything else from the first trash mob till the final boss.Story: There is none.Items: There is not a lot of variety with weapons / armor, it's a pretty flat, straightforward upgrade path. I think they could 've done more here with random itemization à la Diablo 2 to keep things interesting.Again, these were probably deliberate design choices - partly because of budget constraints (nail the basics > bodging experimental stuff) and partly to emulate the old dungeon crawlers with their very basic gameplay. If that's what you're looking for though, LoG delivers.			"

												This games is awesome! A true dungeon crawler, with puzzles, traps, and dungeon dwellers. The rich story unravels as you play, giving you a reason to want to find your way out of the dungeon, not to mention see what's waiting for you at the bottom. It's nice to have a decent range of character customization, without spending hours figuring out what you want your characters to look like. You can choose portraits for your characters, but ultimately their stats and bonuses are going to be more important in this game. I tried it out for the first time and ended up playing for 5 hours straight!			"

												This game, like all roguelikes, is not easy on beginners. However, it is also incredibly unique for one of its genre, and is definitely worth a look. If you like roguelikes, RPGs, or tabletop games(D&D), Grimrock is probably worth your money. I enjoy it immensely, but don't take my taste as your own.			"

Only when we ocassionally switched places did he find out it isn't as easy as it seemed. :) And there simply is no better way to play this game. When I'm on a frantic run from the last whatshisface, my brother is still calm enough to notice a button on a wall as I run past, saving me a lot of tedium. The puzzles were fun, the combat and leveling up too, the monsters may have been less varied than I would have liked. Overall I really recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs, or likes Dungeon Master, or anyone who has never played it.			"

												Easily a 9/10.Definitely worth the full price.At first I bought this game during a steam sale and forgot about it, but after burning myself out of a couple of other RPGs I noticed I had this game still practically untouched. The combat is fun and interesting, its fast paced enough to keep you on your toes, but slow enough to give you time to do things like brew a potion on the fly or swap out weapons. The controls can take a little getting used to, but its overall simplicity is a godsend in an age of Menus: the RPG. It would not have much replayability if not for the robust steam workshop integration. The game is pretty light on the story and allows you do get right to the heart of this Dungeon-Crawler without worrying too much about the details.Overall an excellent experience.			"

												Legend of Grimrock is a 3D first person tile-based dungeon crawler with real-time combat. Blending elements of Wizardry, Ultima Underworld(s) and Arx Fatalis it's a solid entry into a very small corner of the RPG world where releases are few and far between. You begin as a party of four prisoners thrown into a dungeon atop a mountain. A place, as the game cleverly puts it, ""Only remembered when things need to be discarded or forgotten."" There are no towns, no merchants and very little feeling of respite.  Your map and the food, torches, alchemy reagents, spell scrolls and equipment you'll find are worth more than gold to a naked, starving group of prisoners who must battle their way to the bottom of the mountain for any hope of escape. Standing in your way are 13 floors of deadly creatures and cleverly designed traps and puzzles.Though the environment and enemy variety is limited the game is beautiful, and though the skill system is brutally restrictive in what you can achieve it's still a good crawl with lots of secrets to be found.

												Had the game for a while thanks to a previous sale, but I just started playing it, and I must say it is a very in-depth RPG system.  I like the gameplay, though turning the camera is a bit awkward.  Overall, it's worth its price.  It offers an insane amount of replay value.I don't like the map editor much, but it gets the job done.  The map editor is similar to some old-school editors in games like Darkstone but not quite as complex.  You basically are limited to a 2D floor plan, which makes level design faster but also limits your artistic placement of items and also makes testing how things look a little more difficult.  If nothing else, it makes publishing RPG ideas to the Workshop very easy.Real quick, the editor has some major quirks.  Quirk #1 is that enemies cannot be finely tuned for the levels.  What this means is enemies are set to basic levels and have stats based on which monster they are.  You cannot be told those stats in the editor, though, so you have to read the monster/combat guides to figure out which enemies are strongest/weakest.  That is not very intuitive, and if I was the dev, I would want to add more granularity to enemy types.Quirks #2 and #3 kind of roll together.  Quirk #2 is that the editor is 2D, but the levels are 3D, so you can't place items exactly where you want them.  You can, however, pick the wall/direction of the item, and each tile can have up to 4 items of each type... well, most types, anyway.  Quirk #3 is that you don't have any intro/outro scenes for entering and exiting levels.  The real problem is that the first level does not have any story options.  All you can do is throw scrolls and wall text into the level and expect the player to read everything.  You have no way to guarantee that the player will see that text.  It would be nice if the levels could have transition scenes, even just black screens with white text.  I also think some kind of mandatory text message or cutscene device would be useful for getting custom stories or even just area names into the game.Well, enough ranting about the engine's quirks.  I love the game, and I recommend it to dungeon-crawling fans.			"

												Awesome game!  A throwback to old tile-based dungeon crawler games, this game is real-time, difficult, and bleak.  You control a whole party of 4 adventurers that are forced by their ankle chains to stand on the same square.  There are tons of puzzles as well as tough monster fights.  Secret rooms everywhere!  Your characters need to eat occasionally or they start to recieve negative effects, forcing you to keep moving deeper towards your own doom.  Everything seems well balanced, though it is balanced towards difficulty.  In order to do well in combat, you are expected to perform a ballet dance, attacking the enemies from the side and sidestepping them before they turn to face you.  You will probably end up dying a lot, so save often.  If you want a real challenge, there is an option to turn off the map, forcing you to use graph paper to map out the dungeon as you go.The game is said to last at least 10 hours, and a level editor and mod support are coming soon.

												Ok, so you remember the old-school first-person dungeon crawlers? It's one of those, and it's excellent.Oh, wait, you said ""no""? Oh, well, let me break it down for you. It's an RPG with light story, grid-based movement, puzzles and exploration a-plenty, and monsters intent on ruining your day at every turn. You know The Elder Scrolls? It's not like that. You don't go on quests, you don't visit towns, you don't save the world. You get one massive dungeon that you and your party of four wander through in a ceaseless battle for survival and escape. The game is hard for the modern gamer. It requires careful planning, strategy, and knowing a few things about RPGs (fire wrecks undead, poison is wasted on spiders, etc.), but every battle is rewarding.If you want something old (or something new, depending on your gaming history), grab this. It's incredible, and there's the promise of custom dungeons on the horizon, so you'll have plenty more exploring to do in the future. Good luck.			"

Be sure to save at every opportunity because much like SMT or Wizardry ...you will die,a lot.Enjoy!			"

												Great game. Tricky sometimes (for me at least, or I grow impatient with the years :-). If you liked Dungeon Master LoG is, probably, as close and as good as it gets but with its own charm as well.As a side note I hope that they'll port LoG 2 on MacOS X as well. Really. They'll get my money when they do.			"

												Hardcore is the only word I can really think to use to describe this dungeon crawling extravaganza. From the word ""go"" you will be brutalized by horrific creatures, daunted by the interminable passage of time as you lose yourself in the labyrinth, and deceived by the surprisingly complex puzzles. Just remember to stay well fed and spend your skill points wisely.			"

												Do not underestimate this game: it is tough. Even on easy, the puzzles become daunting, the monsters brutal, and your party's resources frighteningly scarce. If you're not careful to level up your characters efficiently right out of the gates you'll find yourself trapped in grinding mode until you're able to progress...but be warned: your food dwindles at an alarming rate and is every bit as elusive as any other form of aid. It's a no-joke type situation, and a person would do well to get into this with the mindset of committing to a hardcore adventure.Nonetheless, I find the challenge a good thing. It's refreshing to have to think in a video game again and quite rewarding when you manage to proceed to another floor. You can spend a huge amount of time playing this game too--plenty of levels, lots of achievements, tons of brain teasing puzzles, plenty of weapons and gear to scavenge and disburse amongst your characters. While not for the faint of heart, this game gets my thumbs-up.			"

Only when we ocassionally switched places did he find out it isn't as easy as it seemed. :) And there simply is no better way to play this game. When I'm on a frantic run from the last whatshisface, my brother is still calm enough to notice a button on a wall as I run past, saving me a lot of tedium. The puzzles were fun, the combat and leveling up too, the monsters may have been less varied than I would have liked. Overall I really recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs, or likes Dungeon Master, or anyone who has never played it.			"

However, I got stuck and stopped playing because I couldn't pass this one room and none of my friends were able to help me either, so if you are one to give up easily, this game may not be for you.

LEGEND OF GRIMROCKA first-person dungeon crawler set in a series of underground labyrinths, filled with monsters, puzzles and traps.Rating 7/10A throwback to the early 90s role-playing games like Eye of the Beholder, Ultima Underworld and Stonekeep. Whilst in many ways Legend of Grimrock is a homage to those early games it's worth buying not just for nostalgia but because it's a great game in it's own right.In updating the classic formula they haven't changed much, grid-based movement, advancing one tile at a time with 90 degree turns. The party consists of four different characters spread across three classes, the fighters in the front row and the more vulnerable mage and Rogue in the back row. The two in the front row will deal the most damage and take the most damage via melee combat, the two characters in the back row can use magic and ranged attacks. It's a fine balance and timing is key in order to keep your party alive. Combat suffers from the same limitations as it did in the games Grimrock is trying to re-create, wait for the enemy to enter the tile in front of you before unleashing all of your attacks then back away or strafe sideways before they have a chance to return damage. Rinse and repeat. There are obviously times this strategy doesn't always work such as being surrounded by three or more enemies or backing into a dead end but it's the strategy you'll end up using the most. It worked back in the 90s and it still works now. There is a story loosely attached but it's not really important, this is a dungeon crawler at heart and the fun comes from fighting your way through and solving puzzles in each new level of the dungeon. There are no quests to speak of other than to survive the dungeon. During the game you pick up clues and lore via letters left by a previous prisoner called Toorum, it's a simple but effective way of building up some atmosphere and history to the adventure.It's a bit too easy and a bit too short. I completed the game twice unlocking all achievements, completing my second play through on Hard Boiled and Doin' It Old School and even then I completed it with little effort. Aside from making the game longer I felt it would have benefited from a few NPCs, something Stonekeep did to great effect. It would have broken up the game play a bit and offered something different. However these are fairly minor disappointments to what is otherwise a superb game.Looking forward to Legend of Grimrock 2.			"

Its managed to keep all the great elements of the early games, lots of puzzles that will keep you occupied and keeping the old combat tactics in place. They've given it lots of attention in terms of the graphics, sound and music, and overall its really well designed and thought through dungeon crawler classic. The dungeon designer looks really straghtforward to use too, and adds a nice additional touch to the package. Heartily recommended, especially for the old-schooler. My score is a ice 9 out of 10			"

												A fantastic old-school first person dungeon crawler full of hidden passages, complex puzzles, and difficult combat. The graphics and sound design are amazing considering the game is only 600mbs. Most of the music is ambience leading to a calm gameplay experience... until a skeleton rushes around a corner and makes you jump. Old style games like this have a terror of their own with the lighting and sound effects. When your torch goes out, it is pitch black until your characters ""eyes"" adjust and even then you can barely see. The only real complaint I have is the combat can be frustrating when you get body-blocked into a corner or are simply overpowered because of poor stat placement or equip.If you go into this expecting ""Amnesia with swords"" instead of ""Skyrim without towns"" you will have a great experience. Be prepared for a game that wants to beat you down; save often and take map notes because you will need all the help you can get.			"

It takes the best all-time classic RPG ideas and improves the whole thing in a mix of real-time and turn-based gameplay. Board Game spirit with a high class european RPG body. Hero Quest + Skyrim.

LEGEND OF GRIMROCKA first-person dungeon crawler set in a series of underground labyrinths, filled with monsters, puzzles and traps.Rating 7/10A throwback to the early 90s role-playing games like Eye of the Beholder, Ultima Underworld and Stonekeep. Whilst in many ways Legend of Grimrock is a homage to those early games it's worth buying not just for nostalgia but because it's a great game in it's own right.In updating the classic formula they haven't changed much, grid-based movement, advancing one tile at a time with 90 degree turns. The party consists of four different characters spread across three classes, the fighters in the front row and the more vulnerable mage and Rogue in the back row. The two in the front row will deal the most damage and take the most damage via melee combat, the two characters in the back row can use magic and ranged attacks. It's a fine balance and timing is key in order to keep your party alive. Combat suffers from the same limitations as it did in the games Grimrock is trying to re-create, wait for the enemy to enter the tile in front of you before unleashing all of your attacks then back away or strafe sideways before they have a chance to return damage. Rinse and repeat. There are obviously times this strategy doesn't always work such as being surrounded by three or more enemies or backing into a dead end but it's the strategy you'll end up using the most. It worked back in the 90s and it still works now. There is a story loosely attached but it's not really important, this is a dungeon crawler at heart and the fun comes from fighting your way through and solving puzzles in each new level of the dungeon. There are no quests to speak of other than to survive the dungeon. During the game you pick up clues and lore via letters left by a previous prisoner called Toorum, it's a simple but effective way of building up some atmosphere and history to the adventure.It's a bit too easy and a bit too short. I completed the game twice unlocking all achievements, completing my second play through on Hard Boiled and Doin' It Old School and even then I completed it with little effort. Aside from making the game longer I felt it would have benefited from a few NPCs, something Stonekeep did to great effect. It would have broken up the game play a bit and offered something different. However these are fairly minor disappointments to what is otherwise a superb game.Looking forward to Legend of Grimrock 2.			"

												A fantastic old-school first person dungeon crawler full of hidden passages, complex puzzles, and difficult combat. The graphics and sound design are amazing considering the game is only 600mbs. Most of the music is ambience leading to a calm gameplay experience... until a skeleton rushes around a corner and makes you jump. Old style games like this have a terror of their own with the lighting and sound effects. When your torch goes out, it is pitch black until your characters ""eyes"" adjust and even then you can barely see. The only real complaint I have is the combat can be frustrating when you get body-blocked into a corner or are simply overpowered because of poor stat placement or equip.If you go into this expecting ""Amnesia with swords"" instead of ""Skyrim without towns"" you will have a great experience. Be prepared for a game that wants to beat you down; save often and take map notes because you will need all the help you can get.			"

												Proper old school RPG. If you loved EOTB and Dungeon Master then you'll enjoy this one too. Its clearly been made by people who were fans of the originals and its a real work of love. Its managed to keep all the great elements of the early games, lots of puzzles that will keep you occupied and keeping the old combat tactics in place. They've given it lots of attention in terms of the graphics, sound and music, and overall its really well designed and thought through dungeon crawler classic. The dungeon designer looks really straghtforward to use too, and adds a nice additional touch to the package. Heartily recommended, especially for the old-schooler. My score is a ice 9 out of 10			"

												I really enjoyed this game other then some weird flaws that I felt were in the mechanics of the game.Straight up tanking the ememys is for the most part impossible unless you build the right team and know what perks to go after quick in the game. Most noobs wont know this, so the game becomes about running around to avoid getting attacked, shutting doors on enemys after you have attack to wait to attack again, and so on. I feel this kinda takes away from the game alote and give an odd dull feel. There seems to be lots of replayable contect and playing the game secend time around can still offer some fun on the harder difficulty  and building a team better then what the stock game offers you the first time. Still great game, cant wait to play the 2nd one.			"

It's a small, simple and short game, but what it does, it does really well. It's a great game, not just for dungeon crawler fans, but for everyone to enjoy.			"

												One of my favorite indie gamesA grind based dungeon crawler, aparently based on some old school games ive never played, but if they are anywhere near as good as legend of grimrock ive missed outWithin the game you control a party of 4 characters at the same time and move in first person through square grind based dungeons, the game has a great degree of micromanagement, you use the different attacks of your party members individually, they suffer from different status effects, they all have their own stats and they all suffer from hunger and carrying limitations, not to mention since your characters are set up in a square formation within the square grind you are on attacks from different directions affect different party members, learning to balance all of this is pivotal to successthe dungeons in this game are all well designed with clever puzzles and some nice settings. The combat in the game is for the most part decent, it can get a little boring agaisnt single enemies, since running around em is usually enough, but when multiple enemies are present it becomes really challenging, since you must maneuver the environment skillfully to avoid getting trapped and having your weakest party members killed. Your party members can belong to 4 races and 3 different classes, each with their own characteristics, the mage class is a standout, offering the most interesting and challenging combat of all classes. The game in general is very hard but fair, with only a couple of traps and situations id describe as cheapWhen it comes to graphics, they are somewhat simple but pleasing to the eye, with an adequate amount of detail on screen and a good art direction, its understandably claustrophobic but this goes well with the game's setting and mechanics, i guess one flaw on this regard is the fact we are dealing with the overly familiar middle ages fantasy setting herethe game has a very long campaign, it took me around 19 hours to finish the main campaign and i didnt even find all the secrets, you can start a new game with different party configurations and the game has steam workshop support with over 700 custom dungeons, this thing has some serious replay valuefantastic game overall, my mayor complain is the fact a game like this begs for randomization and yet it has none, it could really benefit for random dungeons with random loot, random spells, random enemies in random locations, but well i guess the game couldnt have these brilliant puzzles otherwise, and the steam workshop support does alleviate this shortcoming a bit﻿			"

Legend of Grimrock is a dungeon crawling role playing game with an oldschool heart but a modern execution. A group of prisoners are sentenced to certain death by exiling them to the secluded Mount Grimrock for vile crimes they may or may not have committed. Unbeknownst to their captors, the mountain is riddled with ancient tunnels, dungeons and tombs built by crumbled civilizations long perished now. If they ever wish to see daylight again and reclaim their freedom the ragtag group of prisoners must form a team and descend through the mountain, level by level. - Highly Recommended!			"

												My favorite game to play alongside some other activity. Just put it in a smaller resolution windowed mode and start cracking puzzles and finding secrets!Also the Workshop adds a lot of replayability to it. Maybe not a $15 if you're not super into grid-based dungeon walks, but definitely worth checking out if you want to try something relatively oldschool and challenging.			"

												Salutations Everyone and welcome to my review of the Legend of Grimrock. Legend of Grimrock is a first-person dungeon crawler by Almost Human games. In this dungeon crawler, you either take a preset team of 4 or, more commonly, create your own band of 4 to take through the depths of Grimrock to earn your team's freedom.Before we go further, let's discuss options. The options menu offers many quality options for textures and shadows that let you tailor Grimrock to your machines needs, but as the game's ports to IOS and Android work well, your machine does not need to be powerful to run at maximum settings. Aside from that, there are two sliders for audio. One slider is for Music and the ambient noises of the dungeon, and the other is for sound effects such as sword swings and punches. Both can be muted should you wish, and the sliders actually work. Finally, there is a multitude of extraneous options such as complete mouse control and hiding damage texts which is entirely up to personal preference/machine.After the options menu, we go on to the story of Grimrock which is simple. You play as four prisoners who are dragged to the top of mount Grimrock for crimes commited. The judges absolve you all as your are pushed in for those who survive Mt. Grimrock are given their freedom. As such, it is your objective to reach the bottom of the mountain while you receive assistance via a being that speaks out to your in your character's dreams. To avoid actual spoilers, I'll end this portion here, but the story is generic so that you can create backstories of your own for the party. You react how your characters react thus giving a ""truer"" role-play experience, akin to those found on tabletop.From there, we go on to the most important aspect of Grimrock, character creation. During character creation, you determine the race from four types and each character then gets his/her class from one of three types. This gives you ""12"" options for race/class combinations which can expand out further in gameplay proper. Naturally, certain races are better at certain class because of raw stats; however, due to the rpg nature of Grimrock, the end result cares more about class than race. The only thing that race truly decides are the traits that grant bonuses that are unique to the race/class. Finally, you determine stat distribution of bonus points into the four stats of Strength, Vitality, Willpower, and Dexterity. For those experienced with RPG's you'll realize that dumping all stat points into a primary stat is a good thing for specialization is key to making Grimrock a breeze. In reality, the benefits are minor compared to how you level up in the main game, but optimizations can mean the difference of 20 health points or mana points by the end of the game.All this talk of optimization in Character creation is nice, but the game isn't about building characters. The game is about racing through a dungeon, fighting monsters, and solving puzzles. The movement systems is based on a grid. Specifically, you can move, forward, backward, turn left, and turn right. You can do this as quickly as about one move action per half second. This is good as it is your primary tool for staying alive. In addition, each member of your party gets one ""hand"" action per second that regenerates based on when the action was used. All of this together makes up Grimrock's frantic combat system where you duel enemies that either out-number or out-power you. Note the game has several levels of difficulty and the difficulty simply changes how quick the enemies will move and attack. Otherwise, it has no effect on stats of the enemies.To compensate for the strength of the enemies, you get frequent level ups which grant skill points to boost a character's level in one of six skill paths. Each path works by granting traits, abilities, and buffs based upon how far along the path you are. Those clever enough to realize it will focus on one path to get access to high-level powers and skills to kill all opponents, but a secondary path is also recommended to compensate for either a low defense or offense that comes from specialization. Those who don't do this will find the late-game to be near-impossible which is a definite flaw in the game's design, but it is easily correctable via the multitude of throwable bombs found in the game. Aside from that, the other flaw with combat is that several weapons are unavailable except through the many secrets of Grimrock. For instance, you cannot find a missile weapon until at least level 3 behind a secret that is easily missable to those who haven't played before. As such, it is a poor mark on an otherwise good game.Aside from combat, the rest of Grimrock is based on exploration which rewards savvy players. Many of the puzzles in Grimrock have simple solutions that are hidden behind layers of prose, or they are simple logic puzzles that can be solved via trial and error. As such, the puzzles are fair and easily solvable to most people. However, there are a few, optional, puzzles that do not fulfill this format which give no indication on how to solve them properly. However, this isn't a humungous issue as everything hidden behind them is either food to handle hunger (the game already gives you too much and an infinite source) or it is equipment that is made obsolete by other, easily find-able, items. Furthermore, many secrets are simply hidden switches which can be spotted as they are made to stand out if you are actually looking, and these tend to have the best items. All in all, puzzles are mostly fair and secrets are important to the power of any Grimrock run, but they aren't 100% necessary.In short, Grimrock is a fun game that will take about ten or so hours to complete. For its price, it is worth the buy, and its charm leads to a lot of replays and runs. Each run can be vastly different from one another, and that is the benefit of any run of Grimrock for it never becomes too boring. You can only make it so by actively seeking only the best builds and stomping all enemies into the ground with little challenge. As such, I implore you to make your party and delve into the dungeon!			"

												Whoa! Nostalgia! What we have here is a 2012 blend of the old classics, Stonekeep, Eye of The Beholder and of course, the legendary Dungeon Master by FTL.It's a 3D viewable game, played in the step-forward, back, left and right mentality. The story? Your 4-man party has been thrown into a prison-style keep called Grimrock. Can you survive? Yes - that's it. Surely that's a problem? No. Not at all.In the current climate of RPG genres where back-stories, multi-layer character development and seemingly endless dialogue all vie for supremacy, LoG is wonderfully absent of all this 'clutter'. You're in a hole - get on with it.Newcomers to RPGs may instantly be put off by its appearance - but that's only skin-deep. Veterans of the Amiga/Atari ST days will immediately feel at home with this and end up just spending '10 minutes more' on it. Simple, honest, fun. A brilliant first-step for those people who might think RPGs are usually quite daunting.Certainly recommended. 8.5			"

												RPG adventure with a group of four and tactical fighting.  This game is not too bad (that's as high a compliment as I'm willing to give).There are mods - so I recommend checking the ratings and commentaries on those maps.But the actual vanilla game map - I found one great turn-off that I want to warn people about - even though I'm still giving a thumbs-up.  I hit one particular puzzle which involved movement combinations (the one that portalled you around the room until you got to the exit).  I coudn't find any approach to solving this puzzle other than brute force - so I decided to just Google it to find the answer.I consider that to be just blatantly bad game-writing.  Never make a puzzle that just involves trying all the combinations.  And for the benefit of the doubt - maybe there was some graceful way of solving it and I just didn't see how to do it.  Anyways, after getting past that puzzle I decided to uninstall.			"

I understand that somebody will really love it but not me. I made it into 9th level and stopped. And after a while I tried it again. Nothing changed. Grimrock is nice no doubt, I like to crush monsters, kite ogres and stuff but when I know that I cant reach some item because I didnt switched lever no. 12415 in 3rd level when I am in 7th, I just get mad :D.

And even if you finally solve speed puzzle A and B, C, D, E and many more will follow.With so many games to play I decided trying to beat the speed puzzles was not the way I want to go.

												A great and well rounded game that has just the right amout of difficulty and unforgiveness. Reminds me a lot of table top Dungeons and Dragons. My only complaint is there is hardly a punishment for death. When a character dies they can still hold torches and their inventory can still be opened. If I were to change something about this game it would be that dead characters can't hold torches(or provide light in any way) and also make it so either the dead character's inventory becomes locked or their inventory is split up into the other party members. Other than that I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys dungeons and dragons, dungeon crawlers, and even rogue likes. I give it a solid 9/10.			"

												A 1st person rpg adventure. If you've played and enjoyed Lands of Lore then this game is a must. There is a small setting up for the charecters or you could just roll with pre-generated ones. Being able to move and attack is very crucial. Move in > Attack > Back Away. Try to dodge your attacks by retreating   away each time. I also like how many skills and abilities the classes have.			"

												(Adaptation of my Grimrock 2 review.)Getting lost in this huge dungeon is so great. Even in the age of Witcher 3, this game shows that grid-based movement can still be fun. I have a hard time explaining why but here are some possible factors:- Enemies feel more menacing because you can't circle-strafe them, play with aggro range or exploit pathfinding bugs against them like in most free movement rpgs/fpss. So the dungeon feels more claustrophobic and menacing... I definitely don't feel that in Skyrim dungeons.- Mapping out the dungeon square by square and paying close attention to your environment for secret buttons and switches feels great, and it's not the typical modern RPG experience. A free movement game can hardly hide a button somewhere on a wall and expect you to find it, here with the constrained views it works.- The grid system allows for some very smart puzzles, I have to admit I sometimes give up and consult a walkthrough, but I enjoy their presence nonetheless!And you get to control (read: juggle) 4 characters, so four times the RPG goodness!All in all, you'll like it if you liked old-school RPGs like Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder and Lands of Lore: Throne of Chaos. But if you haven't played those games you should try it anyways! You might very well find that grid-based movement is a bit like pixel art: originally born of technical limitations, it can still bring a unique and interesting twist to a game.Once you're done with this one check out Grimrock 2! It's bigger, more varied visually and less linear. The modding scene is also flourishing for both games, though I suspect mods for the second game must be better, modders have more material and a more advanced engine to work with.			"

												Do you miss the dungeon-crawling of yore? Ever wished you could play games like Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder with modern design? Then Legend of Grimrock is the game for you!In Grimrock you form a party of four people and explore a vast dungeon. The movement is tile-based and in real-time. You move with the keyboard and all other actions are done with the mouse, like in the classic dungeon crawlers. The overall game is pretty challenging and the combat at times is tough as nails when you fight against multiple enemies. The riddles and puzzles are very well designed (apart from 1-2) and will probably have you scratch your head quite a bit. There are no NPCs to talk with, no towns to sell your loot or anything like that - it's just your party and a dark, scary dungeon (although the game does have a story!). There will be an editor available eventually, allowing people to create and share their own dungeons! Give it a look, it's great!			"

												Legend of Grimrock is an accessible dungeon crawler with fun and engrossing puzzles; the kind of puzzles that aren't complicated but require a decent understanding of the point-and-click mechanics. Unfortunately most of the underwhelming puzzles require hugging the wall and hunting down hidden wall switches.The RPG mechanics are pretty barebones. The combat consist of mindless clicking and side-stepping. You'll most likely never reach the end level class skills in your first playthough without excessive grinding. The only redeemable aspect of combat is the spellcasting system. In Grimrock, using magic spells require you enter the correct combinations of runes, as if you are dialing them on a keypad. Learning new rune combinations through the scrolls found in the dungeon is always an enjoyable treat. I only beat the main campaign but it took me roughly 10 hours not counted on Steam as my internet connection was down for a period of time. The user submitted workshop dungeons could hypothetically add even more unique playtime with this but I haven't had a clue if they are as good as the main game. Grimrock is well worth the full price by itself, though.One final note is that if you are of faint of heart you might not enjoy this game as it throws you a ton of creepy creatures that run around in the darkness of the dungeon.

												Classic, old-school puzzle-ridden dungeon-crawler. At least, I think that's the correct definition.This took me several attempts (and a guide or two!) to get right, it's a deeply satisfying game but can also be brutally punishing as well. Some hidden puzzles are downright obtuse and I wouldn't have found them without wasting hours of my life (thankyou internet!), but otherwise it's a very enjoyable and well-polished game.It won't be everybody's cup of tea, but I liked it just fine. It's also been cheap a gazillion times so don't ever buy it at full price, wait for a bundle or a sale.			"

												The story is definitely intriguing, and the environment feels as creepy as it should be. What kills this game is the ungodly impossible time puzzles. These kinds of puzzles may have its place in the hardest difficulty settings, when tring to get optional but desireable artifacts, and on low specs machines, but definitely not in the easiest difficulty settings, not to get artifacts that are required to finish the game, not in a computer well within the specs recommended. The forums recommend lowering the video settings, but no player should have to go to that lengths. Said time puzzles totally ruin the game. I wish I could get my money or my time back, but can't. I will, however, never buy from you again.			"

The vanilla game it is not very easy and you will need skill in this oldschool game, also orientation AND patience.

												One of the first birthdays i can remember, i was given ""Dungeons & Dragons: Warriors of the Eternal Sun"" for the sega mega drive, and played that game well into my teens and it left a huge footprint on gaming for me, mostly the dungeon networks within the game i spent hours trying to explore.  I saw a few screenshots of ""Legend of Grimrock"", and that was all i could think of. After playing it, It seems like a complete graphical overhaul of the traditional dungeon crawler mechanics, with more puzzles and exploring to do.The addition of mods (steam workshop) will bring fresh life into this game for a long time. I found the official level (story?) a bit hard to get into. But tried a go at some of the dungeons made by other players and found those more entertaining at the beggining. The engine that powers the game is top class, and somewhat unique. That it's also available on Linux (wooo!) is an added bonus.9/10.			"

												A modern take on the old-school tile-based dungeon crawler, was something of a surprise hit. Blending a close to perfect mix of horror, suspense, mystery, puzzles, and combat, Legend of Grimrock enticed my inner adventurer. The game itself is quite enjoyable, the grim-dark atmosphere lends itself perfectly to the setting, and the tile-based movement adds an interesting mechanic to it all. The is a game where you will make mistakes, there’s no avoiding that, you will fumble and fall and lose party members and grumble as you backtrack to a crystal. You’ll jump and curse when spiders sneak up on you, groan and rage as traps trigger and surround you with enemies, and kick yourself for not saving more often. You’ll experiment in the skill tree and find out that you’ve invested in something useless, or that you’ve given points wrong, or expended one-use items on the wrong character. Sometimes you’ll wish you’d taken the other loot, or wondered what was in the other locked room, so you’ll reload and find out, then compare before reloading again and deciding. You’ll rage as monsters surround you, you’ll rage as you find a character suddenly out of ammo, mana, poisoned, or just plain dead. You’ll rage as you run from Ogres, you’ll rage as Fire Elementals hit your back-row characters, you’ll rage as you’re confronted with new horrors the dungeon has to offer. But most of all, you will rage at the puzzles.The game does not hold your hand, which is both beautiful and mildly infuriating at times. There’s a lot of trial an error when it comes to solving puzzles, and you will die a lot trying. But that’s what this game is, a lot of trial and error. It can be harsh, but it’s never unfair, so long as you use your brain and save every 5 minutes. The only genuine complaint I have with the game is the inventory/loot system; space was simple to manage so long as you saved your sacks and boxes, but the weight mechanic was a little challenging at times, when I discover that the Kayran Nipple I just looted and put in a character’s inventory has weighed them down and has made the party slow as hell. What really got me was that there was no loot selling or anything like that, things just became obsolete and you had no reason to keep them, other than maybe convenient replacements for rocks.All in all I love this game to death, and had that rare compulsion to play it every second I had free time, though the game is best enjoyed, in my opinion, in longer sessions. That way you remember all the little details you were going over and you don’t miss out on something. That being said, I went over the entire dungeon with a fine-toothed come and still managed to miss some secrets, as the statistics will tell you. Half-way through my first playthrough I realized my lizardman rogue was relatively useless when I could have just gone double fighter mage combo, since I had teched him into ranged and throwing. And that was a mistake. You MUST specialize your character if you want to survive, if you choose to go down swords, you stick with swords, if you want axes, don’t switch out for maces because you found one and it was better, and try to keep to one or two disciplines of magic.For anyone who likes grim-dark fantasy, dungeon crawling, RPG’s, mystery, puzzles, and/or tile-based combat, Legend of Grimrock is definitely a must.

												9/10 So i bought this game a while ago, but didn't really start logging many hours into it until recently. This game is great--if you're a fan of oldschool dungeon crawler games, I highly suggest you look into the Legend of Grimrock series. A few notes:-This game is fairly easy to add content to, such as extra player portraits-Does not lag, seems to run pretty well on most machines-You can choose to fill in the map as you go, classic style-Doesn't have turn based gameplay, but rather each character has a cooldown on their weapons-Spell system is intrigueing and somewhat reminiscent of magicka-Straightforward gameplay-Challenging without being unnecessarily difficult-Graphics are okay, not top of the class but still decentIf you like puzzles or dungeon crawlers, you'll like this game. Try it.			"

												""Why aren't you playing Skyrim instead"" came to mind when I played this for the first time. Nostalgia is why. This is oldskool gaming so those new to this may find it a little simplistic. I played the classic Dungeon Master for ages on my Atari ST and thought it was the best thing. Ever. LoG has simple controls (makes a nice change these days) and you move around in a shuffling chess like fashion. My imagination was working a little more than it usually is picturing my hairy Warrior clad in his leather pants and brandishing a brutal looking cudgel. You can customise the portraits (Homer Simpson as Warrior anyone?) so you could have the Dixie Chicks going around whacking the heck out of everything. Remember to use the quick save often because death is permanent.  It would be a better World if there was a tablet version of this.			"

												A throwback game to old-school Dungeon Crawler RPGs, Legend of Grimrock easily succeeds at that, with a feature that, I feel, should’ve been in all those old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear. It plays like one, it has absolutely no music, but rather, ambient sounds like none of them, it has hard fighting monsters like one, and in this review, that’s only scratching the surface. Let’s dig a bit deeper, and see what this game really offers.Gameplay: As mentioned earlier, Legend of Grimrock is a throwback to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of the late 80s to the early 90s (or at least, I think that’s when these games were hot) and it succeeds at what it set out to do, too. It’s setting is that of Mount Grimrock, a large dungeon inside a mountain, and every bit of it is in first-person. The combat is somewhat fast-paced, but not so fast that you have to be faster than greased lightning to be able to get through fights. Their are helpful hints, if a bit obscure in places, that tell you how to proceed, and plenty of puzzles and traps to slog your way through. Story: The story in Legend of Grimrock feels a lot more fleshed-out than those games from which it takes its inspiration, such as the Dungeon Master games. Basically, though, the whole story amounts to this: you and your party members are prisoners convicted of an unknown crime, and you have been promised your freedom if you can escape from the dungeons of Mount Grimrock. Problems is, is that no one has ever managed to escape from Mount Grimrock, or at least, those who’ve been pardoned in this manner never have. It’s cliché, yes, but it works as a good driving force, because you’ll want to see what the King or whoever it is that sentenced your party to be pardoned in this way since you’ll inevitably be the first ones to ever escape this fate, right? But it actually goes deeper than that, because your party has dreams telling them of an original prisoner in the dungeon who knows the way out. I won’t say anymore on the story, because then I’d have to spoil it for you, and that wouldn’t be any fun, now would it?Music: As I said earlier, this game only has one particular song, and it only plays on the title screen. It’s pretty good, too!Graphics: The graphics look like about what you’d be expecting from a Dungeon Crawler that takes its inspiration from Dungeon Master, but with a modern day take on them. They look like graphics that you’d see in a modern day game.Now, that’s everything that’s in the game itself, but the game’s true strength really shines with the built-in Dungeon Editor. That’s right! Now you can make the Dungeon Master dungeons of your dreams with a bit more interactivity, thanks to Lua scripting and the Drag-and-Drop editing power of the Dungeon Editor for Legend of Grimrock.Overall, an amazing successor to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear, Legend of Grimrock is an obvious success, and it’s one in which I hope you can escape the shackles that will undoubtedly hold you to it and keep you coming back for more!

												Grimrock is a really fun game that harkens back to the Bard's Tale type games that I used to play on the C64 back in High School.  Great dungeon crawler with a good story and RPG elements.  Fun and interesting levels to explore that are fortunately not so complicated that you'd need graph paper for mapping.  The only thing I didn't like was that to defeat enemies past a certain point you often have to sort of strafe and attack to kill them - I don't mind fighting like that in a more action game, but for a game like this, that mechanic felt a little out of place.  Still, a great game for an old school type dungeon crawler RPG.  Highly recommended.			"

												Giving a simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down to Legend of Grimrock seems to me to miss the point of the game; it was consciously designed for a very specific audience, and your enjoyment will depend upon your belonging to said audience. I'd describe Grimrock as a puzzle game with an RPG overlay. You're dumped on top of a mountain and have to fight and puzzle your way through a series of dungeon levels in order to get to the exit at the bottom. There's an opening graphic about being condemned to the maze and offered a slim chance at survival as punishment for unspecified crimes, like eating puppies or promoting Justin Bieber's music or somesuch. Unimportant; it's a reason for your four-person party to wind up stuck in a dungeon. Players of the Recent Might and Magic X: Legacy will find it has less involved, less tactically sophisticated combat but much tougher puzzles (it pains me to admit that I got stumped fairly early on); you look for a hidden switch that opens a door somewhere on the other end of the level that leads to a dead end with another switch disguised as a torch sconce that when pulled opens the gate you saw three turns back which leads to a scrap of paper with a password on it for that magical barrier you couldn't get past before...I've given Legend of Grimrock a thumbs-up because it seems to do what it set out to do: it provides a series of tougher and tougher dungeon puzzles for the player to obsess over, with some simple combat to leaven it. The game's a bit like extra-dark chocolate in that respect: people who already find it to their taste will love it, while people who don't will find it has a bitter, gritty flavour that sort of reminds them of something they like.

												This game is basically a dumbed down version of dungeons and dragons. now before you go and think ""wow that's so nerdy and stupid"" let me explain. the gameplay is, in my opinion, very good. I honestly can't think of another game that has the same type of combat. the gameplay is a action game where you move as a group in a grid pattern. basically you (your group) moves like a rook in chess. and each class (fighter, mage, and rouge) each play differently. also you can play the same class differently depending on how you build them. ontop of the good action there are also great puzzles in this game.  it's really hard to explain the gameplay i would suggest youtubing a few gameplay videos. all and all if you are on the edge of getting the game or not i would say buy it! especially if it is on sale. all and all after playing this game for about 5 hours i would give this game a 8.5 out of 10. if the graphics where better i would give it a 9.5.

												This is how a dungeon crawler is done. It's really old school with lots of modern elements.So, what's the story? Well, there sort of isn't a story, ok, yes, there is, but it's not so essential to the main plot. The plot is that three people accused of crimes are thrown into a dunegon and must escape. So they must survive while there are monsters everywhere, disgusting food, a strange dream that happens sometimes when you rest, creepy sounds and amazing atmosphere. The graphics add so much to the atmosphere too because they look very amazing and somehow this game runs very well on my terrible PC. I wish more games did that.There are 3 main parts to this game and I will review each aspect one by one:CombatPuzzle SolvingExplorationCombat-The combat in this game is an old school style one, you're party is in 4 people all linked together and you walk on square tiles. You have to gather up weapons from monsters, hidden rooms and exploring the place as so. The magic combat system and the magic system in general is you have to combine a certain combination of runes. You can find these combinations on scrolls which you find and by leveling up the certain types of skills in the game. Speaking of the skills, the skills are pretty much subclasses in classes. The 3 classes in this game are fighter, rouge and mage. (There's a fourth one too but you will have to discover that for yourself) Each class has different abilities, attributes, purposes, uses, etc. There's also traits you can have on each character. There's lots to choose from and some races have their own trait. The 4 races are Human, Minotaur, Lizardman and Insectoid. Each are good for their own class, like how the Lizardman makes a good rogue and how the minotaur makes a good fighter.Puzzle solving-The puzzles in this game are diffucult. I had a LONG time trying to solve them. But after solving all of them, it was all worth it since it was fun and rewarding.Exploration-Without exploration, I don't think this game would've been so great. There are TONS of secrets everywhere. Some are easy to find, some take forever to find. For all those loot lovers out there, you will love this game because of all the loot and what it takes to get it. To go into a little more depth of exploration is the moving system, to turn you can't just turn all the way around, to do that, you would have to turn sideways and look sideways again since you look always in a 90 degree angle.To conclude, I would love to say Legend of Grimrock is a great modern day game and I would recommend it to anyone.

												This game is basically a dumbed down version of dungeons and dragons. now before you go and think ""wow that's so nerdy and stupid"" let me explain. the gameplay is, in my opinion, very good. I honestly can't think of another game that has the same type of combat. the gameplay is a action game where you move as a group in a grid pattern. basically you (your group) moves like a rook in chess. and each class (fighter, mage, and rouge) each play differently. also you can play the same class differently depending on how you build them. ontop of the good action there are also great puzzles in this game.  it's really hard to explain the gameplay i would suggest youtubing a few gameplay videos. all and all if you are on the edge of getting the game or not i would say buy it! especially if it is on sale. all and all after playing this game for about 5 hours i would give this game a 8.5 out of 10. if the graphics where better i would give it a 9.5.

												Not since Portal have I played a puzzle game that made me feel both stupid and empowered when I figured out the answer was right in front of my face. Legend of Grimrock combines an old-school dungeon crawler mixed with puzzles and RPG elements.  Synopsis: You control a group of 4 prisoners trying to escape Grimrock by solving puzzles and fighting monsters. Puzzles can be as simple as a hidden button on a wall or as complex that things may take time and patience to solve. Gameplay: The best way I can describe this game is if you mixed D&D and Myst, with tons of aggravation. The Legend of Grimrock isn’t as one dimensional as the art style and movement may lead you to believe. Many of the puzzles will leave you scratching your head and swearing there isn’t a solution. The other aspect of the game which I believe could use some work is the battle system. As intricate as the puzzles can be, the system to fight monsters throughout gets repetitive and leaves a lot to be desired. It’s a mix between real time and turn based, with a focus on the formation of your team. If your characters use all short range abilities, you have to swap one of the two, for the one you want to attack. Many monsters can be defeated without much strategy and sometimes become a hindrance to trying to solve a puzzle. There are four classes you can choose from as you customize your perfect party, but very little direction or tutorial on how to use each class. I found myself having to look up a guide on how to use a mage to even understand what magic could be used. I have logged thirty-eight hours on this title (some of it was afk during a multiplayer game), but at less than $5, 20 hours of engrossing gameplay and a strong community following, this game is more than worth it.Positive: +Challenging puzzles are intricate enough to make you feel clever+Game can be saved at any point.+Large community following where content can be downloaded.Negative-Battle system can get repetitive.-Not all classes are created equal. Art Style/Graphics:  Think old school, first person, dungeon crawler. This game is a great blend of classic nostalgia with a jolt of current 3d graphics. Much of the game in spent in the darkness with two to three walls around you, but this doesn’t mean the creators were lazy. Attention is paid to simple cracks in the wall, to how the light bounces off each wall. To speak more about the lighting; this plays a huge role on the tone of the gameplay. The torches on the walls (or the ones you drop on the ground) limit vision to what can be around the next turn, which makes you feel like you are actually there.Positive:+Lighting is engaging.+Can be played on lower-end computers.+Can be played in Windowed ModeNegative:-Characters and enemies could be upgraded.Soundtrack/Sound effects: This was one of the biggest negatives to the game for me. For the 20 hours I played, much of the time was spent trying to solve puzzles. To solve puzzles you have to explore the dungeon, often falling to lower parts. Hearing my characters yell as they were falling, over and over, got very annoying. This is only increased by the often reused sounds of the characters attacking and grunting in every fight they encounter. On a positive note, the minor sounds of metal doors closing, walls moving, or crackling of the fire, add a realistic aspect and can be heard in surround sound.Positive:+Simple sounds of environment Negative:-Repetitive Cost: I personally bought this game in a Humble Bundle (only paying $5), but that being said, I would wait for this game to go on sale. $14 (full price) is a bit too much for the amount of gameplay in the standalone. At 75% off ($3.75) a case can be made. This does not include the amount of community related additions on the workshop; which is extensivePositive:+HUGE community created contentNegative:-Full price not worth standalone "

It's thrilling, easy to explore, fun to play and has a unique atmosphere that only makes you want to continue playing. Oh, and the soundtrack is gorgeous!I was lucky enough to buy this one on sale for 3$ (or something like that), but I can say right now that IT IS worth the 15$ pricetag it's gotten on Steam, and it is a must buy for RPG fans. If you also play any type of role-play IRL (yes, with papers and pencils) you will be familiar with the system of this one. Fantastic!			"

												If you're into this type of a game I'm sure you will like it but there are two things you should know about this game that I didn't when I got it: It is not turn based. You move and attack in real-time.The dungeons are static and are not randomly generated. The enemies are also not randomized in any way. This kills replayability for me.The graphics are great and the gameplay is strategic enough to keep interest up, but honestly speaking it's not really my type of game. I still recommend you buy it if you find the gameplay interesting!----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: -/5 (I didn't play long enough to get into it.)Gameplay: 3.5/5Challenge: 4/5Discovery: 2/5Replayability: 0/5Aesthetics: 4/5Visuals: 5/5Atmosphere: -/5 (I didn't play it enough.)Music: -/5 (Don't remember it well enough.)

												$15 or less gets you a remarkably well-designed retro-style dungeon crawler, complete with a four player party (of Humans, Minotaurs, Lizardmen and Insectoids), a wide range of devious traps and puzzles (which you really don't see in RPGs anymore), and some very challenging fights.It has all of the features of a classic first-person RPG - tile-based movement, dying of starvation, reading bits of the story off scrolls, and the like - mixed with the accessibility and graphics of a modern, big-ish budget RPG...so it's both nostaglic and a refreshing change of pace for the genre? Eh, I'm crapping on, just buy it.			"

												For years I've been wanting to play a modernized old school first person dungeon crawl/RPGs. I tried going back and playing older ones like might and magic games but they just don't cut it over time. All I can say is Legend of Grimrock is EXACTLY what I've been waiting for. It takes all the fun, excitement, and strategy out of those old games and brings it to the current level of gameplay. It removes all the buggyness of older games, it replaces the confusingly blurred graphics where it's easy to miss an important item with beautiful design, poor puzzles with strategic challenges, choppy fighting with challenging battles, etc. I LOVED this game, I had so much fun playing it, and with the added function of a popular mod community and a dungeon editor it is really a top tier experience. If you like RPGs, or dungeon crawls, or have been craving what I have then look no further: this game is TONS of fun.			"

												Grimrock... I have never had a game ever before take me back so very far into my gaming past. Way back, there was a game called Dungeon Master. It was the first adventure game I played, and this game replicates it perfectly in terms of gameplay. The game engine, the puzzles, everything about it just screams that this is one game that will take up a lot of your time.The gameplay itself is solid. You move on a grid, everything happens in real time, you have to eat, you sleep to regain health and mana, your torches burn out. So much management that most modern adventure games seem to miss, that add to the experience. The puzzles are well thought out, take effort to solve and are satisfying to get past. Combat is fast paced, requiring thought as well as a fast clicking finger.This is one game that remains true to the classic, old adventure games of gaming yore. Whether you remember that time or not, this is one experience not to be missed.			"

												Legend of Grimrock is one of a very small litter of games that attempts to create a classic dungeon crawler similar to those of the old days such as Dungeon Master and succeeds in not only emulating that style, but updating it enough to make it a refreshing experience for modern gamers, as well as a familiar one.A feature I found to be charming (as well as terrifying) was the option to play the game on a Classic difficulty that forces you to draw your own maps out on grid paper, much like old pen-and-paper tabletop games. I myself haven't been brave enough to give this playthrough a try yet, but I still find it to be a wonderful option for true gluttons of punishment.As deeply rewarding as it is challenging, with lots of replay value, and great Steam Workshop options to keep the game new for even the most frequent players, LoG is a for sure winner. I'll be eagerly awaiting the release of the second game, ready to brave the dangers between the dungeon walls once more.			"

												An extensive first person dungeon crawling RPG, with plenty of puzzles to solve and monsters to fight. The real time combat system is great, and the tile-based movement dosen't hinder gameplay at all. The puzzles are interesting and sometimes very difficult, and there is a level system and charactcer creation. Plus, you can make custom dungeons with the Dungeon Editor and download player-made dungeons.			"

												I never experienced any of the older games people compare to Legend of Grimrock, so I can't say how it stands up to the ""old school"" classics.  I can say I've been having lots of fun with Grimrock, though.  The puzzles are challenging in different ways (riddles, speed, problem solving) and the fighting style is like nothing I have played before.Some people say you have to have experienced and liked the older games in this style in order to like Grimrock.  I may be the exception to the rule, but I think even a player new to the type of game can find it enjoyable. I am looking forward to seeing how Grimrock 2 turns out.			"

												This right here.  Wizardry, Megami Tensei.  This is the future here.  Puzzles, exploration, a minimalist story, a creator's kit.  It's all good stuff.The Legend of Grimrock is a first person, real time dungeon RPG wherein you control a group of up to four prisoners dropped on the top of a dungeon mountain, given a trial by Tomb of Horrors.  You need to navigate through puzzles, traps and nopeworthy monsters, keeping in mind your placement and that of your enemies, the combinations needed for spells, the spaces in your inventory and much more to manage combat well.  It can be fast paced at times, and healing options are scarce between battles.  The environment and graphics are splendid, and while a bit short, it's cheap and offers a number of community made dungeons.  I dig it.			"

												I've been waiting for years for a game like this. Let's start with the fact that I'm a fan of ""Eye of the Beholder""-like games. You know... these first person RPGs with the primitive movement (one button click, one square-step) where you never see the sun and you're wandering in underground mazes full of puzzles dealing with buttons,plates, teleporters and the like.The game has pretty good visuals, certainly good enough for this kind of game. But the thing it excels at is the puzzles. The creators have achieved just the perfect level of difficulty. Plenty of puzzles that are not easy enough (plague of modern games) but not too tough on the other hand to make you quit the game. You get the satisfaction of solving a puzzle without hitting your head on the wall (except for maybe a couple of cases :)), one of the cornerstones of great gameplay.Overall the game is great and cannot recommend it enough!  Just hope there were more games like this one			"

Graphics are as good as needed, which shows a degree of style that most games companies lack. Just a good game.Drawback if there is one, is that this game will be the same every time you play it, or rather there is no random map or puzzles. Like myst, a walkthrough will ruin the game.			"

If you manage to beat the final boss (which is the most satisfying experience in life), you can still keep playing maps made by the community in the Steam Workshop, or you can use the map maker provided to create your own.

												An excellent RPG that really brings back the days of using pen and paper to play dungeon crawlers. The option to use the game's auto-map function, or pen and paper to manually map out your surroundings is fantastic because it gives players a nostalgic feeling when they used pencil and paper. Graphics are good and the puzzles are challenging, so I'd say that it's definitely worth the money. However, this game doesn't have any predefined goals other than to escape Mt. Grimrock, so if you're looking for any side quests, better you know now.			"

												This right here.  Wizardry, Megami Tensei.  This is the future here.  Puzzles, exploration, a minimalist story, a creator's kit.  It's all good stuff.The Legend of Grimrock is a first person, real time dungeon RPG wherein you control a group of up to four prisoners dropped on the top of a dungeon mountain, given a trial by Tomb of Horrors.  You need to navigate through puzzles, traps and nopeworthy monsters, keeping in mind your placement and that of your enemies, the combinations needed for spells, the spaces in your inventory and much more to manage combat well.  It can be fast paced at times, and healing options are scarce between battles.  The environment and graphics are splendid, and while a bit short, it's cheap and offers a number of community made dungeons.  I dig it.			"

You move and attack in real-time.The dungeons are static and are not randomly generated. The enemies are also not randomized in any way. This kills replayability for me.The graphics are great and the gameplay is strategic enough to keep interest up, but honestly speaking it's not really my type of game. I still recommend you buy it if you find the gameplay interesting!----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: -/5 (I didn't play long enough to get into it.)Gameplay: 3.5/5Challenge: 4/5Discovery: 2/5Replayability: 0/5Aesthetics: 4/5Visuals: 5/5Atmosphere: -/5 (I didn't play it enough.)Music: -/5 (Don't remember it well enough.)

												A throwback game to old-school Dungeon Crawler RPGs, Legend of Grimrock easily succeeds at that, with a feature that, I feel, should’ve been in all those old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear. It plays like one, it has absolutely no music, but rather, ambient sounds like none of them, it has hard fighting monsters like one, and in this review, that’s only scratching the surface. Let’s dig a bit deeper, and see what this game really offers.Gameplay: As mentioned earlier, Legend of Grimrock is a throwback to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of the late 80s to the early 90s (or at least, I think that’s when these games were hot) and it succeeds at what it set out to do, too. It’s setting is that of Mount Grimrock, a large dungeon inside a mountain, and every bit of it is in first-person. The combat is somewhat fast-paced, but not so fast that you have to be faster than greased lightning to be able to get through fights. Their are helpful hints, if a bit obscure in places, that tell you how to proceed, and plenty of puzzles and traps to slog your way through. Story: The story in Legend of Grimrock feels a lot more fleshed-out than those games from which it takes its inspiration, such as the Dungeon Master games. Basically, though, the whole story amounts to this: you and your party members are prisoners convicted of an unknown crime, and you have been promised your freedom if you can escape from the dungeons of Mount Grimrock. Problems is, is that no one has ever managed to escape from Mount Grimrock, or at least, those who’ve been pardoned in this manner never have. It’s cliché, yes, but it works as a good driving force, because you’ll want to see what the King or whoever it is that sentenced your party to be pardoned in this way since you’ll inevitably be the first ones to ever escape this fate, right? But it actually goes deeper than that, because your party has dreams telling them of an original prisoner in the dungeon who knows the way out. I won’t say anymore on the story, because then I’d have to spoil it for you, and that wouldn’t be any fun, now would it?Music: As I said earlier, this game only has one particular song, and it only plays on the title screen. It’s pretty good, too!Graphics: The graphics look like about what you’d be expecting from a Dungeon Crawler that takes its inspiration from Dungeon Master, but with a modern day take on them. They look like graphics that you’d see in a modern day game.Now, that’s everything that’s in the game itself, but the game’s true strength really shines with the built-in Dungeon Editor. That’s right! Now you can make the Dungeon Master dungeons of your dreams with a bit more interactivity, thanks to Lua scripting and the Drag-and-Drop editing power of the Dungeon Editor for Legend of Grimrock.Overall, an amazing successor to the old-school Dungeon Crawlers of Yesteryear, Legend of Grimrock is an obvious success, and it’s one in which I hope you can escape the shackles that will undoubtedly hold you to it and keep you coming back for more!

												Honestly some of the most fun I've had with an RPG in years. The atmosphere of the game is incredibly immersive, which is impressive given the way the game throws you into the midst of it with little background story. The puzzles range from mundane to incredibly complex, and require real wits to solve, though the game ocassionally offers hints in the form of notes left by a previous adventurer. The only negative is the sometimes repetitive combat, where your practically become invincible if you can get the correct pattern down. Nonetheless, the game has captured me, and I can't seem to put it down.			"

												Giving a simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down to Legend of Grimrock seems to me to miss the point of the game; it was consciously designed for a very specific audience, and your enjoyment will depend upon your belonging to said audience. I'd describe Grimrock as a puzzle game with an RPG overlay. You're dumped on top of a mountain and have to fight and puzzle your way through a series of dungeon levels in order to get to the exit at the bottom. There's an opening graphic about being condemned to the maze and offered a slim chance at survival as punishment for unspecified crimes, like eating puppies or promoting Justin Bieber's music or somesuch. Unimportant; it's a reason for your four-person party to wind up stuck in a dungeon. Players of the Recent Might and Magic X: Legacy will find it has less involved, less tactically sophisticated combat but much tougher puzzles (it pains me to admit that I got stumped fairly early on); you look for a hidden switch that opens a door somewhere on the other end of the level that leads to a dead end with another switch disguised as a torch sconce that when pulled opens the gate you saw three turns back which leads to a scrap of paper with a password on it for that magical barrier you couldn't get past before...I've given Legend of Grimrock a thumbs-up because it seems to do what it set out to do: it provides a series of tougher and tougher dungeon puzzles for the player to obsess over, with some simple combat to leaven it. The game's a bit like extra-dark chocolate in that respect: people who already find it to their taste will love it, while people who don't will find it has a bitter, gritty flavour that sort of reminds them of something they like.

												Legend of Grimrock is a solid old-school rpg game for rpg fans, nostalgia seekers, and gamers that wish to flex their creative muscles. The main story is about a band of 4 criminals who have commited treasonous crimes, and those crimes will only be pardoned if  they survive mount grimrock, a aincient nordic-looking cave atop a high moutain. The game sticks to its classic roots. There is a smooth and simple skill tree, races (that dont play too much of a part), and plenty of suprises and new foes to keep the game intresting. The game also supports Steam's workshop, to share and try out new dungeons. I had lots of fun scanning stone temple walls for hidden buttons, finding out new puzzles, such as a pressure plate that needs to be weighed down with a rock, in order to pass through.Overall, I would recommend this game to alot of my friends, but the old-school genre isn't for everyone. If you are used to a game such as Dark Souls II or the Elder Scrolls V, this may not be for you.My rating 8.5 / 10Keeps you coming back for more! "

												A stirling effort from Almost Human Games here in their (in my view) near, if not flawless re-visitation of a classic genre; it pays well - earned homage to the pioneers of the genre - Eye of the Beholder, etc - as without their contributions to the multifarious world of gaming, we would never have seen such a remarkable title, namely the Legend of Grimrock, nominally reflecting its plot seamlessly.In time, with further refinements, if even necessary, heeding the game industry's inexorable technological progression & evolution (possibly in the form of a sequel, alluded to by the game's dev's on the LoG website), I could easily expect their respectively held positions in gaming legend to invert, seeing LoG as one of the superlative titles of our generation, as its, in terms of genre, preceding titles were to theirs.

												Wizardry inspired gameplay with a friendly interface.  Atmosphere is intense.  The semi-turn based play is perfectly timed to make the dungeon dangerous.  Skills procide customization beyond the 3 base classes, keeping race selection vital. Magic is difficult yet fun.  A party well balanced to your personal style helps immensely.

												Ok, I just marathoned through Grimrock 1 and 2 and thought I would conclude that with a concise review.In short : the games are unbelievably good. Admittedly, this was the first time I've ever played a first person dungeon crawler with classic grid-based movement, but there is very little I can actually criticize.The puzzles are extremely well designed. Even though it usually took me few minutes to go from ""This♥♥♥♥♥♥makes no sense at all, what the hell!"" to ""ohhhh, I get it!"", it felt all the more rewarding when I finally managed to solve a particularly difficult puzzle all on my own.The first game manages to create a great gloomy atmosphere, when you delve into pitch black dungeons, devoid of any other human being, and when you can hear the various critters crawl somewhere on the other side of a wall. I would even say, it's not too far off from what a horror game feels like.The successor has a much more open and interconnected world, with differently themed areas, both above and below the surface, similar to how the first Dark Souls approached level design (including the bit where you aimlessly wander around in already cleared areas, looking for the entrance to the next dungeon). It may not be quite as eerie as the first Grimrock game, but the first mimic you encounter in the game will make sure to give you a heart attack regardless.The only thing left to say is : Don't play them on hard mode on your first play through, like I did, or else you're in for a lot of frustration. The games do have a few really cheap moments, the second one even more so than the first one. Because if there's one thing the developers really like, it's trying to make you fall down into a monster infested trap pit, which spells inevitable death. Few things are more infuriating than finding and activating a hidden switch on a wall, only to be mauled by a dozen monsters crawling in from all directions a few seconds later. Now, combine that with an incredibly clunky combat system (Grid-based attacks and movement. In real time. Why...?) which in itself poses enough of a challenge, when enemies can kill your front line in two hits, and you'll find yourself dangerously close to throwing something valuable out of the window. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who would have loved to have turn based battles, like in Wizardry 8 for example, in these games.			"

												A stirling effort from Almost Human Games here in their (in my view) near, if not flawless re-visitation of a classic genre; it pays well - earned homage to the pioneers of the genre - Eye of the Beholder, etc - as without their contributions to the multifarious world of gaming, we would never have seen such a remarkable title, namely the Legend of Grimrock, nominally reflecting its plot seamlessly.In time, with further refinements, if even necessary, heeding the game industry's inexorable technological progression & evolution (possibly in the form of a sequel, alluded to by the game's dev's on the LoG website), I could easily expect their respectively held positions in gaming legend to invert, seeing LoG as one of the superlative titles of our generation, as its, in terms of genre, preceding titles were to theirs.

												Wizardry inspired gameplay with a friendly interface.  Atmosphere is intense.  The semi-turn based play is perfectly timed to make the dungeon dangerous.  Skills procide customization beyond the 3 base classes, keeping race selection vital. Magic is difficult yet fun.  A party well balanced to your personal style helps immensely.  Now I wish Wizardry would take some cues from Grimrock!  ~ This from an alpha tester.  Has charm similar to Etrian Odessey.

												Legend of Grimrock is a truly superb game, but certainly not for everyone. It is a beautiful, thoughtful, old-style dungeon crawler, very much reminiscent of Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder, etc for those old enough to remember them. It combines the thrill of continual discovery with the satisfaction (and occasional frustration) of interesting puzzles and bouts of combat. It thankfully brings the genre back from the 'choke on your loot' approach of the recent Adventure RPGs, making each find much more interesting than ""is there an item here with purple text? No, into the bag of holding then"". In fact this is typical of a game that is much more thoughtful, even though at times it can also be frantic and panicked. And so if this is the type of game for you, you will certainly be very pleased with it, and indeed also with Legend of Grimrock II which is even better in every way, and notably improves the character advancement and takes you outdoors.But there will be a few who find Grimrock flat, in particular the combat. It's not particularly tactical - more about understanding your best approach to combat than doing anything particularly tactical in combat itself, and there are many players who find themselves using an endless circle/strafing approach to combat which definitely works, but isn't much fun. These old hands don't have the reflexes for that, and likely that's a good thing, because facing up to combat (at least on most occasions) tends to be much more fun in the can-I-make-it kind of way!And each to their own, but if you have qualms about looking up puzzle solutions online when they start to get frustrating, Grimrock (and especially Grimrock II) could have it's downsides. That said, there will also be many moments when you pat yourself on the back for being smart, and there aren't that many games that do that any more.What's it worth? £20 / $25			"

												Lengends of Grimrock, what the hell is that?  My first thought as I clicked on the link.  To my utter surprise this appeared to be a leap back in time to the wonderful dungeon exploration days of Dungeon Master & Eye of the Beholder.  Not only have they captured the soul from the Dungeon crawler era, they've improved upon it.  For the uneducated amongst you, Dungeon Master let you create a party of 4 and turn by turn you'd explore a dungeon mapping as you went, solving riddles and nasty puzzles whilst fighting creatures way too powerful for your team.  LoG has this option but wisely have included automapping (on squared maps for authenticity) with ability to write notes.  Graphics and sound are atmospheric with level design that not only tips the hat to the former greats in the genre but pushes it beyond.  I'm 5 levels in and hooked.  Each room you get to has hidden dangers and rewards to find.  The turn based mechanics have been sped up.  If you don't move the enemy will keep going.			"

												Yes, I know, it's a whiny statement, but let me kind of explain why I feel this way and perhaps it'll make more sense.I get the dungeon crawl concept. I've played them before, and roguelikes. Against all expectations, I beat the hardest of hardcore modes on Dungeons of Dredmor, I went through a couple playthroughs of Dark Souls, all that stuff. When I lose in those games, I feel it's because I did something to mess up, missed a move or made a wrong decision.With this game, there is no wrong decision to make, because no matter what you decide, you get thrown up against a difficulty spike that you can't possibly be ready for until you die at least once to it. If it isn't the obtuse puzzles that only make sense about half the time, it's the enemies that pop out of nowhere, can take forty times as many hits as any of your characters, and deal out damage that can kill you in seconds in a straight fight.I know a lot of people may disagree with this, and they certainly have a right to. But to me, this game isn't a challenge, or a dungeon crawl. It's just mashing my face against random walls in the hopes of finding a hidden switch, and getting killed a dozen times by the same overpowered monster group until I find the hidden cheese tactic that somehow lets me go down another floor.

												To make it short and sweet, this game can't decide what it wants to be. The base systems it sets up are sound, their levelling and RPG and class/team building mechanics are all solid and interesting.Then the combat throws all that out the window and makes you essentially try and play an FPS on a grid by circle strafing and dodging and such. There is little sense of type weaknesses, formation shuffling, tactical considerations, or any other interesting RPG type mechanics; just running around enemies and tapping the attack buttons until they die.This gets progressively worse throughout the game, with more and more ""bullet sponge"" enemies, until what might be the worst final boss fight I've had the displeasure to experience in a long time, in terms of lore, mechanics and comprehensibility.Maybe try that new Might and Magic game if you want an actual dungeon crawler, instead of a gridlocked FPS.

												Prepare to click. A lot. This game decides that the ideal way to make a game difficult and ""old school"" is to make the controls awful. There are no useful keyboard shortcuts for anything, and it employs realtime combat with you controlling all four party members. Making a game's controls awful to increase difficulty doesn't make it fun, just frustrating.Click to attack, click to move, click to turn, click to cast a spell, click to open your inventory, it gets old very fast. I couldn't even stomach a second hour of play, and I normally love games with old school themes or mechanics. I honestly think it got such good reviews because the genre is starved for this sort of old dungeon crawl, rather than another Minecraft-like. But they could have done much, much better.			"

												The game started off being very entertaining, but it became less and less of an RPG and more of a ""twitch"" reflex game. I had to quit at level 6 where you are required to press three different buttons in sequence with absolutely no room for thought or planning. If you enjoy very fast complicated key strokes with split second timing, this may appeal to you. If you want a real RPG, look else where.			"

												As the game begins, you are released into a grimdark dungeon crawler that looks to be fantastic. This is veneer. As the game progresses, cracks appear most aggresively in terms of the combat. Fighting enemies begins to turn into a game of slow speed kiting. This is the fundamental problem with doing tile based combat in real time. Most puzzles seem to work properly, but more than a few are entirely unintuitive.The problems with this game are really unfortunate. It has such promise, but lets you down consistently.			"

												While I like the idea of dungeon crawlers Legend of Grimrock is simply too rough around the edges to recommend. At the time of writing this review I have completed the first three levels of the game with a Human Warrior, Minotaur Warrior, Human Rogue and Insectoid Mage party.Almost nothing is explained wellThe tutorial is a series of images that explain the most basic concepts of the game. The tooltips when you mouse over attributes or skills give you essentially flavour text. They don't really explain exactly what affects they will have which is a crucial part of RPGs like this where you really can't afford to waste points.I was constantly Googling trying to get clarification as to what exactly certain attributes or skills would do. A lot of times I got linked to the Steam forums where players seemed to be debating amongst themselves exactly what the affects were. The reason this irked me so much is that this is the prototypical old school RPG where you can easily spend points on stuff that is essentially useless and with no ability to respec it makes it really easy to make mistakes and which then feels like you have neutered your character.The combat is way too repetiveI'm about three hours in and so far the combat has essentially boiled down to right click on all four characters to have them take a swing, wait a couple seconds and repeat. There is no real strategy in how you attack, at least not yet.My melee classes have a weapon and a shield because it seems that high evasion is an absolute must for frontline fighters. However this means that they basically can do nothing except right click every couple seconds. Rogues in theory could have a bit of variety because you don't need a shield if your in the back row and could have two things equipped but the problem is that you can't attack with both. Any attack puts both equipped items on cooldown. This caries over to the mage who after they cast a spell has to wait again.For all of these reason combat becomes incredibly repetitive and boring. Perhaps it gets better later on and you get more ability to strategize but I am three hours into the game and it feels incredibly dumbed down to me. I'm sure some people reading this review are saying ""you're suppose to move a lot in combat"" and while I tried doing that it was no fun at all. Since you have to move on a grid it's essentially like chasing a younger sibling around the kitchen table. You can literally run in circles and the enemy can't hit you and while it is a valid strategy running around in circles for hours is by no means fun in my books.Old school grindingYou know how a lot of people talk about how games make ""quality of life"" improvements because developers realized that many of their game mechanics were simply there to elongage the time the user spent playing and actually really agitated the user? This game took all of those lessons and ignore them and instead went back to the old school Dungeons & Dragons mindset.Simple things like mages burn through their energy far faster than rogues or warriors so they become useless faster and require constant rest or trips to the life crystals to restore their energy.Health regenerates so slow that after a battle you often have to sit and wait to heal back up. Otherwise you're spending a couple minutes running back and forth between the afformentioned life crystals.Perhaps all of this wouldn't be an issue if the game dropped health or energy potions but in my three hours of playing I have only got enough ingredients to make four health potions and you will burn through them almost instantly.The straw the broke the camels back for me was the spiders on level 3. I had the best armor I could get at this point in the game as far as I am aware. Full light armor for both my warriors and they both had over 100 hp but the spiders would still hit for 20+. So I could take a max of three spiders back to back before my party was completely wiped and I had to take a couple minutes to properly heal.The kicker was that these spiders can poison you and of course poison means damage over time. Problem is the same ingredients you need to make health potions are the same ingredients you need to make antidotes and even if I made antidotes instead of health potions I would only have made four of them. I easily fought over 20 spiders and got poisoned over a dozen times. It would not have made any difference and I still would have had to run back to the life crystal a dozen times just to cure my poison because the game did not give out proper resources.In my mind these kind of games should be about battle strategy and how you use medicine during a battle is part of the strategy. But after four battles if you're completely tapped and the only strategy then is to cheese by running around the kitchen table well then I think that means something went wrong during the design of the game.Cool idea but bad executionLike I said in the first sentence of this review, I really like the idea behind this game. Crawling through a massive dungeon while overcoming the challenges inside. I just didn't think the challenges would be limited resources and knowledge of playing ring-a-round the rosie.			"

												Probably a pretty cool game overall?  Will never know, though.  First two levels were fun but the third introduced spiders that decimated my fighters (which were already skewed towards defensive stats) unless I took every spider one-on-one and did a stupid little dance to exploit the AI's inability to turn quickly.  I was willing to keep going until the game thought it would be ""cute"" to trap me between two sets of 3+ spiders by having a set pop out of a hidden room.  I couldn't even just attempt to gun it for the exit because a swarm of impassable spiders continually covered the tiles leading to the next room.  Tried all manner of consumables just to clear a tile so I could maaaybe escape - nada.What goes through a dev's brain when he designs something like this?Edit: Did some additional reading on this level.  When the prevailing advice from hardcore fans of your game is ""exploit doorways, rest after every fight, and savescum"", your design has problems.			"

												This game is great in that it brings back an old-style game. Unfortunately, they didn't only bring back the good things, but all the bad things as well. That, to me, is just unforgivable. They should have improved on the game-play aspect but haven't. Especially the user interface (GUI, mouse, keyboard) are downright terrible.ProsNice graphics.ConsThe turning and looking is annoying.The combat, especially magic, is downright terrible.Inventory management is incredibly weak.Mini-map is absent (constantly pressing tab is non-fun busy-work).The enemies just stand there and hit you while you slowly walk backwards. The IQ of the AI is nonexistent. "

												The Legend of Grimrock is a fun and entertaining dungeon crawler role-playing game that really captures the core of the genre. Elements from Dungeons & Dragons and like games have been incorporated into the Legend of Grimrock and with great success. Coming from a person who normally doesn't like dungeon crawlers, this is definitely an amazing game! As if it could get any better, a dungeon editor is available, which allows players to build their own customizeable dungeons and share their creations with other players. This game contains many features for the player to explore and customize, as well as stimulating puzzles that can really boggle your mind. Although the puzzle aspect of the game pervades and dominates over the action or dialogue, the Legend of Grimrock is nevertheless an exciting RPG that revitalizes the dungeon crawler genre!			"

												I used to like this style of dungeon crawler in the 90s but it really feels dated now. This game had me panic quite a lot. Not sure if I liked the puzzles in it either. It was a solid effort to connect me to my past but Im not sure if I really missed it afterall. I just said no to this game because I feel like I am well and truly past that part of my life and if others are in the same position I'd give it a miss. But YES if you do miss it.			"

												I had few problem with this game. First I thought it was turned based like the classic games of this genre I played in the past. The game is in real time.  Not a huge problem so lets go on.  All the levels look the same. The game looks boring.  There seems to be only one tile set.  The bigget problem is the controls. The game moves like a tank.  If you hold down a movement key you can over shoot the spot you wanted to stop at. This because a big problem when dealing with timed puzzles and traps. The one thing that made me drop the game is that timing is directly related to screen resolution and graphic card power.  There were traps and puzzles that were impossible to get through without lowering my resolution to reduce the speed of the trap.   Now this is mainly a hardware issue for people that good graphic cards.   However, I feel the game was  poorly designed  for the traps they had. The limited classes and portraits just added to my let down but didn't effect the game much.  For me this is a insult to the old school dungeon crawlers I played in the past.			"

												I went into this game thinking it was a dungeon crawling RPG. It walks like one, quacks like one, and a whole lot of people seem to think it is one.This, however, is a Tomb Raider game. From the fixed item locations, to the limited use/high power dynamic of bombs, to mashing attack while jumping around like an idiot, to timed switch flipping, to the literal treasure hunting, to the inexplicable end boss, this is through-and-through a classic Tomb Raider game.Is it a good Tomb Raider game though? Eh, kinda. Better than Tomb Raider 3. Like Tomb Raider the game would be much improved by more complex movement options, but it still does most of what's possible in the limited vocabulary it offers. I was disappointed, but I did not feel my time was wasted.Note for laptop owners: thanks to a bug in the game's trackpad recognition several timed puzzles will be much harder than they need to be. They're still possible, but will require frame perfect accuracy.			"

												Great atmosphere, a lot of nostalgia, but I dislike the mechanic of combat...Combat is more like a quick time event game, but without warning you when your characters will go ready to attack again. In a moment they are disable and instantly are enable without any clue.Even in the first combats you will take some unnecessary damage and become frustraded...			"

												This is an absolutely beautiful game. But that's the only good thing I can say.I *really* wanted to like this game. I adore roguelikes and I used to play games just like this in DOS. However, combat nothing but tediously waiting for cooldowns to finish so that I can click for the next attack. Enemies have way too much health, so fights are too long (hint: more enemies with lower health makes for better games). Making the game real time rather than turn based was a major mistake, because it turns everything into a reflex clickfest. This is exactly why I didn't like Lands of Lore from way back, but at least that game had a story and voice acting and such. "

												Welcome to Hell, here's your complimentary puzzle.I mean, when I bought this as an ""old school dungeon game"", I expected more of a hardcore RPG with hours spent contemplating the best possible course to develop a character. I expected to be there all the way to see a sorry mageling through every challenge and help him grow into an arcane terror of epic proportions.I didn't expect a game where the best viable party are two unarmed rogues in the front row and two ranged rogues in the rear, and I certainly didn't expect the ability to mash buttons in a specific sequence or play reverse dodgeball with a swarm of white fireballs to be the only decisive skill in this game. Well... logic helps, too, I guess.Still, I'm having a great time and I have no idea why.			"

												I've noticed a trend in my reviews: I tend to only review games that I have a negative opinion of. NOT ANY MORE!I thought this game was very good. Not amazing, or fantastic, but very good. The puzzles can be diabolical, and the boss fight at the end can be a frustrating test of patience, but overall, Almost Human did a great job with it. Combat is almost always fast-paced and hectic (trying to click on the right runes for a mage while trying to dodge attacks from multiple enemies is a blast), the graphics are rather impressive, the puzzles are satisfying (for the most part), and the variety of enemies is very welcome indeed.Many games of this genre can get boring, as they are truly turn-based, and you can take your time, but not with this game. Your characters have a food (hunger) bar that continually shrinks, even when standing still. Add to that the fact that food is not by any means a common find in the dungeons, and you have a real motivation to always keep moving. There were a few places where you could grind for food, and I wish I hadn't discovered that fact, as it took away quite a bit of the urgency of the situation. If/when you play through, I would strongly suggest you not take advantage of any grinding opportunities you come across (they won't be too easy to find anyway), as the game is fair about food, and will give you as much as you need. With my grind, by the end of the game, all my characters were slightly overburdened with food that I refused to throw away.Character designing is a lot of fun, and trying different combos of teams adds quite a bit of replay value, although certain teams work a lot better together than others. Puzzle solutions are always sensical, although some of them are rather esoteric. Clues on pieces of paper and random items you find are almost always relevant to puzzles, so keep your wits about you.Overall, this game is an example of just about everything done just about perfectly. It's not an easy game, but it's not punishingly difficult either. It never asked for more than I could give, but it was always close.Plus, indie team. Always awesome.			"

												Growing up I would often play games on my fathers DOS only PC (I know right, a PC without Windows/Mac, crazy huh?). One of the games that I would often play was Eye of the Beholder. I would never make it past the second dungeon but that was ok with me, I just enjoyed making my party and exploring the awesome dungeons. As I got older I would ocassionally look EotB up and give it a try. And on one such occasion I came across this gem of a game. At the time, this game was in development. But I wanted it so bad I could taste it. When the game was finally released I waited up all night for them to E-Mail me my download link. I did nothing but play this game for the next two days. All I can do is give my heavy reccomendation that everyone play this game. It is a total throwback to old school dungeon crawling RPG's. The game plays so flawlessly and true to the original style that I sometimes forget that it is now 2014, and go back in time to my childhood. Serioulsy, buy this game.			"

												I'm going to offer a dissenting opinion on this one, because it seems all the other grognards can't seem to take off their rose-tinted glasses and put on their real prescription lenses. Furthermore, this review is going to be different from most of the others, in that I'm going to focus on the controls. Read on and you'll see why.Essentially, this is the most awkward-controlling dungeon crawl I've ever played. It shouldn't be actively difficult to get my characters to do what I want. A lot of people defending the control scheme will say that this is how the old games played. Which old games, exactly, had controls like this? I played the old Wizardry. I played the old Might and Magic. I played the old Ultima. Those are the first in the CRPG genre, and they all managed to be much easier to handle than this. FFS, the old Wizardry games made you type out the spell names! No, scrambling to manage a UI during real-time combat doesn't simulate the rush of combat--it just serves to frustrate me. Having to click on a small area of the screen with speed and accuracy isn't nostalgic, since all the firsts of the genre didn't have mouse input. It's scientifically-proven bad design. Yes, there's real science behind it: it's called Fits's Law. Maybe if you're a twitch gamer you'll like this, but I just found it frustrating and tiresome.I grew up playing the firsts of the genre, and Grimrock doesn't resemble them at all--or if it does, I wasn't able to get to a point where I could appreciate it, because the controls are so bloody difficult. This game was an exercise in awkwardness and frustration that I haven't felt while gaming in a very long time. Don't confuse bad game design with challenge: the two are distinctly different.			"

												I remember the first RPG I played on my very own first gaming system. The 8-bit NES. It was a dugeon crawler. The name was Swords & Serpents. It was a difficult one. With four different characters struggling through the mazes with only a few things in my mind. To level up, to find better equipment, to search for traps and secrets. Constantly threatened by wandering monsters, stronger every floor, and pay attention to traps and secrets every step you make for just that one bottle of potion extra, a few gold coins or that very nice piece of armor.Altough the genre was not so popular that moment but I enjoyed it a lot. I remember myself sitting in front of my big old TV with pen and paper to write down passwords en to map the maze. Many, many times the the devs try to make a RPG or dungeon crawler type of games to enjoy fighting monsters, hunting for treasure while exploring the dungeons. I enjoyed the Might and Magic series, but always after a few hours playing I can’t stand the graphics of that game. I think the game what reminds me most of my first experience was Wizardry 8. The graphics where great the moment from release (now still acceptable) and it was huge, with a lot of items, spells and exploring.When I saw the first screenshots of Legend of Grimrock I was hoping that this was a real modern version of my first experience. But I was skeptical. The graphics on the screenshots looked too good to be true. I thought that because of this beautiful graphics for sure the gameplay itself isn’t that good. I was disappointed a lot with modern versions of old games lately.With the SummerSales for I gave it a shot and after a few hours playing I’m blown away! It looks beautiful indeed. Even on my 3 year old laptop. The graphics are so polished and so smooth. I really like the style. Also stones are real stones with different width and height. That’s cool. No flat textures anymore. The lighting is fabulous. And the mouse freelook is very comfortable to inspect the first time you enter a room. That the rest of the movement is not free movement is only a good thing. It’s easy concentrate on the environment when walking around and you have time enough to inspect walls for loose stones to find secrets. I found A very balanced set of items for my first party in my first dungeon. If you want to reach the end you also need to use all your items carefully. Don’t throw away a little stone, take that +1 old armor and that shoes in the corner of the room. It can make the difference between more down one dungeon level or a single trip to hell.The monster movement is realistic and they look really good. The fighting is also very innovative, fast but fair. Just prepare yourself and click on the right time on your weapons to use them. It’s a little bit real-time and a little bit turn based. A good combination to keep you excited, but no need to be a master in keyboard combinations. The interface is totally friendly and slick.You can see the makers of this game are real interested in the genre and in my opinion deliver a great game for hardcore RPG, exploring, dungeon crawler, magic, fantasy, dungeons and dragons fans. But also a game what is very easy to learn, but hard to master, for the casual or newcoming gamers.What maybe for some people is one reason to consider is I didn't see too much of storytelling. Do not expect pages of information about things happens around you and history about the world you play in. There is not. For me that is not an issue. What you can expect is small notes with important information or text written on the walls. Even in the start of the game you have the possibility to not automap the game so you can go back to the good old days to make your own map! But it's optional.The character building as well isn't very complicated. It's the most basic skills and stats what you can have in game. But they are all there and it's very clear to see directly what effect the numbers have on different skills and stats.What is really make this game oustanding is the complexity of carefully exploring the level where you are in.Every move count, every choice of action you make count and for every single item it counts how, who and when you use it. That is gaming!I hope this game is give you the same great experience what I had with my first game in this genre. "

												OH DEAR GOD. Ok let me first stress how picky I am about games. I immediatly hated the halo series from Halo 2 onwards, for one reason. Master Chief going through re-entry into the atmosphere. I've played games since I was 4. I am now 22. FF7 was my favourite game for years with other favourites being Earthbound, Clocktower and Chrono Trigger. THIS GAME JUST TOOK THE SPOT OF MY FAVOURITE GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. BUY IT NOW.			"

												Legend of Grimrock misleads the buyers to think it would be an oldschool dungeoncrawler. When in reality its a puzzlecrawler!Puzzle are chained after each other, so you get the feeling after some hours of playing, that if you manage to solve a puzzle, the reward is a puzzle, who would have guessed...It gets really boring, when you simply wanna crawl through a dungeon, but have to solve one thing after the other. Puzzles in general would be fine, but they're mostly just walking the wrong way until you find the right one. Rarely there are real puzzles to solve.There are some good things I can't deny, the game looks great and would be a real blast if it would be a real dungeoncrawler. A good thing is you can play the playermade dungeons. The original game though just gives me the feeling it was designed this way, to mislead the player into thinking the game had decent length. (really short)I bought the game at full prize, because of the overhyped reviews people give and the misleading promoting the makers give on their side, I quote directly from their website: "" The ultimate dungeon crawling RPG"", which isn't the case. (too short, nothing inovative, monster fighting is boring)Hope this helps someone, expect alot of puzzles! And by a lot, I mean a lot! If it's something you don't mind. Then feel free to buy it, its great if you like to play puzzle into puzzle into a bit dungeoncrawling into more puzzles.Atleast the Custom maps are worth a try!TLDR: 80% Puzzle 20% Dungeon, not the other way around! Misleading advertising! Wait for discount before buying or you may be dissappointed!Only a 5/10			"

												I wanted to really like this game because the character creation was pretty fun and you got to have your own character portraits for you party! Additionally, the puzzles that I got to were pretty interesting. Sadly, the combat system--which you will be forced into experiencing in between many puzzles, over and over again--is really lacking in terms of engagement, time economy, and variety. This is at least true in the beginning and was enough to convince me to stop playing.			"

												I'm a big fan of dungeon crawlers but this game was not fun to me at all. The world and visual style didn't really interest me and I found the mechanics not especially noteworthy either. The biggest drawback for me though was the real-time grid-based nature of the game. For me, these two elements combine horribly. If something is going to be grid-based it needs to be turn-based too, especially when its first-person, or else it feels terribly clunky.			"

												The game was a bit to old school for me. It's basically in the style of the early might and magic games. However, I'm not a particularly nostalgic person, and I think that M&M was designed around the technology limits of the time. It was never really fun, or a good way of navigating a 3D space with a party of characters.I ended up turning off around 3 hours in when I realised basically all the fights devolve into a 'square dance', where you circle the enemy (or rather, move around them in a square) and take pot shots. It's really not very fun, or particularly strategic.			"

												A respectful and authentic homage to all the aspects of the real time grid based dungeon crawler that killed that subgenre in the first place.There are just too many mechanics that are pointlessly obtuse or poorly designed, from the combat that doesn't even try to correct for the fact that it's taking place on a rigid grid where the enemies act much more slowly than you, to the muddy textures making it difficult to notice items that are lying in front of you.I eventually quit because I felt that I couldn't correctly play the game without a walkthrough. Not because of the puzzles, I liked those, but because I kept finding treasure rooms and leaving them having missed half of the items, some of them critical for progression. Between that and the terrible combat, I wasn't getting anything out of the game.			"

												Lots of mixed feelings about Grimrock.  I had fun while playing it for sure, but the visuals are reptetitive, the interface is weird, and the controls are awful—trying to be cute and nostalgic by only allowing you to turn 90 degrees at a time.  But the worst part is that a game so full of secret buttons and levers and rooms requires you to find most of them.  This is a HARD game, and I can't imagine being able to complete it without finding a decent chunk of all of the tiny little hidden buttons in the walls, which means carefully inspecting every single surface of the dungeon, often with some sort of time requirement, or alt-tabbing to a guide (this one's awesome by the way: http://guides.gamepressure.com/legendofgrimrock/ ).  And that was fun and nostalgic for a while, but was incredibly tedious by the end.  (And even the Might and Magic games of more than 20 years ago didn't make me hunt for the pixel to click on.)			"

												The most important thing to understand about this game is that it absolutely is not ... not ... an old-school RPG.  If you are looking for an old-school RPG this is not what you're looking for.  I would go so far as to say the suggestion that it is an old-school RPG is borderline false advertising.This is a puzzle game wrapped in the trappings of an old-school RPG, and played in real time rather than turn-based.  Combat is a dance puzzle with button mashing.  There are no tactics.  Magic is encumbered with rune selection, which must be done in real time, making casters a liability.  Rogues are just another combatant, there is no thieving.There is no story to speak of.  When you're not solving puzzles, you are seeking hidden buttons and pattern differences in wall tiles.Is it fun?  Yes, it's not bad as far as puzzle games go, nor is it anything special.  Yet, it's nothing but a puzzle game and that wasn't what I wanted.  I usually avoid Indie games, and now I will never buy an Indie game again.  I feel like I was conned, and robbed, and that this game has been intentionally marketed to fool old-school gamers for profit.			"

												I wanted to like this one. Really, I did. I'm all about old school RPGs, it comes with the Jim Sterling seal of approval, and I enjoy games that let me throw my own content in a bit, like with the portriats...That said, I couldn't do it. The combat is tiresome, tedious, and unrewarding. The interface is clunky and amatuerish. The bestiary is lifeless, the puzzels are unfulfilling, and worst of all, there's no dialog for all intents and purposes. This is as souless of a dungeon crawler as I've ever seen, devoid of wit, story, motivation, and wholly undeserving of the level of hype it's gotten. I can put up with it's old timey grid gimmick - maybe even enjoy the novelty some. But that's all that it brings to the table, and it isn't anywhere near enough. The interface needs a complete overhaul, the combat needs a lot of work, and for the love of Skyrim put some plot and dialog in! A straight up dungeon crawl can work, but you really need to frame it better - give me more of a world, give me context and a story. Give me details and motivation and reward me with more than a set of stairs and a big spoonful of the exact same thing I just did. I gave it a chance, and it isn't for me.			"

I think this game strives more for appealing to people who have nostalgia for old-school games like Eye of the Beholder, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that - it's just that, coming from this with my perspective of just wanting to have a fun time, this game wastes a lot of my time doing pointless things that aren't really fun for me.If you like this style of game, definitely check it out.

												Concept: a band of four prisoners is taken to the dungeon of Grimrock for their crimes, where none thus far have ever escaped.Gameplay: despite its appearance, it is NOT turn-based. It's realtime, although most enemies' movements have LONG delays. You navigate on a strict grid and cannot cut diagonals. The combat consists of clicking weapons and hoping for special attacks, or clicking magic and casting your own damn spell. Not that the rune system really helps you.Graphics: look closely and you'll notice that the texture on the face of every wall is exactly the same. The graphics, even aside from the walls, are pretty lazy, although the monsters are fine. However, the headbobbing of moving around is a wonderful way to get sick.Audio: no music. Just generic, boring ambience and a single audio effect for each monster that you get to hear 20 times a minute.Difficulty: dungeon crawler. It has difficulty settings, although I have only played one difficulty thus far, so I've no idea what the difficulty affects.Synopsis: hardly worth $15(but I got it cheaper) unless you're really into dungeon crawlers.

												This is like an updated and reimagined Dungeon Crawler like Dungeon Magic, Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder, or the Ravenloft PC games of the 90's. Simply brilliant game. Nice, catchy and pretty hardcore. The graphics, sounds and overall atmosphere in this game are so realistic, awesome, and just gives you chills because of the creepiness. The puzzles are very challenging, although it took a while to figure them out.  I got stuck like about 3 times, so i had to look at a playthrough video. This game is also very action packed, and it also can get scary, especially the screams of death. One night I played with my speakers turned up, the scream of death woke up my brothers wife and she came running to my room. When she opened the door,she saw a minotaur on my monitor, and screamed her lungs out as if she saw a ghost because her eyes couldnt take such epicness.  There are a lot of ways to die in Grimrock and if you're not paying attention, taking the time to search out better gear and learn to craft potions, you're going to have a difficult time with it. However, there's a great feeling of accomplishment as you traverse each floor, defeating powerful monsters and figuring out puzzle solutions on your own. I also like how this game has its own website and community, with people making mods, and helping out eachother. Definitely a game worth buying			"

												The feel and presentation are superb but the actual game mechanics themselves leave much to be desired. By that I mean theres little depth to the RPG elements or they simply do not properly work. Playing a rogue for example, putting points into Missile weapons gains you Dex points, which affect your ability to hit in Melee, but not from a distance. Ranged attacks always hit something in front of you. Dex does not increase your damage with ranged atacks so by extension if you focus on using a bow for one of your characters, you'll build a stat that is nearly useless to them. This is by definition bad game design. Furthermore, I admire loot being hard to comeby, but not supporting all builds from the outset is dumb. If you're doing the above and making one of your characters an archer, then I hope to god you find the secret bow on level 3 or else you've been literally screwed. This is a game that should promote and reward exploration with better and special equipment but instead twists your arm into looking up secrets online to get the most basic of equipment.Overall, if you love the concept of this game then buy the sequel or stick to user made dungeons.

												The first few levels are fun enough, but the game lacks depth and every mission is similar to the last in one endless dungeon.  I feel like the game designers punish mistakes far too heavily.  If you don't use the perfectly optimal build and character types, you'll run into a brick wall of difficulty halfway through the game.			"

												Lost all interest in playing further on the 3rd level.  Constantly getting poisoned by spiders and walking back to the heal crystal was not fun.  The real time combat makes it impossible for your ""archer"" to switch to other throwing weapons when they run out of arrows, while you're trying to dance around in circles around the fast spiders (as almost every hit = a poisoned char.).  Getting trapped in place by enemies, not fun.  Spellcasting system is ludicrous in real time as well.  It wouldn't be as bad if your charcters had any tankiness to them, but even 1 on 1 with enemies you die real fast if you are not constantly able to side step all the time around them.			"

It adds many improvements coming from being more modern, like great graphics, better sounds, better designed controls, choice of automap or not, and more. There's plenty great puzzles, great fights (hint, use movements during fights), great levels design and an excellent exploration. It's old school RPG brought into modern time in a perfect way and as you never believed it will happen. For me the RPG of the year 2012.			"

												Ug. I don't know. I like the IDEA of this game - but it fails to pull me in. It is quite difficult. This is a situation when the reminiscent memories of gaming past are better kept in your head than revisiting it for real. Graphics are nice, and the oldschool feel is right (except combat is in realtime). Puzzles are quite frustrating too. I guess I just don't have the patience for this kind of dungeon crawler anymore - it just feels so dumb in my brain compared to modern dungeon crawlers that have much more to offer than 'pull a lever', 'open door', 'move to next level'.Sorry, I would have to pass.

What do you mean you dont have time to go looking at every individual tile on the wall, just on the hunch that one of them might have a hidden stone. What do you mean, you have a job, and dont want to spend your few spare hours that you set aside for gaming after work looking at wall tiles. What do you mean you don't have much spare money, and this game is all you can afford, and you expect more from a developer. You just can't appreciate games based on values which were developed under the extreme restrictions of old hardware, and which are entirely outdated. No you're upset. You just don't understand. It's designed this way for a reason.			"

												Though the editor is surprisingly involved and you can invest quite a bit of time in creating an interesting little dungeonscape of your own, the lack of resources and rather lackluster content overall is further dimmed by the particularly dull adventure that is Legend of Grimrock.For all purposes, it's your typical ""My First Dungeons & Dragons Campaign"" path, replete with all the usual cliches, poorly balanced scenarios, and wondrously dull combat that works a little bit better with a pen, paper, and a fistfull of dice than a mouse and several buttons to keep track of.While the content itself is fine and the dedication to detail in the terrains and creatures quite stellar, the game is surprisingly dull in its execution and eventually falls into the same barely differentiated chambers and puzzles/traps, from which the only escape is abuse of the built-in Map function and a little tedium.Hardcore fans of the (early) tabletop world that want to add a Rogue-like and 3D element to the table will likely get some enjoyment out of it and its nostalgic feel.

												This game is simply not for me.  Why you ask?  Because I seem to solve puzzles differently than how the game developer intended in Legend of Grimrock.  The game itself is fairly good for a dungeon crawler, with decent graphics, simple gameplay, and not too demanding hardware specifications.  The game relies on solving a series of puzzles and finding things to advance to the next level.  The game is linear, and if you don't solve the problem in the exact manner intended by the game developer, you WILL BE STUCK, like I've been.The first time I time I played, I used a custom party of 1 fighter, 1 rogue, 2 mages, and I found the mages to be useless cheerleaders due to a lack of access to spells.  No problem.  Start a new game.  Second round of 2 fighters, 1 rogue, 1 mage seemed to be a better fit for the challenges awaiting me on level one.  However, there was a portion of the dungeon with 1 pit and 2 pressure plates, with snails waiting behind the gate.  I got past the pit with no trouble, and the gate lifted.  However, during the encounter I moved off the plate, and the gate slammed shut, with no way to lift.  From my previous playthrough with my abandoned party, I knew that this area was important in order to advance to the next stage.  With no way to lift the gate, I was stuck.  Thus, I needed to restart the level.Moving on to level 2, I almost cleared out the entire dungeon, if I could only find the two keys for the keyholes to the left and right out of gate, with a portal beckoning me to enter.  Unfortunately, I got stuck again.  Why? Because at the portion of the dungeon with two hidden rooms, I did not realize there was a second hidden room, with a key located there. I found 1 key in the room past the teleport trap, and used it.  When I retraced my step, I couldn't get the door to the second hidden room to open no matter how many times I pressed the hidden switch.  It appears that by using the key, I broke the script.  So now I've put five hours into the game, and I'm looking at the prospect of a third restart of the game.  Not worth it. :(			"

And about it saying Five hours Playtime it was launched on it's own which for some reason it was lanched after it finished even though I have it in my settings to NOT launch games automatically. All I got from this game was three giant snails that I somehow manage to lose my only weapons to, a human wizard, a minotaur warrior, a insectoid assassin, and a Lizard mage; Honestly this game sucks it was a good Idea but it was not fleshed out enough AND It launched without my permission on my computer racking up 5 hours of playtime, which is way over the 2 hour maximum on refunds...p.s. this is the SECOND game I have given a bad review, and the first I can't get a refund on.

												As an original fan of the Dungeon Master Series Legend of Grimrock held quite a bit of appeal for me. The game almost perfectly emulates  the gameplay of the classic series while bringing the visuals nicely up to date.GAMEPLAYSimilar to another Classic Series (Elder Scrolls), LoG casts you in the role of Prisoners being exiled for unknown reasons into the catacombs of Mount Grimrock. The focus of the gameplay is on combat and puzzle solving, the latter of which can sometimes be maddeningly frustrating, but very satisfying when you finally work it through.While you have complete freedom to go anywhere you want within the dungeon movement is grid based and fixed to the cardinal directions, up, down, left, right, and turning.  Some people (mostly new school gamers) find this limitation madden and arbitrary, but it plays an important role in gameplay and tactics.STORYThe story is there, but is very, very light. There are lots of little bits and pieces of info scatterd throughout (esp the story of former dungeon Denzien Toorum). You're ultimately left with more questions than answers, but you don't walk away feeling unsatisfied, and that's what the expanded Story in Grimrock 2 is for as well.In general if you are fan of or think you will enjoy the old grid based style then you'll like this game. But if you're not, pass			"

												I played a lot of old school puzzles and walkthroughs. This game was highly recommended as an old school player. HOWEVER the designers put in a lot of ""time based"" actions puzzles where you have to do go through a repetitive sequence to progress. Basically what happens is that you sit at one puzzle and practice your timing skills for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and obvious puzzle that only difficult because of the time constraints.  No room for error or a slight goof.  This breaks the game as you spend 5 minutes on the real challenging puzzles and 10 hours on trying to get the timing down for the timing related"" puzzles.The movement system is a step, wait, step wait, step wait, wait for the computer to catch up while it mobs attack unmercifully.  You basically become a cheese monkey for the whole game by finding a door, attacking the over powered mobs, shutting the door resting and repeat. Occasionally the game gives you a big screw you and locks you in a room with over powerd mobs and kills you. The mob power and character balance setting on this game makes it a ""B' class game.It much like playing dungeons and dragons with munchkins.The game is only worth ""B"" grade price, no more then 5$			"

												Grimrock is beautifully crafed and oozes with atmosphere and old-school charm. Unfortunately it sets no higher goals for itself; it merely puts a spit shine on the past, without attempting to update or modernize any of the rickety old systems that make up its core gameplay. It makes no effort to evolve, and that, ultimately, is why the game fails; it is content with mediocrity in every area that matters, while being exceptional in those that do not. It's entertaining and nostalgic, but I can't recommend it on any other terms.			"

												A strategic Adventure filled with Secrets to find & puzzles to solve. This dangerous dungeon crawler takes place in a mythical era of Ancient Magics & Technology. You’ll begin as a group of 4 prisoners tossed into an Ancient prison and left for dead. A team of unlikely characters, 2 in front 2 in back. I suggest melee weapons in front, magic and throwable/range weapons in the rear. Easy controls, you can set the movement command to the Number keys which was much easier for me. While in a room with a pillar in the middle you can use this to your advantage to circle around backwards to kill a difficult enemy. As you venture thru you’ll find yourself being manipulated by a technological being that was magically sealed within a mountain and a prison built around it by a mysterious and long forgotten race. Along the way you’ll face a wide range of enemies & find a variety of items and equipment to use to develop your characters strength and wisdom.			"

I like the ""old school"" concept of games but everytime someone does one they utilize everything everyone did not like about old school games instead of the things we did like.  Five minutes in you're stuck at a puzzle you cannot solve (from what I've seen most people had to look it up on you tube).  A minute after that, you're stuck at another one that's even worse.  This is not what I think of when I think of an old school party driven dungeon crawl.  If you like to be stuck for hours on end trying to figure out how to solve something with zero visual clues and zero intuitive gameplay - then this is your game.

												Wizardry, Bards Tale, Dragon Wars, Eye of the Beholder... I have fond memories of all those games. The developers of ""Legend of Grimrock"" hoped to tap into that nostalgia with their new RPG, which updated the graphics but retained the retro gameplay. Unfortunately, they failed to take into account that there is a reason I don't play those games anymore: that retro gameplay sucks. Even back in the day, I hated the ridiculous maze-like levels and the ""find the hidden button"" puzzles, and looking for keys to open the next area is a trope so old that even Duke Nukem made fun of it. The combat is mildly entertaining, but - having long mastered the attack/strafe techniques in the early '90s - it lacks challenge. A distinct lack of variety in monsters and textures made it hard to maintain interest. I think I'll stick to more modern games in future.			"

												Legend of Grimrock is a dungeon crawling role playing game with an oldschool heart but a modern execution. A group of prisoners are sentenced to certain death by exiling them to the secluded Mount Grimrock for vile crimes they may or may not have committed. Unbeknownst to their captors, the mountain is riddled with ancient tunnels, dungeons and tombs built by crumbled civilizations long perished now. If they ever wish to see daylight again and reclaim their freedom the ragtag group of prisoners must form a team and descend through the mountain, level by level.The game brings back the oldschool challenge with highly tactical real-time combat and grid-based movement, devious hidden switches and secrets as well as deadly traps and horrible monsters. Legend of Grimrock puts an emphasis on puzzles and exploration and the wits and perception of the player are more important tools than even the sharpest of swords could be. And if you are a hardened dungeon crawling veteran and you crave an extra challenge, you can arm yourself with a stack of grid paper and turn on the Oldschool Mode which disables the luxury of the automap! Are you ready to venture forth and unravel the mysteries of Mount Grimrock?			"

												I honestly don't know why this game exists. Visually it's decent enough, but it lacks anything remotely resembling a real storyline and all of its elements were surpassed by the old AD&D Gold Box games from the mid to late 1980s. The developers (and apparently most of the players) seem to think this game hails back to that golden age, but frankly, that golden age was better than this.This is just dumb.			"

												Honestly, considering the reviews, I was a little let down.  It's okay, for short bursts at a time, but it's not a game that I could play for hours on end.  Just not a fan of the movement and battle mechanics, mostly.  It feels really... clunky... to me.  Having to push q and e to turn, while I guess is necessary, considering the fight mechanics, just feels wrong to me.  Using right mouse on a weapon to attack seems really backwards.  Maybe that is a genre staple.  I really don't know, but to me, it is far from intuitive.			"

												I bought this really cheap. Its an old school dungeon crawler with a 3D perspective. Kind of like you're stuck in an Elder Scrolls dungeon that is randomly generated. The easy is very easy, each area is blocked by a door and you need to get something that opens the door. Get a torch, pull a lever, find a key. Simple stuff. Everything is built in a grid, so you walk one square at a time. Oh and you can look, walk and strafe, but to turn you either need to use a key or hold left mouse button and drag the mouse to the side. This game has a slow pace that not everyone will like. At its best it feels like a modern Shadowgate... at its worst its clunky with boring combat where you click and see a poor animation. I have a tough time justifying more than $5 for this.			"

												This game is a throwback to the old dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder, bringing back that oldschool gameplay with modern graphics.  Unfortunately that's pretty much it's only redeeming quality.  The interface is clunky, puzzles are too easy, ""secret"" areas are glaringly obvious, and combat is generally much too difficult.  The game likes to throw large groups of very powerful enemies at you right from the start and dying sends you back to the last save point which tend to be quite far apart.I got bored and frustrated with this game in a very short time and I can't say I recommend it to anyone unless you enjoy a nostalgia trip.

												The game is terribly balanced around the different characters you create. Mages? Useless until couple of levels in and even than they are high maintenence low reward. Archers? Useless until you find a bow which the game never actually gives you by the way, it's a secret you must obtain. That's right, the essential weapon of a class is secret.  Warriors seems to be the only class that are playable since they are strong both offensively and defensively, they don't require any fiddling or experience they are always good.After completing this game I can say it is easily the worst game I've played in the last 10 years.

												Ugh, what a load of GARBAGE... my God... this looked like it had so much promise but it's just a disaster of a game.I thought the combat was going to be a bit better but really this game is just walking through boring square shaped hallways. I hate the idea that the game runs on rails to a degree and I don't have a free roam 360 perspective... it makes the game as a whole insanely tedious, clunky and boring.There aren't any quick keys for potions or abilities either. The mage is practically worthless in a fight because of how obnoxious it is to cast spells. The characters in the back are annoying to use in battle as well and demand a long range weapon which sometimes leaves them gimped. It's inanely hard to switch characters and weapons in the middle of a fight as well... I found myself running half way back through a dungeon just to make some small changes... unacceptable.The only redeeming quality this game holds is the dungeon editor... Make your own dungeons and share them with your friends because the campaign is just brutally awful. I'm also afraid the game is too long and that worries me... it's just not worth the time spent put in to it.Puzzles also become incredibly demanding later on because you need rocks to trigger switches so if you accidenitally threw some away or left them somewhere on the ground, have fun wasting your time backtracking or throwing valuable items like torches. All in all, not recommended unless you like this sort of thing. I thought it was going to play more like Shadowgate and it doesn't... it's just crap.Buyer beware.... also I noticed most negative reviews for this game get thumbs down, go for it, I don't really care, the people who enjoy this game are obviously blindsided by it's crappiness...

												I love RPGs but I found this game rather dull and overly difficult. You control a party of four people from first person view, which is rather strange as it would seem to imply that you are walking in an unnatural two by two formation at all times. You only move in right angles as if on an invisible grid which is also a bit strange. I get that they probably don't have skyrim's budget but there were no characters to interact with, and your party is completely generic, everything is indoors, and even combat occurs with you walking in this strange way. You can expect to reload from a lot of saves.  I didn't like it and can't recommend it. There are better RPGs out there.			"

												This game is a convoluted mix of standard RPGs that permit free movement of characters and tactical strategy games that allow only limited and measured moves. Characters move jerkily in blocks in 4 possible directions -- front, back, left, right, the implications of which are severe: you can't move diagonally or look up and down; your characters cannot move by a distance of your choice since each keystroke takes it in any of the 4 directions only by a preset distance; you cannot have varying pace, i.e. your character cannot run or slow down; with this movement style, combat is bound to be weird and unenjoyable.This kind of jerky navigation system totally kills the charm of playing a fantasy RPG game by robbing you of the ability to set your own pace and enjoy the game environment by pausing anywhere you want to. This also creates problems during combat since you can look in ONLY 4 possible directions. The only way you can defeat an enemy is by sidestepping off its path and quickly circle behind him, and while you are going behind him you obviously cannot see what the enemy is doing and how it is positioning himself.This game is well-designed and I was looking forward to spending a week or so playing it. But the stupid gameplay has put me off. What should've been a simple and standard RPG affair has been reduced to a monkey dance.HORRIBLE.			"

Second - puzzles, that requier to step/press a sequence need too much of a perfect timing.

												The controls can prove to be frustrating for some, but after half an hour they are no longer a nuisance. The controls is a bit quirky for a reason. You have to press several buttons to cast magic forexample, adds to panic attack you're going to have when fighting multipile foes always trying to foresee their next move. Make no mistake this game is in real time.The combat do however happen in a weird pace that gives you time to think and plan (usually), but still manages to deliver frantic situations. Grimrock has a great atmosphere which is probably where it shines the most. I got some serious chills at times, even while fighting. The game is befitting a mature audience seeing how the puzzles can prove to be challenging. I never got to play any of those old school dungeon crawlers and it probably explains why this felt so fresh. Dungeons crawlers still has a future with games like these. Recommended!			"

												Great rethinking of the old 1st person 4 character rpg genre. You don't get punished for failing things too much, for example falling is fine. You just have to find your way back up if you fall. But you do need to be quick on your feet. This is not a turn-based game.			"

												I'm a little torn on this game to be honest, on the one hand it is a very compelling game, I was never bored while playing it, on the other hand it is ****ing terrifying, have you ever been sandwiched to death by two giant spiders while helplessly trying to flail your way out, then you have not played Legend of Grimrock, the one game that has ever made me scream in terror, it's dark, it's claustrophobic, and things you've likely had nightmares about WILL sneak up on you, and that's just the early game.The controls are actually really easy, WASD to move Q and E to turn, right click on the hands to attack, and left click on objects to interact.The only thing I've played that I can compare it to is the main Shin Megami Tensei games, but the two are entirely different animals.The graphics are nothing special if you couldn't tell from the sceenshots, but the atmosphere makes up for that.And finally the game itself is hard as nails, especially if you don't find any of the secret equipment to help you, combat is nerve wracking especially when you have to deal with multiple opponents, take my advice, NEVER enter a corner			"

												This is a great modern take on a classic game style. As an homage to Lands of Lore, Stonekeep, and Eye of the Beholder, Legend of Grimrock keeps the interface (tile movement and character profiles on the page) similar to the original games but adds some modern flare to it with 3D enemies andmild free camera movement while keeping everything we loved of the original games intacked. The game can be short or long depending on your play style and willingness to explore the secrets and extra areas.I've thouroughly enjoyed this game with my daughter's company as assistant navigator and I recommend it to any old school gamers out there.

												A well-done first person dungeon crawler, reminiscent of classic games such as the original Bard's Tale trilogy.  The graphics are well-done and the combat is fluid and engaging.  Though there are some frustrating parts, the ability to backtrack and find a restore gem as many times as you need to lets you pick away at even the largest enemies.  Keep your eyes open and inspect all the walls you come across--the best weapons and armor are often hidden behind secrets or puzzles, making this more of a thinking man's dungeon crawler rather than simply being a corridor full of enemies.  The ambitious scope of this game gives it an incredible amount of depth, from the food system to the multiple skills that can be advanced for each character type, resulting in a game which can be very accommodating to any playstyle.I did not get into the custom dungeon creation, so I have no insight into its use nor on the addition of custom dungeons from the Steam Workshop, but having those available does create a massive venue for replayability.Verdict:  Engaging and fun, but wait for a discount.

LoG is full of old-school goodness just the way you remember, only now with an auto-map feature, so you can put away the graph paper (unless you play hardcore mode). I enjoyed my time with this game immensely, and my only knock against it is that it ended a bit sooner than I expected (based on character stat maximums). However, they were working on a map editor and maybe an expansion, so that's good news. In summary, if you call yourself an old-school gamer and enjoyed games like DM, Ultima Underworld and Bard's Tale, get it!			"

This is a perfect recreation of that classic atmosphere, along with some excellent graphics, and some of the most devious puzzles I've encountered in a CRPG game. I can't stop playing it, despite multiple restarts and completing it on Normal already (Old Skool mode, naturally). Now I'm attempting to find all the treasure on Hard mode, but using the auto-map this time. Well worth every penny.			"

												Great take on the classic Dungeon crawler theme. Amazing graphics, good story. I bought this because I missed the adventures  from Eye of the Beholder, and wasn't disappointed. I also appreciate the quality of puzzles this had to offer, well done!  My pre-school son loves this game as well, and is constantly asking me to play ""spiders"". Appeals to all ages!			"

												Something of an old-school feel, with updated graphics and think-on-your-feet fighting style.  Don't expect your opponents to wait while you decide which spell to throw at them, let alone remember which combination of spell-runes will create that favoured lightning bolt.  I'm enjoying all the puzzles and the secret stashes waiting to be found.  Since childhood, I've remembered Shining in the Darkness... now I'll remember Legend of Grimrock.  Sweet.			"

												This game really captures that classic dungeon crawler feel.  It's very exciting to play, as it's a combination of action and action puzzle solving.  The dungeons have a dangerous feeling to them, like one false step will get you killed.  The atmosphere is oppressive and violent.  The graphics are great, nice animations, weird creatures.  Definitely a must buy if you like old school dungeon crawlers!  Easily worth the $15 not on sale price, a steal when it's on sale.			"

												Ok, I've bought 20 or so games now on Steam, and while I enjoy them all, this is the first one I've been compelled to recommend/comment on.  I loved Dungeon Master on my old Atari ST back in college, and man, this really takes me back (in a really good way)!  Torches that burn out, food that must be eaten, mundane gear that you are rejoicing to find, this is OLD SCHOOL DONE RIGHT!  If you are looking for something like Eye of the Beholder, Dungeon Master or like dungeons with puzzles and tricks - this is the one for you.  The price is perfect and it even comes with it's own dungeon editor to make your own.  Graphics are really well done and the sense of atmosphere is second to none - you really get that feeling of being trapped deep underground.  So what are you waiting for?  Buy it now!			"

												A well-done first person dungeon crawler, reminiscent of classic games such as the original Bard's Tale trilogy.  The graphics are well-done and the combat is fluid and engaging.  Though there are some frustrating parts, the ability to backtrack and find a restore gem as many times as you need to lets you pick away at even the largest enemies.  Keep your eyes open and inspect all the walls you come across--the best weapons and armor are often hidden behind secrets or puzzles, making this more of a thinking man's dungeon crawler rather than simply being a corridor full of enemies.  The ambitious scope of this game gives it an incredible amount of depth, from the food system to the multiple skills that can be advanced for each character type, resulting in a game which can be very accommodating to any playstyle.I did not get into the custom dungeon creation, so I have no insight into its use nor on the addition of custom dungeons from the Steam Workshop, but having those available does create a massive venue for replayability.Verdict:  Engaging and fun, but wait for a discount.

As far as cons go, be prepared for lots of stone brick hallways. Aside from that, there is a lot of fun to be had. There are lots of puzzles to solve in Grimrock, with some being harder than others. There is also a degree of strategy in encounters with enemies that can make for a challenging experience. It is a fun game; but hard to recommend. If you like RPG's and are looking for something a little different; go ahead and give it a try.			"

												This is an odd game to reccomend. I woudl say: if games of this type were part of your adolescence - buy it! If this kind of game is a bit new to you, maybe give it a skip. It's very well done, I enjoyed it for a little while. But it's a bit monotonous and a little depressing. The fundamental game mechanic is kiting, and the environment is of course dark and repetitive. On the whole, Linux gamers with a bit of extra cash might appreciate Grimrock just because its an actual (!) 3D game! To most other gamers, it might be a bit underwhelming.			"

												I always enjoy dark fantasy and well this reminds me very much of Diablo only this time it's more personal. The first person perspective ramps up the tension as you explore Grimrock dungeon, the place no adventurer wants to be.But unlucky for your group you have all been condemned to its dark recesses.The sounds echoing throughout the dungeon really adds to the sense of forboding you have when you explore, also the combat mechanics are entirely mouse driven so you just click to attack for each character, it's simple and intuitive. Also no huds to clutter up the screen.Yay!Apart from the puzzles, which a couple of hours in admittedly aren't all that tricky, however they seem to be ramping up - you'll have to face very creepily animated enemies and do the sword dance. Or just shoot spells at them. Or die horribly. That might happen quite a bit.It's dark, it's creepy, it's wonderfully made. And if all else fails. You can have a minotaur with pointy shoes and a pink doublet on.			"

												Not many modern RPGs can boast the presentation of a genuine challenge. Legend of Grimrock does, in mother♥♥♥♥ing spades. Thrown into a dark, dank, critter and/or zombie infested dungeon (the eponymous Grimrock), your four plucky prisoners must use any means at their disposal to escape from Grimrock, or, as is often the case, keep from becoming a stain on the rough-hewn cobblestone wall, while contending with the constant threat of hunger and/or giant venomous murder spiders.Every level was designed by hand; every trap, monster, mushroom, and weapon lovingly tucked exactly where it needed to be to make your experience as harrowingly awesome as possible. This is an old-school dungeon crawl through and through, and it'll never let you forget it. If you're, like me, too impatient and dense to check every nook and cranny for a secret cache of items, you won't see a longsword until you're 45 minutes in.The game has got some shortfalls, however. The tile-based movement means that it's pretty easy to take advantage of the enemy AI (something the rogue's assassination ability is built to take advantage of). Trolls, which are practically LoG's mascot and therfore built up as being incredibly badass, are kind of disappointing to fight because of this, since their charge attack (which they do whenever you're at least one tile away from them) leaves them wide open for a backstab. They will, however, give you a thundering ♥♥♥♥♥-slap for your trouble if you try to dance around them as per usual. The puzzles can somethimes get a little frustrating, too, if you're used to having more than a cryptic, vague line of text to go on.Overall, it's pretty great, and triumphing over an army of poisonous ents and badass,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off mudcrabs makes you feel awesome like few other things can.

												Legend of Grimrock is an old-school RPG that harkens back to old first-person dungeon crawlers such as the venerable Eye of the Beholder series, the older Might and Magics or the Wizardry series.My first playthrough on normal difficulty took close to 20 hours and this was considering that i had skipped a couple of puzzles and also had to consult the net for solutions to some of them.Puzzles are the core of the game. Some of them are essential for game progression, most are optional, and ALL of them are very cleverly crafted and are absolutely fun and challenging. You will definitely get a sense of satisfaction if you manage to solve it without any help.However because of this, I personally felt that the game focused too much on puzzle solving, and the game sometimes felt more like a puzzle game with RPG elements instead of an RPG with puzzles.Instead of having puzzles subtly presented like in the old Eye of the Beholder series, Grimrock literally hands you a puzzle room and even puts out a label of the puzzle's name.On the whole, this makes the whole game feel more like 13 levels of puzzle rooms where you just need to solve it to progress instead of an RPG with a coherent story that gives context to the puzzles.Story is definitely not Grimrock's strong point, and it only provides an introductory excuse to let the player know why he is in a dungeon. As a game touted as an RPG, the treasure and loot selection are unfortunately not exciting. There are only a couple of limited choices. This game also features the most rediculous looking final boss in an RPG ever.Music is very well done and sounds appropriately cinematic and epic. However, there are only 2 tracks in the whole game. The art style while looking very modern, recycles alot of textures and makes every dungeon level feel the same as the earlier ones.The main gripe I had was the magic system, which was overly complicated and too frustrating to use. It actually requires you to remember spell combinations and click on them fast during battle. I felt that they should have had a simpler approach to this, or at least provide a simpler alternative style. (Eg: why can't we right click on the mage's hand, choose the spell i want and just cast it?)Despite its flaws, Legend of Grimrock is still a very good game and is a worthy addition to the past glorious dungeon-crawlers. The fact that the entire game was made by only a 4 man team with a limited budget really blows the mind. Whats more, they even allowed player modding on this game which is probably a first time for games of this type and genre.For veterans of old-school RPG dungeon-crawlers, this game is a definite must buy. For newer gamers who have never experienced such old-school gameplay before however, it is better to review the gameplay videos before deciding if this game is for you. The play style in this game may not appeal to modern gamers.Overall Rating: 8.0 / 10An excellent and authentic old-school dungeon crawler that veterans would enjoy. I cannot wait to see a sequel to this game. Two thumbs up. Don't miss it.			"

												This is a hardcore dungeon crawl, not unlike the old Ultima games of old. I'm not saying this is a bad thing but just make sure you know what you're getting into. The game is merciless - one misstep and you end up down a hole you will have a difficult time coming up from. Still, if you like the genre, get it and you will not regret it. If you're looking for a casual RPG, you're in the wrong place.			"

												I've never played anything quite like it before. If you're looking for an rpg in the tradition of modern titles such as The Elder Scrolls: III-V, be prepared to learn how the movement controls work, as they are vastly different. Not in a bad way though. The controls  for movement bring this game much closer to its pen and paper cousins, as every movement, forward, back, left, right, and even turning are basically the equivalent to taking a turn in a board game.Because of this, in some cases your next turn must be very carefully considered, as a mistep may lead to death. While this does make the game more difficult, I found the game to be enjoyable and rewarding once I got the hang of the movement.If you lack patience, then this title may not be for you, but for those who are willing to take the time, it will be a worthwhile experience of discovery and adventure.

LoG is full of old-school goodness just the way you remember, only now with an auto-map feature, so you can put away the graph paper (unless you play hardcore mode). I enjoyed my time with this game immensely, and my only knock against it is that it ended a bit sooner than I expected (based on character stat maximums). However, they were working on a map editor and maybe an expansion, so that's good news. In summary, if you call yourself an old-school gamer and enjoyed games like DM, Ultima Underworld and Bard's Tale, get it!			"

You spend half an hour trying to solve a puzzle, and the only solution is to examine every single stupid wall on the whole level. Once or twice is fine, but this gimmick is thrown in repeatedly. I finally had to look at the FAQs just because I was sick of searching for a tiny difference in one of a hundred identical screens. Then they put in the rune. That's just cruel.			"

												This game is tons of fun dungeon crawling.You play as a team of four characters (of any class you choose) that move together in a 3D grid world.  Because it's grid bound, it can be a little head-trippy when dealing with fast monsters whom you want to fall back on first-person-shooter skills with.The atmosphere of this game is very dark without being gorey.  Some monsters are pretty scary but it should be fine for someone who does zombie movies but not horror movies.Your inventory is limited, so you'll find yourself consulting the web to find out how important keeping an item is.  The most aggravating features are getting cornered and hunger.  The first issue you have to strategize to avoid, and the second issue you have to really juggle your inventory and stock up on food for whenever possible.This game is worth $5 if you don't complete all your games, $10 if you're a completionist and will really stick it out (it gets a little repetitive whenever you get stuck).  I am glad to have finished it.			"

I love it as is, but it also gives you the option to build your own, custom content which gives it a lot of replayability. You can even download dungeons other people have made! Lots of fun. Brings you back to the good ol' days of RPG gaming.			"

												Legend of Grimrock is a tough-as-nails dungeon crawl through ten levels of dangerous monsters and difficult puzzles.The game feels like an old-school D&D campaign, where each level is broken into either combat or puzzle encounters; it makes very little effort to hold your hand. You create a fully customized party of four characters, and assign new skills as they level up and advance through the dungeon. While there is very little story, and the conclusion is lackluster, the rest of Legend of Grimrock is still a great experience.Recommended. 7/10.			"

												Fantastic game to play, with well thought out content.However, I wish some aspects would be rethought/removed. For instance, the Spiders, completely OP with the poisoning. Rapid attack with a high chance of poisoning, even when equipped with poison resistance. That's all well and good, if you have a never ending supply of Anti-venom potions. These are easy enough to make, using only one herb and a refundable bottle. From the moment I started up until the first spider encounter I saved the herb to make the Anti-venom, which lasted me a good 8/9 poisonings. Considering the front two party members can both be poisoned, on the same attack, you burn through the potions incredibly fast. That wouldn't be a problem had they made the herb a common find. You just end up having to run back to the Crystal every time you are poisoned, or waiting it out, sleeping, until it wears off. What is the point in the potion, if it only lasts you 5/6 spider encounters, and then your running back and fourth just to remove poisoning? Pointless, in my opinion, it just makes the game incredibly boring.What should be done with the potion is that it gives you poison immunity for a set amount of time. That way you wouldn't burn through every potion to the point you are using the Crystal to remove poison.It's just a bad aspect of the game, in my opinion.Other than that it is fantastic. Great little puzzles, although stupidly easy. I recommend this to any RPG lover. I would say it is aimed more towards old D&D players, or people that don't mind movement and fighting restrictions. "

												Grimrock: A dungeon-delving exploration game with puzzles and combat (sometimes at the same time!). It features grid-based movement and real-time combat.The puzzles themselves are difficult enough, and very satisfying to solve. Combat is sufficiently varied throughout the game, so that it never became boring. A matter of clicking the attack button for each character in your party, or reciting the correct rune pattern for spellcasting.My one major complaint with the game is the interface. With a lack of hotkeys, (and no auto-attack option) there is far too much clicking in combat for my liking. It becomes very repettive and tedious. Simple hotkeys and/or an attack toggle would be nice.That aside, It is a great game, and worth the asking price. A-			"

												I've never played any ""old school dungeon crawlers"", but that didn't stop me from enjoying this game. The combat system is unique to say the least. But it's satisfying when you finally get the hang of it. The idea is there are 4 of you, and maybe a couple dozen of them per level. But there are a finite number of hostiles per level, so you can easilly kill all the mobs then solve the puzzles. Rather than be forced to solve them under pressure. Puzzles, secrets, fantastic rpg, I heartilly reccomend it.			"

												Old-school dungeon-crawlers have been making a comeback the last few years, and this doesn't disappoint.  Grimrock takes players and tosses them into a labyrinthian underground rife with puzzles and secrets to conquer, while roaming monsters are happy to startle you from the dark corners and shadowy distance.  With no music playing in the background, you are thrown into a place with heavy atmosphere: small sounds tickle the ears while monsters are heard shuffling about, and faint whispers make you wonder if you're actually alone down here..or if you're going mad from the oppressive isolation.  With a team of four, three job classes to choose from, and a variety of builds to utilize, the game is quite balanced and rewards those with quick reflexes as battles are done in real-time.  Those who stay alert and take in details with scrutiny will be rewarded as well, as buttons hidden in stone can be easily missed.  Be patient, cautious, and cunning..and you may find freedom from the dark.			"

												Great game.  A lot of secrets, many are quite difficult to find.  Combat is good, but really it comes down to kiting enemies which can draw it out quite a bit (especially later in the game).  A lot of items for varying styles of combat, but many are superfluous if you're not spec'ed for it.  Realized at the end that I stockpiled a bunch of stuff for situations that never arose, especially because I just kited enemies in a circle (well, square) to kill them.  But still really fun and immersive, and when I finished I was sad it was over.  Don't know if I would ever replay it, but it was wonderful.			"

												LoG is not a bad game. I do like the retro feel and the graphics a lot. What I don't like is the gameplay mechanics. 1st it's real time. Combine that to an attack system triggered by a right mouse click on 4 squares at the bottom right of your screen, with recharge times for every attack and movement along a grid and you'll understand what the issue is: more than fighting enemies you're fighting the interface. I'm sure that with enough practice one can get good at it but it's not where the focus of the combat mechanics should be in my opinion. Since enemies are quite strong - at least in the beginning of the game -  combat mostly boils down to weather you manage to evade enemy attacks long enough while still being able to land a hit once in a while. Let a single enemy (or worse: two)  corner you and  it's ""load the last savegame"" time. Another thing I dislike: you can't move with your map open and there's no minimap. So prepare to hit ""tab"" quite a few times.If you're looking for a less frustrating game but still with a lot of retro feeling to it then you might want to check Might and Magic X.			"

												An amazing take on the classic Dungeon Crawler. Tons of secrets, challenging rooms, and a lot of thought with puzzles, riddles and clues for all sorts of goodies. A very immersive game from what I can tell, with only a few gripes. Dual wielding doesn't really exist in a sense I would like. A rogue using two daggers doesn't attack with both weapons. So it's better to use a shield. Hopefully this will be changed in the future for a bit more variety.

Those games being Dungeon Master and the Eye of the beholder series. this game has EVERY ounce of love and dedication one would expect from a small team working on what is really a amazing movie worthy love letter to these past gaming experiences.The controls are tight and focused, the tutorial pop up isn't the best but is still alot more than what was given to the games it honors by recreating. The gameplay being a modern take of the older dungeon crawlers is very node specific (meaning you move up dow left right) may be a bit off putting to those who are used to freerange dungeon crawling games but its not meant to be played free range which is great for what it aims to do.The graphics are amazing even if your computer is a potato (like my laptop is)10/10			"

												Now this is a game I highly recommend for ""Eye of the Beholder"" / ""Land of Lore"" fans.  It's dynamic, fun, simple and still gives lots of lots of a dark frightening gaming atmosphere.  You start playing and get very hooked up.Old school first person RPG will definetly love this game. :-)			"

												Not bad, not bad. Almoust like Wizardry but more linery game. I don't know what to think. On beginning you learn how to attack. Die a lot, look for secrets, kill mobs when you learn how. Nice graphic, cool music and good rpg. I can like it.			"

												Well, as you can see from the playtime I've put a lot of hours into this game.  I was a huge huge fan of Dungeon Master, then Chaos Strikes Back, and of course the Eye of the Beholder series.  I even tried my hardest to like StoneKeep, but it was just a touch too formulaic to be considered an 'evolution'.. It was really just a repetition.   At the time, the Bards Tale games were also exploring the rectilinear 2.5D game approach, and I did quite like them, but they were vastly inferior at projecting an atmosphere (I felt).    So, I hope you get an idea of where my review is coming from: I'm a die-hard Dungeon Master fan, who really likes the genre, but is looking for DM with improvemetns.Legend of Grimrock is a superb game, there is no doubt about it.  ""Polised"" doesn't even come close to explaining just how wonderful the world is.  The rocks glisten, the toches flicker, and everything has the exact same 'feel' as Dungeon master, from the pressure-plates, and doors opening to the 'worms' (now snails) which offer up repulsive-sounding chunks of meat to keep your party alive.   The big question that you want to ask is ""Does it represent 25 years of advancement over Dungeon Master?"".  The answer is ""mostly"".  I'll explain in a bit more detail...The game is effectively the same as Dungeon Master: You start out at the 'top' of a dungeon. In DM, you were a party of resurrected adventurers controlled by a wizard (who you could see if you battled your way all the way back up the dungeon and used the 'see through walls' spell on the first door!).  In LoG, you're a party of four adventurers, imprisoned for unknown reasons in a big mountain.   The door closes, and this is where the first main difference arises: Choosing your party.In DM, you 'floated about' as a spirit essence, looking at paintings of dead adventurers, choosing who to resurrect, and who to 'take' but remould into your desires.  This was completely revolutionary.  LoG picks a very AD&D approach instead, and just allows you to stat-roll and custom-build your party.   DM allowed you a lot of freedom over your party. It was pretty much possible to get anywhere and do anything with any party (although a lone adventurer was too hard for me to ever complete the game with).  LoG is essentially the same, however there are some classes which are completely useless, and some races which appear to be awesome (minotaur).  I took a Rogue, but didn't look at the achievements list, so never got assassination, and therefore never got the one thing that the rogue is good for, the backstab Steam Achievement. Pah.OKay, so you pick your formulaic team (Fighters up front, mage(s) and rogue(s) up the back), and head into the dungeon.   The first level is a training level, as you'd expect. You're deposited naked, so you find some loincloths, daggers and rocks, and use them to bludgeon the locals, as you'd expect...  There are a few traps, and puzzles, but by and large, it's your standard training level.  HOWEVER, the game's true nature comes to the fore at this point...The training level can kill you.  And is does. Over and over.  You see, there's a trick to playing LoG, which you have to learn RIGHT at the beginning, or you're going to die. and die. and die.  You must never try to go toe-to-toe with an enemy. You will die.   The monsters are always scaled to be a difficult challenge.  To fight you must find at LEAST a 2x2 grid, and strafe, rotate, hit, strafe, rotate, hit, strafe, rotate, hit... and so on.. and so on.. until one of you is dead.    Woe betide you if there are two enemies: This is a retilinear circus of death.. you'll get trapped, and die.  For two enemies, you need a 3x3 grid, making sure never to step into a corner cell if you can help it!  And so, you quickly learn the mathematics of LoG.  Quick count: 3 enemies, right I'll need a 4x4 space to dodge around them in, at least.If you're REALLY lucky, you'll come across them in a snake-like corridor, and can use their abysmal path finding against them.  Monsters will often sidestep with you, so you can pop-left, shoot, pop-right, and the monster will take the arrow or fireball in the face, then step right again, and now there's some rock between you.. You wait to cooldown, and rinse repeat.I'll say this again: Never ever ever try to go toe-to-toe with an enemy.  Sometimes you can't help it. In this case, you're probably boned, but try and slash your way out of it as best you can:  There are some 'secrets' which FORCE you to be in the middle of a swarm of things (Fighter's Challenge), and in this case, you're boned.  Over and over.. until you get lucky and reload enough times that a space randomly appears in front of you, or whatever, and you're able to retreat out of the swarm... Something like that..Supplies are in short supply:  Lack of food is the main impetus to keep moving.  There were many times that my party were getting low, because I'd been searching for secrets, and I just had to plough on into the next level, to get some food.    At first I found it annoying: Cosntantly running low: There are penalties for being hungry!  But then I realised it was to stop people stagnating on earlier levels.   I remember in DM having my entire party encumbered with Worm Rounds because we'd camped near a spawn point, and I ended up dagging them up and down, and up and down, three or four levels down from the spawn point, so I could have a stash.   Similar things happen in LoG. There's a famous 'snail room', but you only get two snails, which is barely enough to keep two party members alive.  However, they do replenish every time you step a certain distance from the room...As you get deeper and deeper, the enemies stay just as hard.  Okay, I KNOW they're getting harder, but I'm getting better at the same pace.  So, while a snail on level one needs ten dagger-hits, a cthulu-faced magic-wielding lightning-thrower-evil-demon on Level 12 still takes ten lightning-sword hits.   So, the 'experience' changes a little with the variety of ranged vs. melee monsters, but the game stays uniformly difficult.  In DM, there definitely felt to be an advancement in ability, and monsters became easier.. So in DM, that demon would take three lightning-sword hits, if you see what I mean?Descending through LoG, the 'tunnels' feel slightly different. You start off in fairly rustic 'sewers'?, and then descent into perfectly rectilinear dressed-stone corridors.  They stay this way until the very last level, which goes very industrial, and it becomes clear what the game's emblem is all about.There's a LOT of side-activity here.  You can plough through without finding many secrets, but the majority of the good stuff is behind tiny buttons, and so on, so it really pays to explore.   However, there's always that looming hunger, so you can't spend too long.  There's about enough surplus food int he dungeon (without snail-mining), to get you back to Level 1 from Level 12 two or three times, if you forgot something, before you really start to run dangerously low.I'd say my main gripe about this game is the w ay that the skill 'trees' (or just skill List) works.  In DM, you started off beign able to do ""14"", (fire), and then learned ""144"" (fireball)... But once you leveled up, you could try for ""244"", bigger fireball... sometimes it'd work, sometimes it wouldn't.   LoG has nothing like this.     My second main gripe is that magic needs SO MANY DAMNED CLICKS to work.   five perfectly-placed clicks on smal squares, while you're trying to strafe,turn,hit,strafe.... is a REAL pain the a$$!!!!   All in all, I'd say this was a really excellent attempt to remake Dungeon Master.   They've missed some of the fun in a few areas, and instead concentrated on graphical beauty.  Doesn't stop me from recommending this though. It's a great game, so long as you learn the one cardinal rule: Do not go toe-to-toe with an enemy if you can help it! "

												Fantastic indie title that delivers an extremely challenging and aesthetically appealing dungeon crawl developed under a low budget. Highly recommended, especially if price drops and/or a level editor is released. I predict a very strong community if dungeon crafting is implemented. At the moment there's only one dungeon and it isn't randomly generated so replay value is a little weak unless you wanna try a harder difficulty, different party layout, or hit up ""Old School Mode"" which turns off automapping so you gotta grab a pen and some paper to map things out on your own.Certainly worth a purchase, and I write this less than halfway through the game so I've still got some excitement ahead of me.

												I was put off by the trailer showing the movement system, but I was amazed at how incredibly quick I got used to it, and remembered what it was like playing games which had grid movement (Zelda for example!).A review about it being a pixel hunt for secret switches etc also put me off, but this is most definately NOT THE CASE. You do not have to hunt down the secret doors, and they aren't that hard to find either (except for a couple of rune engravings, but those are the super secrets and the game hints at their locations).The only issue I have is the inventory management is a little mundane, but you quickly forget about it.This is one of my most recommended games ever. Extremely well polished.			"

												Grimrock is a triumphant (re-)discovery of the first-person dungeon crawler genre, fused with modern sensibilities which make it all the more atmospheric and immersive.The real-time combat encourages skillful dances around enemies (as well as careful timing of one's actions to interrupt enemies' attacks). The brain-rackingly devious puzzles are intensely challenging and rewarding. The secrets are often extremely well-hidden and reward careful exploration. Multiple playthroughs can offer very different experiences based on how you design your party members.Never have I been so terrified of mushrooms.I highly recommend this as a thinker's game and as an excellent sampling of the core old-school dungeon crawling experience.

												A fun little RPG. It can easily be beat in a couple of days to a week of casual play. Despite the 3D art, the game/movement takes place in a 2D tile-based environment (no jumping) with turn-based movementUpsides: decent character and plot progression, and art. Some good puzzles. Legitimately fun game overall.Downsides: UI is easy enough to navigate, but can be a bit klunky. Little diversity to the monsters and items. Nearly all of the monsters can easily be beaten by drawing them into an open space and stepping around them. More levels would have been nice so that the characters can progress in skills a bit further. Overall not that bad taking into account that this was made by something like 2-3 devs.			"

I was transported back to the old days of graph paper and pencil (not required for this game, alas, as it is all online to be easily printed).  It was great fun to play.  A simple interface, and much better graphics than the old Commodore!  If you ever played the old Bard's Tale games, or any of the classic RPG from the 80's and 90's, you will love this game.Not too long, unfortunately, but a fun storyline, and super fun to play.

												Legend of Grimrock is one of those games, that seemed, at least for the most of us, to have come out of nowhere.It puts one goal in it's mind - to recreate the old school dungeon crawler ""Dungeon Master; Eye of the Beholder"" style games. And Ladies and Gentlemen - it does that very, very well.The game is engaging, interesting and challenging. It does not try to be what it is not, nor it is any pretentious in any sort of way. The developer team knew his limits, budgets and skills and used that to a supreme extend. No, seriously - the game looks highly polished and finished, well balanced in all manner of presentation. It is a great skill to distribute your resources like that so you achieve a lot, using something modest.As for the game itself - it is a 4 person party hex based, 1st person, real time, dungeon crawler. It takes the best from the old school similar games and improves that using today's technology and UI.Of course, to be objective - it is not a game for each style. The combat is a combination of tactics and quick reflexes, using the mouse and keyboard at the same time. It may take some time to get used to it, but once you are used to it - it's getting exciting.The only criticism of the game itself is that the final boss battle, the first time it is played, has this unbalanced feeling that each wrong move leads to your death. When this happens for 10th+ time, it can really get on your nerves. Basically - each mistake is a death there. The good point is, once you figure the stuff out - the boss becomes far easier.As a final though - I recommend this game as it is a very well executed product. If you are going to take it though, please, watch some gameplay videos first to see if it really is for you. As I said - the game is pretty good, just not for everyone.Legend of Grimrock 2 is in the works. The team had great sales thus they can continue their indie work. We can expect the next game to be even better, with significantly bigger budget.			"

												Here's the truth: I haven't yet played a single minute of ""Legend of Grimrock"", so this isn't a review of the game. And albeit I was never much of a dungeon crawler in my youth, I do have very fond memories of ""Lands of Lore"". That's why, in this time of open-world MMORPGs with ultra-realistic 3D leaves and flyings birds, I find it very refreshing that a small independent gaming studio from Finland decides to make a ballsy move and revisit the '90s dungeons in all it's 90-degree, monster-filled glory (updated to the graphic standards of this millennium). This game shows just how far you can go when you love the product, not just the income they bring (here's looking at you, EA and Ubisoft). That's why I strongly recommend you all to support these guys in their wonderful nostalgic, old-school project. Because they represent what this business is all about. And because the game just rocks!			"

												A beautiful love-letter to the Dungeon Crawlers of the 1970's and 80's.Smart. Beautiful.Tough, but fair.The game is PACKED with secrets, secrets, secrets and you are constantly keeping an eye on your food meter since resting while starving does you no good. The game is well-balanced but does NOT hold your hand-- this is not for your little sister to play, even on normal difficulty.Walking on a grid system took some getting used to, but the game is well-paced enough that by the time it hits its stride you're a master at it. The game is going to give your the best experience during the FIRST playthrough only, though. As it is a puzzle game at heart-- the puzzles don't change. Going back through a second or third time would only be for the over-achievers that want to find all the secrets, hidden items, skulls (yes skulls), treasures and so on. I got 22/40 achievements just playing it through the first time. I only had to look up the solution to two puzzles in the entire 20hrs of gameplay, and felt halway clever the rest of the time. The game does a good job of coyly telling you what to look for, then letting you walk RIGHT past it soon after and NOT getting that cool sword that's hidden in the walls.Be patient, Be smart, Be methodical. Grimrock IS out to get you. Food is scarce and some enemies are a bit overpowered--- again, tough but fair. You'll have a blast wandering down its tunnels. I wholly recommend it. 9/10  "

												Dare I say game of the year? I never grew tired of this modern homage to first person dungeon crawlers. The atmosphere and graphics are spot-on. Where other companies would offer more content in the form of paid DLC's, the developers have instead made an extremely user-friendly dungeon editor and mod tools. The mod scene for this one is on fire. Given the plethora of good user-made dungeons the replayability of this game is seemingly infinite.			"

												As a former commercial painter, I've stared straight at a lot of walls in my day.  This game was basically made for me, it's got it all:  staring at walls while strafing sideways, constant 90 degree swivels to stare at each individual wall tile every time you move a square forward in newly discovered areas, and even back tracking to stare at the same walls all over again in case you missed something.  Pros:- Walls- Great puzzlesCons:- Bit excessive on the walls actually, now that I think about it.- Game has a seriously big jump in difficulty at level 3, forced to learn how to actually fight the baddies in the first room of level 4, same tactic used on basically every baddie from that point on.

The one & only.Dungeon Master has created so many things that were never outmatched...A unique spell system, light, food, experience, levels, weapons, monsters, mysteries.. so many things...LoG recycles these elements & gives us something really fresh and that's what we want.This game has very nice mechanisms & a great technical engine.The several mods allow you to play the adventures you want & the Dungeon Master mod is really well done.Thank you for such a game!

												I almost felt while playing like eating a bag of Doritos was required. Such a solidly geeky game! I mean, a trapdoor dumps you into a pit with a troll in it? Are you kidding? That's the best! Very satisfying to solve some of the puzzles. Towards the end I could almost guess what was intended and go off of instinct instead of thinking a puzzle through. I felt like the puzzles and traps had a personality to them that I had gotten to know. Great game!			"

												A gripping, challenging dungeon-crawler of the highest calibre. Don't play this expecting an easy ride, prepare yourself for plenty of reloads as your party gets slaughtered to a man/woman/minotaur, prepare yourself to be frustrated as you struggle again and again to solve that one puzzle or defeat that single enemy that seems unbeatable. But go into this game knowing that the sense of relief and achievement you get when you *finally* complete each level is worth the struggle!It is a struggle, and there will be times when you'll probably just want to quit in frustration, but you won't want the dungeon to defeat you and so you'll persevere. That's the real drive of this game - you're not striving for reward or achievements; you've just trying to stay alive and escape, and that's a much more powerful motivator to see the game through.

												This game is both visually stunning and fun to play.  I recommend this game to anyone who likes solving puzzles and a challenge.  The design of the dungeons give this game as much atmosphere as anyone can ask for.  This game hits the balance between not too easy and not rediculously hard very well.  Combat is different but after a bit is easy to find your groove.  The only negative thing I will say,  based strictly on my own opinion, is the spellcasting system is...umm...I guess I can say hard to master.  Remembering which tiles or combination of tiles to click to cast a certain spell is a bit much to think about in the heat of a battle.  I found myself picking one spell to use for a fight and sticking with it.  I know this will not be the case for everyone but was for me and therefore I brought it up.  All in all a very enjoyable game and I would recommend this game to anyone.			"

												For those of us who remember spending rainy Sunday afternoons playing games like Dungeon Hack or Shadow Caster this is a welcomed re-awakening of a genre.  The graphics are superb, the controls are tight and the interface is simple enough while maintaining the desired level of PC complexity that many of us wish was still prevalent today in gaming.The combat is fun although tactical a tad simplistic.  I have found that the most effective strategy is to lure enemies one at a time into a 2 x 2 or larger area and simply strafe around while your attack recharge.  The game does do an effective job of complicating this simple strategic by throwing multiple enemies at you at once which leads to some wonderfully frantic fights but these are (thankfully) not too common.The puzzles are challenging while remaining logical and almost every puzzle hint that I found proved both valuable in discovering the solution without being to obvious while also adding to both the story and the atmosphere.  Also the reward of finding many of the game's secrets is very fulfilling!All in all well worth the price of admission for those looking for a modern take on a classic genre.  I am hopeful that the sequel carries on with this level of fun and frustration as the dungeon crawler rises again!			"

												Fantastic game to play, with well thought out content.However, I wish some aspects would be rethought/removed. For instance, the Spiders, completely OP with the poisoning. Rapid attack with a high chance of poisoning, even when equipped with poison resistance. That's all well and good, if you have a never ending supply of Anti-venom potions. These are easy enough to make, using only one herb and a refundable bottle. From the moment I started up until the first spider encounter I saved the herb to make the Anti-venom, which lasted me a good 8/9 poisonings. Considering the front two party members can both be poisoned, on the same attack, you burn through the potions incredibly fast. That wouldn't be a problem had they made the herb a common find. You just end up having to run back to the Crystal every time you are poisoned, or waiting it out, sleeping, until it wears off. What is the point in the potion, if it only lasts you 5/6 spider encounters, and then your running back and fourth just to remove poisoning? Pointless, in my opinion, it just makes the game incredibly boring.What should be done with the potion is that it gives you poison immunity for a set amount of time. That way you wouldn't burn through every potion to the point you are using the Crystal to remove poison.It's just a bad aspect of the game, in my opinion.Other than that it is fantastic. Great little puzzles, although stupidly easy. I recommend this to any RPG lover. I would say it is aimed more towards old D&D players, or people that don't mind movement and fighting restrictions. "

												Bottom line:  Grimrock is a dungeon crawl modelled after the one and only Eye of the Beholder.  Eye of the Beholder was the first of it's type... a trend-setter that broke every rule for a game of it's type efore it.  Of course, its only a step away from the RPG  we enjoy now with 360 degree view of the game world.  BUT, in that light it is a nice fresh return to that style of rpg.Yes, its difficult.  Yes, its quirky.  I simply argue that it's the quirks that make it unique... and at $10 its a ♥♥♥♥ing deal.			"

												Has somewhat of a Dungeons & Dragons feel to it where you control a party of 4 players in attempt to escape a mountain you were thrown into.The game looks beatutiful and the gameplay is fairly exciting. You either solve puzzles or fight monsters that are in your way. With the ability to custimize your party you can do pretty muh whatever you want.While the gameplay is exciting and entertaining the only real downfalls is that it uses controls you've probably never used before, making it clunky for the first few floors as well as combat being very meticulous and sometimes difficult to navigate if you want to avoid getting the♥♥♥♥♥♥beat out of you.Rate:8/10			"

												Pretty good game overall. Probably about 18 hours straight out from beginning to end and it never really became monotonous. I haven't played a dungeon crawler like this in over a decade so I don't really have a good rule of measure as to how good the good parts are.The upsides are: the puzzle system, basic loot system that isn't way over the top like most white washed rpgs(getting a sword is a big deal), finding secrets and the multiflloor nature of the dungeons(falling down holes to find secrets), the logistics system(food, rest, potions)The downsides are: a poor magic system(clicking runes instead of casting spells with one click makes having more than one mage a pain), the lack of integration between party members in combat e.g. Ogre Battle 64 has a combat system with more depth and it uses pretty much the same frontline tank back line nuke system; no comboing off your mages.The battle system is pretty basic: click and swipe and kite around in a sqaure; use your mage nuke to pull.I played with an insectoid warrior and minotaur warrior in front row and a human rogue and insectoid mage(poison) in back row. Rogue had 12 points in assassination so it could attack from back row with daggers.If the mages casting system was better I would do another play through but as is I don't feel like manually clicking runes over and over in the middle of battle.If you play fps a fair amount it is a good idea to remap the strafe and turn keys.

												There's no doubt about it: Legend of Grimrock is a fantastic level-grinder and a wonderful tribute to the original Dungeon Master by FTL (Grimrock is kind of a modern re-imagining of Dungeon Master). Playing it really did grip me, even when the obscure puzzles stopped me in my tracks and sent me scurrying to YouTube for answers. There's no doubting the challenge this game represents - it's HARD! Like the original Dungeon Master: Legend of Grimrock is scary, evil and unforgiving, but great fun to play and lose yourself in. Just don't play it if you have a weak heart!			"

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I did not expect this game to be as amazing as it is. I mean, seriously, if you guys love dungeon crawler games I highly recommend it. I love how the fighting system is and how the whole place is underground. I love with what they did with the wizard. I mean, they could have done it like most rpgs do it and just make a list of magic. However, in this game its like you have to know the right symbols to cast the spells before you even get to build up your level to cast more of them. I think it's a different way to play a mage and I am happy they made it like that. I bought this game and I feel it is worth the money for it.			"

It's not frustratingly hard, but there definitely are challenging bits as you're trying to figure out some of the puzzles throughout the dungeon. Keep an eye out for the sequel!			"

												I love it when a dead genre is resurrected in a way that does justice to its legacy. Some things like the lack of keybindings make the game less user-friendly, but on the flip side you get a proper old-school experience through it. Also, this game is hard as as nails. Playing it on normal is quite challenging, and on hard I actually had to give up. A first playthrough on easy is recommended, and for normal / hard I'd recommend taking the time to customize your party and let the initial playthrough guide you in what abilities to go for.			"

												A slick idea of bringing back first person dungeon crawler game in today's era.  The result is very interesting. Personally, I haven't played any other dungeon crawler before other than Dungeons of Dredmor, but this game has a very unique feel to it that you can't find in other games nowdays. The idea is simple: you are a party of 4 prisoners and your goal is to escape a dungeon filled with traps and mosters. As you progress through the game, you find better items and level up your characters. Where this game is shining is n the atmosphere department. Since the game is in first person view, and you have access to free move camera, you are entirely immersed in the game.For an indie game, it looks gorgeous aswell.In conclusion: it's a unique game that we don't tend to see nowdays, so if you want to experience something new that will suck you for at least 20 hours for your first complete playthrough, go for it.Must buy! 10/10			"

												Legend of Grimrock is a classic dungeon-diving game. You play as four criminals who have been chained together and tossed into the seemingly endless labyrinth of Grimrock. Loads of enemies, puzzles, secrets and loot await you. The game also has an interesting combat style. You move around on tiles like moving on a game board, and each of your four party members can attack individually, though they always move with each other and face the same direction. Positioning is really important, and things can get frantic when you have more than a couple of enemies in a tiny room with you. Lots of fun, definitely recommend it, especially if you like games that make you think, with lots of hidden stuff to find.			"

												I remember stone walled buildings, a list of stats and inventory, and cryptic dungeons. All was black surrounding the structures. Walking on the outskirts of town meant certain doom. If you happened upon a dungeon, your strength and wits were your weapons. There was a crude map, difficult to decifer without a compass. Combat was fierce and your glass cannon wizard would fall often. Bringing him back would require coin. Aquiring coin involved pushing outside the town. Wandering outside the town meant certain doom. You can look only one direction at a time and interact with what you see. The city was a safe haven, but boring. If you got the stones, you went down into the crypt. The crypt is Grimrock, the above description is Bard's Tale for NES. The graphics have been updated, the interface changed but it's the same challenge, if not moreso.			"

												I first found out about this game on the development phase, long before they had anything but a few screenshots to show around, and I was immediately in love with it. The old school style, mixed in with a new way of gameplay, plus a great deal of style made me giggle like a little boy when I finally saw the first video. It doesn't take much to imagine I kept checking in to see how the game development rolled.I can't really recall if I got the game straight out through g.o.g. or if I bought it directly from the developers, either way, I know it quickly found a way to my digital shelf on g.o.g. If I wasn't one of the first players to go all the way down on Grimrock, I have to say I 100% certainly was one of the first to accompany people doing so.The rumors about players making maps started right of the bat, soon after the game was released, and I have been fingers crossed to see it blossom, and here, with Steam Workshop, it were it all starts again. Now, after having bought this game once, possibly twice, I'd think I wouldn't have to be saying why I'm spending money on it a second or third time, but hell, I'd do it again if I had to!Legend of Grimrock, this game right here, is a gem. The price won't come even near to the satisfaction of finishing puzzles, looting fantastic equipment (That will save your life!), facing weird monsters for the first time and jumping on excitement every time you find a secret area.There really isn't much else to say besides the obvious.Play this ♥♥♥♥ing game!

I haven't played a dungeon crawler like this in over a decade so I don't really have a good rule of measure as to how good the good parts are.The upsides are: the puzzle system, basic loot system that isn't way over the top like most white washed rpgs(getting a sword is a big deal), finding secrets and the multiflloor nature of the dungeons(falling down holes to find secrets), the logistics system(food, rest, potions)The downsides are: a poor magic system(clicking runes instead of casting spells with one click makes having more than one mage a pain), the lack of integration between party members in combat e.g. Ogre Battle 64 has a combat system with more depth and it uses pretty much the same frontline tank back line nuke system; no comboing off your mages.The battle system is pretty basic: click and swipe and kite around in a sqaure; use your mage nuke to pull.I played with an insectoid warrior and minotaur warrior in front row and a human rogue and insectoid mage(poison) in back row. Rogue had 12 points in assassination so it could attack from back row with daggers.If the mages casting system was better I would do another play through but as is I don't feel like manually clicking runes over and over in the middle of battle.If you play fps a fair amount it is a good idea to remap the strafe and turn keys.

												A fun revival of what WAS a sadly long dead genre.  If you want just a pure dungeon crawling experience, Grimrock serves that up.  With some fun puzzles and classic tile-based combat, Grimrock is fairly old school in a lot of good ways.  The downsides: with real time combat, ""square dancing"" becomes the general way you fight almost everything (which can get tedius), and the leveling system isn't all that hot.			"

												Astonishing modern-day dungeon crawler with an excellent difficulty curve. It comes with a bonus option to make your own maps, which is pure nerdery at its finest. The character/class options could use more variance, but the skill trees and leagues of equipment more than make up for it.			"

												Honestly one of my favorite games I've ever played on Steam, it's incredible, it's essentially one of those old top-down dungeon crawlers, but entirely in first person. Combine the limited view with the dark corridors, eerie atmosphere and slightly challenging gameplay, and you get what can be one of the scariest, non-horror games on Steam.			"

												This game is AWESOME. Even though I don't think it's labelled/tagged 'horror', by heck it is one. Every time I'm faced with an opaque closed door, I know I have to open it, but I don't want to, because, at the end of the day, the enemies are unnecessarily creepy, scary and disturbing. Here's some examples (Do not apply if you play Dead Space/Evil Within/watch Silence of the Lambs on a regular basis):Snails: Meh.Crowerns: Unexpected low-level creepiness with the occasional minijumpscare.Skeletons: Meh.Spiders: ******* **** RUN JUMPSCARES GALORE!!! (especially when you get ambushed)Tentacles: Rarely even found, but a jumpscare guaranteed.Scavengerss: Don't look at him! Just slash and slash and DON'T FOCUS ON HIM!!!Crabs: I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THEM LEMME GO HOME!!!!So far, this game is 1st Person Zelda + Mini amnesia/FNaF jumpscares, aka addicting crap your pants simulator.Also, you are always needing to sleep to regen health and stamina. So this is Sleep, crap your pants and scream simulator.Speaking of sleeping, It seems whenever there's enemies like spiders or crocodiley things, even the occasional skeleton, and you sleep, you're gonna get interrupted, jumpscared and hit with an extra powerful attack, because you were basically backstabbed.However,When you do finally get through the cringeworthy battles and sometimes lookup-worthy puzzles, and you get to the revitalization crystal and the stairs to the next floor, You feel powerful and rewarded. 9999999999999999999999/10 would persevere through the jumpscares.Have you yet picked up that I have gamer-nerves and anyone similar/old and frail probably shouldn't play this?AFTER I FINiSHED IT*Watches Curse of Chucky*Meh*Reads Green Mile*... NOT SCARYETCAlso, I gained 20 IQ points from this game... sooo... yay education?Obviously, once you man up (or stop being a ♥♥♥♥♥ like me), you don't find anything scary. I feel like this game has made me stronger and smarter.new rating: 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10Also, conquered the GamerNerves just so I could prove to myself that I can do this. I can still get jumpscared (FNaF in mind), but this game has fortified my mind by trying to kill it. So if you want that, do it. namely, the <SPOILER>* 7 15 18 15 13 15 18 7 19 <SPOILER> were what stopped me from progressing, but that really forced me to make like TF2 and Mann Up.*Use the letter to number code to work out the name. ie: 1=a, 2=b, 3=c etc.			"

												Okay, I'm a massive Paper and Pen RPG nerd, and I grew up on D&D.The preceding statement may have made me a little biased here, but onward! Legend of Grimrock (LoG) is a great game. You control a party of Adventurers through the maze-like bowels of a great mountain called Grimrock. You upgrade their skills, attributes, and equipment as you go to allow them to better survive the monsters that exist within the darkness.Though there are beasts and monsters within Grimrock, it is the puzzles and lack of consumables that will probably cost you dearly, as the challenges put infront of you can be devious indeed, and food is extremely scarce.The history of the Grimrock, told through flashbacks, notes, etc is intriguing, and add to the already gloomy, oppressive atmosphere of dread and desperation.The Community has made a LOT of Steam Workshop stuff for LoG, and it is really worth a look, some of the modules people have created are fantastic, and will extend the enjoyment of this game indefinitely.If you like fantasy gaming, RPG's or are more used to Tabletop RPG/Wargames then give this game a go. It won't be for everyone, but it is definitely hitting all the right marks with the crowd it was intended for.			"

												Old school RPG meets 3D! This game blends in action, exploration, puzzle-solving and suspense in a very effective way; you will feel the dread, you will feel fear alongside your characters. The Workshop features added replayability and variation on the theme, and some are actually on par (or even better) than the original.Despite a few shortcomings in the control departement (keys can indeed be remapped to whatever you want, but it's still a bit sluggish overall), the game will suck you right in, right there in that horrible dungeon. Fascinating.			"

												Liked the ideas of dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder, Dungeon Master II, and Stonekeep, but couldn't quite get into them? Legend of Grimrock is in exactly the same vein, and yet it manages to pack more fun in its little snail than most of the older games.Seriously, I used to admire party based dungeon crawlers but had a hard time getting into them -- not so with Legend of Grimrock. Challenging puzzles, feindish monsters, and lots of loot, spells, alchemy, and skills to keep you coming back.			"

												Legend of Grimrock is a first person RPG dungeon crawler reminescent of old school RPG of the same genre. It takes what was good of those old games while taking almost nothing of the bad, clunky stuff in the process.The story is kept really short: 4 criminals (your party) are brought by soldiers at the top of Mount Grimrock and sent to die in its dungeon. They fall into a huge pit that leads to the first level of the maze itself, and they can't go back. And that's basically it for the story. I mean sure, there is some kind of plot - for example there's a guy that talks in your sleep that is trying to help you get out, and there are some documents around the dungeon that fill in some details about the place - but you don't really care about it and the game doesn't really make you care for it. It's absolutely not the main focus of the game and it's perfectly fine in my opinion. This is a game that is mostly played for the gameplay aspect and the adventure.At the start of the game you can create your party of characters (with a good amount of options for stats and abilities, and even different races) or take premade ones, but whichever you choose everyone starts the same. No equipment, not even some clothing: you have to find things as you go through the maze. There's also some kind of survival mechanic, as you need to keep your characters fed with the food that you find in the dungeon, but it's not that big of a deal really.The combat is pretty straightforward: you just click the weapons that your character has in possession in one of his hands, then you have to wait a while to recharge its attack. But you also need to be aware of how to move in this game: you can't just stand still while you fight. You have to circle around the enemy, try to not get stuck in a corner and so on. Fights can be pretty tense, and they only get more tense as you go on through the game.Exploration is probably my favourite part though. Each level (that is each floor that you're exploring) in the game has increasingly difficult puzzles, and they are kept smart enough and interesting throughout the adventure. It's especially fun and exciting to find secrets when you carefully explore the environment and find out that you can open a passage in a wall by pressing this hidden button and find awesome equipment for your characters. By the way, a lot of the secrets you find in this game are actually useful in some way, so finding new gear is always very exciting.  You can take notes in the map if you need and, if you feel hardcore, you can draw the map yourself by choosing ""old-school mode"" at the start of the game.It's easy to learn its mechanics, but hard enough in general so it keeps you on your toes while you crawl in this maze full of monsters, traps, treasures and secrets. The scaling of difficulty is pretty well crafted, as is the level design and the enemy strength, and nothing is ever too hard for your party of four.What I did not like, though, is that the levels in the dungeons are quite weak in the variety department, so things could feel a bit repetitive after the first few levels. You kinda always see the same textures and scenarios over and over, albeit some exceptions in a couple of levels. Also, there are almost no bosses, or not many that you can call a boss, and I felt that it would've been a cool thing to add, so that's a bit disappointing. The final boss is also a bit underwhelming: without spoilers, I felt like it was really dumb. The ending too, it's not that great really.In summary, this is a rewarding and challenging experience, even if it is a bit repetitive. I still recommend it though, because there's not a lot of stuff like it.I can't wait to play the second one. I hear it is deeper, has more environments and it's more open than the first one. So that should be really fun to see.			"

												Great classic grid based RPG. Grimlock is consectutive dungeons, each on a grid. Each dungeon has a solution (they are great, challenging!!) wholly contained within the level. No searching  for some key in another area. Combat is real time, but on a grid. I cant control 3D combat, it becomes a wild clickfest. This is much more my style. If you like this Grimlock, Might and Magic 10 is a must. Another great grid based RPG, absolutely worth your time.			"

												A gripping, challenging dungeon-crawler of the highest calibre. Don't play this expecting an easy ride, prepare yourself for plenty of reloads as your party gets slaughtered to a man/woman/minotaur, prepare yourself to be frustrated as you struggle again and again to solve that one puzzle or defeat that single enemy that seems unbeatable. But go into this game knowing that the sense of relief and achievement you get when you *finally* complete each level is worth the struggle!It is a struggle, and there will be times when you'll probably just want to quit in frustration, but you won't want the dungeon to defeat you and so you'll persevere. That's the real drive of this game - you're not striving for reward or achievements; you've just trying to stay alive and escape, and that's a much more powerful motivator to see the game through.

												This game is both visually stunning and fun to play.  I recommend this game to anyone who likes solving puzzles and a challenge.  The design of the dungeons give this game as much atmosphere as anyone can ask for.  This game hits the balance between not too easy and not rediculously hard very well.  Combat is different but after a bit is easy to find your groove.  The only negative thing I will say,  based strictly on my own opinion, is the spellcasting system is...umm...I guess I can say hard to master.  Remembering which tiles or combination of tiles to click to cast a certain spell is a bit much to think about in the heat of a battle.  I found myself picking one spell to use for a fight and sticking with it.  I know this will not be the case for everyone but was for me and therefore I brought it up.  All in all a very enjoyable game and I would recommend this game to anyone.			"

												I remember stone walled buildings, a list of stats and inventory, and cryptic dungeons. All was black surrounding the structures. Walking on the outskirts of town meant certain doom. If you happened upon a dungeon, your strength and wits were your weapons. There was a crude map, difficult to decifer without a compass. Combat was fierce and your glass cannon wizard would fall often. Bringing him back would require coin. Aquiring coin involved pushing outside the town. Wandering outside the town meant certain doom. You can look only one direction at a time and interact with what you see. The city was a safe haven, but boring. If you got the stones, you went down into the crypt. The crypt is Grimrock, the above description is Bard's Tale for NES. The graphics have been updated, the interface changed but it's the same challenge, if not moreso.			"

												This old fashioned dungeon crawler kept me engaged for dozens of hours. I had not played this kind of game before and was positively suprised of how entertaining the simplistic combat mechanics and exploration were. I had some thoughts on what I might find at the end. But I have to say I had no idea.			"

												Bottom line:  Grimrock is a dungeon crawl modelled after the one and only Eye of the Beholder.  Eye of the Beholder was the first of it's type... a trend-setter that broke every rule for a game of it's type efore it.  Of course, its only a step away from the RPG  we enjoy now with 360 degree view of the game world.  BUT, in that light it is a nice fresh return to that style of rpg.Yes, its difficult.  Yes, its quirky.  I simply argue that it's the quirks that make it unique... and at $10 its a ♥♥♥♥ing deal.			"

												This is very much a modern Dungeon Master clone. There is exploration, combat, and character development but no story. There is no randomness to the levels, which trades off replayability for puzzles. However, there is choice in party makeup and character development, and apparently there is now a level editor for fans to make new challenges with. If you like conquering dungeon crawlers with puzzle elements, then this is for you. If you prefer roguelikes or story-driven RPGs, on the other hand, then you might be disappointed.It's definitely worth picking up when it goes on sale, which I've seen it do frequently.			"

It's not frustratingly hard, but there definitely are challenging bits as you're trying to figure out some of the puzzles throughout the dungeon. Keep an eye out for the sequel!			"

												I love it when a dead genre is resurrected in a way that does justice to its legacy. Some things like the lack of keybindings make the game less user-friendly, but on the flip side you get a proper old-school experience through it. Also, this game is hard as as nails. Playing it on normal is quite challenging, and on hard I actually had to give up. A first playthrough on easy is recommended, and for normal / hard I'd recommend taking the time to customize your party and let the initial playthrough guide you in what abilities to go for.			"

												A slick idea of bringing back first person dungeon crawler game in today's era.  The result is very interesting. Personally, I haven't played any other dungeon crawler before other than Dungeons of Dredmor, but this game has a very unique feel to it that you can't find in other games nowdays. The idea is simple: you are a party of 4 prisoners and your goal is to escape a dungeon filled with traps and mosters. As you progress through the game, you find better items and level up your characters. Where this game is shining is n the atmosphere department. Since the game is in first person view, and you have access to free move camera, you are entirely immersed in the game.For an indie game, it looks gorgeous aswell.In conclusion: it's a unique game that we don't tend to see nowdays, so if you want to experience something new that will suck you for at least 20 hours for your first complete playthrough, go for it.Must buy! 10/10			"

You either solve puzzles or fight monsters that are in your way. With the ability to custimize your party you can do pretty muh whatever you want.While the gameplay is exciting and entertaining the only real downfalls is that it uses controls you've probably never used before, making it clunky for the first few floors as well as combat being very meticulous and sometimes difficult to navigate if you want to avoid getting the♥♥♥♥♥♥beat out of you.Rate:8/10			"

												Pretty good game overall. Probably about 18 hours straight out from beginning to end and it never really became monotonous. I haven't played a dungeon crawler like this in over a decade so I don't really have a good rule of measure as to how good the good parts are.The upsides are: the puzzle system, basic loot system that isn't way over the top like most white washed rpgs(getting a sword is a big deal), finding secrets and the multiflloor nature of the dungeons(falling down holes to find secrets), the logistics system(food, rest, potions)The downsides are: a poor magic system(clicking runes instead of casting spells with one click makes having more than one mage a pain), the lack of integration between party members in combat e.g. Ogre Battle 64 has a combat system with more depth and it uses pretty much the same frontline tank back line nuke system; no comboing off your mages.The battle system is pretty basic: click and swipe and kite around in a sqaure; use your mage nuke to pull.I played with an insectoid warrior and minotaur warrior in front row and a human rogue and insectoid mage(poison) in back row. Rogue had 12 points in assassination so it could attack from back row with daggers.If the mages casting system was better I would do another play through but as is I don't feel like manually clicking runes over and over in the middle of battle.If you play fps a fair amount it is a good idea to remap the strafe and turn keys.

There are enough puzzles, secrets and surprises to keep my mind guessing and questioning. At one point I was driven to a new height of madness by an seemingly unsolvable maze and I started wondering if this maze was put there to simply play with my mind.This is old school dungeon crawling at it's finest, and even though we get only a profile picture of our heroes, that's all we need for the imagination to make up everything else and let the role-playing take us into this world.

												Fire up Grimrock! If you are a fan of the older school games like King's Field, this should get things mostly back to where they were in the past, only I have to confess up front I am not a fan of the grid moving system in Grimrock. My brain is a little soggy from not doing the sorts of puzzles in these games and got stuck pretty quickly after moving through a couple hallways. Like other reviews say, it's more puzzles than action. Games like Demon's Souls and Dark Souls got away too much from the original formula, so if you feel like me and never liked those follow up games, LOG will certainly get you back to where developers should have gone. I am not too far along in the game, it seems like a good effort to bring some happiness to old school folks, or I should say people who didn't want the King's Field formula to change the way it did. I don't consider myself ""old school"" only because the past games were made in first person and had some atmosphere. That's called ""good school"" in my book. Anyway, enjoy if you choose to buy.

Fun character creation and development, awesomely annyoing puzzles and good light and sound effects make this worth playing. Whet makes it worth coming back to over and over, however, is the community. There are dozens of user made adventures that are fun and creative, and this makes LoG a game I could likely play for the next ten years.			"

												Initially I voted Not Recommended for this game. Now that I've played Legend of Grimrock through, I decided to change my vote to Recommended with some qualification. There is a great deal to love about LoG. I only wish the developers had reconsidered a couple of design decisions. Understand that LoG is a dungeon-crawler not truly an RPG. There is no role-playing and very little story. The only RPG elements are that you can generate your own party and determine your characters stats as they level. You interact with no other characters and converse with no one, not even your own party members. Where LoG succeeds is in its retro style and feel, but with contemporary high-quality graphics. Additionally, LoG has plenty of difficult battles, many fun and intriguing puzzles, and considerable switch-hunting (be warned). LoG is not a turn-based game as you might expect for an RPG; it's real-time. Depending on your expectations and playing style, this feature can be annoying or thrilling, because monsters can attack you unexpectedly as you view your map, manage your inventory, or even as you level up. I loved this aspect of the game.Be aware, though, that if you have only average manual dexterity, the game can at times become very frustrating as you load, reload, ad nauseum, trying to ""solve"" running/timing puzzles that occur in the game. A couple of these puzzles can be bypassed, but then you will miss some of the game's most coveted items. A few are required to progress, however, and these can be game-stoppers. Worse, the movement system is not really geared to running/timing puzzles because you move one square at a time, and it's quite easy to overrun your mark--yet these puzzles require precise timing without any room for error. I found it irksome that I could understand a puzzle, but couldn't ""solve"" it because my fingers weren't fast enough. This dimension of the game made little sense to me; after all, the game purports to be a dungeon CRAWLER, and this genre traditionally relies on wit, thought, and tactics, not rapid finger movements like a platform game. I finally was able to deal with the two worst of these puzzles. For one of them, I found an AutoHotKey script that with minor adjustments did the work for me; for the second, inspired by the script just mentioned, I developed my own AutoHotKey script. That was more challenging and satisfying than endlessly retrying a puzzle my fingers just wouldn't do.In another odd design choice, the developers required some commonplace items to solve a puzzle essential to progress in the game, but then didn't include the items on that level. These were the kind of items players might have easily ditched as useless levels earlier. Being compelled to trudge back several levels to search for discarded items is not fun. Fortunately, you can use the LoG console to generate the items if you don't want to bother backtracking levels.Still, once you get beyond these issues, Legend of Grimrock is an enthralling game. If you're new to dungeon crawlers, don't expect something with the strong character interaction, huge world, and depth of story of, say, Dragon Age. That's not what Legend of Grimrock is about. But if the idea appeals to you of a dungeon-crawler/puzzler with heaps of combat, secrets, and wicked traps, go for it. You'll love Legend of Grimrock.			"

												LoG is not a bad game. I do like the retro feel and the graphics a lot. What I don't like is the gameplay mechanics. 1st it's real time. Combine that to an attack system triggered by a right mouse click on 4 squares at the bottom right of your screen, with recharge times for every attack and movement along a grid and you'll understand what the issue is: more than fighting enemies you're fighting the interface. I'm sure that with enough practice one can get good at it but it's not where the focus of the combat mechanics should be in my opinion. Since enemies are quite strong - at least in the beginning of the game -  combat mostly boils down to weather you manage to evade enemy attacks long enough while still being able to land a hit once in a while. Let a single enemy (or worse: two)  corner you and  it's ""load the last savegame"" time. Another thing I dislike: you can't move with your map open and there's no minimap. So prepare to hit ""tab"" quite a few times.If you're looking for a less frustrating game but still with a lot of retro feeling to it then you might want to check Might and Magic X.			"

												Decent indie RPG with some min/max play style to it.  The game has real time combat and you can kite enemies, trivializing content.  There are some puzzles to solve.  I found the game to get a bit repetitively as I went further and further.  This game does a decent job of mixing some old school feel with more updated combat, even though the combat can get a little bland after awhile.

Each characted in your group has seperate skills, be them magical, physical, fighting etc. You must solve puzzels in order to escape the prison of Grimrock, battling the monsters you meet along the way.The puzzles you have to solve to get any where can get rather challenging later in the game but they're certainly innovative and like nothing ive ever played before.The only con point is that the dungeon is not procedurally generated, its the same everytime you play.I can certainly reccommend The Legend Of Grimrock to anyone looking for a puzzle game they can really get stuck into for a few hours at a time.

												Do you like dungeon crawler RPG's? Endless hallways filled with monsters and loot? Having to break out the graph paper and make your own maps? Welcome to the Legend of Grimrock.You're tossed into a dark dungeon, given 4 pre-fab or customized heroes, then made to set off through the dungeon and reach the end. No one has ever done it. But if you do, all your crimes are forgiven. Navigate the dark hallways, fight off the hordes of monsters on each level, arm yourself with sharp weapons and deadly spells as you move from block to block in this graphically impressive remake of a classic RPG genre. But even after you beat the main story, the fun never ends. There's a rich community of player-made dungeons to pick your way through. From short one or two level mini dungeons to seemingly endless mazes, the community is always looking for ways to challenge themselves and others. Seriously, this game is worth every penny you'll spend on it. You will not be disappointed.			"

												Disclaimer: This review is coming from someone who did not grow up on dungeon crawler games. A great little RPG/Dungeon crawler/puzzler.  Well worth the admission price.Pros:-Fantastic Atmosphere-Figuring out Puzzles make you feel like the smartest man (or woman) alive-Linear levels, but still manages to make exploration rewarding-Great community support (e.g., dungeon editor).-Challenging without feeling unfair-Can be very rewardingNeutral:-Decent replayability - the dungeon loses some of it's magic on subsequent playthroughs (which is one of the strongest points of the game) but interesting party possibilities exist.-Small number of weapon upgrades for each type-Interesting perspective being a party of characters rather than 1 character or being an omniscient controller of the party.  Some will enjoy it, some won't.Cons:-Combat takes some getting used to and feels slightly archaic-RPG elements (i.e., skill trees) are a weak point, imo.  They seem poorly thought out for the vanilla game-Some abilities/skills/stats are blatantly superior to others (particularly on higher difficulties)-A bit of a learning curve			"

												Initially I voted Not Recommended for this game. Now that I've played Legend of Grimrock through, I decided to change my vote to Recommended with some qualification. There is a great deal to love about LoG. I only wish the developers had reconsidered a couple of design decisions. Understand that LoG is a dungeon-crawler not truly an RPG. There is no role-playing and very little story. The only RPG elements are that you can generate your own party and determine your characters stats as they level. You interact with no other characters and converse with no one, not even your own party members. Where LoG succeeds is in its retro style and feel, but with contemporary high-quality graphics. Additionally, LoG has plenty of difficult battles, many fun and intriguing puzzles, and considerable switch-hunting (be warned). LoG is not a turn-based game as you might expect for an RPG; it's real-time. Depending on your expectations and playing style, this feature can be annoying or thrilling, because monsters can attack you unexpectedly as you view your map, manage your inventory, or even as you level up. I loved this aspect of the game.Be aware, though, that if you have only average manual dexterity, the game can at times become very frustrating as you load, reload, ad nauseum, trying to ""solve"" running/timing puzzles that occur in the game. A couple of these puzzles can be bypassed, but then you will miss some of the game's most coveted items. A few are required to progress, however, and these can be game-stoppers. Worse, the movement system is not really geared to running/timing puzzles because you move one square at a time, and it's quite easy to overrun your mark--yet these puzzles require precise timing without any room for error. I found it irksome that I could understand a puzzle, but couldn't ""solve"" it because my fingers weren't fast enough. This dimension of the game made little sense to me; after all, the game purports to be a dungeon CRAWLER, and this genre traditionally relies on wit, thought, and tactics, not rapid finger movements like a platform game. I finally was able to deal with the two worst of these puzzles. For one of them, I found an AutoHotKey script that with minor adjustments did the work for me; for the second, inspired by the script just mentioned, I developed my own AutoHotKey script. That was more challenging and satisfying than endlessly retrying a puzzle my fingers just wouldn't do.In another odd design choice, the developers required some commonplace items to solve a puzzle essential to progress in the game, but then didn't include the items on that level. These were the kind of items players might have easily ditched as useless levels earlier. Being compelled to trudge back several levels to search for discarded items is not fun. Fortunately, you can use the LoG console to generate the items if you don't want to bother backtracking levels.Still, once you get beyond these issues, Legend of Grimrock is an enthralling game. If you're new to dungeon crawlers, don't expect something with the strong character interaction, huge world, and depth of story of, say, Dragon Age. That's not what Legend of Grimrock is about. But if the idea appeals to you of a dungeon-crawler/puzzler with heaps of combat, secrets, and wicked traps, go for it. You'll love Legend of Grimrock.			"

												This game is AWESOME. Even though I don't think it's labelled/tagged 'horror', by heck it is one. Every time I'm faced with an opaque closed door, I know I have to open it, but I don't want to, because, at the end of the day, the enemies are unnecessarily creepy, scary and disturbing. Here's some examples (Do not apply if you play Dead Space/Evil Within/watch Silence of the Lambs on a regular basis):Snails: Meh.Crowerns: Unexpected low-level creepiness with the occasional minijumpscare.Skeletons: Meh.Spiders: ******* **** RUN JUMPSCARES GALORE!!! (especially when you get ambushed)Tentacles: Rarely even found, but a jumpscare guaranteed.Scavengerss: Don't look at him! Just slash and slash and DON'T FOCUS ON HIM!!!Crabs: I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THEM LEMME GO HOME!!!!So far, this game is 1st Person Zelda + Mini amnesia/FNaF jumpscares, aka addicting crap your pants simulator.Also, you are always needing to sleep to regen health and stamina. So this is Sleep, crap your pants and scream simulator.Speaking of sleeping, It seems whenever there's enemies like spiders or crocodiley things, even the occasional skeleton, and you sleep, you're gonna get interrupted, jumpscared and hit with an extra powerful attack, because you were basically backstabbed.However,When you do finally get through the cringeworthy battles and sometimes lookup-worthy puzzles, and you get to the revitalization crystal and the stairs to the next floor, You feel powerful and rewarded. 9999999999999999999999/10 would persevere through the jumpscares.Have you yet picked up that I have gamer-nerves and anyone similar/old and frail probably shouldn't play this?AFTER I FINiSHED IT*Watches Curse of Chucky*Meh*Reads Green Mile*... NOT SCARYETCAlso, I gained 20 IQ points from this game... sooo... yay education?Obviously, once you man up (or stop being a ♥♥♥♥♥ like me), you don't find anything scary. I feel like this game has made me stronger and smarter.new rating: 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10Also, conquered the GamerNerves just so I could prove to myself that I can do this. I can still get jumpscared (FNaF in mind), but this game has fortified my mind by trying to kill it. So if you want that, do it. namely, the <SPOILER>* 7 15 18 15 13 15 18 7 19 <SPOILER> were what stopped me from progressing, but that really forced me to make like TF2 and Mann Up.*Use the letter to number code to work out the name. ie: 1=a, 2=b, 3=c etc.			"

												The most immersive adventure game I played these last years.What Legend of Grimrock will do:- Reward you for exploring- Confront you with many situation and puzzles that will make use of your instinct and brainpower to resolve- Give you a strong sense of accomplishment when you figure out a puzzle, and feel superhuman for doing so at times- Make you feel incredibly immersed in an oppressing claustrophobic experienceWhat it definitely won't do:- Insult your intelligence by holding your hand unnecessarily through puzzles, but instead cleverly hint you in unexpected waysThis game is not for everyone though, as it's more or less a revival of an old genre not much represented anymore these days: tile-based dungeon crawling adventure. But what a treat is it if you decide to get it.I don't doubt that new gamers will enjoy the amount of work that was put into that little gem though.Major thumbs up to Almost Human for making that game.

												Legend of Grimrock is a first person, dungeon crawling, puzzle solving, RPG featuring 4 prisoners cast into the ancient dungeon of Grimrock in order to atone for their crimes.  This is a great game, a very simple but great game.  When I say simple, I mean it’s easy to pick up and start, but difficult to master.  You can be as good as you can be at an RPG, but you still eventually make a mistake in combat, and this game capitalizes and punishes mistakes with heavy damage and/or death.  However, this doesn't detract from the simple fun of this game. As I said in the beginning, you are controlling four prisoners (or less, you can go solo, but I seriously DONT recommend that) cast into the ancient dungeon/prison in the mountain of Grimrock, a mysterious and eerie mountain surrounded in death.  While it seems weird to control 4 people, while in first person, its actually not that bad, it’s actually quite interesting.The movement is tile based, as in each move, moves you a whole tile.  I personally like that change from the usual RPGs.The combat is cooldown and turn based, the front two party members can attack a target and must wait (based on the weapon and their DEX) to attack again.  There are 3 classes (as per usual) Fighter, Rogue, and Mage. Fighters are you usual warriors, utilizing swords, axes or maces and armor, I usually keep them in the front row as they are usually tougher.  Rogues use speed and timed strikes and ranged weapons, if you put skill points in Evasion you can eventually make it so all weapons they use are ""reach"" weapons, meaning a dagger can attack from the back row.  Mages are arcane users that utilize Air, Fire, Ice, and Earth magic, put enough points in one of those skills and the whole party learns to resist that type of damage.  Personally I found Fire and Earth to be the most dangerous early on, but that’s your choice.   I recommend balance, don't go using a whole team of Rogues for example, they are just too squishy.The game is also quite tough and unforgiving, as I said.  You can win battle after battle, but sooner or later you are going to get obliterated by some stupid mistake or a powerful enemy or a meanass trap, just be careful.The graphics are a bit dated, but I personally don't care that they are, I still loved the game.The puzzle solving mechanics are tricky, and definitely increase based on your game progress, heavy learning curve.  There are dozens of secret areas, hidden objects and treasures, and quite a few weapons.  Lots to find using the puzzle solving mechanics.An interesting feature, that I actually didn't do my first playthrough but will next time, is Old School Mode.   Put simply, no map at all.  You ""must"" use a pen and paper and manually put down the dungeons in order to remember them, or just google them, I think of that as cheating but near the end I did use google, so whatevs.The game also has a ""food"" mechanic, you aren't required to feed your party, but you get serious negs if you don't and they are starving.  Mainly, they don’t regenerate health or energy at all, unless you trek back to a Life Crystal (largeass blue crystals that fully restore and revive fallen party members must wait a bit after each use).  Obviously being in an abandoned prison/dungeon, food is a little scarce, but you'll usually find food when you need it.EXPLORE! If you are one of those people who burn through games as quickly as possible without exploring, DON'T! Go off the beaten the path often, that's where a majority of the treasure and loot and armor sets lie.My only kind of gripe is the a little overpowered enemies, a few of them.  Most of the enemies are fairly balanced and scale with you, but some are a little TOO good.  My biggest annoyance was the annoyingass giant crabs; yes GIANT crabs.  They have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of health and almost never miss and hit hard, TWICE! Just a little overpowered imo.  At higher levels, they hit pretty hard but so do you, but when you first run into them, they wipe the floor with your face, just be careful, they appear on the 4th level if my memory serves me right.A fun, exciting, tough and moddable game with a dungeon creator tossed into the game, decent graphics a little dated (granted this came out in 2010 but still), fun combat, lots of loot and monsters. The closed environment and a bit of lack of replay value and a few overpowered enemies are annoying.  However, I recommend everyone to play this game at least once. 9/10 "

												A good throwback to games from the past such as Eye of the Beholder. The game is definitely a good modernization of games such as EotB. Finding all of the secrets, getting the 7 treasures, and upgrading your characters' skills is fun and you can actually see the progress paying off. It's also a huge puzzle game, so if you like puzzles (I personally do), you may enjoy this game. However, it can be a difficult/annoying game at times, especially if you get poisoned and run out of ingredients to make certain potions. However, this can be countered rather easily if you learn how to ""square dance"" with enemies, if you understand what I mean. Grimrock could've tuned that better because even the hardest of enemies become a cakewalk if you can get an enemy in that fashion.			"

												Pretty good dungeon crawler. I'm a big fan of the original Wizardry series (played 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8) and Eye of the Beholder (played 1 and 2). I miss those sorts of games, and Grimrock made me feel nostalgic, so I think it's a success.However, there were a couple things I didn't like very much. For me, much of the fun in RPGs and dungeon crawlers is the random loot, which comes in large part from random monsters. Every monster and item in Grimrock appears to be pre-placed. I think they did a fine job doing this, but any interest I may have had in replaying it with a different party has been eliminated by knowing that everything else about a second playthrough would be exactly the same. Maybe you'd like to have two characters wielding crossbows? Well, it seems you're out of luck. There appears to be only one crossbow in the game. You can't find another. There are also only a handful of quarrels -- about 20 I think. There are no vendors, so you can't buy/trade for more crossbows or quarrels. (Quarrels are reusable - you can pick them up again after the monster dies.)The other thing I like about party-based RPGs is exploring strategy. Particular combinations of buffs, debuffs, and attacks make combat richer and deeper, and reward you for taking time to think through your choices. Grimrock's combat, however, is mostly about dodging. There are very few buffs/debuffs, and it mostly doesn't make all that much difference what order your characters attack in. Which monster you attack first can make a difference, but mostly you won't be presented with much in the way of choice about that.In Wizardry 8, I started a brand-new game to explore a particular strategy. Rangers could get cricitical hits with ranged weapons, and gadgeteers could eventually learn to combine certain crossbows together so they could shoot three times per attack. Three rangers and a gadgeteer were hard in the early stages, and levelling up my gadgeteer and finding enough crossbows to equip each of my rangers with a triple-shot was a fun challenge. But once accomplished, my rangers were a rapid-fire killing posse, firing as many as 45 quarrels per combat round between them.  Buff them with speed, debuff the monsters with slowness and extra vulnerability to crits, and we weren't afraid of anything, especially if we could see it coming a long way off. The problem ended up being that it was awfully hard to carry around enough quarrels to get through more than a handful of fights. I had to take on some NPCs just to act as mules, and every trip to town involved clearing out every single vendor's stock of quarrels.We won't have any experiences like that in Grimrock, and that was disappointing to me.

												Wow! This game is way more fun than I expected. This game would be perfect except for one thing: hidden switches. You spend half an hour trying to solve a puzzle, and the only solution is to examine every single stupid wall on the whole level. Once or twice is fine, but this gimmick is thrown in repeatedly. I finally had to look at the FAQs just because I was sick of searching for a tiny difference in one of a hundred identical screens. Then they put in the rune. That's just cruel.			"

												Tribute to oldschool games. And an awesome one.Legend of Grimrock is a dungeon crawling game with puzzles. For start, let me say I usually don't like puzzle games.In LoG, you get to create your party (nice races, classes, names, you know it) which you are leveling up throughout the game. It's fun, especially the difference between classes (Mage is the most powerful but useless without mana and can get killed quickly while Rogue is also weak but comes with interesting tricks) and positions. Yes, you heard right, positions. You'll figure that out. The casting system is also nice, although hard to remember sometimes (take that as a challenge!). The puzzles themselves are nice and easy, but getting harder while you're progressing. I never really found a puzzle I couldn't solve, except one, but as I found out that was because I missed a hint somewhere earlier in the game. The dungeons are nicely designed and so are the traps and monsters - who are really original and (unfortunately for me, got stuck and the end of the game, gotta try a new party I guess) deadly. The game, while being oldschool, has a modern execution so it plays rather smoothly and the graphics are nice. Furthermore, it comes with easy to learn editor! To dungeons, adventurer!			"

												Disclaimer: This review is coming from someone who did not grow up on dungeon crawler games. A great little RPG/Dungeon crawler/puzzler.  Well worth the admission price.Pros:-Fantastic Atmosphere-Figuring out Puzzles make you feel like the smartest man (or woman) alive-Linear levels, but still manages to make exploration rewarding-Great community support (e.g., dungeon editor).-Challenging without feeling unfair-Can be very rewardingNeutral:-Decent replayability - the dungeon loses some of it's magic on subsequent playthroughs (which is one of the strongest points of the game) but interesting party possibilities exist.-Small number of weapon upgrades for each type-Interesting perspective being a party of characters rather than 1 character or being an omniscient controller of the party.  Some will enjoy it, some won't.Cons:-Combat takes some getting used to and feels slightly archaic-RPG elements (i.e., skill trees) are a weak point, imo.  They seem poorly thought out for the vanilla game-Some abilities/skills/stats are blatantly superior to others (particularly on higher difficulties)-A bit of a learning curve			"

												This game is tons of fun dungeon crawling.You play as a team of four characters (of any class you choose) that move together in a 3D grid world.  Because it's grid bound, it can be a little head-trippy when dealing with fast monsters whom you want to fall back on first-person-shooter skills with.The atmosphere of this game is very dark without being gorey.  Some monsters are pretty scary but it should be fine for someone who does zombie movies but not horror movies.Your inventory is limited, so you'll find yourself consulting the web to find out how important keeping an item is.  The most aggravating features are getting cornered and hunger.  The first issue you have to strategize to avoid, and the second issue you have to really juggle your inventory and stock up on food for whenever possible.This game is worth $5 if you don't complete all your games, $10 if you're a completionist and will really stick it out (it gets a little repetitive whenever you get stuck).  I am glad to have finished it.			"

(While it pays homage it does what it does in a very insignificant and weak way)Problem is it comes short. Puzzles are your usual affair and aren't nearly as intricate or as well thought out as Chaos Strikes back. The creatures are basic until they are annoying. There are many situations where multiple saves are the only way to get resolution (at least on hard).Everyone has a hardon for this game. But it is flawed.

												Legend of Grimrock is a dungeon crawler, inspired by classics like Dungeon Master. It delivers an old-school gameplay with HD graphics. The level design is good, both fights and puzzles offer a good challenge. The only weakness is a lack of variety concerning dungeon's environments.			"

												I love this game. I was a die hard EOB II fan, paying the princely sum of £37.99 for it in 1992, and then moving on to EOB I + III, as well as Dungeon Master. This is a perfect recreation of that classic atmosphere, along with some excellent graphics, and some of the most devious puzzles I've encountered in a CRPG game. I can't stop playing it, despite multiple restarts and completing it on Normal already (Old Skool mode, naturally). Now I'm attempting to find all the treasure on Hard mode, but using the auto-map this time. Well worth every penny.			"

The combat could've been more interesting; you will end up circle-strafing most enemies to minimize damage taken. The puzzles and exploration were quite solid and I had a fun time searching for collectibles and secrets. If you are in the mood for an old-school-style dungeon crawler, this might satisfy that craving. A decent little game, overall.			"

												You will most likely not even notice how amazing this game is. To those who rush its a decent dungeon crawler experience with enemys getting pretty hard towards the end and puzzles being annoyingly hard to solve unless you find that one button you missed that makes everything totally easy. To completionists: hahahahahahaha-good luck with them 100%. I looked in a guide to this game once and missed around 40 secrets and treasures in a matter of an hour apparently. And I looked at every rock and did all I could to gett all the equipment I could. This is what amazes me, its just so incredibly good at hiding stuff from you. The looks are those of a retro-game well done. The combat is ok as long as you dont get cornered by multiple enemys. The mage class is interesting because it will make you write down how to cast the different spells. The only thing that I didnt like about the game was when it was nitpicking. For example when I tried to activate a pressure platform by throwing a knife at it, it didnt work if I just threw the knife like you can throw any other item in the game, you have you use the attack with the throwing knife, In both cases the knife is on the platform but only the latter case works. But im nitpicking myself- if you like the thought of crawling through a dungeon filled with treasures monsters and riddles this is for you.			"

												I've never played anything quite like it before. If you're looking for an rpg in the tradition of modern titles such as The Elder Scrolls: III-V, be prepared to learn how the movement controls work, as they are vastly different. Not in a bad way though. The controls  for movement bring this game much closer to its pen and paper cousins, as every movement, forward, back, left, right, and even turning are basically the equivalent to taking a turn in a board game.Because of this, in some cases your next turn must be very carefully considered, as a mistep may lead to death. While this does make the game more difficult, I found the game to be enjoyable and rewarding once I got the hang of the movement.If you lack patience, then this title may not be for you, but for those who are willing to take the time, it will be a worthwhile experience of discovery and adventure.

												Oh god. SPIDERS!♥♥♥♥ing Spiders every time I turn a corner. I hate those ♥♥♥♥ers. They move way too fast and then murder your face off.Ok, so genre-wise it's pretty much Might and Magic. But there hasn't been a new Might and Magic game (not the Heroes one, the main series) in quite some time. Also, they were confusing as hell. This one is much more straight forward. The magic system is a little obtuse, but the rest of the game plays out very fluidly.I honestly don't know if there's more of a story than ""get out of the mountain"" and ""scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the player,"" but that's enough for this one. It's played for the puzzles. It only helps that the combat is not unwieldy. I don't know if I would particularly call the combat fun, but once you get into a rhythm it's almost soothing. Like a music simulator video game. Step, turn, hit. Step, turn, hit. Open the gate, hit, close the gate. Unless they're the ♥♥♥♥ing spiders. They move and attack way too god damn fast. But then again, they aren't that strong, and that's part of the challenge. Balancing tanking with movement and hitting. That's an old school first person RPG for you. Tile based and Fighter friendly. I wonder how a team of 4 fighters would have done...Anyways. This game is really fun. It's an interesting play on old school RPGs with lots of new school polish. I'm actually really surprised that this one was an indie. But it definitely is a good one.Also, with the level editor added into the game now, I'm looking to see what new adventures await. Perhaps a cow level?			"

												This game is AWESOME. Even though I don't think it's labelled/tagged 'horror', by heck it is one. Every time I'm faced with an opaque closed door, I know I have to open it, but I don't want to, because, at the end of the day, the enemies are unnecessarily creepy, scary and disturbing. Here's some examples (Do not apply if you play Dead Space/Evil Within/watch Silence of the Lambs on a regular basis):Snails: Meh.Crowerns: Unexpected low-level creepiness with the occasional minijumpscare.Skeletons: Meh.Spiders: ******* **** RUN JUMPSCARES GALORE!!! (especially when you get ambushed)Tentacles: Rarely even found, but a jumpscare guaranteed.Scavengerss: Don't look at him! Just slash and slash and DON'T FOCUS ON HIM!!!Crabs: I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THEM LEMME GO HOME!!!!So far, this game is 1st Person Zelda + Mini amnesia/FNaF jumpscares, aka addicting crap your pants simulator.Also, you are always needing to sleep to regen health and stamina. So this is Sleep, crap your pants and scream simulator.Speaking of sleeping, It seems whenever there's enemies like spiders or crocodiley things, even the occasional skeleton, and you sleep, you're gonna get interrupted, jumpscared and hit with an extra powerful attack, because you were basically backstabbed.However,When you do finally get through the cringeworthy battles and sometimes lookup-worthy puzzles, and you get to the revitalization crystal and the stairs to the next floor, You feel powerful and rewarded. 9999999999999999999999/10 would persevere through the jumpscares.Have you yet picked up that I have gamer-nerves and anyone similar/old and frail probably shouldn't play this?AFTER I FINiSHED IT*Watches Curse of Chucky*Meh*Reads Green Mile*... NOT SCARYETCAlso, I gained 20 IQ points from this game... sooo... yay education?Obviously, once you man up (or stop being a ♥♥♥♥♥ like me), you don't find anything scary. I feel like this game has made me stronger and smarter.new rating: 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10Also, conquered the GamerNerves just so I could prove to myself that I can do this. I can still get jumpscared (FNaF in mind), but this game has fortified my mind by trying to kill it. So if you want that, do it. namely, the <SPOILER>* 7 15 18 15 13 15 18 7 19 <SPOILER> were what stopped me from progressing, but that really forced me to make like TF2 and Mann Up.*Use the letter to number code to work out the name. ie: 1=a, 2=b, 3=c etc.			"

												Here's the truth: I haven't yet played a single minute of ""Legend of Grimrock"", so this isn't a review of the game. And albeit I was never much of a dungeon crawler in my youth, I do have very fond memories of ""Lands of Lore"". That's why, in this time of open-world MMORPGs with ultra-realistic 3D leaves and flyings birds, I find it very refreshing that a small independent gaming studio from Finland decides to make a ballsy move and revisit the '90s dungeons in all it's 90-degree, monster-filled glory (updated to the graphic standards of this millennium). This game shows just how far you can go when you love the product, not just the income they bring (here's looking at you, EA and Ubisoft). That's why I strongly recommend you all to support these guys in their wonderful nostalgic, old-school project. Because they represent what this business is all about. And because the game just rocks!			"

												Anyone ancient enough to remember Dungeon Master? This is just that with obviously better gfx. Game gives you option to play old school mode 'unmapped' so graph paper and a pencil to light your way ;)Im not playing that way as for one i dont have a pencil hehe. Dont forget to save often.So far all good, couple times been chased back the way i came by and frantically swapping the party around so that valuble melee upfront dont die on me and i can find a safe spot to rest.So far so good and on Steam sale today for £2.99 you really cant go wrong!

												One of the best classic-like RPGs out there. Has a pen-and-paper feel to it and very unique combat.This is a tile-based game wherein you control 4 characters (a mixture of fighter / rogue / mage). You can either use pre-determined characters or create your own which involves distributing stat points and choosing various attributes. You can make everything from a tank, to a melee rogue, archer, spell-caster, etc.Movement is limited to moving forward / back / left / right along the tiles. This actually works out pretty well, partly because the setting is that of a jail or dungeon so it feels very confined to begin with.Combat is very unique and pretty addictive. Your characters are arranged in a square - two in the front, two in the back. You really need to plan your fights and reposition your characters as you go. For example, a melee character may not be able to attack from the back row, but he won't take any damage either. Archers and spell-casters do well in the back, but take a lot of damage in the front. Etc. You attack by clicking your characters' weapons, each of which is on a cool-down, which gives you time to re-position your characters in real-time. I also find myself strafing back-and-forth (recall the way movement works, so you can try to force enemies between a few tiles). In larger fights, this can work against you as you can get trapped in a corner. There's a lot of strategy going on.Spell casting is also very unique. You click a combination of runes to cast a spell. This requires a bit of thought as you can't save rune combinations.			"

												This game is a great throwback to old-school dungeon crawlers. I liked it a great deal more than I'd though I would. There's very little hand-holding here: Both battles and puzzles can get quite challenging, but never frustratingly so. Thus, the game manages to strike a rarely-seen balance, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to... everyone, actually. Go try it out. On top of everything, the game is very reasonably priced.			"

												Don't bother. This game is deceptively fun...right up until level 6 (out of 13). When the puzzles began displaying the kind of solutions that only a downs-addled fruit fly could ever conceive of, I stopped playing. I wouldnt necessarily have a problem with it if there were maybe multiple routes to an objective or if the puzzles didnt always block progress...If you're determined to beat this game without using the game guides, then glhf.

												This game was honestly amazing.  If you played and enjoyed the old-style dungeon crawler type games, you should check this out.  Streamlined interface, crisp graphics, responsive controls, good ambiance and an intriguing plot.  I can't say enough about this one.  It's a little short, but better short and fun than long and tedious.Only caveat:  Read what the stats do before you decide on your party, and don't make assumptions based on previous games.  For example: Dex has nothing to do with ranged attacks.  Strength and carrying capacity are important.  My party was somewhat poorly made because I didn't plan ahead.  It didn't prevent me from proceeding though.TL;DR -- Awesome game.  Play it immediately.			"

Character models are great, gameplay was lots of fun and puzzles left me stumped in a few places, which is seldom found in current gen games with all the help and pointers for quest succession. This game makes you think, remember, and dodge!  Looking forward to a sequel.

												My impression of this game was low at first, but then after I decided to play it, I decided it was pretty good. I started playing through the levels, and by the time I got to level 5, I decided I had to find out how it ended, and I am glad I did. The style and atmosphere of this game is stunning, and the puzzles and battles are alright too. I must say it fully entertained me for about 15 hours, which is fairly good, considering it is a dungeon crawler that is not randomized.The floors are well differentiated, and no two are the same in enemies or puzzles. It progressed well and only one area felt like it ran on a bit long. I think it was floors 6-8, but it wasn't too bad. It quickly changed on floor 9.Overall 8/10, recommended.			"

												This game is an old school RPG with a lot of tricky puzzles and very tactical combat. This game has 4 races and 3 classes and you get to create a party of 4 characters out of any of the races and classes available. Some races have better stats that make them better at playing a certain class but you can make them do whatever. Also you will have to watch out for hunger as it will stop health or mana regeneration if a character isn't well fed. The magic system is a bit tricky so you will have to read a guide or see a video showing how it works. To learn new skills or spells you will have to increase a certain skill by improving skills such as Swords,Fire magic,Daggers,Assassination and more.			"

												First off, let me basically spoil the rest of this review by saying this game is amazing and you need to play it right now.The combat is surprisingly tense, and the fact it's real time introduces a whole host of tactical decisions to make per new enemy type encountered. The skill variety never feels useless or dull and deaths almost never feel unfair (which is a huge rap for a game that can be as punishing as this). The puzzles always make careful note to teach you subtly how to solve them, whether through the environment or cryptic notes. There's yet to be an element of this game, 10 hours in, that I didn't love or at the very least appreciate.			"

Playing it really did grip me, even when the obscure puzzles stopped me in my tracks and sent me scurrying to YouTube for answers. There's no doubting the challenge this game represents - it's HARD!

												Legend of Grimrock is an old-school RPG that harkens back to old first-person dungeon crawlers such as the venerable Eye of the Beholder series, the older Might and Magics or the Wizardry series.My first playthrough on normal difficulty took close to 20 hours and this was considering that i had skipped a couple of puzzles and also had to consult the net for solutions to some of them.Puzzles are the core of the game. Some of them are essential for game progression, most are optional, and ALL of them are very cleverly crafted and are absolutely fun and challenging. You will definitely get a sense of satisfaction if you manage to solve it without any help.However because of this, I personally felt that the game focused too much on puzzle solving, and the game sometimes felt more like a puzzle game with RPG elements instead of an RPG with puzzles.Instead of having puzzles subtly presented like in the old Eye of the Beholder series, Grimrock literally hands you a puzzle room and even puts out a label of the puzzle's name.On the whole, this makes the whole game feel more like 13 levels of puzzle rooms where you just need to solve it to progress instead of an RPG with a coherent story that gives context to the puzzles.Story is definitely not Grimrock's strong point, and it only provides an introductory excuse to let the player know why he is in a dungeon. As a game touted as an RPG, the treasure and loot selection are unfortunately not exciting. There are only a couple of limited choices. This game also features the most rediculous looking final boss in an RPG ever.Music is very well done and sounds appropriately cinematic and epic. However, there are only 2 tracks in the whole game. The art style while looking very modern, recycles alot of textures and makes every dungeon level feel the same as the earlier ones.The main gripe I had was the magic system, which was overly complicated and too frustrating to use. It actually requires you to remember spell combinations and click on them fast during battle. I felt that they should have had a simpler approach to this, or at least provide a simpler alternative style. (Eg: why can't we right click on the mage's hand, choose the spell i want and just cast it?)Despite its flaws, Legend of Grimrock is still a very good game and is a worthy addition to the past glorious dungeon-crawlers. The fact that the entire game was made by only a 4 man team with a limited budget really blows the mind. Whats more, they even allowed player modding on this game which is probably a first time for games of this type and genre.For veterans of old-school RPG dungeon-crawlers, this game is a definite must buy. For newer gamers who have never experienced such old-school gameplay before however, it is better to review the gameplay videos before deciding if this game is for you. The play style in this game may not appeal to modern gamers.Overall Rating: 8.0 / 10An excellent and authentic old-school dungeon crawler that veterans would enjoy. I cannot wait to see a sequel to this game. Two thumbs up. Don't miss it.			"

												Ok, I've bought 20 or so games now on Steam, and while I enjoy them all, this is the first one I've been compelled to recommend/comment on.  I loved Dungeon Master on my old Atari ST back in college, and man, this really takes me back (in a really good way)!  Torches that burn out, food that must be eaten, mundane gear that you are rejoicing to find, this is OLD SCHOOL DONE RIGHT!  If you are looking for something like Eye of the Beholder, Dungeon Master or like dungeons with puzzles and tricks - this is the one for you.  The price is perfect and it even comes with it's own dungeon editor to make your own.  Graphics are really well done and the sense of atmosphere is second to none - you really get that feeling of being trapped deep underground.  So what are you waiting for?  Buy it now!			"

												I enjoy this game, plenty of re play with different character skills. Not as simple as it may seem. Fun to figure out and deep reminder of D&D of old. Click and turn based, graphics are good, quite hard in some areas have to figure out some strategies to keep alive.			"

												The game embodies the old-school look and feel of RPGs from the early 90s. Gameplay wise it mixes combat with puzzle solving. Although sometimes the puzzles rely too much on a hidden switch on the wall, some of them are quite rewarding, once solved. Combat is tactical, you have to move around the enemy while trying to time your attacks, though the WASD and EQ buttons sometimes made navigation a bit hectic. Furthermore, the way you cast a spell takes too many steps, I wish it was simpler.TLDR: play this game :)			"

												A tribute to old school dungeon crawlers, might not be for everyone but it's damn well executed. You can even disable automapping and draw your own map using only the compass, pen and paper.Few games reward keeping your eyes open and taking notes like this one. Fair but challenging puzzles that are satisfying to solve.			"

												Only 4 hours in, on level 3, and I can soundly say that this is THE BEST dungeon crawler I've played in a long time. Character creation isn't overcomplicated, puzzles are fantastic, the entire thing is just intuitive. Not to mention, of course, the nostalgia it'll bring to anyone who enjoyed games like Swords and Serpents. The level editor is polished (but can take some time to learn), and it has spectacular workshop support. Simply incredible, in every way.			"

												Old school RPG meets 3D! This game blends in action, exploration, puzzle-solving and suspense in a very effective way; you will feel the dread, you will feel fear alongside your characters. The Workshop features added replayability and variation on the theme, and some are actually on par (or even better) than the original.Despite a few shortcomings in the control departement (keys can indeed be remapped to whatever you want, but it's still a bit sluggish overall), the game will suck you right in, right there in that horrible dungeon. Fascinating.			"

												So as to not be too lengthy here, some bullet points: -its excellent-combat feels a bit clunky, especially at first. But its almost like a perfect blend between classic turn based and real time. Getting 'boxed in' is the main mechanic and can be really frustrating at times. -very addicting-could use more weapons especially rogue daggers and mage ones (i ran with 2 mages and found only 2 staffs during the entire game, as well as one off hand. needs more)-the workshop is going to be AWESOME for this game. The game is long enough to satisfy, but I feel like my characters were just beginning to mature. Could have kept going a long time ;)-give them your money			"

Your party as well as the enemies move in squares, and you attack as a unit (although each party member is controlled seperately and timed differently)Two: This is definitely a memorable game to play. I'm a few hours into the story and I'm liking the game so far. It can be frustrating at times, and you need to remember to save often, but solving the puzzles and exploring, all while paying attention to sounds and what's around you are both exhilarating and exciting.Thumbs up from me.

												A fantastic dungeon crawler game, really brings back the nostalgia with a beautiful new face. Almost Human did an awesome job reviving the genre, as they stayed true to the way it used to be without adding a lot of extra fluff. The combat is exciting and adrenaline pumping at times as you try to survive in this dark dungeon. Not too much of a story or explanations of the plot but that's fine. Leaves it all to the imagination. While the puzzles were great, my only complaint is that some of them involved needing exacting timing. There were times where a puzzle would require a sequence of button pushes all while running across pits that would open and close and these often became incredibly frustrating since precise hand-eye coordination is required. In the future I hope they stick to the more intellect based puzzles requiring thought and pondering than how fast you can mash the keys to zip around a pillar without falling in a hole. Besides that though, glowing praise all around!			"

												Legend of Grimrock was a refreshing reminder of my time spent enjoying the game ""Knightmare"" on the Amiga 500 as a teenager (which was based on the TV show, which I absolutely adored as a child). It holds the exact same movement & combat style, except based in fully 3D grim (yet vibrant and colourful) dungeon world.If you had played Knightmare, or anything similar, then you will appreciate LoGrimrock - If you haven't, then this would be a nice change of pace for those who are tired of the same old RPG or MMORPG styles.Admittedly, it didn't take me long to complete the full game, though you have a secret mode to enjoy (assuming you found a specific secret) - As well as a heck of a lot of other hidden secrets to find, which can easily be missed on the first few playthroughs.In short, this game was a nostalgic reminder of a style long past, and a fresh experience for those who hadn't played such games before. It's a satisfying dungeon romp that will have you side-stepping spells, arrows, traps and monsters until the goo-cows come home.			"

												all right lets see so far in 80 mins of the game. legends of grimrock is a classic tile movement rpg game. story is you are prisoners that was suppose to be sentenced to death but have a 2nd chance. you are put into grimrock mountain at the very top and must travel down to the exit but no one has ever came out when sent into the dungeons. when you start the game you have 4 preset characters which are 2 fighters, 1 rogue and 1 mage. you can instead customize your own heroes if u want. when starting the game you can change campaign (which so far only 1 right now and thats grimrock) change the difficulty from easy, normal or hard. also have a optio nto go oldschool mode. old school is where u do not have a map to giude you so to memorize whats what in the dungeon u need a black paper and a pencil to draw the dungeon and right notes down. in gameplay move is w, a, s, d and turn left and right is q and e. tab (without oldschool) brings up the map and type notes down. continue next review-			"

												Legend of Grimrock is a fantastic rpg and puzzle game. Almost Human clearly has put a lot of effort into this game, and it really shows. Levels are well crafted, and full of secret and challenging puzzles. This makes it so that you have to really think if you want the best gear, and there are many examples of great puzzles throughout this game. The atmosphere is also a big part of this game, with excellant sound and visuals style.There are a few things that hold this game back though(two mior and one major complaint), that I do need to mention:1. There are a few puzzles that are a complete miss though they are few and far between.2.The scenery can get rather repetitive (get ready for more stone walls than you can handle), but this is also a minor complaint.*SPOILERS*3.(The big one) The final level, final boss, and overall ending is disappointing to a saddening degree. The last level's puzzles are very simple and final boss is a joke. The battle with is insultingly easy with him being too slow to catch you as you back pedal away from him and attack with your ranged characters, not to mention that you can easily leave the battle to heal and revive your party members and jump right back in with no consequences. The boss's design is laughable as well (i mean REALLY?!).Disappointing final level aside, I really enjoyed Legend of Grimrock, and if your a fan of rpgs, so will you.			"

												The easy way out would be to say ' for fans of oldschool first-person rpg's' , but given that I never played one back then and am enjoying myself tremendously nevertheless:The feeling of exploration is great, and those who keep their eyes open for secrets will be rewarded -- although the ' reward'  might at times be a gigantic spider hidden behind a secret wall.

												The game embodies the old-school look and feel of RPGs from the early 90s. Gameplay wise it mixes combat with puzzle solving. Although sometimes the puzzles rely too much on a hidden switch on the wall, some of them are quite rewarding, once solved. Combat is tactical, you have to move around the enemy while trying to time your attacks, though the WASD and EQ buttons sometimes made navigation a bit hectic. Furthermore, the way you cast a spell takes too many steps, I wish it was simpler.TLDR: play this game :)			"

												Legend of Grimrock employs a great deal of forward thinking to what seems to be a long-forgotten genre of RPGs.  The first-person tile-based dungeon crawl has recently been dominated by Japanese developers, mostly ATLUS, and while great games in their own right, they lack the feeling that the early Wizardy and Might & Magic games had.  Every single bit of Grimrock feels deliberate; crisp visuals give way to crisp sound, providing a surprising depth of ambiance and atmosphere.  Indeed, each room and item has a purpose for it's placement, adding to the immersion.Grimrock's combat moves to a beat - each monster moves at a certain pace, and moving with it is the key to surviving.  The brings a certain amount of tension to each fight, and moving around the environment has its own unique challenges.  Twitchy fingers are practically a requirement on Hard but this is common in dungeon crawls, and after a small amount of time movements between attacks become second-nature.  Magic in Grimrock is fairly straightforward - a board of 9 runes comprise each spell in the game, and combinations are explained in scrolls found throughout the dungeon.  This is probably the biggest misstep Grimrock makes.  It's very easy to progress down a skilltree in a specific element of magic, only to find one or two scrolls relating to the element.  It's a frustrating feeling, and makes the player feel like knowledge of the exact location of each spell is required.  As good as the combat is, the heart of Grimrock is exploration and puzzle solving, something that is (thankfully) executed flawlessly.  Constant observation of your environment is a must especially in the later levels where it's required for progression.  It's tough to explain the puzzle system without giving too much away - but each level of the prison brings new challenges and secrets.Legend of Grimrock is the breath of life into a genre nowadays only found on handhelds, and aside from a few hiccups,  presents a polished experience that indie RPGs should aspire.

												Legend of Grimrock is a surprisingly awesome game that I'd highly recommend. I saw the screenshots and videos of it before and didn't think it looked like anything special, but the gameplay is phenomenal. It's a dungeon crawler with lots of exploration, secret passages and traps, loot and lite crafting, and interesting combat. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try if it's your style of game, even if you've looked at the media and thought it looked weird.			"

												I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.The level's aren't randomized, but that's alright because they're built with certain puzzles in mind. The puzzles are often pretty good, and the combat is entertaining, following the a grid layout where your party of 4 moves around as one. You individually select the items in their hands to attack/throw/cast spells/etc. Tons and tons of secret rooms and items.You can create your group of 4 based on certain classes and races, distribute points and unlock traits, then find gear as you go. It's an excellent combination of old dungeon crawlers and new graphics and game design.			"

												My impression of this game was low at first, but then after I decided to play it, I decided it was pretty good. I started playing through the levels, and by the time I got to level 5, I decided I had to find out how it ended, and I am glad I did. The style and atmosphere of this game is stunning, and the puzzles and battles are alright too. I must say it fully entertained me for about 15 hours, which is fairly good, considering it is a dungeon crawler that is not randomized.The floors are well differentiated, and no two are the same in enemies or puzzles. It progressed well and only one area felt like it ran on a bit long. I think it was floors 6-8, but it wasn't too bad. It quickly changed on floor 9.Overall 8/10, recommended.			"

												LoG is not a bad game. I do like the retro feel and the graphics a lot. What I don't like is the gameplay mechanics. 1st it's real time. Combine that to an attack system triggered by a right mouse click on 4 squares at the bottom right of your screen, with recharge times for every attack and movement along a grid and you'll understand what the issue is: more than fighting enemies you're fighting the interface. I'm sure that with enough practice one can get good at it but it's not where the focus of the combat mechanics should be in my opinion. Since enemies are quite strong - at least in the beginning of the game -  combat mostly boils down to weather you manage to evade enemy attacks long enough while still being able to land a hit once in a while. Let a single enemy (or worse: two)  corner you and  it's ""load the last savegame"" time. Another thing I dislike: you can't move with your map open and there's no minimap. So prepare to hit ""tab"" quite a few times.If you're looking for a less frustrating game but still with a lot of retro feeling to it then you might want to check Might and Magic X.			"

If you are thinking about getting it only for the fighting, you should probably find another game.			"

												Holy Nut Balls! This game is virtual crack. Take the old fashioned dungeon RPG from the nostalgic begginings of PC gaming and give it a modern twist. Legend of Grimrock starts you off with a 4 character party that you have the option to customize their race(Insectoid FTW), name, class and stats. Once you create your awesome characters you start off in the dungeon and fight off some big♥♥♥♥♥snails and solve some puzzles that become more complicated in the later levels. Unlike the old memorable dungeon RPGs, Grimrock's combat is not turnbased and  if you get hit, its mostly your fault. The magic system is a bit difficult to use, but its actually very unique. You combine some symbols in order to cast different spells. The right combination of symbols is never revealed to you unless you find a scroll that shows you what combination is which spell. I really can't describe it any better, just expreince yourself and you will find magic a fun chore. Grimrock also has a dungeon creator for all you creative people who want to see your friends play your creations and laugh at their rage. I have not played around with dungeon creator, but I have seen videos of dungeons made by people that look very nice. All in all, buy this game. This game deserves more praise and I would like to see more games like this(:			"

												A fun little RPG. It can easily be beat in a couple of days to a week of casual play. Despite the 3D art, the game/movement takes place in a 2D tile-based environment (no jumping) with turn-based movementUpsides: decent character and plot progression, and art. Some good puzzles. Legitimately fun game overall.Downsides: UI is easy enough to navigate, but can be a bit klunky. Little diversity to the monsters and items. Nearly all of the monsters can easily be beaten by drawing them into an open space and stepping around them. More levels would have been nice so that the characters can progress in skills a bit further. Overall not that bad taking into account that this was made by something like 2-3 devs.			"

There is so much potentil in this genre and I hope many sequels will follow or similar game releases in the future. I will not bore you all with it's concept or design; I will just tell you that if you like games like the old SSI gold box material like pools of radiance, eye of the beholder than this is a refreshing take on those types with HD inmplimented and a worhty addition to gaming.I hope the dev community is watching as this is an awesome basis for game design.

												I honestly don't get why I'm enjoying this game so much. Its so refreshing to play at such a slower pace, and although the environment is 3D its still played as per Eye of the Beholder, and you can look around. Just feels a good way to play. Levels arent too massive, and becuase you're not bogged down with looting everything so you can sell it at the shop you fine tune your inventory much more. Top game.			"

												A solid contemporary updating of the classic '90s grid-based dungeon crawlers (such as Dungeon Master and the Eye Of The Beholder series). Most of the ""old skool"" mechanics remain intact but the game has a modern polish with some nice graphics and lighting effects. The combat is as uncomplicated as it ever was (strafe & click), but as with most games of this type much of the dungeon is filled with teleporter and pressure pad puzzles that range from fairly simplistic to mind-boggling memory tests. In all, it's nice slice of yesteryear nostalgia that has been given a fresh coat of paint for modern RPG gaming enthusiasts.			"

												If you loved Dungeon Master back in the day and wonder why they don't make 'em like that anymore, well...they do! LoG is full of old-school goodness just the way you remember, only now with an auto-map feature, so you can put away the graph paper (unless you play hardcore mode). I enjoyed my time with this game immensely, and my only knock against it is that it ended a bit sooner than I expected (based on character stat maximums). However, they were working on a map editor and maybe an expansion, so that's good news. In summary, if you call yourself an old-school gamer and enjoyed games like DM, Ultima Underworld and Bard's Tale, get it!			"

												This is a very fun dungeon crawl, but I can't play it for long periods of time because it makes me motion sick.  Each level is filled with secrets to find, monsters to slay, and puzzles to solve.  The core combat mechanics work well.  Combat is real time with characters getting a cool down between attacks.   There is a limited number of base classes, but they can be built in a multitude of ways.  The only class that I am not fond of is the Mage.  Spells consist of using runes to cast magic making spellcasting require at least 3 clicks where every other class uses one. It messes with the tempo of the game.  While many of the puzzles use the same mechanics to actually work, all of them feel fun and varied so it's not the same puzzle over and over again.			"

												This game is an old school RPG with a lot of tricky puzzles and very tactical combat. This game has 4 races and 3 classes and you get to create a party of 4 characters out of any of the races and classes available. Some races have better stats that make them better at playing a certain class but you can make them do whatever. Also you will have to watch out for hunger as it will stop health or mana regeneration if a character isn't well fed. The magic system is a bit tricky so you will have to read a guide or see a video showing how it works. To learn new skills or spells you will have to increase a certain skill by improving skills such as Swords,Fire magic,Daggers,Assassination and more.			"

Food, equipment weight, item throwing, rune magic, it's all there. Expect lots of puzzles, pitfalls and monster traps.Simple game interface is kind of two-edged sword. However, this retro simplicity usually works well unless you need to use potions.I miss old DM way to level skills by using them, but LoG skill point system is O.K. and avoids grinding monster spawns.8/10, very good game with retro feeling(depends if you like moving on pen and paper grid).

This time decided to give it atleast a hour and I ended up playing 4 hours.This is infact a good game with really good puzzles. Well the game mechanics are kind of hard to grasp at beginning and the tutorial doesn't explain that well. So total beginners will have trouble with ""Legend Of Grimrock"" at first. But once you get the hang out of it, you just can't seem to stop. And if you want to be more hardcore, go the old school way( which I have yet to try).			"

												Well this pretty much IS Dungeon Master. Just with nicer graphics and different layout. Dungeon master was awesome when it came out (apparently back in '87!) and it turns out, the formula is still pretty fun now. Great mix of tricky puzzles and fighting monsters. Sure, the fighting gets a little repetitive but it also manages to feel quite frantic because as soon as you're backed in to a coner, you're probably dead. Think I'll be spending quite some time with this one.			"

												Fun hack&slash/dungeoncrawl from old...sort of. This game has a lot in common with the old games like Dungeon Hack, but what bothers me about it is a lack of random map generation, meaning once you've played threw the game there just isn't the same draw the old games in this genra have. That being said the game uses a suprising amount of clever puzzles & character customization is quite nice. Oh...and it's very very hard, think survival horror hard. Plus i havn't really found having more then 1 spellcaster useful enough to outweigh the negatives.			"

												If you're a hardcore dungeon crawler who likes game series like Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder, Wizardry, Shining in the darkness, etc,  you absolutely cannot pass up this incredible game. Even if you haven't played one before, this is the one you should try. Also, if you like Portal, this game is for you. Many of the puzzles are tough, but extremely rewarding once you figure them out.This game will go down as one of the year's bests. Best $12 I've ever spent.			"

												Legend of Grimrock is modernised version of many of the classic dungeon crawling experiences of the 1990s, taking inspiration from such games as Ultima Underworld, Dungeon Master, and Dungeons & Dragons, this games makes for a deep grid based action role-playing game.Starting off with next to nothing you and your ragtag bunch of prisoners must battle through levels and levels of dungeons clearing them, finding secrets and reaching the levels. Appoint XP points into each of your characters to unlock new abilities such as spells and the ability to use different weapons. Change your party line; do you prefer to use your mage on the front line? Move him to the front two and watch him destroy the enemy. Or, do you prefer to bash in creatures? Put up your shields and use your heavy hitters to deal the maximum amount of damage. Don't let my few hours of game time throw you off, this doesn't include offline playtime and it truly is an absorbing masterpiece brought to you by a fantastic Finish indie developer. The steam version also includes a level editor allowing you to create your own dungeon and share it with your friends or the steam community via the steam workshop, so go on, go buy this and you won't regret it one bit.

												This is a great modern take on a classic game style. As an homage to Lands of Lore, Stonekeep, and Eye of the Beholder, Legend of Grimrock keeps the interface (tile movement and character profiles on the page) similar to the original games but adds some modern flare to it with 3D enemies andmild free camera movement while keeping everything we loved of the original games intacked. The game can be short or long depending on your play style and willingness to explore the secrets and extra areas.I've thouroughly enjoyed this game with my daughter's company as assistant navigator and I recommend it to any old school gamers out there.

												I was put off by the trailer showing the movement system, but I was amazed at how incredibly quick I got used to it, and remembered what it was like playing games which had grid movement (Zelda for example!).A review about it being a pixel hunt for secret switches etc also put me off, but this is most definately NOT THE CASE. You do not have to hunt down the secret doors, and they aren't that hard to find either (except for a couple of rune engravings, but those are the super secrets and the game hints at their locations).The only issue I have is the inventory management is a little mundane, but you quickly forget about it.This is one of my most recommended games ever. Extremely well polished.			"

												Grimrock is a triumphant (re-)discovery of the first-person dungeon crawler genre, fused with modern sensibilities which make it all the more atmospheric and immersive.The real-time combat encourages skillful dances around enemies (as well as careful timing of one's actions to interrupt enemies' attacks). The brain-rackingly devious puzzles are intensely challenging and rewarding. The secrets are often extremely well-hidden and reward careful exploration. Multiple playthroughs can offer very different experiences based on how you design your party members.Never have I been so terrified of mushrooms.I highly recommend this as a thinker's game and as an excellent sampling of the core old-school dungeon crawling experience.

												First off, let me basically spoil the rest of this review by saying this game is amazing and you need to play it right now.The combat is surprisingly tense, and the fact it's real time introduces a whole host of tactical decisions to make per new enemy type encountered. The skill variety never feels useless or dull and deaths almost never feel unfair (which is a huge rap for a game that can be as punishing as this). The puzzles always make careful note to teach you subtly how to solve them, whether through the environment or cryptic notes. There's yet to be an element of this game, 10 hours in, that I didn't love or at the very least appreciate.			"

												This game is an old school RPG with a lot of tricky puzzles and very tactical combat. This game has 4 races and 3 classes and you get to create a party of 4 characters out of any of the races and classes available. Some races have better stats that make them better at playing a certain class but you can make them do whatever. Also you will have to watch out for hunger as it will stop health or mana regeneration if a character isn't well fed. The magic system is a bit tricky so you will have to read a guide or see a video showing how it works. To learn new skills or spells you will have to increase a certain skill by improving skills such as Swords,Fire magic,Daggers,Assassination and more.			"

(though there are many secrets to be found)2) spellcasting is terribly clunkyI am interested to see what people do with the level editor,the environment is  beautiful, and the puzzles are pretty good, the combat is decent, the atmosphere is wonderful!  and the storyline/storytelling is near the top for a dungeoncrawler.9/10 midway through first playthrough.

												A nod back to the earlier days of dungeon RPGs, this game will have you thinking of Captive and Lands of Lore.The developers have added some fresh ideas in here, like the spell casting, which is done by combining 9 different ""elements"" (laid out in a numpad style) in a specific pattern, all by memory (or cheating with pen and paper).Thoroughly recommended for those who are nostalgic for those old school dungeon crawlers			"

												Legend of Grimrock is what I'd consider a minimalist RPG. What I mean by this, is the story and premise is set up right at the begining of your play, then after that you're left to your own devices. You basically form your own story while you explore the dungeons. It's very much in the ideals of the original Ultima series, where it's all about exploration, finding secrets, and killing monsters. You get to either spawn four prisoners that you'll take on your journey, or customize them to exactly who you want with you. The races and the types are familiar (warrior, wizard, rogue), but the way you can build them is where the difference comes in. The game play itself is also aikin back to what RPGs used to be on the computer. Everything works in blocks, you can turn, sidestep, and all of that good stuff during battle, but it all works on a grid. Along with this you can either choose to draw your own map, or play with one that populates as you go depending on how old school you want to be. The graphics bring you into the game and the monsters are well designed and fun to fight. There's a lot of secrets worth looking for meaning you're going to be checking every wall for loose rocks, or for some of the other ways you open the doors. On top of this, the replayability is excellent because of the mod community. Currently there's a mod that keeps most of the original set up but makes things harder and adds more dungeons, or you can just download the added dungeons that other people have created.Over all this is a great game that, for how it's designed, there isn't much to complain about and I recommend this to anyone that's an RPG fan, especially if you remember the originals like Ultima and Final Fantasy for NES.

												I'll jut cut to the chase. Game is fun. Fun exploring new areas, difficulty is tough but fair, puzzles are pretty fun. Combat is kinda meh. You'll be kiting monsters frequently in 2x2 spaces or opening doors, swinging and closing. However, casting spells is pretty fun are enough combinations to feel varied depending on what type of mage you play. Overall I'd give this game an 8, The combat isn't the greatest but it's still fun fighting monsters you encounter for the first time. Also prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥for the ice lizard maze in level 9.			"

												I apologize in advance for my star-eyed enthusiasm.It's challenging. It's charming. It's old school. Grimrock, to me, is a game of imagination. While obviously nowhere near to the extent of pen & paper, your characters (the most important aspect) are left up to you to flesh out. This is where all the fun begins. The character system is pretty flexible for its simplicity, and simplicity makes for great gameplay balance. The aformentioned flexibility also adds to replay value with there being many combinations of builds, although your mileage may vary. The classes are well balanced, all except the mage. They are an insult to the name ""magic-user"" because they aren't nearly versatile enough to make up for their many weaknesses.(I personally solved my inept mage problem with Cheat Engine by giving him 8 skill points per level) - use ""double"" as the address type.The gameplay itself is a delicate mix of puzzle-solving, action, character management and hoarding with a bit of story advancement thrown in. Combat is real-time and fairly simple, but has several strategic and tactical elements, such as party order, flanking, backstabbing, and rudimentry dodging. Items are particularly well done. Everything you might expect in an RPG is there and balanced well, including the modest amount of interesting, unique, and powerful items.While Grimrock does have a few rough edges, it is nonetheless expertly crafted.

												Old-school design, new-school look.  Legend of Grimrock is a nod to dungeon crawlers of the past with its first-person view and grid terrain dungeons (think first-person rogue-like as an analogy).  You create a party of four (races: human, minotaur, lizzardman, and insectoid; classes: warrior, rogue, and mage) and set out on your quest to traverse down the pits of Grimrock--the highest summit in a fantasy world.  On each level, which increases in difficulty the further you go down, monsters imperil your survival while clever and daunting puzzles test your patience and sanity.  Very deep and satifyingly tactical; at $15, Legend of Grimrock is a must buy.			"

												At first I thought this game would be boring and not at all enjoyable, but it surprised me, I found it to be very fun and even a bit addicting.The mechanics are nice although they seem a bit strange, you have a group of 4 people which you can't split so that you can take better advantage of your numbers, it is like you are a 4-headed ogre, if there is such a thing.What really caught my attention was the nostalgic feeling of crawling into a dungeon just like the old eye of the beholder and also the puzzles. It was very fun exploring and solving the puzzles in this game, but I must confess some of them were a pain to solve.In all, it is a simple game, which might be a little addicting if you like to challenge yourself into exploring and solving numerous puzzles, the story is okay and overall I like this game very much, might not be a game for every person, but I believe it is worth a shot.

												The screensaver of gears alone is probably worth half the price of this game. Actually its not a screensaver, but that would be awesome if it was!There's something appealing to me about old-school dungeon crawlers and Legend of Grimrock is no exception.Creating your party = winExploring dungeons = winGaining experience/levels = winFinding treasure = winSpooky factor = winNot too difficult puzzles = winSmooth and Steady gradation of difficulty = winWhat separates this first person dungeon crawler is the whiff of dry humor and psychedelics (your party will eat their share of mushrooms to stay alive). And the reason I say that is because of how smooth the gradation of difficulty/monsters/puzzles goes as your progress.One thing I find difficult however, is spellcasting in combat. It can be challenging to manage 4 characters in real time combat much less managing the spells of the caster. You actually have to click on a recipe or sequence of 3 symbols to cast spell. A party of spellcasters? Unthinkable. Out of the question. Impossible.And here's my solution: HOTKEYS! Why cant we use hot keys to program our top 3-5 used spells?Backpack/Weight management can also be difficult. I took one minotar in my party and his worth in packmule and tank roles was quickly surpassed by my human fighter of average abilities save for SKILLED Feat +5 skill points. She actually has almost as many hit points as my minotar, easts less food, has higher armor rating, higher weapon rating, much more reliable.All in all 4/5 looking forward to the Legend of Grimrock 2 after I beat this one.

												Legend of Grimrock game review pending… (maybe forever…)  Okay, a quickie…  The game is freaking awesome!  Great old school RPG gameplay, party of 4, awesome graphics, lighting and sound, etc, etc…  Buy it!!!  Also know that Legend of Grimrock 2 is also out and you may want to get that.  I have a Mac running OS X 10.6.8.  See bottom for my full specs.The Legend of Grimrock (LoG) ""Level Editor"" alone is worth the price of the game!  I seriously may never play another game accept for my own LoG adventures!  I am so addicted to this editor and pretty good at it too if I might say!Seriously, I cannot break away from the level editor long enough to write a review about the game which is also really awesome!  Ideas just keep popping into my head for my adventure.  The editor is the easiest, most powerful game editor I have ever used.  An 8 y/o could make full blown D&D style adventures!  It's that easy. I never once needed a manual except when scripting a couple of things.  There is good support on their website for that.  There are scripting abilities using the included Lua scripting language, but know that you ""do not"" need to use scripts at all to create full blown adventures with stories included, if you want to write them on walls! :-)  I used Lua to write messages on screen, instead of walls.  Say, sometimes you want to set the mood with some text as you enter a room…  You can easily place an invisible switch on the floor and link it to some scripted text.  I only needed scripting so my text would show up on the HUD.  If you want text on walls, it is much easier!  You basically set a text box on a wall and type what you want it to say.  It shows up on the wall as a golden unfamiliar text.  Kind of like the old ""Lord British's Ultima textstyle"".  Then you click on it to read it.You can easily insert short or long text onto walls to create a story if you want, or to leave cryptic messages for puzzles you can create.  I believe anything that is done in the game, can be done with this editor.  If you like to build maps and levels with a D&D type theme, do not hesitate to get this game.You'll be so proud of yourself and your creations.  You will play and tweak ""your"" own adventures for hours!  There are so many cool things you can do and setup!  You really are creating your own adventures and feel very good about them!  It's an incredible feeling of great accomplishment!!!  I never really scripted before this game…  You are limited to flat level designs, but can link levels together with stairs, pits and teleports.I could go into greater detail, but just know, the level editor is awesome and will burn up your spare time fast!  You set the lighting by adding torches and/or more modern lights.  You can create some super creepy settings and add different monsters or monster spawn points to them!  If you want to just build a simple arena with endless spawning monsters that you control by the flip of a switch, you can do that too!  You can add different items to each monster so they drop different items, weapons and armor!  You have a lot of control and options and it is so simple to use!  Then, you can play them in the full game and even share them online in the Steam Workshop!  How freaking cool is that!!!  I will eventually be posting mine to try, and it is really good if I might say so myself! :-)Here are my system specifications: Apple iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8, Journaled HFS+ Extended file system.

												A beautiful love-letter to the Dungeon Crawlers of the 1970's and 80's.Smart. Beautiful.Tough, but fair.The game is PACKED with secrets, secrets, secrets and you are constantly keeping an eye on your food meter since resting while starving does you no good. The game is well-balanced but does NOT hold your hand-- this is not for your little sister to play, even on normal difficulty.Walking on a grid system took some getting used to, but the game is well-paced enough that by the time it hits its stride you're a master at it. The game is going to give your the best experience during the FIRST playthrough only, though. As it is a puzzle game at heart-- the puzzles don't change. Going back through a second or third time would only be for the over-achievers that want to find all the secrets, hidden items, skulls (yes skulls), treasures and so on. I got 22/40 achievements just playing it through the first time. I only had to look up the solution to two puzzles in the entire 20hrs of gameplay, and felt halway clever the rest of the time. The game does a good job of coyly telling you what to look for, then letting you walk RIGHT past it soon after and NOT getting that cool sword that's hidden in the walls.Be patient, Be smart, Be methodical. Grimrock IS out to get you. Food is scarce and some enemies are a bit overpowered--- again, tough but fair. You'll have a blast wandering down its tunnels. I wholly recommend it. 9/10  "

You pass up dozens and dozens of secrets, unbeknownst to you until you finish the game and realize you didn't even get half of them. Each secret you discover, puzzle you finish, feels like it is ""yours"" because it takes significant effort to accomplish.It would be simple to download this game, open up a walkthrough, and breeze through it. Don't. Play it and stress over every detail, search every nook and cranny, draw your own maps and write down your own notes on a notepad in front of you. Treat the game seriously and as a test of your intellect. Go to bed asking yourself ""What could this mean?"" and wake up with a solution.If you're willing to let the game beat you up a little bit, this will give you some of the most enjoyable gaming experiences you can get.

												Very reminiscent of old school dungeon crawlers. Everything is grid based, though smooth animations make it far more pleasant that moving in some of the oldies like Bard's Tale.The dungeon's puzzles are increasingly difficult and at times so difficult that it makes the game very unpleasant (unless you use a walkthrough, but then it feels less rewarding). This is pretty much my only complaint about the game.The sum of it is don't watch your food too closely - explore the heck out of things. Some of the best items in the game are found in areas you would have not thought, which falls in well with the plot considering many of the items were likely weapons previous prisoners died with.All around a great RPG dungeon crawler with a sequel coming that I am eager to play. I do hope there is an exporting of previous characters though - without that its hard to see it carrying over well.			"

												Legend of Grimrock was a chance buy. I saw it on sale at one point and said ""this might be interesting"".  It really, really was.  I was so glad to have bought it!  The puzzles are challenging, the combat is interesting, and the secrets are addictive to uncover.  If you like puzzles and dungeon crawlers (and discovering treasure) this is definitely a game for you!			"

												Perfectly recaptures the feel of those classic first-person dungeon crawls, taking the standard turn-based combat formula and converting it into a realtime-with-cooldowns setup that works very well. Both the combat and puzzles offer just the right amount of challenge, rewarding you for being prepared and using your head, and the sound and visual design do a wonderful job giving off the ""alone in a dark, monster-ridden dungeon"" atmosphere.

It literally took me years, because the reloading was that frustrating.Play on easy mode, unless you've got the kb/mouse reflexes of an uber gamer, in which case I hear the game is ""easy"".  Ironically, the final boss was not too bad, but getting to him... that was a nightmare.Still, a worthy revival.			"

Combat is cool, and you can level your four characters up nicely. The ending was good, and overall i was pretty happy with this. I did feel like it was a bit difficult when i first played, but maybe that was just because i didnt really have enough interest at the time. There are some issues with the player being able to trap themselves in rooms. Specifically doors with levers next to them, you can flip the lever closing the door, but immediately move past the door and trap yourself, but you just have to not be stupid to avoid it.			"

												The Legend of Grimrock is an interesting action adventure game which involves engaging puzzles and difficult combat. The enclosed and dark environment easily engrosses the player giving a claustrophobic feel throughout the entire game. The graphics are fairly average for a game that is produced in 2012 but the content in the game is what is more important than the graphics. The controls are simple and easy to understand and is great for anyone to quickly get into. As for story there really isnt one save the beginning prologue. If you're a lover of puzzles and dungeon crawlers then this game is most definitely for you. This game truly only appeals to the most hardcore gamers so it is clear that it will not appeal to everyone.			"

												Arcane and unforgiving, this is an RPG in the truest sense of the term. You cannot help but be drawn into the world in which you are trying to survive, trawling through a dungeon facing off against various nasties on the way......but this is an RPG of old. Stats matter an awful lot; there isn't the fluidity or fancy UI of many other modern titles to distract you from the frantic calculations which you make during combat. Control of your whole party is mostly mouse-driven, and you are locked into grid-squares all the way along, giving this the feel of a late night D&D game being played in the company of too much pop and pizza. Brass-tacks at its very best.			"

												When I started Grimrock, I was expecting a simple dungeon crawler with good graphics. This game ended up being so much more than that. This game has incredible puzzles requiring speed, wit, cunning, and an attention to detail. The battles are a constant struggle between life and death, and require fancy footwork to survive. The pacing and discovery are superb. The story is told through items, scrolls, and dreams, and immerses you in the mystery of Grimrock.I never thought I'd be able to fall back in love with such an old-school concept as a 3D dungeon crawler, but Grimrock not only does everything right, but does it with so many surprises that you'll constantly enjoy your adventure into the unknown. 5 out of 5 foxes.

												Legend of Grimrock is my favorite indie release this year. Many compare it to Dungeon Master, but I find it equally reminiscent of old pen and paper RPGs, requiring equal parts wit and might to survive. As you traverse the dungeon, you’ll encounter floors with deadly traps, vicious enemies, numerous puzzles and secrets. The puzzles are satisfying and require truly clever solutions in many cases. Similarly, combat requires guile and agility, and you must constantly be on the move, exploit enemies’ weaknesses where ever possible and avoid being cornered at all costs. One of the game’s few negative aspects is the absolute lack of any instruction (even the tutorial fails to explain game mechanics in any detail) and would perhaps benefit from a “show, don’t tell” approach. All in all, Grimrock provides a great amount of content at a price that’s quite reasonable. I’ve already logged about 50 hours and still haven’t uncovered all the secrets.			"

												Well, as you can see from the playtime I've put a lot of hours into this game.  I was a huge huge fan of Dungeon Master, then Chaos Strikes Back, and of course the Eye of the Beholder series.  I even tried my hardest to like StoneKeep, but it was just a touch too formulaic to be considered an 'evolution'.. It was really just a repetition.   At the time, the Bards Tale games were also exploring the rectilinear 2.5D game approach, and I did quite like them, but they were vastly inferior at projecting an atmosphere (I felt).    So, I hope you get an idea of where my review is coming from: I'm a die-hard Dungeon Master fan, who really likes the genre, but is looking for DM with improvemetns.Legend of Grimrock is a superb game, there is no doubt about it.  ""Polised"" doesn't even come close to explaining just how wonderful the world is.  The rocks glisten, the toches flicker, and everything has the exact same 'feel' as Dungeon master, from the pressure-plates, and doors opening to the 'worms' (now snails) which offer up repulsive-sounding chunks of meat to keep your party alive.   The big question that you want to ask is ""Does it represent 25 years of advancement over Dungeon Master?"".  The answer is ""mostly"".  I'll explain in a bit more detail...The game is effectively the same as Dungeon Master: You start out at the 'top' of a dungeon. In DM, you were a party of resurrected adventurers controlled by a wizard (who you could see if you battled your way all the way back up the dungeon and used the 'see through walls' spell on the first door!).  In LoG, you're a party of four adventurers, imprisoned for unknown reasons in a big mountain.   The door closes, and this is where the first main difference arises: Choosing your party.In DM, you 'floated about' as a spirit essence, looking at paintings of dead adventurers, choosing who to resurrect, and who to 'take' but remould into your desires.  This was completely revolutionary.  LoG picks a very AD&D approach instead, and just allows you to stat-roll and custom-build your party.   DM allowed you a lot of freedom over your party. It was pretty much possible to get anywhere and do anything with any party (although a lone adventurer was too hard for me to ever complete the game with).  LoG is essentially the same, however there are some classes which are completely useless, and some races which appear to be awesome (minotaur).  I took a Rogue, but didn't look at the achievements list, so never got assassination, and therefore never got the one thing that the rogue is good for, the backstab Steam Achievement. Pah.OKay, so you pick your formulaic team (Fighters up front, mage(s) and rogue(s) up the back), and head into the dungeon.   The first level is a training level, as you'd expect. You're deposited naked, so you find some loincloths, daggers and rocks, and use them to bludgeon the locals, as you'd expect...  There are a few traps, and puzzles, but by and large, it's your standard training level.  HOWEVER, the game's true nature comes to the fore at this point...The training level can kill you.  And is does. Over and over.  You see, there's a trick to playing LoG, which you have to learn RIGHT at the beginning, or you're going to die. and die. and die.  You must never try to go toe-to-toe with an enemy. You will die.   The monsters are always scaled to be a difficult challenge.  To fight you must find at LEAST a 2x2 grid, and strafe, rotate, hit, strafe, rotate, hit, strafe, rotate, hit... and so on.. and so on.. until one of you is dead.    Woe betide you if there are two enemies: This is a retilinear circus of death.. you'll get trapped, and die.  For two enemies, you need a 3x3 grid, making sure never to step into a corner cell if you can help it!  And so, you quickly learn the mathematics of LoG.  Quick count: 3 enemies, right I'll need a 4x4 space to dodge around them in, at least.If you're REALLY lucky, you'll come across them in a snake-like corridor, and can use their abysmal path finding against them.  Monsters will often sidestep with you, so you can pop-left, shoot, pop-right, and the monster will take the arrow or fireball in the face, then step right again, and now there's some rock between you.. You wait to cooldown, and rinse repeat.I'll say this again: Never ever ever try to go toe-to-toe with an enemy.  Sometimes you can't help it. In this case, you're probably boned, but try and slash your way out of it as best you can:  There are some 'secrets' which FORCE you to be in the middle of a swarm of things (Fighter's Challenge), and in this case, you're boned.  Over and over.. until you get lucky and reload enough times that a space randomly appears in front of you, or whatever, and you're able to retreat out of the swarm... Something like that..Supplies are in short supply:  Lack of food is the main impetus to keep moving.  There were many times that my party were getting low, because I'd been searching for secrets, and I just had to plough on into the next level, to get some food.    At first I found it annoying: Cosntantly running low: There are penalties for being hungry!  But then I realised it was to stop people stagnating on earlier levels.   I remember in DM having my entire party encumbered with Worm Rounds because we'd camped near a spawn point, and I ended up dagging them up and down, and up and down, three or four levels down from the spawn point, so I could have a stash.   Similar things happen in LoG. There's a famous 'snail room', but you only get two snails, which is barely enough to keep two party members alive.  However, they do replenish every time you step a certain distance from the room...As you get deeper and deeper, the enemies stay just as hard.  Okay, I KNOW they're getting harder, but I'm getting better at the same pace.  So, while a snail on level one needs ten dagger-hits, a cthulu-faced magic-wielding lightning-thrower-evil-demon on Level 12 still takes ten lightning-sword hits.   So, the 'experience' changes a little with the variety of ranged vs. melee monsters, but the game stays uniformly difficult.  In DM, there definitely felt to be an advancement in ability, and monsters became easier.. So in DM, that demon would take three lightning-sword hits, if you see what I mean?Descending through LoG, the 'tunnels' feel slightly different. You start off in fairly rustic 'sewers'?, and then descent into perfectly rectilinear dressed-stone corridors.  They stay this way until the very last level, which goes very industrial, and it becomes clear what the game's emblem is all about.There's a LOT of side-activity here.  You can plough through without finding many secrets, but the majority of the good stuff is behind tiny buttons, and so on, so it really pays to explore.   However, there's always that looming hunger, so you can't spend too long.  There's about enough surplus food int he dungeon (without snail-mining), to get you back to Level 1 from Level 12 two or three times, if you forgot something, before you really start to run dangerously low.I'd say my main gripe about this game is the w ay that the skill 'trees' (or just skill List) works.  In DM, you started off beign able to do ""14"", (fire), and then learned ""144"" (fireball)... But once you leveled up, you could try for ""244"", bigger fireball... sometimes it'd work, sometimes it wouldn't.   LoG has nothing like this.     My second main gripe is that magic needs SO MANY DAMNED CLICKS to work.   five perfectly-placed clicks on smal squares, while you're trying to strafe,turn,hit,strafe.... is a REAL pain the a$$!!!!   All in all, I'd say this was a really excellent attempt to remake Dungeon Master.   They've missed some of the fun in a few areas, and instead concentrated on graphical beauty.  Doesn't stop me from recommending this though. It's a great game, so long as you learn the one cardinal rule: Do not go toe-to-toe with an enemy if you can help it! "

												Not bad, not bad. Almoust like Wizardry but more linery game. I don't know what to think. On beginning you learn how to attack. Die a lot, look for secrets, kill mobs when you learn how. Nice graphic, cool music and good rpg. I can like it.			"

												Love this game, real retro feel taking me back to my mispent uni days playing ""Eye of the Beholder"" and ""Dungeon Master"". Only gripe given the low video specs, I still have to set my settings to low even on a GT620 in order to be able to do some of the timed puzzles else there is enough of a lag delay to make them impossible.Nice to go back to puzzle games though, with an interesting mix of trivial ones to lead you into a false sense of security before hitting you with some real brainteasers.

												Solid old-school RPG with a heavy focus on puzzles. I played through the game on normal.The good:- Tons of puzzles, this is certainly the main meat of the game- Lots of hidden secrets- Normal difficulty was a good challengeThe bad:- Poorly designed RPG mechanics- Combat is clunky and heavily based on kiting your enemies around. Not a big fan of this kind of gameplayThe ugly:- The environments get quite repetitive after a while- Some puzzles could have used extra hints, a few times I had to resort to trial and error or online guides			"

												A one of a kind title that combines o-g designs with modern grx. This is a game that I'd spend real money on if they came out with a campaign pack or two, cus it's quality. Don't have any time these days to waste on me-too crap.  Curb that caffeine habit and get this for $6!COD, MOH, BF3, n all the other year-on-year derivatives, I don't care how many copies you sell, you still a limp mutha♥♥♥♥a!			"

												Eye of the Beholder given a graphical overhaul for the new generation. Legends of Grimrock is a great dungeon crawl with engaging puzzles, challenging combat and plenty of secret doors to hunt down. Your rag-tag group of 4 criminals have been chained together and thrown into a dungeon atop a mountain, absolving them of their crimes - now all they have to do is be the first prisoners ever to reach to lowest depths of the place and escape the dungeon alive. Old-school gaming with all of the signs of age cleaned off. Heartily recommended.Also, don't forget to use the ""rest"" button occasionally to take a nap. It's a great way to pass time and restore some health, and some of the plot might come as a bit of a shock if you don't...			"

												Dungeon Master on the Amiga was one of the classic games I loved and so Legend of Grimrock was like embracing an old friend. If you're in the same <cough> 40+ <cough> camp and are looking for an up-to-date Dungeon Master-like RPG this is an unapologetic copy and plays beautifully. My 27.5hrs is a single and (relatively) thorough play through, so it should keep you busy. If anything it's a little easy in terms of puzzles and level structure, could have had more polish in some areas of the story and presentation, but the end is suitably clever and you'll come away feeling rewarded. Certainly stands up to being played again too. I'm writing this as I see a sequel is on the way, so grab this on discount in preparation!			"
