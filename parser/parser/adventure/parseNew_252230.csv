												You start fighting the main boss right at the beginning of the game and you fight him the whole game.  The main boss is the camera which is garbage your view is constantly awkward and off.  The last time I was beaten this bad by a camera I was drunk in a back alley in New Orleans refusing to give up my wallet and Nikon.			"

												I want to clear something up before I move on here.  This game is NOT a traditional Ninja Gaiden game, if you couldn't already tell.  I feel as though some people were looking for a Ninja Gaiden 4, a true sequel to Gaiden 2 (because 3 was definitely a different, less satisfying beast).  So Yaiba.  This game is the extreme opposite of a true Ninja Gaiden game in many ways.  However, it is also like those games in many ways as well.  Let me explain.I've played Ninja Gaiden 1-3, beginning from the original xbox.  I was never great at them, constantly getting punished just like every other regular joe, but I beat all three.  I've read from others that this isn't a true Ninja Gaiden, that it's easier, that it's more or less terrible.  Sure, if you were amazing at the first two, maybe this one wasn't that next level of challenge you were looking for.But let me tell you this.  If you are used to the blocking/counter system of games such as mad max and batman, this game will toss you around like a baby back ♥♥♥♥♥.  There is little to no leeway in your counter timing, and on top of that the moments when you can block/counter are random and unpredictable.  Even the enemies that are predictable are so quick to react it's hard to gauge when to counter.  Even on the first level I had a few moments where i found myself getting killed simply because I couldn't react to my opponent's attacks quick enough.  Very Ninja Gaiden to me.Moving on, in terms of the series itself, this is not a progression of the Ryu Hayabusa story, at least as far as I can tell.  Quite the opposite.  You play as the antagonist (the bad dude) to Ryu in this game.  You play as the man who wants to KILL Ryu, and will do what he has to in order to find and defeat him.  So no, in that way this is not a typical Ninja Gaiden.  This dude is foul mouthed, generally uncaring, sarcastic, and everything that Ryu is not.  A large depature from the original series.The graphics and artwork in this game certainly depict this departure.  Instead of a crisp, realistic graphical style, we are given a more vibrant, comic book graphical style.  I personally love how this looks and it fits wonderfully with the overall theme of this game.  Plus it  just looks bad♥♥♥♥♥  This doesn't detract from the gore and dismemberment the series is known for, however.  If anything, the game is more gory and vicious than the games before it, and it is super satisfying to watch.This game is, at its core, a big hack n' slash game.  Is that a bad thing?  Well, yes and no.  In the original games, you were faced with a fair amount of enemies, but they were pretty skillful.  If you didn't play just right, you would be dead in a matter of seconds.  In this game, the amount of general enemies is basically tenfold.  You will be fighting mass hordes of zombies, and you WILL be cutting up said zombies in hordes as well.  That being said, you will still get torn up.  Why?  There may be 20 or more enemies on screen.  Although you may be cutting some up, it is almost guaranteed that there will be others that will come at you from all angles, hitting you with stupid little attacks.  Some you may be able to counter, but the counter symbols come so quick and randomly that its more than likely the average joe will not be able to stop them before they are hit.This is where the difficulty comes in.  You miss a counter, get hit, turn to focus on that enemy, only to have this happen from another random angle at a random time, within a split second.  Let this happen a few times, and you're done.  Dying in this game does not come from the fact that you are fighting gigantic random hordes, but from the fact that in these masses you will be hit randomly by one or two enemies enough times to where you will die.  In this way it is no different than the original games.  The only difference being that those deadly blows now hide in a massive crowd.At its core, this is still a Ninja Gaiden game.  If you've never played a Ninja Gaiden game before, I will tell you now, this is not how the original games were, and you will be sorely disappointed if you go to the others after having played this.  The gameplay is still the same, allbeit in a much more ""dense"" form, but the rest is very much a different story.  As an impartial gamer I would take this game as a very over the top, comic, gory, sarcastic hack n' slash romp with a rather tough/tight countering system.  As a Ninja Gaiden fan, I take this as being a very interesting view at the other side of the Ninja Gaiden world, with all of the jokes, changes, sarcasm, gameplay tweaks, and graphical changes that come with it.  This isn't a ""bad"" game.  It's fun, it's crazy, it's brutal, it's cool.  But if you're looking for an advancement in the original Ninja Gaiden series, this isn't it.  This is more of a rebel yell from the developers than anything else.  Enjoy!    "

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively. Gameplay: I really don't get the hate surrounding this game. Yeah, sure, it's not the same quality of game as the Itagaki-produced games, but it's still a load of fun. The gameplay is best described (in my opinion) as a cross between Devil May Cry and Rise of the Triad (actually, that's fair to say in more respects than just the gameplay). Rather than going with light attack/heavy attack/grab, the game has three different types of attack: shortsword for fast face fu- I mean wrecking; fists for punching things dead hard; and flails, which are essentially the Blades of Olympus. Along with that are some special weapons that you get from executing stronger enemies. These lead into the Element system of the game, which is really vital to grasp so that you don't launch your controller, chair, monitor, PC, and desk out the window. However, even more essential is learning how to counter.      Admittedly, countering is somewhat finicky, but I found it to be a godsend against the later bosses of the game. My biggest complaints, honestly, are the finicky countering and the camera, which can be a huge pain at times.  However, those didn't really ruin my day all that much. After beating the game, you unlock Ninja Gaiden Z mode, which is essentially a ""Yaiba-lite"" version that plays more like a beat-em-up game like Streets of Rage than an actual classic Ninja Gaiden game. This was disappointing, admittedly, but it's still a good bit of fun. Also, no, I haven't beaten it. I'm not good enough to do about an hours worth of gameplay on one continue. But hey, this review isn't about my gaming abilities; it's about the game, and this game is simply fun. While it's not as engaging as Ninja Gaiden Black, I still think this game is a load of fun and will definitely play through it again on higher difficulties in the future. 8/10.Story: The Ninja Gaiden series has never been well known for being the most well-written, and I think it's about time that they embrace their incredibly camp nature. Spark Entertainment felt the same way, too. The writing most definitely got plenty of laughs out of the 12 year old inside me. The Engrish in the Arcade mode was pretty great, too, even if it is a bit of an easy joke. Unlike gameplay, there really isn't much here to talk about. If you've got an immature sense of humor, you'll probably enjoy the cutscenes and dialogue. Just don't go into it expecting Shakespeare. 7/10.Graphics: Definitely the most striking aspect of this game. It's got that ultra-cel shaded style in the ilk of games like Madworld, Killer7, and No More Heroes, and it looks pretty dang good when you crank the settings to max. It ran near-perfectly on my GTX 760 at 1080p, max settings, and 60FPS, so if you've got a similar card, you should have pretty similar results. As for the actual art design of the game itself, some of the areas get a bit boring to look at again and again, but if you're spending that much time looking at the scenery, you're not playing the game right. Now, don't think I made those comparisons earlier in this section without intent. This game, much like the prior three mentioned, is pretty dang violent. Absurdly so. However, this helps feed into the campy nature of this game, so I don't mind it at all. Again, this is more proof that art style trumps ultra-high polygon counts most any day of the week. Your eyes will most definitely not get bored, presuming you're actually playing the game. 5/5.Audio: This game has a pretty rad soundtrack, I must say.  The ""hard encounter"" theme is a bit meh, but there is some pretty good battle music throughout this game. They're songs you probably wouldn't mind working out to, if that helps give you an idea of the kinds of songs in the game. As for the voice acting, it doesn't get in the way. Nothing really that remarkable. Sound design, once again, doesn't really get in the way or make itself known all that much. For some pretty good songs, but not too remarkable anything else, the audio portion of this game gets a 3/5.Overall: An absolutely gaudy adventure both in style and in substance that I overall had a pretty good time with. However, I'd hold off until this game becomes about $30 or so. Any higher is a bit too much in my opinion. 8/7/5/3; 7.7/10.			"

												This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, but you know what sucks more? The fact this will probably sell like♥♥♥♥♥♥and we'll never get a good Ninja Gaiden game on Steam.EDIT: I love you guys, too. Let's just say this, if you're looking for a bad God of War game, you've found it. Right down to the traversal QTEs. This game is shallow as ♥♥♥♥ in terms of combat. You've got nothing close to ""depth"" beyond using different elements to hard different types of zombies. You've seen everything the game has to offer within two hours max. The bosses are worse than DmC's. The counter is OP and makes the game way easier. The only two things the game has going for it are the art style and humor. The majority of the humor was already shown in the trailers. So yeah, if you wanna waste $60 or get your friend a joke gift, then this is the game you want.			"

												Man, this game is just so bad, but there's no denying it's extremely fun. It's a decent hack and slash with a great comic feel, and it's just awesome to pull off combo after combo on huge waves of zombies, but the story and everything is plain dreadful. It's dumb, crazy, got a stupid plot and all, but it does ensue for heaps of fun and mayhem if you pick this game up really cheap. It's not for you if you're looking for a proper Ninja Gaiden game, but it's certainly for you if you're in to the hack and slash genre, like badass cyborg ninjas, zombies, explosions, blood, gore and choppas! It is such a dumb game, but it's action packed and full of humor and you will get to pick up missiles in mid air and throw them at helicopters. The camera is bad, story is bad, dialogue is bad, characters are bad, AI is dumb, but the gameplay is regretfully fun. Once you complete this game, it will get you thinking what the hell you're doing with your life. 5/10			"

												I had read reviews before even considering buying Yaiba so I should know better right?But with ""Ninja Gaiden"" in its title I still hoped for some decent amount of quality. You could have fooled me.Repetitive gameplay, repetitive combos, embarrasing ""jokes"" and really frustrating stupid camera. This is not worthy 30€ not at all, no way sir. But the cel-shaded stylization makes Yaiba eye-candy.			"

												First off don't go into this expecting a Ninja Gaiden game.From what I've played it's combat reminds me of the Dynasty Warriors/Musou genre. While graphically it's colorful and nice. The gameplay won't appeal to those looking for depth in their combat systems.If you just want a simple hack n' slash game where you slaughter hordes of zombies you may like this game.The platforming segments aren't all that hard but were really unneeded.

												If you can accept the new direction of ninja gaiden, there is a really fun hack n slash with a great b-movie vibe with a colorful new look and feel to a hack n slash.The story is about a foul mouthed ninja named Yaiba kamikaze who gets killed by series protagonist,Ryu Hayabusa. several weeks later, Yaiba is rebuilt by a corporation so that he can ""stop"" the zombie outbreak(yes you fight zombies, but I'll get to that later) and Get his Revenge on Ryu Hayabusa. The story is pretty basic and predictable, it ends up being really abrupt near the end.The writing is something you ethier are gonna love or hate, personally I see the majority of the dialogue to be so bad it's good, and the humor comes from how vulgur the characters are with lines like ""He's got some hot woman helping him. I'm sooo jealous. Maybe I'll kill her when I see her. Or maybe we can make out. Maybe we'll have a threesome! I'll do whatever Yaiba tells me to do. I'm so horny..."". There are some geniunely funny moments like the introductions of the zombies, which is just slap stick humor at best. The gameplay of yaiba isn't ninja gaiden, it's more like Devil may cry,rygar, or Lords of shadows. The actual combat consists of 3 weapons which are a flail(basically a chain),Cyborg arm, and your ninja sword. It takes some time for the combat to become really entertaining, when you know how the system works. You can also do executions which will you give you more health(especially usefull when upgrading to do up to 10 executions) and a counter system which when you pull it off is incredibly satisfying though it isn't that well implented as lords of shadows. You can also pick up weapons from enemies by executing them(or a mashing qte) ranging from numbchucks to electro whips to a rocket launcher, which make the combat more interesting because each enemy has their own weakness to certain elements . there is also platforming, which is on rails and quite fun for the most part.  Now the one thing that most reviewers criticize the game is the difficulty, which the game really isn't that hard if you get all the collectibles. Which there are 2 types, the first one being health shards(which combing 4 of them will increase your health),story parts and elemental resistent shards(which makes the game a hell of a lot easier to get through). I HIGHLY Reccomend you get all of them since they will make the game a lot more easier than the reviews are saying are saying it is.Here is a video of where you can find them.

 Now there are 2 flaws with this game, the first is that the game is rather short it took me around 6 hours to finish the main campaign and honestly it could have included a few more levels to make it around 8-10 hours long which would have been the perfect length for this game. The next one is the camera, which is fixed and you can't control it, however it is a improvement over the console version, which apparently is worse.Overall the gameplay is fast paced,franic, and just good mindless fun. The visuals are pretty solid, they are done in a cel shaded look which gives the game a comic book look to it, and I ike the designs of the zombies(and yaiba As well), since all of them are Unique, and all look drastically different. Animations are very fluent and fun to look at. The PC version also runs at 60 fps, which helps with your reaction time in the game.Sound is pretty good, the soundtrack fits the mood of the game and has some killer tracks in there . sound effects are great especially the attack sounds when you hear the crunching sounds of zombies being ripped to shreads. Voice acting is alright, nothing really stand out and half the time I barely noticed it, but what is there is just fine.In short, Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z is an enjoyable hack n slash, with a nice look and feel that you don't get from the typical hack n slash. I would reccomend the game when it's on sale, since asking for full price is too much for what is there. 8/10 Good brainless B-movie fun.			"

												I finished this game today and for being a game where you don't play as Ryu Hayabusa...this game is extremely fun to play.  Sure this game has flaws like being extremely easy as heck then getting harder as you progress through just like any other Ninja Gaiden game but for me it was hard to put down no matter how many times I died. So if you like slicing up many enemies and solving many puzzles..then this is the game for you.			"

												This is a really fun hack and slash game. You can play as a rogue cyber-ninja, and slaughter zombies as brutal as possible. The game and the characters have a good sense of humor, unlike any other Ninja Gaiden games in the series. Get Bloodlusty, hack and slash thousands of zombies, brutally execute them, and also, beware of the Clown, Drunk Punk, and Soviet Zombies! Whoever thinks the game is bad, and also, Metascore, for giving this game a 49, SHAME ON YOU ALL! Also, the only Ninja Gaiden game so far on PC. Its great! If you have a lust for blood, likes hack and slash, and likes zombie killing and ninjas, this game is just the right one for you. Also a great timekiller.			"

												This is a game that fits it's purpose and then some. The somewhat quirky plot just adds to the appeal of the insane- over the top hack and slash gameplay. One aspect of this game that might turn off die hard Ninja Gaiden fans is that you dont play as Ryu Hayabusa- you play as Yaiba Kamikaze a rouge ninja from Ryu's clan who refused to return an ancient blade to Ryu. In turn, Yaiba die's and is now a cyborg in the zombie apocolyptic future and begins a new journey to get revenge on Ryu Hayabusa. This game is insane amount's of fun, but there are some part's that will test your patience, like running into an overpowered enemy, or one that has too much health, or you can't find a hidden health upgrade- So I believe that this game still has the good old hair tearing difficulty in some sections. The comic book-like art style work's perfectly and only work's to compliment the gameplay seen here (It almost excuses this games horrible camera). You also can get really interesting power-ups that makes an exciting expirence just THAT much more interesting! The gameplay is the absolute best part too- There is no feeling like the feeling you get from mowing down hordes of enemies in your psychotic rampage. A psychotic rampage unlike any other- that THIS game provides! I thoroughly enjoy this game and strongly reccomend buying it if you have not already. Yaiba Ninja Gaiden Z get's a 9/10!			"

												Good game with a good sense of humor about it self. Camera angle can be a little annoying since you have no control over it at all and that can be problematic if you say... have to block anything. Other than that I really enjoyed it. Great art style and unadulterated gore held together by some adult themed humor. I'd give it a 5 out of 5 if it weren't for the fact that the final boss refuses to show up. I've watched videos on youtube of the final boss battle and well... on my copy he's no where to be found. I just stand around and watch some dino-bot looking pterodactyls fly around what looks like a nebula. So 4 out of 5. Perfect score if someone could help me figure that♥♥♥♥♥♥out. i do recomend playing it, just hopefully you'll have better luck than i did. O.O;			"

Developer: Spark Unlimited, comcept Inc., Team NINJA Publisher: KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.Release Date: March 21st, 2014Zombies are cool and all but so 2k14.Seriously they are. At least in this game since it’s been released in 2k14. No need to applaud I know that I’m a funny guy. But feel free to applaud anyway.All joking aside there are Zombies in it. Hence the Z after the GAIDEN which comes after the NINJA.And if you look close you’ll see YAIBA. Yes it’s in all caps because reasons!To make it short: This is not a traditional Ninja Gaiden game and to be perfectly honest I couldn’t care less about that fact despite loving the Ninja Gaiden franchise.StorySo you’re not playing as Ryu Hayabusa in this game. To be precise: You, Yaiba Kamikaze (lovely name ain’t it?), challenge him since he’s the weakest foe you’ve seen so far. After some fighting Ryu shows you that you’re no challenge for him and slices your left arm and eyes; killing you in the process. What a bummer.Who would’ve seen that coming? That’s it folks. It’s a wrap. That’s exactly why the game has gotten such negative reviews.BUT WAIT THERE’S MORE!Magically you come back to life! Well not magically. Because of SCIENCE!That’s right you’re back in action, restored with some new and fancy, mechanized body parts and prepared to find and kill Hayabusa once and for all!All thanks to the fine people over at Forge Industries who’ve found Yaiba’s corpse and thought it might be a glorious idea to bring him back from the dead.Yaiba then learns that a zombie outbreak has begun (hence the Z after Gaiden … duh) and that good guy Ryu has been searching for the source of the infection.Being the smart♥♥♥♥♥that Yaiba is he agrees to work with Forge Industries to help put a stop to the zombie outbreak. Oh and because he wants to slaughter Hayabusa.That’s the story in a nutshell and to be honest I had a blast playing it.GameplayIt’s not your traditional Ninja Gaiden. You should be fully aware of that by now.You’ve also got quite a nice looking, as I find, navigator at your side in the form of a red-head called Ms. Monday. You can decide for yourself whether or not the game’s sexist or whatever as soon as you see her but hey … it’s a free world and a woman can wear whatever she wants!


IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE I SWEAR!

Sexist? You decide. Anyway back on track.It’s “fairly difficult”. I’ve put that in “ “ because it’s not that difficult to be honest. I’ve been playing it on the hardest difficulty at first and it’s basically the easy mode. Considering that there’s a Nightmare and Hell difficulty after you’ve beaten the game once. It just takes some time to adjust and to find combos you like and that’s it.Basically it’s one big ol’ hack ‘n slash game. Think of the DmC: Devil May Cry. Just without all the seriousness to it and full of zombies and full of dumb and childish humour, which I adore so much and sexual innuendos.And let me tell you right away that this ain’t a bad thing! It’s quite refreshing to be honest.For me the whole gameplay, as repetitive as it might be for some, the setting, the characters, the humour and just everything was a very welcomed breath of fresh air in the franchise.Also I’m quite fond of Yaiba. He’s a cool dude. An ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but a cool one.On your quest to find and kill Hayabusa you’re hacking, punching, kicking, throwing, cussing, laughing and slashing your way through a wide variety of zombies.

You’ll be ripping of the arms of undead clowns, drunks or you’ll even find yourself ripping out the spinal cord of a bride which comes with a nice bonus: ELECTRICITY! More on that later.The game features quite a bit of, incredibly easy, platforming. There are every few instances where you actually have to pay attention and get the timing right.Back to the fighting.In order to make your way through the zombie hordes you’ll have access to three weapons.Your trusty katana, your new and shiny mecha arm which you can use to (rocket) punsh stuff or extend your hand and use it as a flail.Your best bet is to mix up your attacks to create combos in order to either increase the damage you’re dealing or to get the situation under control.You’ll gain experience points, if you manage to stay alive, which you can use to upgrade Yaiba.He’ll gain quite a few nice abilities that way such as the rocket punch or even resistancies.That’s right. Earlier I talked about electricity. Basically there are three elements in this game which you can actually mix to create new and awesome effects.Those three are: Electricity, Fire and Bile. By mixing up electricity and bile for example you’ll trap enemies in some kind of crystal which you can then destroy with your mecha arm for a nice amount of damage.Your best bet is to just try out different combinations but fear not! The game’s telling you anyway what and how to mix.Getting struck by electricity will overload your arm and render it useless for the duration. Fire will … set you on fire (seriously what else have you expected?) and you’ll lose health as long as you’re on fire. Bile will steal part of your vision.There are two ways to get more resilient against the elemental attacks. By using your skill points or by finding the hidden collectibles in the game. Let’s talk about those real quick.Five kinds of collectibles are waiting to be found. Health pieces, story pieces and the three elemental shards. If you find all shards you gain 40% resistance against the element.And health gives you more health … duh. The story pieces are actually quite fun since you’ll learn more about Yaiba and the whole situation from Yaiba’s point of view. The stuff he has written about Hayabusa is just awesome.There’s one way to get some health back. If you’re low on health you’ll have to execute enemies in order to get some back. Besides that you can also gain access to zombie and elemental weapons if you execute the special zombies in the game.Last but not least is the Kamikaze Special! It’s useful in battle (and also in bed) and it’s called Bloodlust! Once you activate it you’re temporarily invincible and deal more damage. So think twice before you’re activating it.AudioIt fits. There’s not too much to say besides the game does sound “alive”. At least for me it did. There are, of course, some parts in the game which sound a bit dull or stale but that’s a given in any game. What I did enjoy a lot though was the laughing, screetching, moaning, groaning, puking and vomiting of the zombies. Not only did it give the game a rather grotesque if not even disgusting charm but it was also just fun to listen to.VisualsCel shading baby! I do love me some cel shading! While I’m a sucker for pixel art I do have to admit that I truly enjoy cel shading. The game looks good, fun and vibrant. There’s actually a fair amount of detail in it. The different type of zombies all look unique, which you might oversee considering that you face thousands of them.

A Screenshot of YAIBA: NINJA GAIDEN Z
By: Caomhainn




I’ve found myself looking forward to every cut scene. Because nearly every single one was either dumb or obscene in a way. I did enjoy the interactions between the zombies the most in it to be honest.What else can I say?I enjoyed the game a lot. It actually saddens me to see all those negative reviews, knowing that we might quite possibly never see a game like this in the franchise. I adore the difficulty, enjoyed the gameplay and the characters. Overall it’s a solid game.			"

												dont mind the negative review.at first, i thougth this is just another zombie game.turn out i was wrong.if looking for some crazy hack and slash time, this game fill the gap left by DMC.while dmc took serious turn, yaiba take not so serious approuch.your not playing as protagonist, but as the antagonist of the ninja gaiden series. the game language is harsh and sexist.think of mixing devil may cry, god of war and the foul mouth of deadpool on steroid.so just enjoy hack and slash as it is. 3 tipe of attack, multiple combo, fun and not so confusing game mechanic.some perks to upgrade using xp system.fatality type execution (different for each enemy, and can be chained for multiple enemies).some enemies have elemental values that can have many serious effect if collide with different types.there are some puzzles but not too boring as many action hack and slash game.some say the counter system is flawed, because it is very fast and hard to hit.but in this game, you are not suppose to counter every thing as in batman series or other game that use counter system.the goal is to kill as many enemies as fast as possible before you get swarmed. some perk help to achieve this. and some elemental and environment mechanic also help alot.while almost every attack can be countered, use counter as necessary. example, when some missile or some bomb throw at you is the best time to counter, because some perk activated when countering succed.some complaint about the camera, but i think the fix wide angle is the best to play this kind of game.even better than batman series and dead pool,where enemies often came from behind camera. and instant killed you in higher difficulties.certainly this game is not for everybody.so just dont think alot when playing this game. this game test your reflect, your nerve and sanity.the game is brutal and very fast pace. so dying might come instanteously you  will have many ""aaarrgghhh"" moments and die so many times, but the fun keep still attract to play this game.if you cannot handle the pace, go find some slower pace action game.seriously....you have been warned			"

												Classic hack-and-slash action in  a cel-shaded/comic-book style. Definitely not a traight-up Ninja Gaiden game, but a superb spin-off, especially when you stop and take the time to look at all the humour (breakdancing zombies, ripping off clown arms and weaponizing them as ""nun-chuckles"", and so much more).360 Joypad compatible, and features both a side-scroller version of the game, tons of laughs, and most of all, the ability to play through the game (after completion) dressed as a schoolgirl.

												I've alwyas been a huge fan of the Ninja Gaiden series and this one is a bit of a disappointment among the others. I dig the cyber ninja thing and the 2.5 D visual style but not the zombies. Plot is not amusing and the cliched jokes aren't funny at all. The combat system is actually pretty decent but its relatively standard gameplay does little to set it apart from its competitors. Most of the puzzles involves chucking a zombie at something to solve them. The game doesn't offer much. Levels are very less(7 only) but has long fights. Long load screens and what's worse of it all is the camera. It pisses me of so much when I can't see my charatcer because it doesn't center on Yaiba and it pans and zooms in and out every time. The AI however is smart and enemies work together to kill you. Not much variety of skills (some of them include upgrading the previous skill) The last boss fight was a huge letdown. The only good thing about this game is having Ryu Hayabusa.Overall, it's boring, repetitive and very sloppy.			"

												I'm a fan of both Ninja Gaiden and Dead Rising, so I had to pre order this when I heard Inafune was making a NG game (also to test out my gaming PC, mostly play strategy and other less resource intensive games on PC).Overall Yaiba is an average fun game. The gameplay has a rock/paper/sissors puzzle aspect in using different types of attacks and types of zombies to counter different types of enemies, and you can harvest special weapons from mini boss type zombies. It has an experience based upgrading system similar to NG3:Razor's Edge, and I love humor, the kind I expect from a Keiji Inafune zombie game. The story is a 180 reversal on Ninja Gaiden, with Ryu Hayabusa, the hero of the series being the main enemy. Instead you're Yaiba Kamikaze, who is the ultimate zombie apocalyse Psychopath Frank West, Chunk Greene and Nick Ramos would NEVER want to encounter, even if it was 3 of them armed to the teeth with combo weapons & vehicles against Yaiba.But it is still not the Ninja Gaiden/Dead Rising style mash up I hyped myself up for. Compared to Ninja Gaiden it doesn't have the smooth and satisfying ninja feel, instead feeling rather clunky controlling Yaiba; nor does it feel as fun killing Zombies as it does in Dead Rising games, fighting the same types of zombies over and over gets old without over the top psychopath-like enemies to freshen it up in between. The game length is short and starts feeling rushed halfway through. I'd still recommend it to any fan of Ninja Gaiden or Dead Rising, just don't expect Ninja Gaiden or Dead Rising quality, but rather a very very very very very rushed underbudgeted version of those games. It's almost like a Case Zero version of Ninja Gaiden; good enough to be a small DLC game, but not good enough to be a main game. I hope they make a sequel, because this feels like a huge missed opportunity mashing ninjas and zombies together. I expect way more over the top action and gorey zombie parts flying everywhere constantly when Ryu Hayabusa and Yaiba Kamikaze fight their epic ninja battles with zombies caught in the crossfire.

												Since it's been awhile that I've done a written review, I plan to pull out my biggest gavel on this one. First off, after trying it out for about two hours and clearing two stages (for a future LP), it puts me in the mind of the Koei Warriors series since it literally plays in that style.  Another thing that I have to say is, why so much hate toward this game to begin with? You don't like it because it doesn't meet YOUR expectations? Let others enjoy it for what its worth but don't let a ""professional"" review tell you otherwise. Seeing that Inafune's company played a part in this made me just play this game even more.  (Course that's a personal reason for me but moving on...) The fact that it feels like an uber-gory graphic novel piqued my interest when I started up the game and I couldn't put it down since.  My advice is that you'd have to think out the box on this game, this game is crazy good and if you enjoy a mind-numbing hack and slash with very little story and lots of action, then go for it and buy it for yourself and I highly recommend getting it for a friend if you so choose.  I feel a game like this gets a lot of unneeded flak just because it doesn't meet a certain level of expectation so on that note, it counts as an underrated game. Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z is approved in my book and should be worth trying in yours.			"

												Nice game, just change the camera to ""Wide"" in the ""Game Options Menu"" also check your ""Codex"" frequently, given that the game does not explain many things, and will explain others in... Not... Such a good way. For example grappling your opponents it's far more effectively if you make sure to HOLD the left trigger, instead of just ""pressing it"" as the game states.Other than that i frankly think a lot of the complaints about this game coming from the gaming media weren't more than just the ""outcries"" of some people complaining about the game being sexist, or something stupid of the sort, it's just a freaking game, reduce it to what it is, the main aspect about this game, it's that the story it's not that good, but it's bearable, and the game can be pretty freaking decent in some parts of it's gameplay.

												Not a bad game but has its issues.The good:This is a hack-n-slash game with a combo and counter system, it's fun in the way that you fight a small group of enemies and have some options for killing them. Between areas the story is filled in by brief dialog with other characters over a communications system; it reminds me of early video games back before unnecessary cut scenes were put into games. The story isn't terribly deep but I didn't mind, it's cheap fun. I played through on easy difficulty because I'm trying to cut through my backlog, it was easy but I actually enjoyed it. I guess it took me around 7 hours to complete, but I'm not really sure I completed it...The bad:It can be buggy. I'm pretty sure I beat the final boss, but it would crash probably before the final cut scene or whatever was supposed to be shown. I had modified the config to allow higher frame rates and disable intro videos, but I allowed that to be reverted, I checked game cache, and rebooted and the issue persisted. Other than that, if you do run it over 60FPS, there may be some areas you'll get stuck but the game saves so often that you should be able to exit, revert the changes you made to the INI file and continue. In the tutorial (beginning), it stopped letting me block/counter, not sure if that was a side effect of the frame rate mod, but others in the forums have experienced similar issues; fortunately it was early in so I just restarted the game.If you want it, buy it cheap (less than $10). I didn't have too many issues with it, guess I'll go watch the ending on YouTube.			"

												It CRASHES in 4K when going to upgrade menu, the only FIX was play in 2560x1440,and use NVIDIA INSPECTOR to tweak settings so that it still looks sharp.I decided to keep the game anyway. For that low a price in a saleAnyway now that i did not have the rush of 2 HOUR mark, i decided to look into it further.1. Create NVIDIA INSPECTOR Profile for the NRZgame.exe and NRZLauncher.exe2. Set the following options.* 0x004412c1 (Diablo III) for antialiasing compatibility (normal one) (D3D9).* Anti-Aliasing Mode = Overwrite any application settings.* Anti-Aliasing Setting to 12xS Combined: 2x2 SS + 4x OGMS D3D only.* Anti-Aliasing Transparency SuperSampling = 8x Sparse Grid Supersampling * Anisotropic to User Defined.* Then to 16X below that.* Filtering Quality = High Quality.* Single Display performance Mode.* Prefer maximum performance.I can go into upgrade menu this way without the crash, and it effectively runs at 5120x2880.It is really sad that they dare to sell a game, that now once again costs 29,99. Even without any Warning, that the game is Broken at points and will crash to windows in certain cases even besides this 4K BUG.There are other cases where it just crashes.This Developer does not deserve the money, of the original 29,99, it is just as much Steam's fault for not putting a BIG warning message on there Store Page.They even know this developer has abandoned the game, according to multiple posts.Yet they have taken no action at all.Neither the Publisher , Developer answers anyone.Not even after a 3 year time span in over 20 different threads.I will not advice anyone to buy anything from this publisher at all considering they have more games with poor support according to other reviews.They have sales right now , and they are fake as hell.There prices are extremely overpriced.For mediocre games with poor support and numerous amounts of bugs.That worse of all mostly are titles with less then 4 or 8 hours of content on top of it.A worthless brand.Anything with Koei Tecmo on it will ot be bought by me in the future.Anyone else should decide for themselves.But if you get ♥♥♥♥ed.Then its your own problem.My Thumb Stays Red simply because of not answering and only collecting money without giving any support at all.

												Currently only have two hours in this game but that's enough to view and try out the variations in gameplay that the title offers which isn't much but that doesn't mean that's a bad thing.Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z is nothing more than your every day hack and slash gorefest and that's the strength it plays to. Fight hordes of zombies and other enemies in glorious, flashy fast paced slashing action. Graphically it isn't the best and there aren't many variations when it comes to gameplay. You go from point A to point B and brutally murder everything in your path while purchasing some upgrades for Yaiba a long the way. What really makes the game shine is the humour. Think Borderlands meets Ninja Gaiden. Yaiba is a reckless, ruthless and funny rage filled character that will keep you entertained.I got this on the sale and it's more than worth that price for a couple of hours of switching your brain off to engage in some gory action. The game runs incredibly smooth, I've not encountered any FPS drops, any crashes, any freezes or any graphical issues. I've also not encountered any gameplay bugs so far either. For a fast paced combat focused game running smooth and being as bug free as possible is a must and this game seems to nail it.I will say though if you're a hardcore Ninja Gaiden fan (1, black, 2, 3) then this game likely isn't for you. It has nowhere near that level of difficulty and combat depth and certainly isn't as ""serious"" as the main franchise games try to be in tone.If you're looking for any deep sort of gameplay then I'd move on but if you're just looking to murder hordes of the undead, give it a go. It's worth it.			"

												Well to start off, I picked this game up off of a Humble sale for pretty cheap. I sometimes like to buy and play ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games just for the hell of it. While some are enjoyable in how awful they are, like Legendary, some are just truly bad. This game is one of the latter. It's just bad.TL;DR - It's bad. If you like awful,♥♥♥♥♥♥games pick it up on sale. If not, just keep away.Pros:-The cell shaded art style of the game is solid. Nothing special, but it doesn't look poor.-The game runs well with high frame rates on high settingsCons:-THERE IS NO CAMERA CONTROL-The writing is just god awful (the intended audience has to be preteens when it's probably rated Mature)-The game is weirdly difficult, but not in an intuitive way (feels more unfair than hard)-Generally uninspiredWhile the game looks good and runs well, that doesn't save it from being an utter shitpile. The game is weirdly difficult, which is nothing new to the Ninja Gaiden series, but it's not intuitively difficult. The other NG games made you want to ""git gud"" and beat the difficult areas/bosses while this game is just frustrating. Enemies are plentiful and you can only take a few hits worth of damage. Then there are tons of gimmick enemies that are super powered and while fine on their own, become annoying and difficult as they send multiple at you at a time. The weapons you have to deal with them are uninspired and feel sub par, taking like 2 light combos for one generic enemy. The more interesting and special weapons are gated behind killing special enemies and you lose them after a period of time. Leaving you with just the normal boring weapons again.What makes the game the most difficult is the lack of camera control. Not being able to move the camera at all is the worst decision you can make in a game like this. Enemies get in the way of the camera and it's way to easy to lose your character after getting knocked around. No camera movement plus enemies that obscure the screen make it nearly impossible to see what's going on in certain situations. I feel like most of the difficulty stems from this awful camera which just makes the game more difficult in general.Poor controls + uninspired weapons + terrible writing means I cannot recommend this game. I tried to as hard as I could to play it thinking 6 hours (howlongtobeat) was doable, but I just can't do it to myself anymore. Just save yourself the bad feelings and skip this one. "

http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/yaiba-ninja-gaiden-z-game-review/A Ninja Gaiden game on Steam? Aww yeah!I was surprised to open Steam and find a Ninja Gaiden game, I mean, I've been a  fan of the series for years now and, with this title, the series continues to impress me. Yaiba takes the Ninja Gaiden series to a different realm, in a way, well, in terms of graphics at least. The game looks like it was pulled out of some comic book. This was a great style for such a game, even more for a Ninja Gaiden game. It was kinda like when I first played Borderlands, and that's a good thing. However, disregarding the graphical change, Yaiba does not stand out as a true Ninja Gaiden game.Although it may not be a ""true"" entry in the series, it certainly performs much like its predecessors and is a great deal of fun to play. The reason I'd say Yaiba is not a true entry is the pace. It's simply not as fast as I'd expect from a Ninja Gaiden game. It played more like Dynasty Warriors, which isn't entirely bad, but if I wanted to play Dynasty Warriors, I'd play, well, Dynasty Warriors. It may be a strange take on the series, but the game certainly nails that fun factor for me.The game's difficulty is a bit weird as well. I played on normal, but it was really, really hard at parts. Maybe due to my lack of playing hack and slash titles recently, I dunno. I can't begin to imagine the frustration that would come with choosing the hardest difficulty, but I'd like to try someday. If it's anything like Metal Gear Revengeance, than it'll be a frustrating time indeed.The game's story is laughable, but not really 'bad'. Just your generic storyline, nothing to be impressed with. I was disappointed to find out that I was grounded the entire game, as in, I could not jump. Instead, I would dash. Dashing is cool and all, but I miss my jumping ability. Instead, quicktime events are factored into the game to replace the jumping mechanic. Want to jump across a gap? Press whatever button is displayed in front of you.The game ran smoothly on my PC, probably due to the fact that it made use of UE3, which is probably why this port exists, but no complaints from me. The game is also full of humor, a great addition to such a game, but most of this is adult humor, which was alright with me, but some may find it rather offending.I've also heard of others having issues with the game camera, and I can't deny that it can be a bit weird at times, but it wasn't as bad as others made it out to be. It worked well for me, at least.Overall, Yaiba is a fantastic entry in the Ninja Gaiden series, even if it may not be a ""true"" entry, it still manages to impress. I urge you to give it a shot.			"

												I have to say that so far this game is one of my most favorite hack and slash games out there. The attitude of the character and the awesome stylized game graphics just make this game pop. I love dismembering my opponents and beating down their comrades with those limbs. Especiall the clown zombie limbs. Just frickin amusing to beat someone down with rainbows. Also the counter system which allows you to throw projectiles back at the sender or into a group of enemies is just amazing Then you go the grab system which just lets you use an out right enemy as a bludgening weapon. The thing I enjoy the most is the fact that they took into account what happened to the character and how electicity and such would effect him. Even the cute reminder that hes not fully robotic warnings to stay out of fire and such/ It just all makes me just immerse myself and become addicted for a long time.  As have not beat the game yet I bet even after beaating it I will be returning just to do it again and enjoy the mayhem.			"

												Qucik reviewA lot of fun, funny and can release some stress by mass murdering zombies, good humour.only downside, game can be very repetitive and there can be a huge difficulty jump if you dont have some sort of element weapon against the mini bosses and finally counter attacking can be a bit odd sometimes and can be anoying to do since being surounded by enemys all the time can either interupt it or stop you from being able to counter attack ( oh a rocket il just thow this bac-zombie walks infront of rocket and you get caught in spalsh damage )Aldo i said a lot more negatives than positive this is just me being picky as i went most of the game never counter attacking besides when there were rockets, for me it was a lot of fun, could have been better but hey i got it for 4.99 ( or 5.99 cant remeber ) so im happy with it			"

												After I spent a few hours in this game I feel like I must protect this game, so I wrote this review:Its a FiretrUCKING awesome game!!! I can understand the negative ratings by the ""Ninja Gaiden"" fans or those guys who wanted something else. Im a huge fan of the series, BUT I never had an xbox. Sooo im the fan of the original NES Ninja Gaidens. I didnt really liked the look of Hayabusas gimpsuit on xbox (on videos), not because its bad, just I like more Yaibas outfit and character (I used too much for the original ""blue ninja"") but here when i saw the blue ninja outfit :D I even (donno why feeling the same excitement like when i played on my NES... oh the memories :D ) And the jokes... I love this kinda jokes and fighting. I love the story and I love the gore and everything. I even like the camera angles. There are too much pros in this game for me so I just write a few:- Ninja Gaiden (NES) feeling- Humor- Gore- Executions- Comic like- Ninjas- Cyborg- Cyborg Ninja- and lots of more like well optimized, Ministry for trailer music, voices, atmosphere, etc.I got only 3 problem with this game:1, the end fight dont have checkpoints and you cant skip the ""cinematic"" parts, so if you make a mistake you need to start over the An act of Gonzo. (but with practice its not that hard, just long if you die)2, same problem with the ""2D"" Ninja Gaiden Z adventure. If you run out of continues after the first stage kinda frustrating. I think it maybe would be better if you have an option to continue from the start of the stage, but then it could be too easy.3, no cards and stuff for this game.			"

												Today's Review: YAIBA: NINJA GAIDEN ZFirst of all, i didn't get why all the bad reviews, this game it's among the best, most fun and well made hack n' slash games i've ever played, everything about this game it's pretty well made, awesome borderlands style graphics (from the makers of Dead or Alive 5 Last Round), it's incredible fun, music it's pretty good and story is decent and pretty funny (for mature audiences)I really don't have a lot more to say than that, for me was a solid buy.Metascore: 73/100 If you enjoyed titles like DMC Devil May Cry you should give this title a chance, or if you just love Ninja Gaiden.

												   Well, this is one of those few games I both like and hate at the same time.    On the one side, we have good story, good humour, great graphics. I like the yaiba character, and ms. monday, and wouldn't mind seeing them again in another Yaiba game. BUT.   Compared to other ninja gaiden games, the combat was meh. You only get three basic attacks, and whatever bits you can rip off of your zombie foes, which do eventually break. Compared to the arsenals, hayabusa gets in the primary Ninja Gaiden games, it feels a little dissapointing. You don't even get shurikens or kunai to throw. Your main projectile weapon is zombies.    The other main issue I have with this game is its insanely frustrating and sometimes semingly random difficutly of the various fights (including the last boss). I can't remember the last time i've had so many rage moments at a game, and that includes older Ninja Gaiden games. Sufficed to say, a number of the fights either do not progress in difficulty properly, or are so badly stacked against Yaiba, that you would think the developers didn't want you to finish the game. Either or, a number of the fights are horribly inbalanced.    Over all, I can't really recommend this game. However, if you like frustration in your gaming, go for it.			"

												barely recommended. not because of the on rails platforming, i have no problem with that. the color scheme and cel shading with acidic colors is a plus. the atmosphere, setting, voice acting, and comedy is fine.the reason i cant highly recommend it is due to the damnable camera.its not the fact that its fixed...its due to that, sometimes, the camera is panned so far away from Yaiba it becomes incredibly difficult just to see where he is the screen!lots of times i have no idea where Yaiba is at while fighting a horde of enemes. 2 particular instances come to mind. One being fighting a giant mech with a horde of clowns around. really frustrating not being able to see where your character is on screen.did the devs expect people to fight well in these areas? how do you expect me to do something like a counter when i can just barely see Yaiba at such distances????...???other than that its fine. performance of the port runs well on any pc.

												Man I dont even know where to begin with this one. Wel I guess Ill start with saying that this game is a spin off of the Ninja-Gaiden series where you play as a ninja named Yaiba who was killed during a duel with the protagonist of the other 3 ninja gaiden games, Ryu Hayabusa. He eventually get revived by a corporation who gives his cyborg modifications and tasks him to fight the living dead and find a cure. And try to kill Ryu somewhere along the way. The character of Yaiba is very rude and angry and is very dislikable in a funny way. The supporting characters of Ms. Monday and Del Gonzo are only there in cutscenes or through dialogue. The artstyle to this game is very similar to that of Borderlands or The Wind Waker as its cell shaded. This brings a fresh of breath new life to the ninja gaiden series and its used very well. Now the game took me about 10 hours to complete and its not as difficult as the other ninja gaiden games. This one is more difficult because the enemies have a lot of life, can drain your life, and have lots of ranged attacks and the mini bosses can be insanely hard to kill especially near the end when they throw up to 4 of them at you in the same open room. This makes the difficulty feel cheap and unneccesarily hard. Not to mention that the final boss in this game if the most INFURIATING final boss ive fought against in any game ive played thus far. As a fan of the ninja gaiden games I cant recommend this game uness you want some cheap fun for a few hours and really need to get rid of money or else you will die, if you get it for $5, or if someone gifts it to you (which is how I got it) If i had to give it a score itd be a 4/10. Its an average game with a few flaws and a stupid final boss (I dont think I mentioned how much I HATE that final boss with its stupid 3 phases and open arena where he drops lots of special zombies) which gets the job done of keeping us with a bit of action while we eagerly wait for Ninja Gaiden 4.

												UPDATE: 11/22/2014 out of boredom decided to try this game again. I know i verfied the files before and had no results. did it again and it found 175mb of files to download.... i  also disabled steam ingame by unchecking the box in the games properties within steam. i started the game and it laucnhed with no problems. i played for 2 hours untill the game froze when i finished a level and then when i alt tabed it crashed.  i think  disabling steam ingame helped though. 11/23/2014 well the game is crashing at the end of that level everytime it seems...oh no wait now it crashes everytime i try to start the game...... im done with this junk. stay away from this developer(s) there is a clear problem  for some users and they have never addressed or patched the game since launch. original review below-----------------------------------------------------------------The game is fun but i cant complete it due to the game crashing all the time. I thought i had fixed the problem several times only for it to return time and time again. sometimes it wont even start when i hit play or go straight to the exe and run it as admin. it just crashed before the first logo appears. this might happen 10 times then suddenly it starts and i may be able to play 5 mins or 1 hour but it crashes sooner or later. Checked forums and there are several people with this problem since the game first came out too!!!! with no sign that it will be fixed. Now im not saying dont get this game by any means, there are many more people without the problem than there are with it. im just saying be aware that it could  happen to anyone and you really dont know till you play the game. I  really want to play the game and finish it and i have tried but after fighting this crashing problem it is just too much to handle.  I honestly do not think it will be fixed since there has been no patches since launch for PC. If anything this is a lesson to be wary of this dev for me personally.			"

												A spin-off game from Ninja Gaiden serie, the game is about Yaiba a cyborg ninja who seeks revenge against Ryu Hayabusa and gets involved with a zombie apocalypse.I don't really understand why some people gave negative reviews for this cool game here. Might be for the auto camera view or it could be that they want the real Ninja Gaiden games on the Steam, well I dunno... But here is my honest opinion on the game:It's a really fun hack'n'slash game just like Devil May Cry, but way harder. The game will punish you for not parrying, dashing, or attack at the right timing, so you gotta be a real ninja here.The story is not a masterpiece at the point to get you really really interested but it's ok, I mean is not bad as well. In fact they add alot of funny stuff on it. The zombies are really stupid doing idiot stuff, and so some Yaiba reactions.As for the price 29.99€ I think is worth it for a physical copy, as for a digital copy I think it should be 19.99€. So if you want this game I suggest to get it on a sale, that would be 100% worth the price and you will not get dissapointed.Edit: So after finish the game for 2nd time I've decided to replay for collectibles and get the remaining achievements, and for my surprise there is few glitches I must point out. Along the game there is few of them but they didn't bother me, but there is one in specific that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. There is a mission where there is a elemental shard (collectible) in a place of a story shard (collectible) which makes the progress 90% and unable to get 100% because the item just dissapeard and you get stuck in 90%, the only way I found out is to restart a new game wipping out all your data. But this is just rare case that happened to me and few people I saw on forums. And the same glitch / bugs are on PS3 / Xbox.I wish Koei bring others Ninja Gaiden games to Steam.			"

												If you're looking for a hack'n'slash, pick any other hack'n'slash and only settle on Yaiba if you've played them all and are bored of everything else. I only managed 20 minutes before accepting that it wasn't going to get better. Too bad we can't get the actual Ninja Gaiden games on PC - this is nothing like those, do not buy this expecting it to play like a NG game in any way.			"

												Having played the first 3 hours, i really can't understand the horrible reviews this game got. I really enjoyed my time so far. It looks like a very nice spectacle fighter.I like the art style and the cinematics. The controls are pretty good so far. You combo your attacks with 3 buttons (which is just complex enough for me). Doing big combos while being surrounded by dozens of zombies is really satisfiing, i have to say. In addition to these buttons you have a dash to quickly move (no jump btw), a block and some other actions like grabbing a zombie in order to use him as a weapon or throw him. Overall the combat feels really good. I can't complain at all.The difficulty seems to be pretty high, but I don't mind dying a few times now and then. They could have added a few more savepoints. But that's only a minor complaint.The camera is fixed, you cannot adjust it yourself. This will♥♥♥♥♥♥off some people. And yes, sometimes you end up in a situation where the enemies are behind the camera, where you can't see them. This can be annoying sometimes. On the other hand, you can use your right thumb purely for attacking, blocking etc. and don't have to interrupt only to move the camera. I think both systems have pros and cons. I am fine with how Yaiba handles it most of the time.So yeah, i think it's a good game. The most important thing is that the combat feels really good, and that's what these games are all about, right? ;)Some gameplay footage:

												I wouldn't recommend unless you enjoy faux-3D games with fixed camera angles (refer to that horrible Castlevania redux). For all the 3D action they present this game as having, the right analog stick cannot be utilized at all in order to pan the enviroment.... They could've learned a lot from MGR: Revengeance: a beautifully crafted and styled, fully panoramic real time combat enviroment; Yaiba was sold as such, but scarcely delivers. This game is only worth purchasing at at least half the price.			"

												I was thinking of giving the thumb up to this game. I mean it's not really that bad of a game, yeah the camera sucks, the enemies lack in variety, and the difficulty is more based around throwing a lot of strong zombies at you at the same time than testing your skills, but the combat was fun, the humor was ok, and visualy looks good.The last boss was what made me just give up and give it thumbs down. Not that the boss is that hard, because he's not, and i've fought way harder bosses than him (Ornstein and Smough i'm looking at you) but at least they were fun and hard in a good way, this one is a bad boss, plain and simple. What makes the fight hard is the same that makes the rest of the game hard, throwing some strong zombies at the same time at you. The boss itself has only a few attacks that will mostly miss you, with the laser eyes being the only attack that can be a pain to dodge. The fight is basically dodge a couple of boss attacks then defeat zombies to get their weapons to use them on the boss. The biggest problem is that the fight is lenghty and if you die close to the end you have to start from the beggining, which wouldn't be so bad if the boss wasn't so boring and dull. In the end i quit the game because i couldn't muster any motivation to go throw that boring boss fight again.I'm not giving thumbs down just because of the boss, but that plus all the other negative aspects of this game makes me not recommend it.

												It's not DMC, it's not MGR, it's not even slasher, to be honest. This is tribute for players like me, who lost all of his money in smoke-covered bars with coin-up NEO-GEO machines. This is more like a Double Dragon or any straight-walking fighting arcade games of SNES/SEGA age. Combat system is fun, variety of combos and moves are impressive and the graphic style is nice. It's not Crysis of course, but nice, stylish look inspired by games like Killer is Dead. Main story is pretty short (you can rush the game in 4 hours), but you have many reasons to repeat all missions. There is a lot of hidden objects to find, lot of difficulties to complete, ranks and medals to earn and so on. There is even an Arcade Mode in it, when you have NES inspired HUD, and funny, static cut scenes with 8-bit graphic.The biggest problem at the moment is price. 60 EU is absolutely too high for that kind of game. After all, this is only short spin-off of bigger franchise, aimed for a very specific kind of players. I don't regret buying this, but if you're expecting DMC clone, or even something like previous Ninja Gaiden games, just don't buy it. Buuuut, if you like arcade beat'em'ups like Streets of Rage, but with more modern design and improvments, then you can think about shopping. But IMO, wait for discount anyway.Oh, and one more thing. I'm mad at people who complain about this game, and by the look on their Steam profiles, they don't even have it. I'm sure that they didn't even bother to play pirate copy, just judging enitre game by it's price, wich is stupid as hell. And stop comparing it with previous Ninja Gaiden games. It is Ninja Gaiden as much, as Metal Gear Rising is Metal Gear. It's spin-off, not NG4.			"

												I really like this game. It has some flaws, but who doesnt?Yaiba is fast, beautiful, jokes are good, difficulty is high.This is modern version of arcade beat'em'up game. It's hard, it's challenging and it's simple.Don't play on difficulty lower than Hard!			"

												YAIBA: Ninja Gaiden Z ROCKS! This game is a pure fun Beat 'Em up/Hack & Slash with some amazing artwork and graphics. The graphics kind of remind me of a 90's gory comic book style and the humor is like FC3: BloodDragon. I've been playing almost non-stop since I bought it and having a blast.Sure this game isn't for everyone but if you like the artwork and don't mind TONS of gore and b-rated humor with some great beat 'em up gameplay, you'll love this.

												Not sure why so many reviewers (IGN, Gamespot, ...and all the others except Famitsu) are giving this game such bad reviews. IMHO i think the people that played the game did not take the time to learn all the various combos and most importantly the elements system. In other words all those reviewers just plain suck at games and shouldn't call themselves gamers. They look at the few bad things and blow it out of proportion. And yes I said they are not ""Gamers.""I do agree that there are some aspects of the game that can be mind-wracking, but its not as bad as you may believe. Such as the camera...Yes the camera can become an issue at some times, but all you need to do is dash out of the fray and get back to slaughtering zombies. Other reviewers complain about how some zombies are impossible to kill with out ""Zombie Weapons,"" but that a bunch of bull...default weapons are just as viable.With that said about default weapons, counterattacking the zombies is easy with the convenient circle indicators above their heads; just need to time your button presses right - you'll see what I mean if you buy the game.You cannot play this game thinking it will be a true to heart/spirit/whatever...Ninja Gaiden game. It is a hack-n-slash to its core - with some SMALL RPG elements via the leveling up system and perks. Jumping around is by simple three-button quicktime events that have checkpoints in between - so don't worry about dieing during the event and having to restart the entire level. And for those combo junkies that do their best to rack up huge combos...well this is your game IMHO - just avoid getting hit. As mentioned earlier about the camera, if you get surrounded by zombies, just dash out - it works rather niceley.Now for the animation, I love it! Not too many games these days have orginal art and animation - especially since everything these days is a got dang FPS. The whole comic book style - though not original - but what is original these days - it is still nice to see and in this case its done rather well IMHO. Animations overall are fluid - havn't experienced any stuttering or issues so far.If gratuitous use of adult language and sexual themes offends you...then this is not your bowl of pudding....go get something a little sweeter. Yaiba and his motley crew have a bunch of sailor mouths, but I'm fine with that.On my last note - the zombie comedy and easter eggs are pretty neat and original.Overall, this is a recommend - Highly recommend if I could. Like any hack-n-slash, take time to learn the combos and other systems implemented. Learn your enemies' movement and patterns to know when to strike, defend, and counter. If you take time to learn, I promise the gaming experience will be much better than trying to bash your way mindlessly to death and eventuall victory.....And for those that didn't buy the game cause the price was ""too high"" you're missing out on the FUN!

												Update setting the resolution above 1440p like say 4k causes the game to crash I do not like this game having the ninja gaiden name as its not true to the old nes or even the xbox releases of ninja gaiden this is just a cash grab I feel but at the current price its worth it if you want a hack  n slash game with humor			"

												My Experience: The combat button mashing feels smooth but performing combo's can sometimes put the player in a bad spot. In Certain environment or levels the camera will basically work against you at times making it difficult to see. The game only contain 7 levels each taking about 15 to 30 minutes to complete. I found some bugs but not truly game breaking and at times I was put in some situation where I had no idea what to do. My Opinion: This game had potential but it feels like the developers didn't have enough funding or staff to execute perfectly.For those who were thinking of getting this game my recommendation is to wait for the steam deal like I did and play the game on the easy difficulty setting.  This was basically a decent but yet a frustrating game.			"

												man i just played Hyrule warriors and Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's edge for the Nintendo wii U.. Man this is a New type of series for Ninja Gaiden. More like a Future Setting after everybody is Dead.. and you have 2 Friends to help you. the zombies have Brains and know how to use them.. even Have Comedy Moments Through Out. YOu will laugh and Have fun Sliceing and Diceing your way Threw these Zombies. They can even Speak. in Most Zombie Games the Zombie is never creative.. in this game they are creative as Much as a Human Being A Nice Twist to the Zombie Horror Elements.. and its a good take on rather then Shoting them for once.. Also there are plently up upgrades, And Combo Sets for you to learn.. And many Levels of mastery..  I am glad i got this Game.. by Now Tecmo should come with a Addictive warning Label for me..From Dead or alive to Ninja Gaiden To DW and beyond all the games from Tecmo, This is the most fun i been having gaming for a while.Requires a Mature Level of Taste not for the Un Mature Level Gamer Or senativaty to Sexual Jokes or that type of nature.. For those who can get the adults Jokes welcome to the best fun you can have.. and its a good thing this game does not take it self Seriously I am kinda getting Tired of all the Games in video games have to be serious. I can Recommend this game to all of my Friends. Pick it up and Just Have fun.. Thats what gaming is all about.. And Let this game Help you get lost in the hours to come..  and its true most games i have lost there fun factor.. i am Glad Tecmo still makes games that are fun, Challenging and Engaging to all gamers.. who are adults from the 8-bit era/ 16-bit/ 32-bit and 64-bit and 128-bit Group of gamers..

												I wish I could leave and honest review about this game. I really liked the trailers and the gameplay seemed like lots of fun.HOWEVER!!!This heaping mess of buggy code wouldn't even launch from within Steam. From what I gathered from Steam Forums in regards, this has been a constant issue since 2015!!!The most luck I had was following directions that lead to closing everything on my computer, including Steam (not even running it in the background) and I was able to launch the game (I still had to modify the resolution settings in the mygames folder).I got to play a whopping 45 seconds of selecting my difficulty before it crashed for the last time.I love Ninja Gaiden games and how difficult they are, but this is beyond ridiculous. I shouldn't quit the game from just trying to lauch it!FWIW I am sure it is not a hardware issue. I am running an i-7 2600k, GTX970 and 16GB RAM. The game was even installed on my SSD (Samsung 750 EVO).			"

												Funny and short this is a great game to play when you're in the mood for some hack'n'slash action. The two big drawbacks are the very short story (took me about 3 hours to go thru it) of the game and the fixed camera which sometimes makes it a hassle for seeing enemies. Aside from that there is a lot of humor and an awesome visual style that reminds me of anime with great use of vivid colors and nice attention to details. There's also some platforming and light puzzle solving to this game. Had lots of fun.			"

												Wonky controls, bad checkpoints, and an awful camera. Even with external fixes in place, the camera can still be garbage. This had lots of potential at the beginning of the game. But too many cutscences that disrupt the action during the beginning, as well as dumb boss fights. Do not bother with this one.			"

												UPD: After going back to this game, I am now ashamed of my past attempts to justify the game's existence. It's a bad game, even worse, it's a♥♥♥♥♥♥Ninja Gaiden game. Of course I was excited when I found out a Ninja Gaiden game was coming to PC. Of course this excitement didn't last as I pretty much instantly found out this was not going to be a true Ninja Gaiden title. So here are my first impressions after playing first two missions:- The game is fast, but not as fast as classic Ninja Gaiden games.- I'm playing on Normal, and the game manages to pose a challenge sometimes. Basic enemies which attack in hordes are very easy. This is one of the things that make this Ninja Gaiden look more like a God of War title.- No free jumping this time around. The jump button is used for dashing. Blocking and countering are still there.- A lot of finishing/execution cut-scenes. Again, this is where the game is obviously treading into God of War territory.- Different weapons are there, but you have to pick them from enemies, and they don't last long. A strange change but I guess it works.- The story is cheesy in a good kind of way. Had a few smirks and grins out of it so far.- The game looks beautiful, feels like you're watching a cartoon.Overall, I'm enjoying the game so far. I'd be happy to play classic NG games instead, or Bayonetta, or DMC. But I'd pick Yaiba over God of War any day of the week.I would urge you to buy the game so we can get more Team Ninja games on PC, but I have little hope for that. This game is made in UE3, which makes it easy to port unlike other Team Ninja titles. Not to mention the insane launch price and the fact that the game is absent from the top selling titles on Steam.So, only buy this game if you are certain you'll be able to get some enjoyment out of it. If in doubt, wait for a discount. It's not that bad, it's actually pretty good. Too bad it's not really Ninja Gaiden.			"

												Initially game wouldn't start and keep crashing. After some time searching found a fix: disable steam overlay.Can't take screenshots but at least I can play. After an hour and finishing a chapter game crashes after what I think is the boss. Now it can't start anymore and steam overlay is already disabled.Gameplay's ok for a hack n slash, some comedy in the dialog.			"
