												I played Obscure back on the PS2 at its original release and remember being pleasently surprised. This game utilises ""fixed camera angles"" like  the classic Resident Evil and Silent Hill games but mixes it up with a cheesy high school teen slasher flick story, and combining gameplay from both franchises. This survival horror has alot of the classic elements you would expect; variety of actual puzzles, limited supplies, dark and tense atmosphere, unique monster designs and since this is a co-op experience, reliability on your partner.Speaking of partners each different character you can play as, and switch to at any time, have their own special abilities - so it is advisable to use different characters in the appropriate situation, I think this adds depth to the gameplay.The story is cheesy, not serious, but there is a charm to it. It also features my favourite ""game fetish"" storyline in which everything is normal at first, but slowly devulges into the horror you came to expect, and you have to fight and learn the mystery behind how this all happened.The combat is basic, there is auto-lock, power attacks and standard attacks, but that's all this game needs I feel. The good thing is that the controls are easy to learn and complexity is not needed here.Unfortunately, for me, the music is quickly forgettable so don't expect some Akira Yamaoka level of quality here. That being said, what I hear fits what is happening, just that it isn't something you would listen to casually.I recommend this game to fans of the classic RE and SH games, and looking for their fix on survival horror with some original concepts to it. However, this game was originially released back in 2005, so expect some outdated mechanics compared to modern horror.Also, this PC port is a re-release of an older port but adds native widescreen support and full controller support, among general optimisations to work on modern Windows systems. The only bummer is that there is still no mouse support. I should also mention the game does indeed run at 60fps.			"

												I remember playing this years back on PS2 and PC.If you like survival horror games, you will like this one.This reminds of those high school horror movies played out at as a 3rd person survival horror game.The gameplay, action, suspense and camera movement is much like what you would find in games like Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil: Code Veronica, Silent Hill and Cold Fear, except in this game you play as several high school students, Stan, Kenny, Ashley, Shannon and Josh, that you can switch over to at any time and you will need to for teamwork to pass certain obstacles. The game feels good in that way because it brings extra life to the game rather than thinking you are playing as a lonely character. Each character has a special ability which will make progressing through the game easier if you don't let them get killed.Stan by far is the best character. His personality is just too carefree and cool. :PBut if you want to have real fun, invite a friend over and grab an extra controller for 2 player Co-op playing out the story of the game. It is a lot of fun! You can even share items and weapons, passing them to each other when needed.A couple of downsides are that the game hasn't been updated to support wide screen monitors, so you will have a 4:3 aspect ratio unless you lower the res to 1600x1200, 1280x1024, 1152x864 or lower to get a full screen without side borders. Also, use of a controller is highly recommended as the game really wasn't optimized for mouse and keyboard.Obscure is a great game though and yet another surprise to appear on Steam. :)			"

												I first got my hands on Obscure back in 2004, on PS2. Was quite surprised to see it on Steam. It's one of the games which reserved a spot in my memory. I remember having a lot of fun playing it, and i got the same pleasure replaying it after 10 years.Obscure is an old-school horror survival game which manages to entertain by offering a cheesy story, influenced by the Robert Rodriguez's  ""The Faculty"" movie. It uses the music from the movie and even contains a character based on it. Even though i heavily disliked the movie, Obscure succeeded in offering me a whole different perspective.You have 5 students trying to escape their school, from an entire horde of monsters created by their Principal who was experimenting on students. You can choose to play for any of them, and at any time a second player can join the game for any other character, which doesn't force you to start a new game if you want to play local co-op with a friend. Each one of them has a different special ability like running faster, better healing, or picking locks skills. I loved especially the method of saving the game. You do it using a CD which you need to find in-game, and i consider it to be an important aspect in a survival game, so that one won't be able to save every 2 minutes since the amount of CD's you can find is limited. The outstanding soundtrack composed by Olivier Derivière, in this particular environment, creates a even creepier atmosphere. There are few types of monsters, and also limited types of weapons, but what makes it better is that except weapons there is something else that hurts monsters - light. So when you are in a room with windows, and got yourself cornered - you can always break some windows and let them know who the boss is, as for the rooms with no windows - one can combine any firearm with a flashlight. I didn't notice for the light of the flashlight to inflict any damage, but at least it keeps the monster at distance for a short period of time.There are also some cons of course, but none which caused me any inconvenience. You can choose a resolution up to 1920x1080 but the game does not support widescreen so you'll just get a 4:3 aspect with black borders on the right and left side. Playing it with keyboard & mouse is possible, but not entirely comfortably. At least i couldn't do it, so i just used  a Xbox 360 controller which worked just great. Graphics are not the best, but also not awful, especially for a 10 years old game. I enjoyed Obscure very much, and would recommend it to anyone who likes old school survival games. Looking forward to play the second game. Hope i'll enjoy it as much as the first. Cheers ;)* NOTE > The game also includes all the Deluxe Edition content: Soundtrack, Artwork, Screenshots, Sketches...			"

												If you only plan on playing, say, ten or less Resident Evil and Silent Hill-styled third-person ""survival horror"" games in the course of your brief and precious time on this planet, you probably shouldn't make this one of them...in fact, the best of the aforementioned franchises as well as that of the Dead Space universe should keep you more than rewardingly occupied.  If however, like my unfortunate self, you are incurably addicted to games which remind you of that first-ever magical experience of playing the original Resident Evil on the Playstation 1, and have been seeking to recreate the unprecedented terror and freshness of that experience ever since, then you could do much, much worse than this particular game, 'cause for better or for worse, it's still one of the better Resident Evil rip-offs around.   Obscure certainly owes an extraordinary amount to the first two Residents.  The high school it's set in looks a little uncannily like a spooky mansion at times, and heck, there's even a large emphasis on sinister plants and underground labs and what-not.  Add the flashlights from the Silent Hill games, and the monsters-who-are-adversely-affected-by-the-light elements from Alone In The Dark: A New Nightmare (another oldie, but goodie), and you pretty much have this game.  But really, if you're the kind of person I described at the end of the last paragraph, this ain't exactly gonna be something you'll complain about, right?   I somehow never got around to this one when it was on the Playstation 2 - the high school setting somehow didn't inspire me at the time - but I'm glad to say I was wrong to abstain for so long.  Not ""classic"" exactly...but certainly respectable enough to be a must-play for the likes of yours truly.  Sure, it's nothing to write home about (unless your mother is also a fan of such games), but also not something for the horror-faithful to pass up, especially on sale.  I personally bought it at full price, and even then didn't feel ripped-off.  It's about the length it should be (i.e. mercifully shorter than the otherwise superior Dead Spaces), about as difficult as it should be (i.e. not overly so, with the possible exception of a slightly questionable save system and a truly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ final boss fight), has all the expected weapons (well, for an AMERICAN high school campus, anyway), and an actually pretty darn excellent soundtrack (which comes free in a separate folder with the game).  Hell, the AI for the single-player version (wherein you babysit a fellow high-schooler/""partner"", who you can switch to at any time) isn't even that bad, as these things go...sure the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s get in the way occasionally, but only about 20% of the time, which is pretty acceptable all things considered.     In short, not too shabby at all.  Not terribly scary for a game of this type, with a story as poorly-constructed and real-world illogical as you would expect, and the characters make those in Friday the 13th movies look positively layered by comparison (the distinct ""special skills"" of the characters is certainly a nice touch, but do we honestly need the guy who runs slightly faster than everyone else, or the guy who picks locks slightly faster than everyone else?)...but lower your expectations suitably, and you just might be pleasantly surprised.  I certainly was, and look forward to playing the sequel.Verdict: 8.5/10.			"

												I used to play this all the time with my brother on the original Xbox back when it first released, and I won't lie, I bought this game purely for nostalgic reasons.The game's plot is pretty weak overall, basically A group of high school students stay behind after school just to find that the whole place is full of these creepy monster things after dark. There's more to it than that, but that's the basic gist of things. Each of the high school students have their own special abilities, ranging from stronger attacks, the ability to sprint, and instant lock picking certain doors and lockers. If during the game you get one of the high school students killed, then they shall remain dead throughout the course of the game and the ending will change accordingly.Combat is a little sluggish, you'll often find yourself mashing the attack/shoot button in the direction of your enemy until they fall down. There's not a whole lot of depth to it, but some enemies will require a little pre-thinking strategy before going against. Ammo is also scarce, so you can't use your guns on everything you see either. The weapon management in this game is very simple, yet effective. For example, shining your flashlight on a monster will weaken it, and if you manage to find some tape, you can tape your flashlight onto a gun so you can use them at the same time. You can get better flashlights than others so you have to be careful on what you want to use your tape on. Nothing ground breaking, but a nice touch of item management none the less. You can also find healing items that will restore lost health. Again, healing items are scarce, so don't go tanking too many hits with the same character. The game does have simple puzzles, but nothing that you need to spend too long thinking about.Where this game really shines though, is in the coop mode. Sadly it's only local coop, but nearly the whole game can be played with a friend (besides the tutorial at the start). Item management between players is very self explanatory, and everything can be shared between players. The camera is shared between the players, meaning no split screen and it'll only focus one player. However you can alternate who you want the camera to follow at any time, and a lot of the camera angles complement the idea of two players so it isn't that much of an issue.All in all, this game is pretty much a lower quality version of the older resident evil games. It's not very scary, the combat is okay at best and the game isn't too long either. However the coop aspect in my opinion makes all of it worth it, so if you have a friend you can play this with, then buy away!If you're interested in looking at the game, my friend and I have just started a let's play of this steam version on our channel. I'll just leave a link here in case you want to check it out:

												Well, first off I want to state that I played  Obscure  only in local-coop (there is actual NO online co-op) and will review the game as such. And I have to say that   Obscure  is one of the best co-op experiences I've ever had. The nature of the game makes playing together prefered or rather playing ""solo""  unnecessary hard (mainly due the camera fixation on player one).But let's start at the beginning and look at the different parts of the game:- The story: It is interesting enough to pay attention but don't expect too much from a survival horror game. The premise is that your friend Kenny vanished on the school grounds so his friends decide to stay after school and to search for him.- The gameplay: You have 4 or 5 characters you can choose from each with their own hitpoints (so you can change at the actual meeting place if one is hurt too much) and their own little special ability. For example Josh can tell if there is still something in the room for you to pick up which is actually helpful. Also the characters can die and you can keep playing the game till all of them are dead. The camera angles are ""dynamically fixed"" (comparable to Resident Evil: Code Veronica X if you know that game) which means you will see the area always from the same direction but it will move with you to a certain degree. Also the camera is fixed on player one. This means in co-op the second player can go off screen and die there pretty easily. So you need to stay together. Other than that you have the Resident Evil room like system meaning that most time ennemies will not follow you in another room (there are small exceptions).The ammonition is scarce (on normal there is more than enough). The same goes for the healing items and the discs needed to save (yes you can save everywhere as long as you have the disc item but each save will waste one of them). There are also melee weapons which help to save ammo on different ennemies.The fighting itself is normal but has an interesting additional mechanic: the use of light. You can use your flashlight to make the ennemies ""weaker"" as they have some kind of creep protecting them which is sensitive to light. But while you use the flashlight power mode you can't shoot so you have to make a decision which gives a tiny little small amount of tactics. Other than that you have different type of weapons and ammo. - The soundtrack: It creates the necessary atmosphere for the game and I liked it a lot. A small grain of salt for players who owned the PS version. The intro song has been changed. You can look up the old intro and the song was definetely better but the license expired. It is not the end of the world.- Replayability: After completing the game there is a hard mode and you get alternate costumes. And the hard mode in this one is actually really hard. Ammo is divided by atleast two, some weapons are obtained only later on, discs are halved as well and healing items are cut to a fourth I had the feeling and yes, monster do make more damage. With the AI this mode can probably end pretty bad. Also completing the Hard mode is necessary for you achievement completionists. With a good partner you can get all achievements in around 10 hours.Well I don't know what to say more. If you like survival horror games like Resident Evil 1 - Code Veronica X and you are searching for really good local co-op experience then you should definetely get this one (although some may think it is a bit expensive for its age, I got it for the full price and did not regret the purchase). PS: If you have questions just ask. I'll try to answer them as fast as possible.PPS: It's a shame that I never got the chance to play Resident Evil Outbreak Multiplayer Mode (or even the single player mode since it didn't sound as much as fun as playing with others).

												Aaah, Obscure. It was one of my favorite games back then for some reason, and even after all these years, I still enjoy it a lot. Obscure is a third person survival horror game, and a pretty decent one. It's not the scariest game I've ever played, and it's not even close, but it's quite enjoyable on it's own level. You get trapped inside of a school at night while you are looking for a missing friend. But ""Evil"" stuff roams the grounds, and it's up to you to survive. In this game, you can weaken your shadow coated enemies using your flashlight, and then they will be rather weak, kinda like Alan Wake, but years before it. There are 5 playable characters, and if any of them dies during your game, he or she stays dead for good. In easy or normal mode, the game is rather easy, and even if you kill every enemy in your way, you'll still have lots of ammo. BUT, when you play on hard mode, it's got that good ol' survival horror feel, where you are actually trying to survive. You've got WAY less bullets than the enemies you'll encounter, and health items are rather scarce, too. It's hard, but not overly hard, it's still quite enjoyable, judging when and where you should use your healing items or ammo. I didn't had any trouble with this port, aside from the incredibly awkward (before you get used to) keyboard controllers. (Yes, you can change 'em, and yes, it supports a controller, but I was way too lazy to change the inputs).The graphics, even for a 2005 game, are pretty decent. The cutscenes are rather weird looking, but during the gamplay, they are enjoyable. The music of this game is also pretty good, even if there's only like 3 songs with countless remixes and stuff. (Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it)The only downside about this game is, that even on hard difficulty, it's a pretty short game. You can finish it in less than 2 hours if you know where you're going, hell, perhaps even faster. I started a run on hard/special mode, and managed to go through the whole game in an hour and half. It's definitely worth it, I would recommend this one if you are into old horror games. One thing, though....This game lacks the Sum 41 intro that made the old version kick♥♥♥♥♥ That made me sad...9/10.			"

												One of the better classic survival horror games that I have played. I wanted this on the PS2, but the games a tad pricey when buying it, as it's a  semi collectible. So, I was over joyed to find it on steam AND with full Controller support(as long as you enable it from the options menu. It doesnt detect an xbox gamepad unfortunately)Now, as with most old school survival horror games, the story is very unrealistic and centers on a group of kids, who does the most rational thing one could do upon hearing a high school friend of theirs didn't come home from school the night before: They sneak into the school with a baseball bat and begin busting open vendor machines and windows.Still, the game looks gorgeous for a classic game, and plays flawlessly! If you love games like Resident Evil and Dino Crisis and love movies like the Faculty, then you will love this game to bits!			"

												An old school survival horror,in which 5 students brave the horrors unleashed on their school,which manages to stay enjoyable despite its age.Pros:-fairly interesting story-considering its age,graphics are still decent-oldschool soundtrack has a retro but still enjoyable quality to it-coop is an option-a few extras/game mode unlocks for those so inclinedNeutral:-permadeath on characters,adds to the challenge but can lead to frustration and/or force a reload-limited amount of savesCons:-pretty cheesy overall-clunky controls and poor autoaim make combat harder than it'd be (I used a controller,so can't vouch for k/m)-uninspired last boss battle-companion AI isn't the best-despite having 5 characters there's not alot of difference between them,nor are they really fleshed out background-wise-short length-no widescreen supportOverall Obscure is a decently enjoyable experience and a good throwback to old school games,but you have to accept its shortcomings-some of which come from its age-to properly enjoy it. I'd say go for it when it's on sale if you already had your fill of old survival horror titles and are looking for more,just don't expect to find a life changing game experience.			"

												I played Obscure on my ps2 back in 2004. I found it for 5 euros in my local store, and I couldn't believe how a good deal it was. The game is a real gem, a survival horror game settled in an average american school, in where you take the control of 5 friends that have to survive in a very hostile enviroment. Puzzles, exploration, action, and of course a lot of scary moments, and also you will find some humour. A very balanced game, many hours of fun and a lot of extras.As for the Steam version, it runs perfectly. No bugs reported in the entire game. Enhanced graphics, smooth controls. A must-buy if you like horror games, or if you used to own a copy of the ps2 version.			"

Product received for free
If you've ever played a survival-horror game, you've seen all of this stuff before. The only addition to the mix is the Leafdale High School setting and a cast of five teen protagonists who are grungy versions of the kids from The OC. Hydravision has designed Obscure as a veritable reproduction of the Resident Evil series, including a ""greatest hits"" package of story, atmosphere, and even architecture (hmm, we've seen that double-staircase foyer before). The story, however, is more of a ripoff of Robert Rodriguez's 1998 high-school horror flick, The Faculty, with tentacled monstrosities reminiscent of H.P. Lovecraft's nightmarish creations and mutated human zombies replacing the movie's aliens.At any rate, these creatures smash through walls and doors just like similar beasties did way back when. Gameplay is structured around scrounging through rooms for items that can be combined into tools and weapons, collecting keys, pushing bookshelves, and saving progress with collectible CDs (space-age technology compared to Resident Evil's typewriter ribbons). You can reach the ending in six or seven hours, depending on your survival-horror experience. That experience really comes in handy, too, as some situations here precisely mimic those found in earlier Capcom games. A room with a missing lever and sliding shelves is a near-perfect copy of a chamber that puzzled Leon S. Kennedy in Resident Evil 2. Well, at least Hydravision seems to have done its homework.A few interesting concepts liven up the same old, same old. Light is a weapon almost as potent as pistols and aluminum baseball bats. Turn a flashlight on high-beam or smash away boards covering windows and you can drive back or even kill creatures. Duct tape a flashlight to a pistol and you've got a great one-two punch for dealing with many of the game's nasties.Also, you work in a two-person team for the most part, and can give orders to your buddy, switch between the duo on the fly, or head back to a gathering area to pick and choose a pair from all five members of your group. This sometimes comes in handy, as you need to team up to kill many monsters, and each kid in the Scooby Gang has a special attribute. Josh, for instance, is an investigative reporter with the school paper, so he can sniff out clues and let you know if there's anything else to be done in a room or hallway. Stan is tops at forcing locks, making him a wise choice when it comes to breaking into a room. Kenny can run and punch like the varsity athlete that he is. Smart Shannon provides tips on current puzzles. And Ashley can rapid-fire a pistol.None of these abilities is generally needed, though. Sure, Stan is more efficient at breaking locks than Josh, but the latter can still get the job done given an extra few seconds. Shannon's skill more or less duplicates that of Josh, and since the game isn't going to hurt your brain anyways, you don't need their tips to solve puzzles. Only Kenny and Ashley are truly useful, because of their fighting talents. And even those two aren't indispensable, since--just like in all good teen horror movies--anyone can die at any time, and you can complete the game even if some of your pals bite the dust.At times, you'll be tempted to thin out the ranks yourself. Each member of the gang is an irritating teen stereotype. Kenny's the jock. Josh's the adventurous nerd who always gets the girl in John Hughes movies. Ashley's the pretty, snotty cheerleader. Shannon's the bookish one who nobody notices is really sexy. Stan's the stoner, who calls everyone ""dawg"" and describes things he doesn't like as ""whack."" After a couple of hours of listening to this crew, you'll find yourself rooting for the monsters.Co-op play is a great idea poorly realized. There is no LAN or Net support, so players have to play side by side on the same machine. Gamepads are supported, but not mice, an omission that leaves one player stuck with the clunky yet serviceable keyboard. And the camera sticks with the lead player at all times, forcing the second player to trail closely behind or get lost. Co-op play betrays Obscure's PlayStation 2 and Xbox origins. Clearly, the mode of play has just been tossed into the PC version with no real concern for how to properly enjoy it on that platform.More care has been taken with the translation from console to PC where visuals are concerned. For a console port, this is a great-looking game. Leafdale may look more like a run-down hospital or mental asylum than a functioning high school, but it serves its spooky purposes nicely. Much of the furniture and assorted rubbish can be moved, too, so you're not adventuring in front of static 2D backdrops. Animations are very well done, particularly when characters are swinging baseball bats or metal pipes in fight sequences. Moving shadows add eerie possibilities to every corridor, giving you the impression that something's always about to leap from a nearby door or locker. The tense atmosphere is further enhanced with distant roars, banging noises that can't be explained, and a hair-raising music soundtrack that features Latin chanting and a title track by Sum 41 (not nearly as scary, unless you're creeped out by boy-band metal).In the end, Obscure lives up to its name. It's competent enough as far as blatant ripoffs of the great-granddaddy of survival horror go, but so much has been cobbled together that the game has no distinct identity of its own. "

												It's like playing a cheesy horror movie, which sounds terrible. but I loved this, it's Resident Evil/Alone in the Dark/Alan Wake in a High School.The music is 10/10, spooky and fits the school theme super well. All Choir-like and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Which is spooky.The fact once one of your five characters die, they stay dead is great too. And you can't really combat it with saving every 3 seconds either, as the saves are pretty limited. Though even with that, it's not hard at all to have all characters survive until the end.The game is still in 4:3 ratio though, so if you're autistic enough to care about two black bars at the side of your screen, that'll annoy you. But other than that, the graphics are good (for their time) and the areas have a very creepy feel to them. Mix that with the perma-death, and you find yourself fearing for your life at times.The story itself is a bit dumb, there's no arguing that, but it's very similar to an old cheesy horror movie, and the plot itself is pretty far-fetched, none the less, still easy to enjoy.The game doesn't hold your hand very much throughout it, which is good, though at times it's pretty easy to get lost at certain parts of the map. I've played with both a Keyboard and Gamepad, if you have a gamepad, use it. It just makes everything ser much easier.It's also 90s as ♥♥♥♥.Would recommend tho, I wrote a whole review on it, and I'm lazy as ♥♥♥♥. So it cant be too bad.			"

												This is a game I would certainly reccomend, and it certainly has a different type of idea about the conflict. Most games have a zombie virus, or nuclear waste, but in this one, it has a type of plant. Again, I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a good third-person Horror game. It gets rather frustrating during the end though, and I caution all of those prone to stress production.			"

												Well, where to start... I figure I should give an explanation whether or not you should throw down your hard earned cash on ObsCure. Seriously, ask yourself, ""Is it worth it?""Yes and no. Yes if you are into nostalgia or the rare occasion where you may be just morbidly curious. I, myself, fall victim to the latter and here's why...I played ObsCure 2: The Aftermath on the Wii (which I won't delve TOO much into, see that review later) and thought of it to be a torn fabric of the 1990's horror fame. It was goofy, had that post-grunge rock soundtrack and absurd college stereotypes as your choices for characters. However, I've been familiar with its predecessor for some time. Even having fellow comrades assure me that the original is better, especially if you are into those Resident Evil-esque games (Eternal Darkness, Evil Dead: Hail to the King). That didn't really solidify what I thought constitutes as a ""good game"", however I still had to know.Now for the meat and potatoes, is the game good? It is for what it is, I guess you could say. The game was made in 2004 and made by a company that I honestly never really even heard of. I had fun playing it, I was digging it. I enjoyed the experience as a whole. Despite my enjoyment, the game is really easy to beat. A speed run could go for a rough estimate of four hours, but that's an estimate. I'm sure there is somebody who nailed under an hour. I myself took about seven hours, but that doesn't really mean much.The real show stealer would be the game's soundtrack and sound effects which really help set the tone and mood of the game. The music is sort of reminiscent to horror films like Rosemary's Baby or The Omen. And the sound effects make you feel like you’re not alone in dark and gloomy areas of the school. For what it's worth, the game's music and sound developers succeed in what they were going for. But... like older games... the voice acting. If anything, this would probably resemble best to what my friends were referring to as ""Resident Evil-esque"". <----This feels like a dirty word, really.In lieu of it all, this game is not bad. I'll probably play it again. It's not great, and it's certainly not♥♥♥♥♥♥ But if you decide to get this, the REAL question to ask yourself is, ""Do I buy just ObsCure or the ObsCure Collection?"" As far as that goes, the ball is in your court.			"

												Rated 6.5/10Obscure is a multiplayer (local only) survival horror game. The game takes place at Leafmore High where 4 students go in search of one of their friends who went missing on campus. During the search they discover that the school is hiding many mysterious that could be directly tied to their friends dissapearance. It has been said that this game takes inspiration from the late 90s flick ""The Faculty"". After completing the game I am convinced this is true.The game plays much like what you would expect from a traditional survival horror game. You will explore the campus in search of keys and levers to gain access to new areas all while discovering readable documents to fill you in on plot details. You may also be rewarded for exploring by discovering ammunition, healing items or even CD's which you can use to save the game. The CD's work very similar to Resident Evil's ink ribbons except that you can save at any time as long as you have a CD in your inventory. There are also a fair share of puzzles to solve, most of which prove fairly simple.One of Obscure's strong points comes from it's combat. The combat in general is pretty basic, you can shine your light on enemies to hold them at bay while firing away with your guns, however if you pay attention to your surroundings you can often use the environment to your advantage. (Just remember the enemies are weakened by light).One of Obscure's weakpoints comes from the AI. Again the game does have a local coop option and it is obvious that is how the game was meant to be played. Playing through on single player you will control 2 characters at a time. You will be in direct control of 1 and the other will be controlled by AI, however you can swap back and fourth between these two characters with the press of a button. Don't get me wrong, the AI knows how to dish out damage. Where they fall short is in their ability to avoid damage and once your AI dies, they are dead. Gone for the rest of the game and will never respawn. If you are playing single player, make sure to your AI does not have a bat for a weapon or they will die. Stick them with a pistol and keep them away from certain enemy types and you should manage just fine.Obscure was indeed a fun playthrough once you learn how to work with the AI. The exploring is satisfying and the atmosphere is just creepy enough to keep you on edge. The game is relatively short and you can expect to finish in around 5 hours. If you are a fan of the older Resident Evil styled horror games you will enjoy Obscure. I recommend the energy drinks. "

												ObsCure was one of the last games I played on the original Xbox before I finally sold the console. I thoroughly enjoyed it then, and was looking forward to seeing if it had the same charm years later. It does.If you're a fan of the original Resident Evil, you'll undoubtedly enjoy this. It has the same fixed-camera angles, a spooky setting (a school as opposed to a mansion), inventory juggling (although thankfully no storage boxes), and the same general feel. Some call it a rip-off, but it's more than that. The differences are significant enough to warrant a purchase for survival horror aficionados.The setting is appropriately creepy, as you explore the school grounds after hours and at night. The mutated monsters are horrific, but not ""scary,"" per se. The cast includes five playable students with various minor differences in terms of skills; even if one or more dies, you can continue with the remaining one(s). The music is a particular standout, adding a lot to the overall menace. Acquiring new weapons throughout the game ensures you'll be prepared to combat the horrors within Leafmore High.Some general tips for aspiring students are in order. A controller is absolutely necessary; trying to play with the keyboard would be horrible. (I shake my head at elitist PC users who scoff at controllers.) Character Josh has the ability to determine if any items of interest are still in the area, something I found to be valuable. On Easy mode, using a teammate (either another player or the AI) is helpful and adds to the fun. However, if you opt to play Hard mode (unlocked after beating Easy), AI teammates will use up your ammo quickly. Easy is fun and fairly challenging, but Hard definitely lives up to its name with limited supplies and fewer save disks. Hard is the more satisfying experience, but it can take quite a while (and reloading) to devise the best strategies, including avoiding monsters and not exploring every single room/area.After completing ObsCure 100% on Steam, I'm going to take a break from survival horror for a bit until I go into uncharted territory with the sequel. I'm hoping for a similar fun experience.			"

												Great game! The dialogue is a little cheesy sometimes, but it makes up for it with some pretty good gameplay (which obviously matters more than the dialogue), and a great atmosphere. The characters' special abilities really help (in my opinion Josh was the most helpful, because he could inform you if you left something behind in a room, like a weapon you may have missed).I think one of the only actual gameplay difficulties would be that you can't change the camera angle. It doesn't really bother me, but I had a few friends who said they they wished you could move the angle around as you please.This game sort of reminds of the fictional game 'Stay Alive"" from the movie called 'Stay Alive', which was the whole reason I bought it for ps2 awhile back. Co-op is pretty cool. I was pretty sad to find out that there was no online co-op, but local was fun, and it made the whole thing a lot easier to tackle with more than one person.It's not incredibly difficult. Like, it can be challenging if you're playing on hard mode, but I don't think there's ever been a time where I was stuck on something for hours. I don't really see a problem with this, because unlike some, I hate having to restart levels over and over because of a tough opponent, but I can see why some people wouldn't like it.All in all, I think Obcure is a pretty great survival horror, and if you're a fan of the original Silent Hill or Resident Evil games, chances are, you'll probably find this pretty interesting.10/10 will definitely play again <3 "

												An... ""Obscure"" game from a small French game dev company. This is absolutely a game that is worth playing. I will say if you are younger than 20, you may or may not remember playing it, so it is much more fun to re-explore this game as an adult, but for someone new to the game; simple by choice or the fact you were too young to experience this on the PS2 or Xbox, you may not find it as fun. Nostolgia adds a big boost to any game you play.For me I'd say it's a 9/10 must play for the Nostolgia.If you are new, and are used to the AAA games coming out now, probably a 7/10, save this one for a rainy day, but is worth playing. You will find the script in this game to be cringy, and the game it's self not too scary with today's standards.			"

												THIS GAME ♥♥♥♥ING RULES. I played it as a very small child and it was not an okay game for me to play as a small child. It is HORRIFYING, and every second of it is filled with intense action. Unfortunately, I beat the game on the hardest difficulty while I was without internet, and the achievement didn't pop so I get zero bragging rights.It's a short game, only about five hours if you take your time (and don't get stuck on any puzzles) but MAN is it awesome. The acting is freaking AMAZING, soooo cheesy but sooooo good. ""It's too quiet in here.. something doesn't feel right.."" ""DON'T WORRY MAN- I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVER'THANG"". This is an excellent game to play if you're trying to get into the classic survival horror as the camera angles aren't too terribly hard to manage and aiming is extremely easy, the auto lock works 100% of the time. Unlike games like Resident Evil 2, or Nemesis, you won't find yourself getting hit by hidden enemies around a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t camera angle where you couldn't possibly hope to see them. Stan is, and always will be, the best character in this game. You can't say anything to that because Stan rules. 10/10 would play again. ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game. Seriously, LOVE it.			"

												I don't trust metacritic at all anymore, many of my favorite games have a score less then 80. Some of the criitics were far too picky with this game, such as lowering the score due to the bad grapics. The graphics aren't that bad for a 2004 game, graphics don't make the game; gameplay does. This game definitely delivers in gameplay; the local multiplayer is very well done and makes this game loads of fun playing it with someone right next to you instead of over a mic. I wish there were more games with this king of local multiplayer. My only complaints about this game would be that the dialouge can be a bit cheesy at times and its pretty difficult at times, not impossible though.

												I'd like to preface by saying this is a decent little survival horror game for the price (especially if you catch it on sale) and I do reccomend it, but there's come complaints and obsevations I do have:-No-one that worked on this thing as touched so much as a NERF gun, so we get awe-inspiring stupidity like a large revolver sharing ammo with a 9mm semi-auto and a double barrel shotgun with a pump-action, complete with ejection-port and mag-tube. Not to mention the ""light grenade""It streals all kinds of stuff from Resident Evil (not including the obvious part of being Survival Horror with a fixed camer and tank controls, of course)-Monsters born of evil experiments on a plant-One of the heroes looks like a young Leon S Kennedy-Rips off the save system, but with with CDs that can be used anywhere in place of Ink Ribbons.-Someone has noted skills in lock-pickingOn a techinal level, it had no graphics settings aside from changing reslution and expects you adjust the brightness on your actual screen. Runs smooth and looks good other than that, though.			"

However, if you're not like me and haven't played the second one before the first one, I'd recommend watching gameplay videos on Youtube if the trailer and screenshots the Steam Store has isn't enough for you to make a decision.Think Resident Evil mixed with Silent Hill but ...weaker quality.

												Pros: amazing atmosphere. Engaging plot. Cool concept and execution. Genuinely recreates a slasher flick feel. Decent co-op: player 1, say, picks a lock, player 2 covers his back, which is often necessary. Your AI partner will mostly do the smart thing. Great enemy design.Cons: clunky gameplay, the shooting is especially obnoxious. When the camera view shifts, so do your directional controls. Only 5 and a half hours long, and not much replayability. You can keep all 5 characters alive through the game, or run through with just 1, and it can be any of them: this means the unique ability(which are just ok) of each isn't necessary to win, which makes them feel every bit as interchangeable as they are.If it seems like you'll enjoy it, you probably will.

												""Obscure"" is a surprisingly good survival horror game in the vein of ""Resident Evil 1-2"". It is set in a college setting (a la ""Faculty"" or ""Suspiria""). You find and use objects, solve puzzles and battle monsters, just like in other games of the genre. There are mutliple characters, each with a particular skill and you're free to switch between them almost anytime (you can still finish the game if you lose a couple of main characters). An interesting feature is that you can have a human or AI-controlled sidekick (tha AI is quite good, it didn't cause me problems, unlike Daikatana and many other gaems). The story isn't groundbreaking, but not too bad and has some twists. The levels are varied and well-designed, you feel like you're actually exploring a monster-ridden high school. The monsters aren't too frightening or ineresting, however, except perhaps the final boss. The game is a little short (5-6 hours to finish on Normal), but an enjoyable and satisfying experience. It even has some cool extras (making of videos, new costumes and weapons after the first walkthrough, unlockable soundtrack etc.). Recommended.			"

What takes this game beyond it's father and mother games (Silent Hill series, Resident Evil, and Alone in the Dark series)This game has a very unique story line that twists and turns as you play through it, as any of the 5 characters in the game. Each character has a different skill set that helps you progress through different areas in a more player friendly style of way.  The setting is very cool, very eerie as you complete your mission at the school.  The game is scary,  its unique and different, It has a very good soundtrack and a simple but fun story line.  It does have replay value, a special edition version, which is a very cool basic directors cut version of the game.  They do have a sequal as well,  But by all means play Obscure before you play Obscure 2.    8/10			"

												Obscure (or ObsCure, if you're a weirdo and support terrible naming schemes), is a 2004 survival horror game that has impressively managed to live up to its name. It's brought to you by french developer Mighty Rocket Studio, formerly Hydravision Entertainment, it was ported to Windows at release and is now on Steam.It's important to note that this is a console game first. While the keyboard controls are functional, you're much better off using a controller. Seems to also recognize Dualshock controllers, which is nice. It's also not compatible with widescreen, but there's a simple patch for that.Obscure is a fantastic game that has been unfairly passed over by the annals of time. Both the art and sound direction are absolutely terrific. Leafmore High is dripping with the combination of gothic aesthetic and the engulfing crumminess of any public highschool. Stained urinals and vandalized desks go hand in hand with imposing stone structures and wrought iron gates. A gargoyle would not have been out of place on its crumbling frame.A soundtrack of grim orchestra and childlike choires provides the backdrop as you make like an American and shoot your way through this school. The gameplay is terrific - no tank controls and a generous run speed means you can actually evade, dodge and bait enemies instead of eating damage. There's an Alan Wake style mechanic of dispelling darkness from enemies with light - but unlike Alan Wake, it lowers defenses instead of being mandatory to hit them at all.They balanced out the fun gun and movement mechanics by having the melee be horrible. From wonky hitbox collision to indeterminate hitstun, to an absurdly long startup animation that's frequently interrupted - at no point during the game is melee ever in danger of being fun. Thankfully there's no a single situation where you're forced or expected to use melee during your first playthrough, so Hydravision probably knew this.But besides the fantastic art, gameplay, sound, and performing very well on any system, Obscure isn't perfect and there's a few key elements that prevent it from reaching heights, and might explain the terrible Metacritic score.The game is ""built around"" a (local only) co-op mechanic where a second player or the AI takes control of another classmate. There's a distinct problem with this - the AI is windowlicking stupid. Aside from refusing to perform several core mechanics, it will frequently run straight into damage, block your way and will attack once every 10 seconds. Thankfully you can just ditch it and play through the game solo - which is fun, viable and frankly easier with the scarce resources - but unless you know to do that it can significantly affect your experience. Every instance of the map ingame is clearly unfinished. There's a few rooms in every building (and one giant building that's just on the map) that you flat-out cannot enter, which is a major letdown and tease in any survival horror. I want to explore and strip a place clean, and I suspect the reason I cannot do that is that those rooms are not modeled and don't exist.Add to that, that the story doesn't make sense and isn't engaging on any level. The characters are interchangeable and don't matter - you have to be able to complete the game if any of them die. There's no character development, no memorable lines, the support NPCs aren't interesting and don't say much - it's a flimsy excuse to kill zombies and it shows. There's also some audio problems with dialogue cutting out, but the VA isn't even endearingly bad.Obscure is worth both your time and money, and is a brilliant survival horror whether you're a fan of the genre or just interested. Why it didn't do better than it has is anyone's guess, but even now it is not a game that will waste your time looking into it.			"

												Obscure is like a B horror movie, with all it's downsides and advantages, only that it's a game.The advantage a good B movie has is the ability to turn something really dumb and forced into an enjoyable experience. Obscure is doing this 100%, the plot isn't there to tell a story, the plot is there to force characters into situations where they must fight monsters. By the way, the characters are basic high-school teens and they have zero character outside the stereotypes you can see in any american show/movie whatever which features high school life. Hell, they don't even talk to each other outside the usual ""WE WERE WORRYING ABOUT U GUYZ"" or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ About the monsters, it's dumb, the concept of them being vulnerable to light is good, but the game has no explanation WHY ON EARTH ARE THEY VULNERABLE. Since the monsters (it's not a major spoiler, but it's a detail which isn't obvious, you decide)  aren't ""shadow"" creatures, they are mutated persons for ♥♥♥♥'s sake. Why mutation causes them to hate light? Whatever	.So now that we have the grasp of what kinda feel Obscure has when you think about it, we can move on to how it feels when you don't. Just like a B movie should feel, you can laugh on the logic bumps and ""weird"" execution or cringe on them. Mainly I was laughing, the whole game just screams ""don't take me seriously pls"". Outside of that the gameplay was actually fine. The fighting could be a little bit more complicated, outside of the final boss you're just lighting and shooting at random creatures. The best mechanic is that the game has perma death, if one of the five characters die it's not game over, the character just dies, no coming back, it adds to the feel that people usually DIE in horror themed stuff. There's also a part where you can basically kill one of your teammates by being an inattentive prick like me, that was super cool, I felt bad after that. Also, you can combine items. Maybe back then it was a huge thing (I don't think so) that you can combine items, but I feel like that's not a big deal, not that big at least as people emphasize that. Your options are limited as hell, no reason to pee your knickers just because you can tape a flashlight to a handgun or a shotgun. You can also play co-op, but I didn't really care about that, I like my horror alone. But if you want to pop a beer and laugh while you're participating in some B horror action then Obscure is probably one of the best games for that.I shouldn't like this, but I had fun while playing so I don't care.

												This is an underrated game, it’s gameplay is very similar to the classic resident evil formula which is always a good thing for me. The story is very obscure, I am the only person to make this joke. It’s very cheesy and over the top. The story is not necessarily good but it works for what the game is going for. Interesting characters and character development is non-existent, they are very by the numbers and the voice acting is pretty bad. You spend the whole game exploring a school which is the highlight of the game and it’s what makes the game. The level design and how you interact with it to progress is very well done as well as the layout of the school it feels like a real school.  I think this is a must play for anyone who is a fan of the first 3 resident evil games or even the silent hill games.7/10 (Good)			"

												When I first heard of ObsCure in it's making in 2003 I had high hopes for it. When I later got my hands on it and installed it I was blown away by how good the game was.It's based on the movie ""The Faculty"" wich has been a movie favorite off mine for along time. It borrows gameplay style from both the ""Resident Evil"" and the ""Silent Hill"" games, and throws in stuff on it's own. Like ""Co-op"" whit a friend. The only complain I have about the Co-op is that it's on only on the same screen.The story is nothing new, but it has alot of twists and turns that makes it interesting throw the whole game. The 5 playable charecters isen't developed much, but in their own way some of them is more usefull threw out the game.So if you are a fan of the old ""Resident Evil"" and ""Silent Hill"" should definety play this game!

												An underrated survival horror game from the ps2 era. It has good co-op, perma-death, and the ability to put flashlights on your guns. It doesn't hurt that it's inspired by my favorite movie of all time, The Faculty. It's a little cheesy in the plot department, but it has some seriously creepy enemies and enviroments. My only complaint about this version is that the licenced music from the ps2 version is absent here. I mean who doesn't want to hear Sum 41 during the radical basketball cinematic? 8/10			"

												one of my favorite series since jr high. i loved this game, it got the creepy atmosphere from silent hill, the unique horror style that not alot of game developer understand these days and an excuse for the story.most horror games these days focus on the jumpscares and that somebody is mentally insane or they lost a kid, but this game lets you play as 5 characters, searching for they'r friend who they left to play basket ball alil longer. but when they stay in school after the bell rings out, they start noticing how bizzar the school really is, all just cause they wanted to search for they'r friend who they had no idea where was, even if he were at the school. they soon get lockd in due to the janitor's closing shift and they'r stuck in there.the gameplay mechanic belongs back on a ps2 console and is REALLY reccomended to be playing with a controller, as you would just be using the keyboard and not the mouse. like i said, you can play as 5 diffrent characters and they all have ""unique"" skills. some are useless and some are good. oh, and somethign important? you character can DIE! and if he/she dies, you have to play as one of the other char from your teamparty, if you have any following you(1 at a time).if both of them die, the story continues as the others in the meating spot gets worried. to get back your items, you need to find you previous body and loot the corpes/bag. its an unique touch that you dont see too often.this game is alittle updated since i last playd it, i noticed they changed the intro music, and a few graphical things. but i havent got far enough to tell the other diffrents, but the co-op is new. its only local co-op and you would either need atleast 2 controllers or 1 keyboard and 1 controller... but its not recomended to play with the keyboard at all.this game is generally old, and judging it back then, it was a gem. atleast 8/10 because ps3 was still under development.focusing on nowadays, it would get 6/10 due to poor graphic, annoying controll system, linear path and wacky combat system. like i said, its recomended to play with a controller.. but the truth is, you cant really push high expectations on an old game, if they changed too much, it would ruin the original game itself. with that said, i can only give it a 7/10. it is a must play for silent hill and generally all original horror lovers. there are some few issues with the gameplay, but that is something you learn to play with. without any trouble.

												Do you remember Resident Evil? Do you remember the Resident Evil knock offs that followed in it's footsteps and oversaturated the survival horror genre to extinction? How about the teenage high school horror movies that came out around the same time? If you do, then you know what to expect with Obscure. It's exactly what you think it is, and it's a pretty funny nostalgia trip, too.  I won't say Obscure is “good”, but I'll recommend it anyway with a few stipulations. Firstly, coming in at the tail end of the tank control era allows it to be surprisingly playable by modern standards. The controller mapping is certainly strange; you hold LB/RB to bring up your inventory options and cycle through them with the right stick, holding the action button to bring up commands. It's unique to say the least, but once you get the hang of it it works functionally as well as any other control scheme I guess. You also can have a second character that's either controlled by the AI or by a second player. I didn't try it cooperatively, but the AI works very well for the most part. The second player is optional, but serious kudos for including that feature and making it work much better than the disaster I expected.  The story and setting is very generic; you control a half dozen high school students whose principal is hiding a dark secret and conducting genetic experiments on the student body in his mad scientist lab underneath the school yard. As stated: Resident Evil plus any '90s high school horror movie paints an accurate picture. It's all very small scale; the school and the underground tunnels make up the entirety of the environments you'll be exploring, and it's a short game that won't challenge you with brain teasers or difficult combat/resource management. In fact, I found trying to avoid enemies useless, and (on Normal, anyway) you seem required to pump bullets into every John Carpenter's The Thing enemy you come across to progress.  As copy-and-paste as Obscure is in design, there are a few noteworthy innovations that were well ahead of their time. The co-op is now a staple of modern survival horror games like the newer Resident Evils and Dead Space. Also, I thought the main combat mechanic of Alan Wake (shining a flashlight on darkness-covered monsters before you shot them) was a fresh concept... Obscure features this exact same loop and it came out five years prior. Sure, Alan Wake is a much better game, but Obscure should get credit where credit is due. Another fun tidbit: Until Dawn made a big hoopla about main characters dying but the story continuing without them. Obscure did it a decade earlier. You can swap between the six kids at will. They each have unique special abilities, and if they die they're gone. You then have to find the spot they died to collect any weapons they were carrying ala Dark Souls. Again, not saying Obscure is a great game, but much respect for being way ahead of the curve.  The main reason I came away from Obscure with a positive outlook is because it's hilariously bad. It's B-movie cheese at it's finest, with CGI cutscenes and stereotypical dialogue that's just too unintentionally funny to pass up. As far as survival horror games of it's ilk go it's not nearly as offensively archaic as most, so you're left with a short highlight reel of what makes those games so good/bad. With the right sense of humor and appreciation for the genre, Obscure is definitely worth a look for the stoner kid's lines alone.			"

												What can I say about Obscure? I felt like I was playing inside a 90's horror sitcom, and I absolutely had a blast. The characters are fun, the voice acting is goofy but awesome, the combat is resident evil-esque, and the overall atmosphere is great and enjoyable. This is so much better then the sequel, Obscure 2, that its a wonder how they went so wrong with number 2. Another cool aspect of this game is how each character has a unique ability that is required to access certain parts of the game. The story overall really makes zero sense, but this could basically be turned into a movie, and it would make bagoodles of cash as a horror film. It reminded me of the film, ""the faculty,"" from the 90's. Definitely reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys alan wake, resident evil, etc. Check out my playthough here:

												Short version:  Solid playstyle, AMAZING music, reminds me of original Resident Evil, but wasn't scary for me personally and the story isn't anything new. A fair 3/5: nothing bad, but nothing that you'd gush about to your friends either.Long version: Obscure draws a lot on the original Resident Evil games. Limited supplies, fixed camera angles (which I never had a problem with but other people hate), and puzzles that are for the most part very logical with only one emblem-style lock. There is also the partner system. In this game you play as part of a duo of characters, selected from a pool of 5. On a PC, I think you can play local coop but it requires player 2 to use a PC controller or somehow hook up a second keyboard. The different characters have different abilities which are all handy and none are essential enough that you feel bad for not taking them (though since Josh can tell you if there are any pickups left in a room, you may feel paranoid without him). When playing solo, you can switch which partner you control with the F key, and the AI is rather good about not being an idiot and I've never had a particular issue with it. Combat is solid with an excellent auto-lock system, just keep an eye on your ammo.The characters are drawn on basic high school stereotypes but none of it is as intolerable as some other reviews may make it appear. The voice acting and dialogue is both unimpressive but also lacking any memorable cheesiness along the lines of ""Master of Unlocking"" or ""Jill Sandwich"". Having said that, the voices may be bland but OH MY GOD THE MUSIC IS AMAZING! It's very good and a great mood-setter. "

												Obscure is a game about 5 high shcool students who get themselves into a ""sticky situation"". They find that while trying to find ther friend Kenny, that the Principal is conducting experiments on the students!REVIEWThe game looks alright for being made in 2004, the animations are all smooth, no lag, no issues here. The setting for the game is Leafmore High, the high school the kids attend along with some underground labs once you get halfway through the game. The environments look good, and shadows play a good part in the game, so you'll be using your flashlight a lot. The monsters are engulfed in darkness so you'll have to burn it off them with the flashlight.Be careful though, the flashlights battery can overheat. Now lets get to the good stuff... the dialouge. I'm not gonna lie, the dialouge in this game is actually o.k. It's the voice acting though that can get irritating. You can even sometimes hear a high pitched squeal whenever someones talking. The story is  very important to this game. You're gonna have to look everywhere and anywhere, if you're to find out the backstory, but none of this will be hard. Each of the main charcters have their own special ability. Josh has the ability to tell you if their's something left in the room to get. Shannon has the ability to tell you what to do or how to solve certain puzzles. Stan has the ability to pick locks, but all of the characters can do this, Stan just does it quicker. Ashley is skilled in combat and can double swing or double shoot a gun. Kenny who is the typical jock stereotype of the group, can sprint for at a high estimate 7 seconds before getting out of breath. I actually ran faster with Josh because he seems to take longer strides. The combat is ok but i had some recurring problems on certain bosses, you would have to stand at a certain angle and shoot, and i didnt figure this out till my 700th time through so i ended up wasting a lot of ammo. One thing i didn't like about the characters is that they all had their own personalities, which is fine! They just didnt seem emotionally attached to each other at all. For example, (SPOILERS) halfway though the game before we find Kenny, his sister Shannon dies, when we find Kenny, he doesnt ask abut where his sister is and nobody tells him! This is because anybody can die at any time, but there should still be some emotion!!! All in all i LOVED obscure, it just has some glaring issues that i couldnt overlook, i highly recommend this game.			"

												IV played them both on the PSP so its not a bad game but it is a tiny bit difrent on Xbox if you have played it on it. and it might even be diffrent on computer. such as small things like for starters if you play it on xbox you have a locked cabnet were a painting would be in order to get the fuses and on computer you just have the fuses laying on the floor. not sure if thats just the difficulty or a game thing. but id say its worth getting if your into old ps2 games.

 THIS REVIEW IS FOR A FULL GAMEPLAY, I PLAYED THE ENTIRE GAME WITH SEVERAL SITUATIONS WHERE I HAD TO RE-LOAD TO A POINT BECAUSE I KEPT MESSING UP. THE LONG VERSION IS AT THE BOTTOM	 TL;DR DRAFT	Great game, amazing story, difficult on every gamemode to give you a strategic and horrific gameplay.PROS-PS2 Nostalgia-Several jumpscares-Amazing story-Scarecity of ammo (Not to allow you to gang up on the game)-Allows you save where ever you want-Several characters to choose from-Each character has a slight ability to help-Wonderful boss battle and ending-Spooky scenery-Weapon situations (Like highbeam flashlight)-Everyone can dieCONS-Controls are a bit difficult to get used to-Partner AI is a bit wobbly -Could do a bit more on boss battle-No Online Co-Op-Your character sometimes doesn't aim where you want-Sometimes you roam a bit DETAILED DRAFT	   I must say, after beating this game, it was a wonderful gameplay to complete. Obscure is an old school game that looks like a combination of Silent Hill and the early forms of Resident Evil. Obscure allows you to select five players, only allowing you two to use at a time. I chose (Not being racist just forgot her name) the African American female (Who I will refer as Deja?), who's an expert at fighting, and Josh, the one who can tell if you've forgotten something. At first, I thought this was an online Co-op, making a friend buy it too so we could both play. After we found out it was local co-op, he refunded it and was stingy at me for a few days.    The game though, I chose the normal mode, was difficult on pretty much any mode. It took me exactly SIX HOURS to complete, and rewarded me with a special mode that gave you wonderful prizes that you'll enjoy. The prologue sets a creepy ambience to your gameplay, and sending chills when you must escape. I was pretty shocked at the end of the prologue, and thought that was the end of the character. About an hour of gameplay, I didn't know you had to save. I spent an hour of gameplay walking around the map. I ended up getting Deja killed. I found out there were no checkpoints, so I restarted, playing the prologue again and finding out that discs help you save.   After I found the discs, my gameplay began. I ended up at the courtyard and that's where things went wrong. I had no idea what to do and spent 20 minutes walking around. Before the 2 hour mark, I decided '♥♥♥♥ it' and quit and received a refund. About a week later, I found out OBSCURE and OBSCURE II were onsale for 5.07. I bought the game for 6.99 and I saw that as a steal. I bought both games, now seeing as I bought it again I should play it again.   Thankfully the game saved my progresses and I found out what to do. The variety of weapons in this game, the scarecity of ammo, the amount of monsters you must face, is exciting! Several times I had to conserve ammo, and sharing different guns with my partner proved to be a bit difficult. The story progressed and got darker as it went, which I loved. The partner AI though, seemed a bit disappointing, because she would attack so slowly and rarely. Several times I had to tell her to stay put while I finished off some important bosses.   At the end of the game, the boss seemed a bit easy, even on Normal, but it was a bit challenging for a two-stage fight. I loved the ending, it sent chills up my spine and I'm really considering playing the second one. This game was enjoyable and remembered me of my PS2 Nostalgia.			"

												this game is B-Horror,so dont expect much from itstory centers around 4 teenagers whos trying to find their friend in school.unfortunatly they find out that school was locked with them in.and then some kind of monsters apear and they find out that they can weaken them with light(so yeah,this game did whole ,,light weakens enemies thing'' first then Alan Wake)the thing i have little bit problem (not that i hate them or anything) with characters.today,theyre dated stereotypes of high school studentsfirst we have kenny-typical strong guy,who plays basketball (also he s the one youre trying to find)then we have ashley-Kennys girlfriend ,cheerleader and typical strong chicknext on our list is stan,who is basically more likable version of 2000s gangsta white guy that talk with fake accentnext is josh-nerd kid with camera......enough saidand last is shannon-smart,inteligent sister of Kenny who is basically daphne from scooby doo (to be fair,her personality gets better in sequel and she is the only likable character in sequel) one thing i really like is whenever your partner die,he never comes back,he dies and you cant do nothing about it.that means that you can finish the whole game only with 2 people out of 5.or hell maybe even with onenext thing what id like to praise is the soundtrack which really helps the atmosphere,which is also greatyou can see lot of influences from silent hil,resident evil and alone in the darklast thing i want to disscus are the controls.it has same controls as first three silent hills and theyre allright (i guess)verdict-game is decent horror game that little bit dated on todays standards,but its nothing major,so if you like silent hill -ish or resident evil-ish games this ones for you7,5/10			"

												This title harkens back to the days of Resident Evil and Silent Hill. While it borrows from several great franchises that came before it, there are still plenty of fresh ideas here. While the plot represents little more than a teenage horror flick, the game launches you into the action almost immediately and keeps you wondering when the next atrocious ugly will stake a claim on your life. There are no zombie hordes or hell demensions here either. This is a completely unique survival horror angle that makes from a refreshing experience despite being released nine years ago. As game mechanics go, having a group of hapless teens to choose from and freely swap between makes the game feel more dynamic and versatile. Furniture and small objects will shift and scatter when bumped into, making the environments feel more interactive despite the camera angles being fixed. You'll spend a fair amount of searching for clues and gathering supplies like in any true survival horror game too. Having originally released for xbox and ps2, this game was developed with controller support in mind. Attempting to navigate this title without one will add unnecessary challenge to the game. While this isn't a AAA title, fans of the pre-action/horror genre of games from the 90's will likely enjoy this. If you are expecting this to be another Resident Evil 4-6 or Deadspace 3 then look elsewhere. This is a fairly dated game that should be enjoyed with a fair amount of respect for when it was released. For such an excellent price, I highly recommend this piece of videogame history to any survival horror fan.			"

												Mixed feelings on this one. So overall a 5/10.It's a terrible racing game, but the more I play it, the more I realise that even though the track designs are terrible, and I still haven't found my way to the vehicles yet, the game is more about the journey than the race. It's a story about how five young people pull together in a high stress situation, and learn that together they can win.Many times I found myself wondering why I would need tape to compete effectively, but then I learned that the hallways leading to the track were dark, and I couldn't hold a flashlight by itself, so I could tape the flashlights to different things to light my way. That's just one of many examples of why this is an awful racing game.I recommend everyone buy this game, but don't buy it for the racing or you will be disappointed, buy it for what it really is, an epic convoluted journey to the racetrack with your best friends. And as long as all your friends are together, you know everything will be alright.			"

												As someone who plays a fair amount of horror games, I really wanted to give ObsCure the benefit of the doubt. And in many ways, it shines. Creature design is great, the underlying premise once you get past the ""disposable teens"" veneer isn't bad, and the variety of puzzles manages to keep things interesting while keeping in theme with the school campus setting. However, there are a lot of drawbacks to the game, to the point I'm not entirely sure why it receives such high praise.In general, ObsCure seems rather player unfriendly. The UI itself is pretty solid, with the relegation of menus to the shoulder buttons on a controller proving fairly intuitive. Ammo and healing item scarcity seems reasonable, for the most part, and while there are some tough enemies, you're usually well-equipped to take care of them. Emphasis on ""usually,"" which we'll get to shortly. However, the game seems to have overlooked something rather major in that there's no listing in the controls section as to how you can pass items and weapons on to your partner if you're playing single-player. I was several hours deep and frustrated by a long run of deaths before I finally found what button combination handed things over thanks to a FAQ, thus arming my second character with a second weapon in case their shotgun ran out.The item scarcity also became an issue when boss monsters entered the picture. Rather than giving you the chance to maybe stock up on a bit more ammunition or healing items than normal before a big fight, you're left to pray that you've hoarded enough and that your last save disc was used somewhere not too far back. If you get far enough in, this can be game-ending, as you end up with less than adequate firepower to survive. I got so frustrated with what I think is the 2/3 point of the game that I sacrificed two of the five students in combat, just to keep the ones I actually liked having around going.ObScure also gets cheaper and cheaper as the game wears on. The most egregious example I made it to occurs in the Dormitory area, late in the game, where hidden holes in a hallway floor result in instant death despite there presumably being a floor to land on, albeit with injury, beneath. This is the first instant death situation I can remember in the game, and it comes out of nowhere after everything else just smacked you really hard at worst. It just feels like a really unfair leap without any precedent. If it makes any difference, all of this was encountered on the Normal difficulty level.I'm tempted to give this another chance, maybe on Easy, just to see how the story resolves, but I don't recommend that anyone else suffer through it. Save yourself the frustration.			"

												i was really really enjoying this game - very old school (ie. resident evil) style - except for the f**king save game factor - you need to find discs to be able to save - got about 3/4 through the game without too many problems, but then had to repeat the same bits over and over again (a save disc wasn't where the walkthroughs said it would be at this point; and boy did i need one) - i don't have the time or the patience to keep doing the same actions in the hope that i'll make it through to find next disc - so ultimately i had to rage quit! sad, cause apart from the save game problem, it was enjoyable and creepy - hoping the 2nd obscure is better - most frustrating to spend so much time on a game only to find you have to give up due to such a frustrating save game problem - makes me appreciate the newer games much more !

												There is no point in a long review.  There are a number of bugs that prevent you from playing this game.  I'm not sure why they trigger or why they happen so often.  First off the 4:3 is pretty ♥♥♥♥ed up considering it had a fix for the original.  The problem with the game is some objects disappear or can't be interacted with.  For instance at the VERY beginning of the game theres a cell phone your suppose to pick up and talk into.  Well the damn thing disappeared.  I reset the game and there it was.  Second bug was almost immediately after the intro area.  Your suppose to break a glass window with your bat.  SWING SWING SWING SWING SWING, reset, swing break...this kept happening for window you were suppose to break.I had to get a refund.  It could have been because I was playing Co-OP, but that's one hell of a reason for a lot of bugs.DO NOT GET!			"

												In short, if you don't like Silent Hill you won't like this, and if you expect this to be any thing like Resident Evil you won't get what you expect.In greater detail:It isn't terrible but the overwhelmingly positive reviews convinced me to buy it and I don't think I even want to finish the game, so I'm ticking 'not recommended' and I'll explain why, although I would recommend it to some people.  I bought the game under the premise it was a rip-off of Resident Evil, and classic Resident Evil is my favourite stuff in the world, so I thought I'd give it a go.  It is hardly reminiscent of Resident Evil in any respect.  It feels cumbersome to me, almost like an unfinished game, but so do SIlent Hill 1, 2, and 3, and it reminds me a *lot* of Silent Hill.  But I don't have high hopes for the story, which is one of the most important things in a Silent Hill game.  So, If you adore Silent Hill give this a try.The differences between this and SIlent Hill are chiefly that of the teens you control any of them can die, which is interesting, the puzzles aren't as hard, and the inventory is real-time.

It sits like a watered down combonation of a mystery and a 3rd person hack and slash. It should have chosen one or the other. Could have been better with more monsters and more fighting, or less monsters with pop-out shock suprises, with tricky puzzles. Havent played Obscure 2 yet, but id skip Obscure 1.			"

												I hope you guys wanting this badly have played it before, because for those of you who haven't, let me tell ya my ""fun"" experience.  Oh wait, there was no fun in my experience.  First, NO MANUAL.  You're thrown into a game, with no manual to give you a heads up as to what is going on, there is a movie scene, and it just... stops. And your character is standing there, waiting for instructions from you. Yeah, that same you that doesn't have a clue about what is going on because there is no manual.  Turns out your supposed to get him to move. Great, I finally figure out how to get him to move. So he's walking around in circles. No popups telling you what buttons to mash or where to go, you just walk around in endless circles bumping into the door because hey, why not figure if you walk into the door you walk through it. With all the info you have to go on, that seems as good an idea as any.  Only he just walks into the door. Finally after 10 minutes of walking around and cussing, I happened to mash the A button on my controller while he was standing close to the basketball. ALL RIGHT!! That did something. A cut scene, where he shoots a foul shot, the ball lands on the floor, and.... back to square one. I figured maybe he had to make 3, or 5 or something foul shots in a row and that would ""start something"". Nope, after about 8 or 10, I stopped trying. Again, nothing popping up on the screen to help you and no manual.  So I walk over to one of the doors and mash the A button again and another cut scene, he opens the door, enters another room and a phone is ringing. I walk over to the phone, mash the A button, and another cut scene talking to his girlfriend. Great, I think, something is starting to happen.  Two door later, five miles of walking around later, and finally a couple of popups that finally helped a little later, I'm in this long corridor, with a flashlight taped to a gun, and something that you can't really make out (it just looks like black fog on my screen) is blocking your way and a popup comes up and says to shoot it. And which button to hold to aim. (Finally at least SOME help).  So I shoot the ""thing"". Six times. No more bullets. No help on how to reload, no help on whether you need extra ammo or if you just need to reload. Thinking I needed extra ammo, I spent another hour covering every inch of that long corrider and the room above where the gun was found in the first place and found no ammo, and pressed all the buttons on my controller trying to reload and after that hour, my last one, I wrote this.  For those of you who haven't played this, you've been fairly warned.			"

												I bought Obscure because I used to play it on the PS2 when I was younger. I saw that Steam's store had it and I bought it straight away. Obscure is a game about four teenagers who stay late after school one day to find their friend. Only to realize that their school faculty experiments with students, turning them into monster like creatures. Within this game, you will fight off all sorts of monsters and attempt at finding your friend. I would recommend Obscure for people who like thriller games but can also handle a bit of difficulty as this game can be intermediate for some people.			"

												So I recently started to play this game for a new LP series of mine and honestly, it blew me away. Voice acting and generally the cliche moments. Fun, jump scares and voice acting its, sorta good. Plus I felt alot of the names where tooken from a name of south park.

												This game is really enjoyable!!!! I've just finished my first playthrough and..... I am IMPRESSED. This is a great survival horror title. I've played Resident evil back in the day and have been a fan of this genre ever since. If you like games like RE1 you will definitley enjoy this game. This game has controller support too.I highly recommend playing this with headphones on and the lights off for a great evening of gaming. The sounds you hear in the distance while playing are chilling and you feel like you are really there with your charactors on screen. This makes for a really great immersive experience.Visuals are good too with cinematic scenes here and there, not much to say except they very well done overall fitting well with the abient sounds.The voice acting is good. Each character has different abilities so I need to play through more times to experience each character (so in my opinion replay value should be quite good.)The story works well for a title of its time and the gameplay is really good. The controls are fluid, giving you a real feel to moving around the enviroments.  I have played it on easy and I am now looking forward to the challenges that the harder difficulties bring.For all those survival horror fans out there, give it a go.  "

												Recommended for any fan of traditional fixed camera survival horror games.  The coop mechanic is an interesting idea, but I wish it had been used in a more interesting manner, such as coop puzzles that required both characters to complete different actions.  The voice acting and animations were actually pretty well done for a game this age and the controls are similar to any other survival horror game.  This is not the best survival horror game out there, but it tried a few new things and suceeded in most areas.  Except for being scary.  I do not remember jumping once.3.5/5			"

												A classic gem/nostalgic game if you played this game when you had the PS2! This game in my honest opinion is a must-have ecspecially if you want to relive the nostalgia or try a new survival horror game! I understand that this game is old but to me, I honestly don't care. The plot of this game is really interesting and it will keep you wondering what's going on and why is this happening. The setting of this game takes place at a high school. Then you got your high school students main characters you can definitely relate with. I also loved the atmosphere and music to this game! What i really like about this game is how smooth the camera motions/captures during exploration and the cut scenes! I definitely recommend this game if you're into survival horror games in an high school environment.			"

												A classic survival-horror title I first fell in (serious) like with on the PS2.  It's a definite forerunner to games like Until Dawn in that you play all of the characters at one point or another and which ones survive will depend on how you play.  There is no ""butterfly effect"" that will change the outcome(s).  Survival is based solely on how you evade or defeat the creatures that you are presented with.  Still, a solid old-school game for those of us who enjoy horror.  I always figured this would suffer a terrible film adaptation (I'm looking at you, Uwe Boll), but it never happened.  I also figured there'd be a TRUE third chapter to the series.  I won't mislead you by saying it's a ""must play"" title.  I will say that I found myself playing it every year or so on the PS2 and I plan to continue that tradition with Steam.			"

												Great survival horror game in the style of Silent Hill. You play as four teenagers searching for their missing friend in a school where something strange is going on. I really liked the game as there were many aspects from older games used in this genre and fun co-op i guess, even though it's only local co-op. Works pretty well to play on your own too. What i found mostly disturbing was the fact that the ai is not so good if you play on your own. It usually makes the character stand in the way or walk around even though you tell it to stand still.Pros+ Great atmosphere and music+ Puzzles are challenging but not impossible+ Characters with different abilities+ Enemy design is goodCons- Dumb ai			"

												This game is a pretty good throwback to old school survival horror. The game is pretty much the french version of resident evil. So expect some creepy opera music and sound effect. Story is pretty mysterious with some things you will probalby see coming. It's got a good feel and even some special things that bridge it from other suvival horror games. Character selection is fun as hell, you could roll with one character the whole game to make it a little more personal, or watch in desperation as the CPU gets itself killed. Speaking of such, if you're not cooping it up then expect to babysit, a lot. The CPU does good if you give them a gun and watch its ammo, but if they have a bat or such, expect to see them die. I beat the game in about five hours, I plan to beat it on hard and special mode before moving on to the second game. All in all it was a good game, wish they would have went with a more open story but its good how it is.			"

												Played this on the clunky Original Xbox before even thinking of looking for a PC version.GOG no longer had rights to sell the game, and I lucked out checking Steam.Workshop and mods would be nice for this game.Any help it can get to boost some graphics would be nice.Pretty dated game, but still loads of fun.The haunting school atmosphere still lingers in my mind and sets off disturbing imagery, every time I walk by a school or even just look at one.The music was one of the biggest highlights for me, that creepy choir that just saunters into the room.After replaying the intro to the game, I had to take a break, it was really late (early in the morning) and I didn't realize the game still had a major creep factor. I really didn't remember the shadowy beings being THAT nerve-racking to run away from.As Halloween gets closer, I'll be finishing this game off in time to do a movie marathon that consists of Silent Hill, House on Haunted Hill (1999) and The Faculty.

 Abridged review (personal insights below): + Offers a bit of a challenge, even on Normal mode.+ Brilliantly eerie atmosphere.+ A co-op system ahead of its time.+ Each playable character has his/her own unique passive and active abilities. That was a lot of fun to explore.+ A few unlockables, such as weapons and costumes, offer some replay value.- When playing solo, AI-controlled partners are more burdensome than helpful.- Enemy designs, while innovative, are way too few. There's only like 5 of them in the whole game,- The story may give the impression of being profound and convoluted, but it really is not.Recommendtation: For horror enthusiasts who have not played this game yet, it will be a fresh and invigorating experience, reminiscent of a time when ""survival horror"" actually meant something. However, don't expect anything revolutionary. I don't know how much the game cost, but it appears to have had a modest budget.----------------I first played an hour into the sequel of this game (Obscure: The Aftermath) back when it first came out 8 years ago, without knowing it had a predecessor. As soon as I found out, I stopped, and promised myself I'd play the original Obscure before delving into the sequel any further. I fulfilled that promised just now. Most of the game's shortcomings, few and far in between as they may be, can be attributed to the team's seemlingly low budget and humble technical capabilities at the time. Despite those handicaps, however, they managed to create a spectacular experience with what they'd got. Their ambitious approach to a Resident Evil / Silent Hill-esque experience is certainly unique and engaging. though not without flaws.For instance, Resident Evil 3 had me jump through hoops, retrace my steps, carefully calculate my ammo and herb usage just to gain some progress, which some frown upon, but I find to be vital survival horror elements. I this game, however, I rarely felt this. I always knew where I was supposed to go next, and what to do there. This gave the game an almost linear feel; consequently, I almost never felt scared or lost. But that's just me. The co-op system is thrilling, but having a partner when playing solo can be cumbersome; they tend to get in the way and you lose the true ending if they die, which they happen to be fond of doing quite often. If you're playing alone, I strongly recommend you command your partner to wait at the gathering point in the middle of the school, where they can be safe and not get in the way.The story appears to have only existed as a means to an end: to let you know why the school has gone to hell. There are no ""obscurities"" or profound revelations, nothing that really counts as a twist, and as soon as you pick up the first couple of newspaper clippings or files, you will most likely have figured out the whole conspiracy. As a storytelling enthusiast, I found that to be a bit of a letdown, since it had the potential to offer something far more grand.All in all, I savored every minute of this game and the aforementioned issues did not really get in the way of my enjoyment; I liked it with all of its flaws, just like I like Resident Evil's terrible voice acting.

												I played this with a friend back in the day on the Xbox as it was a good co-op horror game. You won’t find horror that creeps under your skin here, like you would in ""Fatal Frame 2""for example, but you will find a game with great and spooky atmosphere and a disturbing story.Summary:A group of students decide to investigate their high school after the disappearance of one of their friends.I recommend this because it what a coop horror game about unlike RE5 ""N"" 6.

												The graphics are obviously dated now, and it takes a few minutes to ""get into"" the game, especially the combat, but once you've acclimated it gels quite nicely. It's more or less a 3rd person ""survival"" game. You're scavenging, fighting and solving puzzles. Light is your friend. The game has a linear progression path, but the gameworld itself is mostly open, once you have found the respective keys. You can choose between 4 (later 5) characters, whereby you're always moving as a duo and you can also freely switch between the 2 you take with you. In theory every character has a special ability that make the game easier, practically you can just play as whoever you want. I stuck with my main character and the hot chick and had no problems. The AI companion is mostly useless anyway and at the very end even a burden, so I would not take one to the final boss, unless you want them to die and yes, there is perma death in this game. Every character can die. Luckily you can just load an older save to avert virtual perma death. Saving is done ONLY manually via CDs found in the game, so there is a limited number of saves you can have, but in the end I had over 10 saves left, so shouldn't be too much of a problem. Just remember that the game NEVER auto saves.The atmosphere is pretty good, still. Voice acting and story acting in general are terrible though. Well, it's a pretty old game after all. I also forgot how short it was. You can complete it easily in 4-5 hours. Buy during a deep sale. Worked flawlessly under Win 10 for me.			"

												This game is really great. I remember I used to watch my sister play it when I was younger. Then I got the ps2 version and completed it various times with all the characters alive. It's one of the best survival horrors I've ever played. The soundtrack is just perfect. The monster design is awesome. The atmosphere is really creepy, in fact this game still scares me today. The map design is also really good. And the graphics are very good. It was good back in ps2's times and they are still good today. I still have some hope for a third part in the series, but I guess we'll never get it...			"

												Personally i love this game. It takes me back to when i was a kid playing the original resident evil. Silly horror tropes, terrible voice acting, effective jump scares, asinine puzzle solving. Its all there. Only they got rid of the tank controls everyone hates. Is the story ""good""? Not really. But its serviceable. Is the gameplay ""good""? Not really.But its serviceable.  But you dont play old school horror games for either of those. Its about execution of atmosphere, which this game nails. Fully recommend if 90's horror is a thing you enjoy. If it isnt, this may not be for you. Everything is archaic at this point in time, considering how old the game is, the combat is as simple as it gets, and the puzzles are the basic ""find the key for this door by solving this puzzle that has something to do with that random note you found and probably didnt pay attention to"". These are actually the charms of these types of games, but they arent for everyone. Subjectively, i'd give this game an 8/10 Objectively, it'd get something around a 4/10. Theres a huge disparity between what a general modern gamer is looking for, and what specific kinds of people like. So if anything i've said sounds attractive to you, go for it and get both obscure games. You'll enjoy yourself. If your standards for gaming are a modern day triple A blockbuster, stay far, far away.  "
