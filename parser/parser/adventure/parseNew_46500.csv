												Oh man, this is a really nostalgic game for me.During my 12th birthday, my aunt came to visit me from Portugal and brought with her a couple of gifts, but one in particular was the 'special' gift for my birthday. At the time I had been bugging the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of my parents to buy me Battlefield 1942 and I was damn sure that that is what my 'special' gift was.I could barely sleep the night before knowing that Im going to be playing BF1942. The day comes and when I vehemently tore the wrapping paper apart, Battlefield 1942 was not to be seen. In its place I see 'Syberia'...What the f*** is this? Syberia?....by Benoit Sokal? ..Is this a book or something? She told me that she heard I liked computer games so she bought me that before coming to America. I thanked her but deep inside an unearthly rage started to boil. I didn't even play it for a couple days because of how disappointed I was.It wasn't until I had to stay home from school because of a really bad flu that I installed it and gave it a bash. The story, the animations, graphics, art, and theme instantly grabbed me. The sound design was the first thing I noticed when I became instantly immersed with the pattering of rain on the window pane and the soles of your shoes walking along hardwood floors of the inn. The puzzles arn't that complex but really solidify the theme of automatons and cogs and gears of machines. I'm currently playing through it again and its such a nostalgia trip which makes it hard to recommend since I already knew what I was getting into. However, I have no problems saying this is my favorite point and click and one of my favorite games of all time.Make yourself some tea, wrap yourself in a warm blanket and enjoy every moment of this atmospheric masterpiece.

Short version: 83%Syberia is a slow, melancholic adventure game, where the somewhat dreamy atmosphere and the large playable areas, combined the wonderful writing and charm, can easily enchant anyone.Long version:Clockworks and mammoths: interesting combination for any story. Thanks to Benoît Sokal though, Syberia managed to build a touching, emotional tale around this pairing, then wrapped it into a classic style point ‘n’ click adventure game.Like most stories about old people chasing their old dreams, it is quite melancholic, but never too sentimental. There are no boring tales from a bygone era. Quite the opposite: in this game, we control an energetic New York lawyer, Kate Walker, who involuntarily ends up in an adventure from the French Alps to the heart of Russia, chasing the long-lost heir of a toy factory, so he can sign some sales contracts. Along the way, we learn a lot about this mysterious person and his life, and also meet some odd, but strangely memorable characters.These people, like the whole setting, feel like as if they are stuck a century ago with their old clothes and the early 20th century buildings they live in. This anachronism works in the game’s favour, letting the player get immersed in the atmosphere and the slow-moving, yet great storyline.A warning though: when I said the story is slow, I meant it. If you want a game where there is always something going on, then Syberia won’t be for you. It is slow even for an adventure game. Not to mention that all main areas are built from several dozens of screens, of which many serve only transitional purposes. They help a lot with building a believable world, but they also wreak havoc with any kind of pacing.Still, Syberia offer a chance at a journey nobody will regret. Or, more precisely, the first leg of a memorable journey that is continued in the wonderful sequel… "

												Are you annoyed by Kate's slow pace?Do you want to smash your face against your monitor every time you have to go through a long distance twice, or thrice, because of some minor mistake?Are you interested in being able to admire the beautiful scenery without losing five minutes for no reason?Rejoice, there is a way to avoid all that!We are proud to present you the ""double click""!Double-clicking is for you!Double click the sh!t out of everything, make Kate run and enjoy this beautiful game.Brought to you by someone who discovered far too late in the game that Kate can run!-I love this game. It stood the test of time. I think I enjoyed it more than when I first played it back in 2005, but it might be because of that double-click thingie.			"

												A game that is truly worth checking out, even if you are not a fan of Point & Click Adventure games (and for those who are - this is one of the greatest games of its kind). It has an intriguing story and truly memorable characters. The puzzles are done, usually, in a pretty clever way and even if you get stuck on some of them, the curiosity of finding out what happens further keeps you going and trying to solve those puzzles. This game is one of the greatest games I have played ( and I am not a Point & Click Adventure game fan) and its price here, on steam, is absolutely worth it, especially on a sale - do not miss your chance to get this on a sale. I imagine that most people would find this game as great as I did.			"

												For those of you point and click adventure fans look no further. Syberia has everything that makes for a great adventure game. The puzzles, though soetimes simple, are engaging, the backgrounds breathtaking and the story is full of discovery and wonder. There are a few cons to mention though. the voice acting, while mostly good, can soetimes fall flat and the speed Kate (the main character) moves around is sluggish which can be very annoying while backtracking. With the negative marks asside, Syberia is a stunning journey and an adventure game that stands its ground next to classics such as MYST and The Longest Journey.Note: There are a few graphic hiccups when running on windows 7 but nothing game breaking			"

												I give a great recommendations to both Syberia games (as one story), for people looking for good and original videogame stories.I played the games just recently, and was impressed by their original and well made settings. Good mixture of steampunk, naive fantasy and dream, and old fashioned road movie-adventure.The story in the games are about characters and their dreams, not about some complicated twists, violence, or conspiracies. Very touching stuff. Great example of a videogame story, that can be catchy and compelling, while having no violence whatsoever!Yet, there is some rather big technical annoyances in the games. The biggest being the movement animations of the main character...she is just so damn slow! For that reason, I recommend the games just to be played with a walkthrough next to you, to be used whenever you are uncertain what to do next. The puzzles arent that hard, but the walking speed of the char is really that irritating, that you dont want to waste your time watching her crawl from area and back while solving the puzzles. ^^All bad things said; story, characters, atmosphere and music make these 2 games a memorable experience, even 10+ years after their initial release.

												Steampunk style point-and-click with really nice graphics (just remember it was made in 2002) and fantastic voice acting (one of best I've ever heard in an adventure game).Village mysteries, steampunk factories, amazing airships and intricate automatons - all this explored by young New York lawyer, Kate Walker.""Syberia"" has some shortcomings, namely some annoying unskippable animations (like stair or ladder climbing) and it is quite linear, but the story is so great I would definitely recommend it anyway!GRAPHICS: 8/10AUDIO: 9/10GAMEPLAY: 7/10STORY: 10/10			"

												If you're in the right mindset for it, and comfortable with a game with a slow pace, (I admit, Kate did a LOT of running as I played through this), this is a charming, poignant few hours spent, with a lovely soundtrack - well worth the .99 I paid for it on sale. Despite Syberia's age, it's carried along by a intriguing storyline, creative puzzles and a sensitive, nuanced potrayal of the death of one age, as another takes hold.  The tale weaves several themes into its fabric, touching upon everything from the tumultuous changes throughout 20th century Europe to the march of time and technology, the increasing pace of life, what matters, what captures us, and in the end, what truly defines us.For negatives, I don't have many other than noticing a few deviations between script and text, as well as a curious bits where accent/native tounge of the character was completely at odds with the words that were actually being spoken. Not a big deal, and easy enough to overlook.To add: I didn't have technical issues with the game myself, other than the odd graphic bug, and then only when alt-tabbed; easily removed when clicking thru to the next screen.

												Syberia features an interesting and compelling storyline created by Benoit Sokel who created one of Europe's top-selling adventure games called Amerzone. He manages to create a believable steampunk-esq world of automatons and clockwork mechanisms against a backdrop of the real world. When this story is combined with the game's utterly beautiful environments and wonderfully haunting music, it has the ability to take you into another world. The animations are also worth a mention being very fluid and life-like. The animators' attention to detail is very clear to see. I did have a few minor annoyances such as pixel hunting, the voice acting, while being decent enough, wasn't that great all round and the French to English translation wasn't quite 100%, but they are not enough to detract from what is an otherwise excellent point and click adventure. If you are a fan of point and click adventures then look no further. Syberia is a very fine and tremendously enoyable adventure game.			"

												One of my most favourite games of all genres. Interesting story that switches from sad to funny to hopefully and back, a (female!) main character that evolves during the course of the game. The puzzles are rather on the easy side but mostly because they're logical and actually part of the story. It could have been longer... but that's what Syberia 2 is for. ;) 9/10			"

												People seem to love this game and I can partly see why. As a widely recommended title of my favourite genre, it's full of original ideas, beautiful artwork and the opening scene made me feel like I was in for a real treat. The music's nice too. Looking through the Steam reviews you're hard pushed to find a bad one. Unfortunately, as much as I kept trying to love this game, it really didn't work for me.Sadly, my defining memory of this game won't be the ever-increasing innovation of Hans Voralberg's automatons or the sheer time and effort spent on complimenting the plot via newspaper clippings, diary entries and so on. Instead, I'll remember the tedious and seemingly endless running back and forth involved EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. And I should point out that I mean the word 'step' quite literally.I'm not sure exactly what happened to Kate Walker in the days or weeks preceding the game that makes climbing stairs such a challenge for her but as she slowly and deliberately positions herself at the bottom of even the smallest flight, before beginning her tortuous ascent, you can't help but try and solve the only truly baffling puzzle of the whole adventure - If a woman walking up some stairs is so disruptive to the game's engine then WHY PUT STAIRS IN EVERY FRAME?!Solving a puzzle invariably involves walking back and forth through a bunch of frames multiple times in what felt to me like a shameless attempt to make the game feel as though it contains more gameplay than it really does. Don't get me wrong, I've played many point and click games in my time and know that running back and forth between frames to solve puzzles is a characteristic almost all share, but usually this is a case of necessity rather than choice and developers usually try to make it as painless as possible. In Syberia, the designers seem to have brainstormed on the question 'How can we make this game seem longer than it is?' and come up with only one solution; 'Drag every puzzle out as long as is humanly possible until finding the solution is more of a relief than a reward'.My primary frustrations with this game are as follows:- In some scenes you can double-click to make Kate run. In others, for some unknown reason, you can't. This gets quite annoying.- Unneccesary and, more importantly, unskippable animations precede interactions with NPC's, which makes returning to someone you've already spoken to for a quick recap a painfully slow process. The same goes for interacting with objects.- It's impossible to skip to the next frame with a double-click, a simple feature which would have multiplied my enjoyment of the game ten-fold.- It takes a long time for NPC's to say anything that might be of value in some of the most wooden dialogue I've ever witnessed in a point and click game.In short, it takes AGES to do ANYTHING. A simple puzzle that requires little thought and would be solved in seconds in better designed games (ANY Lucasarts title for example) ends up taking minutes to complete which really adds up over the course of the adventure.This review may seem harsh but I feel that the reviews on Steam are so unfairly one-sided that a counteracting review is necessary to warn people that the slow, tedious gameplay mentioned in some of the other reviews as a potential downfall really IS enough to ruin the entire experience.Sorry, Syberia. There were so many times when you were so close to being a great, original game but you screwed up at every opportunity by disregarding the one thing that all great games have in common: The continued engagement of the player.If you consider yourself to be a particularly patient person who doesn't mind spending a five minutes running for every minor hunch that you have then buy this game and enjoy the good things about it. As for me, despite having bought both Syberia 1 & 2 together, I won't be playing the second one until I've finished watching all of my paint dry. At least I can do that without using any stairs.			"

												Syberia has a great story and atmosphere which will capture your attention. What will detract your attention is the poor voice acting from Americans attempting to be Eastern Europeans. Never in my life have I heard such distinct New York accents pass off as what I presume to be Russian, but the accents weren't Russian at all, just American.Anyway, you play as Kate Walker, a lawyer sent in from NYC to some European town to secure a buy-out from a toy factory. Problem is, one of the heirs of the owning family is still alive so Kate Walker has to journey in this strange land of robot-like manufacturing (Automatons) and find Hans Voralburg. There's a mystery surrounding this man as he was presumed dead many years ago. And on your way to meet Hans, you discover secrets, make friends with a robot (Automaton) named Oscar and ride an awesome train.The game is a point and click adventure, so don't expect any difficulty besides using logic and common sense when grabbing clues to progress and make machines work; I guess they could be called puzzles. I have to say that the graphics are mostly impressive; I wish the resolution could be changed from....I think it was 800x600. The only other thing that bothered me with the graphics was Kate Walker's running animation. It's obviosly a cycle, but her head bobs extensively from side to side instead of bobbing up and down slightly; being an animator myself I found that was just a bit annoying. I also didn't like the subplot of getting cell phone calls every now and then from Kate's fiance and mother and employer. The dialog from them was frustratingly bad and the whole thing with them felt unnecessary.Overall, pretty good game. 8/10			"

My Personal Score: 2.5/5PCGamingWiki Page[pcgamingwiki.com]Issues: barebones graphics options and lacking PC-exclusive features. Uses pre-rendered backgrounds made at 800x600 resolution. Susceptible to graphics bugs, especially when alt+tabbing out of the game then back again.DLC: None.Microtransactions: None.Syberia is an amazing adventure game, and one that you should play if you're a fan of the genre. I picked this up on sale for $3, and I have to say that this game is worth more than that; my 19 hours spent playing it had been one of the best experiences that I've had in gaming. The story is great, and it really caught my attention from the beginning, keeping me glued to my seat just to see what happens next. There's an absolute charm to be found in Syberia, and the attention to detail in regards to the cast's dialogue and personalities made the game stand out.The story follows Kate Walker: an American lawyer who was sent by her firm to the French town of Valadilene to settle a huge deal. She was tasked with obtaining the signature of one Anna Voralberg in order to complete an American company's takeover of the once renowned Voralberg factory: makers of world-class automatons. The problem is, Anna Voralberg has been dead for a couple of days before Kate arrived and she is now forced to stay and find a supposed heir, leading her to a quest to find a man known as Hans Voralberg.Syberia is quite simple in terms of gameplay. It's your standard point-and-click with puzzle solving and detective elements; it has nothing groundbreaking to offer and its main draw lies in its simplicity. Unlike its peers, the game is pretty straightforward, and you won't get lost and have problems on where to go next or what puzzles to solve, despite having some very expansive areas. Difficulty-wise, the puzzles range from mundane to having the right amount of challenge, and since the game incorporates elements of steampunk, expect some weird and cooky contraptions to tinker with. The protagonist even has a satellite phone which she uses a number of times to talk to her relatives back home, and gain information that she couldn't access in a remote place. The phone is her only link to the outside world and it's interesting to see that she uses it less and less as the player progresses, since she becomes more independent and more curious. Throughout the levels, there are optional documents which can be discovered, that provide detailed insights on the world and its inhabitants. Some contain clues on how puzzles can be solved and most of them are just great reads that flesh out the story. My only gripe with the game is that backtracking is so excessive. Puzzles that could have been solved by player intuition is held back by dialogue checks and the need to show puzzle pieces bit by bit because of story reasons. There's even a section in the game where you have to go back and forth between two characters that are a minute away - in real time - from each other for at least 3 times, because one is too secretive and you have to persuade the other to spill the beans. Just a minor gripe and you'll get used to it somehow, but I hope that I'll never tread the same path again in the sequel.And there you have it.			"

Posted: January 16, 2015
												I was about to write a review then I remembered I alredy did. Back in 2002. So here it is, unedited:Games such as this one bring smile to my face. Why? Because I was initially an adventure game player and the last few years have been quite bad for this genre. Ever since Sierra and LucasArts stopped their production of adventures and turned over to the more profitable games, a few developers have even tried to do something. The only true masterpiece that I can think of at the moment is Funcom’s The Longest Journey, while Dreamcatcher’s creations were far from what we really need (still, my congratulations to Dreamcatcher for even trying where others don’t bother at all!). I doubt the situation will get any better soon, but Syberia might prove that there’s a lot that adventures can provide, especially to young gamers.In this 3rd person adventure you play a role of Kate Walker, a young lawyer from New York who was sent to Valadilene, a little town in France to complete the deal of purchasing a local toy factory for a huge multinational company. Unfortunately, the owner of the factory Anna Voralberg has just passed away and her only heir, her brother Hans is nowhere to be found. This is where your adventure begins.The story might not sound like it’s anything special, but it’s actually amazing! As you do your research to find Hans, you will discover a lot about the Voralberg family, their toy factory and Hans’ maniacal obsession with automatons and mammoths. You will even meet a few automatons made by Hans, robots with their own character! Your journey will also take you to the weird university in Barrockstadt in Germany where you’ll meet more weird people, then to Russian mining city ruled by a lunatic and so on. Everywhere you go you will get into a bit abnormal situations but you’ll get used to it.Unfortunately, most of the puzzles are rather easy and each problem can be solved in a real short time. Still, since there are many locations and a lot of puzzles you won’t notice this often. I got stuck in only two occasions and both times it really was my fault – once I had to use a cell phone and the other time I just didn’t see the closet that contained two important items. Also, there is no item combination at all, making everything a lot easier as well.Now I must mention the visuals of Syberia. The graphics are simply amazing! It’s obvious that a lot of effort was put into the visual side of this great game. A few screens of the game exist only to show the beautiful scenery such as the side view of the Barrockstadt University or the resort hotel in Russia. The same applies to the sound as the game features some fine, classical tunes specific to the region in which you are at the moment. I especially liked the music in Russia, which sounded a lot like the old Soviet anthem. The complete game is voice covered and the voice acting is probably the best I’ve heard lately!Overall, Syberia may be a bit easy for the experienced players but it’s a true masterpiece in the genre. I was delighted to see normal controls unlike in a lot of similar games that I had a chance to play in the last 15 months or so. It’s all point&click, like in good old times. Syberia is a well-made game, with an intriguing story and even a little soap opera that goes on over Kate’s cell phone. I can’t give it a score larger than 82% due to easy puzzles, but … good work by Microids, I am hoping to see more of their work soon!Plus: Magnificent graphics and sound, intriguing story, easy controls.Minus: Easy puzzles, some pixel hunting.

												Well, the game is extraordinary with what it was supposed to be.You see back then in 2002 that the game published , things were different.All the adventures were pretty tough and their graphics indie.Syberia and The Longest Journey changed that rule, with the latest tohave stronger riddles.The game is fully 3D designed and full cinematic. Only the resolution islow because of the graphics and computer design of 2002. Even if you hada good or normal graphic card you would run the game great but still thereyou listened many cases to have Riva TNT or Voodoo and such graphic cards.Benoit Sokal wanted to distribute a game that everyone could run withoutcaring for hardware and so even you had a better graphic card you didn'thave the option for better graphics. Anyway...The voices and sounds are great. As I said the game is full cinematic.And now for the second part, a game for the people and NOT the hard coregamers.The riddles are not just easy. They are obvious. The game totallywants you to follow the story through interaction to say. Still, it's an adventure.And the triumph of Sokal can show that. Syberia is a game that every new gamershould play. Like a guide to adventures games. In case that something is obviousto happen and doesn't change scene and come back or save,quit and reload thegame. Bugs happen in every adventure game preventing you from continue.Here you have to do with an older title so be calm.The landscapes you'll see in the game and the way of their design is unique.It's North Europe style but like real. ONLY if better resolutions were supported and I 'll had screenshots for wallpapers.The story on the other hand is fantastic. It's between reality and uncertainty.What if the original mechanical clockwork mechanisms were so sharp and so goodwith views to construct and compete the today technology in such a way to makethe travel to moon reality. Don't forget that the older computer is supposed to begreek and that it could compute sharp the thesis of all the stars for the navy(maybesomething else but nobody will say) and is the  Antikythera Mechanism [en.wikipedia.org]made between 150 to 100 BC and it's clockwork mechanism too.A true masterpiece game. Microids should really think of a remake in my opinion!			"

												There's nothing I love more in a game than a good story, and oh boy did Syberia deliver.I don't often play point-and-click games like Syberia since I usually get bored pretty quickly due to the lack of action, but I got it in a Humble Bundle and decided it was worth a try.This game has everything you want from an adventure game: Interesting, intriguing characters, an exceptional story worthy of a bestselling novel, beautiful landscapes with their own unique style which have stood the test of time considering the game was made in 2005, beautiful music although i would have liked more of it, (maybe have music specific for when you make progress in the story and then different background music in case Benoit Sokal ever sees this) and interesting, fun puzzles which require a certain amount of exploration and attention to detail in order to find and assemble the pieces.The puzzles can at times seem tedious as there is a lot of running back and forth, but that didn't bother me the slightest and was definitely compensated by everything else in the game.10/10 in my books, certainly one of the best story games I have ever played.

												I reccomend it only for those who enjoy point-and-click adventure games, and whom have alot of patience. Honestly, I feel that I could have never played it and I would not have missed out, but I enjoyed it enough to reccomend it. First off, if you have no patience, a walkthrough will be helpful.Second, if you are patient, the walkthrough will still be helpful.Really, the main attraction of Syberia (and Syberia 2) is the story and environments, the puzzles are basically an annoying obsticle to that. On that note, the story is interesting and the environments imaginative, inspring, and beautiful. What more can be said?You want more game after the game is over? You want to accompany Kate Walker on her mad journey? Then get Syberia 2, which is just more of the same.			"

												Syberia is a really cool game if you like adventure-games / point to click-games. It's about this girl called Kate Walker who is on a simple quick business trip but then it ends up being an entire adventure and big change in her life + a challenge of her strength. If you like adventure-games then this is surely a game for you! Not to mention all the lectures and crazy sideeffects.Ps. MAMMOTHS!			"

Disclaimer: The review is about OS X version of Syberia's Steam edition. The original Syberia is one of my favourite games and one of the best point and click games I ever played (11/10).I was delighted when Syberia was published on Steam with OS X port. I bought it, but not downloaded at once. But when I finally did it, I was shocked after pressing ""Play"" button. The original, beautiful menu was completely crushed with Comic Sans (I'm not kidding) and by changing background from solid assets to animation of Valadilene's factory. It looks like crap, really. But it's not all - i played it for 10 seconds and quit the game, when I saw... hints. Without option to disable them. The in-game interface is also changed; dialogues are viewed in some awful ""windowy"" thing, and the inventory window is the original one, but streched like hell. Besides - there's no Polish interface; I even changed Steam's main language. That's not a problem for me to understand it in English, but I am very sentimental about Syberia's polish localization. This release of Syberia is a total disgrace for the original one. No Polish language is probably a disadvantage only for me, but ruined interface and hints will break the game for every Syberia fan. My advice? Go to GOG's store and buy original Syberia release there. There's no OS X version, but you get original release of the game, not this mumbo-jumbo ""HD"" turbo Comic Sans remix. It wasn't even mentioned on the Steam page of the game that it is ""remastered"". Don't waste money on that one. It's not worth a single penny.			"

												One of the best adventures I've ever played! Even though the game has a somewhat slow progression, it has an interesting story that can hold your attention and makes you wonder what will happen next.The characters are very interesting and have a great dubbing. The game is very well done with beautiful pre-rendered scenarios, although at low resolution due to being an old game. Although they are very detailed, there is little interactivity, limited to objects and places related to puzzles. The soundtrack is also great.The puzzles (simple and sometimes makes little sense), can be a bit difficult to solve for some people as there are no direct explanation or tips on how to solve them (feature that hardcore players will love!).If you are a fan of adventures, this game is a must-have in your collection (including its sequence Syberia 2)!9,5/10Análise em português:Um dos melhores 'adventures' que já joguei! Possui uma história interessante que consegue prender sua atenção e o faz querer saber o que irá acontecer a seguir, mesmo o game tendo uma progressão um pouco lenta. Os personagens são bem interessantes e possuem uma ótima dublagem. O game possui belíssimos cenários pré-renderizados, que, apesar de serem em baixa resolução, devido a ser um game antigo, são muito bem feitos. Apesar de serem detalhados, há pouca interatividade, se limitando a objetos e pontos relacionados com os puzzles. A trilha sonora é também muito boa.Os puzzles, apesar de simples e algumas vezes fazerem pouco sentido, podem ser um pouco difíceis de resolver para alguns, por não haver uma explicação direta ou dicas de como resolvê-los (característica que jogadores mais hardcore vão adorar!). Se for fã de 'adventures' este é um game que não pode faltar na sua coleção (inclusive sua sequência Syberia 2)!9,5/10			"

Travel with Kate and uncover the missing people and parts to the story, solve puzzles in this steampunk world and ride the train to finish up this Fantastic Adventure in Syberia.I played this on Xbox in 2002 and again when it was released on Steam. then I replayed Syberia II. The Rumor is that Syberia III is coming out this year.... I will play entire trilogy in order if this be true.Smile  : )			"

												A surprisingly good point and click adventure game. The puzzles are clever but I was never stuck with any of them. Which is a big plus because I always feel defeated when having to use a walkthrough. The pre-rendered backgrounds are beautiful and have a very nice style to them. The atmosphere of the entire game was always very ""mysterious"" to me. Voice acting is pretty good as well! With skippable dialog in case you are in a hurry. To get the game running in 4:3 aspect ratioI first had trouble getting the game to launch with the old school 4:3 aspect ratio. Back in 2002 widescreens weren't mainstream. I have an Nvidia card. 1)Set your resolution to 1920x1080 if you have a 2560x1440 or higher monitor.2)Go to the Nvidia control panel3)Click on Adjust desktop size and position4)The scaling tab --> scaling mode --> select ""Aspect ratio""5)Perform scaling on --> Select GPU6)Resolution --> 1024x768This worked for me getting it to run full screen but in proper 4:3 aspect ratioPros-Great story-Very immersive. Found myself not wanting to stop playing.-Great scenery and pre-rendered backgrounds-Puzzles are clever but not crazy hard-Dialog and voice acting are great-Skippable dialog if neededCons-Minor complaint of fiddling with video card settings in order to actually launch the game-Animations of walking up stairs, etc can be painfully slow at times. But that's a minor gripe.-Game ends somewhat abruptly. It caught me off guard. Syberia is a really great game and I would recommend it to anyone. I would grab it if it's on sale. $10 regular price is a little steep. 8/10  Very good			"

												Syberia is a classic point and click quest. This game did not brought anything new to genre, there is no challenging puzzles, but still, this is one of the best games in this niche.Kate Walker, a young lawyer from the United States, arrives in tiny european town to sign a contract with owners of old toy factory. At first this journey looks like a routine job, but it quickly turns into long, difficult and amazingly interesting adventure.Game is very beautiful. Art style is fantastic, every screen is well created with a lot of attention for small details. Also, there is excellent, slightly melancholic soundtrack, that fits perfectly for the mood of the game.Storyline is well designed, characters are charismatic and it was especially interesting for me to observe how gradually changes the personality of Kate Walker. With time she realizes that money and career is not the most important thing in life, there is something else... something important and special. From my point of view, Kate Walker is attractive and interesting character, she got true individuality. Ending of the first part is one of the most touching scenes i had ever seen in games. I took a tissue.Puzzles are logical, they fit well in the story, i did not noticed anything annoying or non-logical. Puzzles are interesting enough but not difficult or challenging and maybe it is for the best, so they do not distract player from the story.Can i give a little criticism to this game? Well... i did not like the animation of characters. Kate Walker looks good enough, but other characters move as dummies. It looks especially ugly if compare animation of characters with stunningly beautiful suroundings.Sometimes there is a little too much of old cliche. Crossing the border between Europe and Russia looks like expedition into depths of Mordor. And when it comes for Russia there is always ""slums, bums and drunkards"" and other ""winter-vodka-bear"" stuff. Well......nevermind, i just can not criticise this game. Syberia had touched my soul.I played a lot of games and i can say this words for only few of them: this is masterpiece. Strongly recommended.			"

												С этой игрой я познакомился в далёком детстве. Когда мне было 9 лет,старшая сестра предложила мне поиграть в какую-то странную игру.Она включила мне ""Syberia"" на ещё стареньком даже для того времени компьютере.Я начал нажимать на все возможные клавиши на клавиатуре,но ничего не происходило,тогда я задал себе вопросы:"" Как управлять персонажем? В чём же смысл игры?""  Немного поиграв,я заинтересовался этой игрой и не хотелось отвлекаться. Одно из самых замечательных плюсов в этой игре - это сюжет. Сюжет просто великолепен- в нём есть загадочные герои,а также запутанная история,которую хочется прожить не отрывая глаз от монитора.  Вобщем я советую поиграть в эту игру тем,кому важен сюжет,а не графика!!!			"

												Just.. Wow.Really Really REALLY Enjoyed this game, To me the gameplay & long rows of story/text & Dialogue, Reminded strongly of 'The Longest Journey', And the ""Graphics"" of the scenery reeks of Final Fantasy 7 (Original).The ""Puzzle"" stuff was straightforward, Nothing weird like ""Glue a frog to a stick to reach the other side of a river"" sort of thing.The story is really good, And the game is relaxing. Only one bad thing about it is .. well.. I HATE STAIRS!, And you will too, After playing this.There is just one resolution setting tho, But i'm not bothred by it. It's an fairly old game, And it is expected. (Mind, Tabing out of the game might cause it to glitch-up, So always save before tabbing out. The steam-overlay works just fine. Sure a chatbox takes up the whole screen, But it's whatever.10/10 in my opinion (if you forget about the thing about the stairs).			"

												Syberia is a great little point and click game with the added charm of having a detailed and full storyline of missing persons and automitons. The graphics are quaint and well designed, you feel through the background, the music and the character interactions (if at times a little 'forced') the atmosphere of the places you visit in the game and the sense of a growing adventure as you unfold the mystery of Anna and her brother Hans. Lots of movevment, though sometimes very linear - the game is nicely paced and the story is enriched enough to the keep the simpler parts of the game engaging.Set 50 years after WW2, in a sleepy town that reminds one of Russia, You play a Lawyer from New York sent to finalise a contact on the purchase of an old mechanical factory. The mystery unfolds and takes you further and further towards Syberia. Lovely game, 8/10			"

												This game is a terrific dose of decent point and click style with a compelling story, good voice acting, and very pretty landscapes.In its time, the graphics were solid and the gameplay manageable. Nowadays it looks and feels dated. That being said, if you have an opportunity and like point and click adventure games then definitely carve out some time for this one.This game, unfortunately, falls short in a few key areas. The writing is weak, the characters are not terribly complex, and it is rife with clumsy dialogue. Our hero, Kate Walker, is pushed around by an uncaring boss with unrealistic expectations, a fiancé who is the biggest jerk in the whole world who cares absolutely nothing for the needs of Kate and her own ambitions in life, and a ""best friend"" who thinks she should just stop all this 'having a job' stuff and get back to being a 'good wife' to Dan the previously mentioned fiancé.The interactions with these shallow one dimensional characters is punctuated by phone calls in which the writers try to draw out a character arc with Kate that literally has one of them saying, ""Wow Kate, you've changed so much in the past few days."" Perhaps this passed for decent writing in the past, but nowadays it just seems rough and juvenile as if the writers had no idea how to write a strong female character.There are moments in which I found myself rooting on Kate as she told off Dan, solved puzzles, and bested the very jerks she had been placed in this world with but all in all I began to dread the phone calls, the interactions and the conversations with other characters. The puzzles were the biggest relief from that.Unfortunately some of the puzzles suffered from hints that were too vague and ground the game to a standstill without referring to a walkthrough. Thankfully these were few and far between and in general the game had fantastic puzzles that were challenging and intuitive while being fulfilling.Ultimately, this game does what point and click adventure games do well: provide a story to generate a plot driven reason to solve puzzles. I just wish the story weren't so aggravating, the characters so thin, and the conversations so utterly long winded.Overall 6/10			"

Syberia reviewThe Good: Breathtaking graphics and music, enriching storyline.The Bad: Quality of voice acting varies greatly.I've never played a game quite like Syberia before. It is an adventure in the most traditional of fashions but yet at the same time it is very unique.This game is all about the story. Story and character. You play as Kate Walker, a lawyer dispatched from New York to the strange, automaton filled Alpine village of Valadeline. You are there to settle an inheritance matter on behalf of your firm involving the Voralberg family. Sounds like a simple premise for an adventure game doesn't it? And it is. The story unfolds at a decidedly slow pace. It takes its time and doesn't rush. It crafts this otherwise simple story into a richly detailed experience. In fact, the story is so elegantly and subtly told that you feel as though you are reading poetry or being sung a sonnet that has been transformed into a game.An area of the game that goes hand in hand with storytelling is character development and Syberia excels here. At the start of the game I didn't care much for Kate; I felt very indifferent towards her, in fact. Though as the game progressed she became more and more likable and a noticeable change in her occurred. By the end I was completely invested in everything that she did and ended up caring for her very much. This is a testament to the excellent job they did in crafting the story.The game play is very similar to The Longest Journey. In fact if you enjoyed The Longest Journey, you are bound to love this game as well. It is played from the 3rd person perspective with 3D characters imposed over 2D backgrounds. The interface is completely point-and-click and relies heavily on the use of inventory items. Nearly all of the puzzles are inventory-based and they are well integrated into the story. I never got a feeling of detachment from the game while solving a puzzle because I knew it was being used to further the storytelling. I felt that the difficulty of the puzzles was very well balanced. There is nothing impossibly difficult that will throw off new players to the genre but simple puzzles are also generally few and far between. Most of the puzzles occupy a nice middleground that should satisfy both experienced and novice players.Beautiful? Stunning? Breathtaking? All words that can safely be used when describing Syberia's graphics. The level of detail is simply immense. You visit four locations in the game and each has it's own style or theme. Valadeline has the look and feel of an Alpinian village that is hidden away from the rest of the world. Barrockstadt is of a tropical persuasion mixed with modern architecture. Komkolzgrad is a Mecca of machinations and steam. Aralbad has a very Dr. Zhivago feel; an ice covered land with an essence of romance and nostalgia. All are beautiful to behold. What is even better is that the cut scenes lose none of that graphical beauty. They were created with the same painstaking detail that the in-game graphics were. They add incredibly to the cinematic feel of the game; they are even presented in widescreen format.The icing on this delicious cake is the music. The score was composed by Nick Valey and Dmitri Bodiansky and they have done an amazing job. It is a traditional classical score that could easily have its place in a film. The score also contains a theme that once heard is easily recognizable, just as one can recognize the Gabriel Knight or King's Quest themes.So is there anything that is NOT good about this game? Well, yes. These points are relatively minor but they are still flaws. First is the voice acting. At times it is acceptable and in some cases very well done. At other times it is downright bad. It fluctuates from bad to good throughout the whole of the game. Second would be the scripting. It feels off sometimes. Perhaps something was lost between the translation from French to English but something seems wrong with the dialogue here and there and it is hard to put your finger on exactly what it is.With those minor quibbles aside though, this is a thoroughly enjoyable game. You feel transported, engrossed, enriched and amazed all at once while playing. Although the game takes place in modern Europe, you feel as if you are in a completely different world. A world that is isolated and untouched by our culture. It is this that lends so heavily to the nostalgic, sentimental and somewhat sorrowful feeling that eminates from the game. If Syberia were a book it would be the kind you read while curled up next to a blazing fire while drinking a cup of hot chocolate.Syberia deserves to be in every gamers' collection, adventure or otherwise.

												So well I went to that town for work, had to get some documents signed, and then somehow I had to break into a crypt, operate a factory, then there was that robot who hated being called a robot, and he took me to a clockwork train. So then we got stuck in a greenhouse station where birds won't let you pass and you've got to blackmail people distilling rare moonshine and attend a lecture about mammoths. And then there was this creepy industrial place and some wacko stole my mechanic's hands so I had to bring him an elderly opera singer who just won't come unless I made her a booze on a pianocktail. Oh, I also had to launch a drunk man into space and free an eagle to get to her. And then I had to blow something up to rescue the singer from the wacko and return her to her spa. I mean to hell with this job man, I'm going to Syberia. Do svidania. P.S. I loved every single bit of it.P.P.S. Guys, this game is 15 years old. Give it credit.			"

I had to refer to a guide two times during the game, but the puzzles are definitely solvable by using just your brain. A couple of cons are the walking speed of the character, and having to go back and forth multiple times at certain parts felt a bit like padding. The story is really good though, I cared for the main characters. 8/10.			"

												A very charming point and click adventure game.  You play as Kate Walker, an American lawyer who is assigned to take care of a takeover of an old toy factory after its owner died. You find out that the owner's brother is alive and you have to travel across Europe to find him. As you play more of the game you find out more about the brother (Hans). The game does a good job in building a mystery around him, so much that you want to keep playing. The puzzles are not too complicated but I got stuck at some points (3 or 4 times, not alot compared to other adventure games).The biggest con is that on Windows 10 it doesn't work out of the box without some compatibility settings like administrator mode and 8 bit color (a HUGE con if it really does play it in 8 bit color mode). I really wish they would fix this or release an HD version (they made it for the XBOX 360). The game was good enough for me to not care too much about the issues but still. Another con is that it is difficult to see the characters' faces because I have to play at a low resolution (cause of compatibility issues).			"

												This game is a very mixed bag. I highly recommend it for point and click adventure fans, if you even have slight notions of French, set this game to French by the steam properties menu, the voice acting is much much better that way. Fanbuys should stop reading this review now. Really.I did not appreciate the synthetic lengthenning of this glorified fetch quest. Basically you have to run accross a village a few times, in real tme. You spend 3-5 minutes running from point a to point b. The puzzles are cliched too, even for the time, they strike me as synthetic and removing from the immersion.Finally the world crafting is spotty, the world is gorgeous, but inconsistent... why was there a <blablabla> there to block access to a <my little pony>? Just 'cause! I think my expectations were too high. This is not a bad game, but after seeing pcgamer giving it like a 108%, I expected a masterpiece a la Grim Fandango or Mass Effect.			"

												A beautiful game. The storyline is rich and the characters are dynamic. For a 2002 pc game, the graphics are lovely. This is a point and click,  single player game. The interface is incredibly simple, as was to be expected. The game is played in different locations and is not open world (you cannot travel at will between game locations once the tasks have been completed there). Dialogue can be very interesting and entertaining at times, at other times it feels rushed or incomplete. Don't overthink- some puzzles and tasks are so simple, you can end up making them more difficult than they are in actuality. Yes, some of the grammar and vocabulary is incorrect and the mechanical aspects of the game don't quite add up sometimes. The game is full of whimsy and charm, and as it progresses, Kate's character really starts to come through. She is not the adventuresome type.... or is she? The beauty of watching Kate discover who she really is, made for a great game. Two thumbs up.			"

												Syberia is an adventure game that has many of the flaws that killed the genre a few years before the game’s release and while I don’t think it’s nearly the absolute classic I’ve seen its touted it as (It doesn’t hold a candle to Longest Journey for instance) it still a worthwhile game if you’re willing to look past its imperfections. Gameplay is of the bad old school adventure game variety, there are no failstates, but a good chunk of the puzzles just feel like tedious busywork, and the game loves its back and forth backtracking, and the areas can be kind of big, so I would suggest playing with a guide to save any frustration, also double-clicking to run is your friend. What really makes the game though it is its atmosphere and its thematic focus.  Syberia has a really strong atmosphere, one of mystery, adventure, and wonder but as well as death, decay, lost hopes and forgotten dreams. Kate Walker’s journey to find Hans Voralberg takes her through several fictional European locations, all decaying into obscurity due to greed, selfish ambition, or just the ravages of time. The game is still beautiful even to this day and the locations just really get across the themes very well. The game also does a good job illustrating and building up Hans as a character and the creations he left in his wake in his decades long travel and how his wonder and creativity endured as the areas around him died or grew more cynical. Kate also has a nice character arc and that’s one of the main focuses of the game alongside Hans, and while it’s subtle as a brick at times, it still feels like a fulfilling journey. While there is Syberia 2, I have no desire in ever playing it because everything I seen of it is worse than its predecessor in every way, and it ruins the mysteries of the first game. I feel Syberia never needed a sequel at all because I think its ending is fulfilling enough, there are many mysteries still unanswered but I don’t think they ever needed to be, because as I said who Hans was and what Kate becomes were always the real focus of the game and the game ties those up with a nice bow. Overall Syberia is a flawed and aged game, but one with genuine heart that makes it worth playing.			"

												I could tell you, that this is one of the most beautiful point&click games I have ever played, but I will not. I could tell you that this story is one of those which will haunt you long after you finish the game, but I will not. I am not forcing my oppinion on anyone but if you are a fan of pont and click adventure games, most likely you have played this title... but if you did not... SIT DOWN RIGHT NOW AND START THE GAME. You are in for one of the most memorable rides of this genre. There is a mature story with great storytelling, nice puzzles, and a long trip to... realising someone's dream, which becomes your dream by the time you reach your destination. It's one of the most reccomended game of it's genre			"

												Syberia is a classic point and click adventure game where you play as Kate Walker a lawyer from New York trying to finalize the sale of a toy factory. The story which first starts off as straight forward but then quickly unravels with new complications - the story is all tied together very well and also has excellent writing. The voice acting in this game is superb and the musical score is perfect. Kate will explore and visit multiple different towns and meet lots of strange and unique characters along the way. The game has a unique charm which really pulls the player into the game's world. The puzzles are all logical and designed very well. The game is pretty lengthy as well, it takes about 8 - 10 hours to complete.			"

												Very good, unique game that holds up well with todays point and click adventures. Impressive enviornments with curious characters and puzzles. Fans of Steampunk lore will like this original series. I would recommend consulting a guide, but only if you really get stuck which it is surprisngly easy to do in this. The only con i would say to this game is that there is no zip mode feature, since there is often a lot of backtracking between locations. Kate's walking/running animations are on the slow side of things. Especially when she is climbing stairs.It is still a very enjoyable adventure game and the price point is just right, get the bundle.

												Syberia is a classic with fantastical, immersive storytelling and believable characters. However, the gameplay has aged to a point where it's not for everyone. The long winded movement of the aptly named Ms. Walker and the easily missed cogs in the puzzle machine make that the game demands more patience than most modern games do.			"

												Summary: Syberia is a point-and-click adventure game with a good story and nice characters. The puzzles are logical, but also not challenging. The main flaw is the very slow pace of the game and the lack of any way to speed up the main characters movement. Only play if you have a lot of patience.Long Story: This recommendation comes with a very big caveat. Syberia is an old-school point and click adventure with none of the modernizations that make those games easier to play. No fast-travel at all (not even dubble-clicking to immediately change scene), no way to see interactionable items except hovering over them or indicating which paths you can take. Steam says it took me about 10 hours to finish Syberia, but I would estimate that maybe 1½ hour was spent on puzzles, another 1½h on dialogue and the other 7 hours were spent on watching the main character run around or climb stairs. There are a lot of stairs in Syberia and you will climb them all. There are also a lot of travel frames that you have to get through to get to places with interactable items. They look very nice, but it is still a bit of wasted time.This means that you should only play Syberia if you have a lot of patience for the incredibly slow pace of the game. If you have the patience, the game rewards you with very nice set-pieces, good dialogue and a nice story. You play as Kate Walker, american lawyer, sent to finalize the sale of a toy factory, only to find the owner dead of old age and the heir missing in the far north of Siberia. Walker starts off as a somewhat unlikable character (lowest point is probably asking a handicapped kid to pick up an oar for her because it is wet and icky), but has a chance to grow throughout the game by overcoming problems and meeting weird people. The puzzles are mostly logical. The difficulty lies more in spotting items and finding all locations that are available. As soon as you have the items and know which locations are available, it is very easy to know what to do. So if you're looking for a challenge then Syberia is not the game for you.I am recommending Syberia because I liked the story, the settings and the characters. However, it would be a far superior game with the ability to quickly move from scene to scene and some indication of which paths are available. As it is, it is an incredibly slow game that you need a lot of patience to play.			"

												One of the best, and most unique adventure games. It's a truly memorable classic which helped revive the genre at the time. I remember when I first learned about Syberia, the idea of a plot involving automatons and mammoths didn't excite me, but I was very curious how it all tied together. This is a slow-moving, story-heavy game with strong atmosphere and a beautiful, haunting soundtrack, as lawyer Kate Walker heads east through Europe to find an eccentric inventor. and close a business deal. In many ways this game is about Kate's character development, and you can't help but to go through the experience with her. The game seems to take place around the time it was created (2002) but as you visit the locations, touched with elements of art nouveau, steampunk, and the scars of world war, the game feels enchanting, surreal, and totally out of time in the most endearing way. The intelligent script, mysterious and charming, has it's moments of suspense and humor, too. Now, the puzzles to be found are somewhat straight forward and will likely give you no trouble. So this isn't a puzzle-centric adventure, which may push some people away. Also, the game has been criticized for having many screens where there's nothing to interact with as you move between points of interest. I can understand that running through 4 screens of landscape at a time with nothing to do, and then running back through them, can be irritating to some people. However, I find this is something that contributes to the immersive and thoughtful tone of the game, like looking at paintings. I should mention that while this is the must-play gem of the series, the shorter sequel is still very good, and the 3rd game, developed 13 years later and coming out next month, will no doubt be interesting.

												I am enjoying the game but here is a quick important gameplay difference between mac and windows versions:The mac version has shiny indicators floating over all interactive (clickable) objects. This way you never miss something important.On the other hand, in windows version, you need to explicitly move your mouse over items to find out if they are clickable or not. This makes the adventure process a bit tedious as it is a lot easier to miss objects.I have no idea why this gameplay changing difference between the platforms exist.			"

												I don't normally speak for a lot of games and I don't put my opinion anywhere about them, but this game is the exception. Syberia is a game that knows just how to pull at the strings on your heart and makes you invested in the story and its characters (Once you get over the occasional bugs and graphical errors, of course. But it's a 2002 game, so it's kind to forgive those).During this complex tale, you realize it's not really about Kate wanting to find Hans so he can sign over the factory. True, that's what her boss wants, but Kate loses interest in finding him for just that reason alone. She, too, becomes caught up in his past and is amazed by his work. She follows his footprints in awe and searches for him for her own answers.I strongly suggest playing this game if you enjoy a good story. You'll be hooked and you won't want to stop. Don't be afraid to play the second one, either. It's just as amazing as the first and you won't be disappointed. The best part? A third is in the works!			"

The Automaton-dominated, steampunk backdrops you will find yourself in are beautiful and detailed, while at the same time being very tasteful and appealing.Dialogue is well laid out, with only a minor gripe about the protagonist's repeating lines when unable to execute a command.The music will travel you to places made out of dreams, and accompany you step by step through this adventure.A definitive must have!

												Wow, is all I have to say.There’s something rather interesting when finding out that you've learned something as a result from playing a game specifically from a long time ago. Sure the aesthetics are okay, nothing bright and attention grabbing at most times, but through this sacrifice, we see a marvelous work spring about. Despite these aesthetics, the artwork and camera angles were brilliant!The story has meaning and messages of all sorts; from the impact of major wars on small European towns (the guard not seeing the static enemy correctly for decades which reminded me of the cold war as a whole), to how mechanical toys seem to be a thing of the past due to the times ('smart' robots replacing machines, smartphones, etc. in our parallel), to uncovering the mystery of a pre-ice age peoples who have been misrepresented by history. (The parallel of history not always being truthful or correct and the shifting of science based on proper connection).Even the main character's personal debacles seem to connect in so many ways to the story. It's been a pleasure playing, and at the same time difficult and rewarding to break out of my ADD shell that seems to be the core mindset that haunts so many top tier games nowadays.You really get a good sense of the ‘general’ video game timeline that seems to sway with culture and society every year: this one showing the mindset of well over a decade ago. But this is not to say that it will be as black and white as comparing the first video game ever created to the last, but it is a vibe that's most felt through the medium of a solid interactive experience that withstands time...unless all you wish to do in the video gaming world is to level up and play the same player vs. player maps over and over again, then I would recommend it even more so that maybe a sense of understanding can come about!But that's just me :D "

												Excellent storyline defines this game's playability. Although the theme of the story doesn't seem special at all, but designers must be complimented for building a haunting gameplay upon it. Elements of longing, mysticism, fantasy, and mystery are well-blended, and make you want to play further and further. Dialogues are well-written and entertaining. Visuals are nothing special. While playing it on a 24"" 1080p monitor wasn't a great experience--the blurry edges around all objects were quite visible, they didn't impede my enjoyment in any sense. Puzzles are quite straight-forward, and don't require any critical thinking skills on your part; you just have to be alert to your surroundings at all times. If there's an object or character that you can interact with, be assured it has some use in the game.The only major irritant in the game is its tedious gameplay. Your character will need to walk around a lot in order to figure out the problems and proceed further in the game. All that could've been bypassed by making the character appear at the location of interest with a single click. But no, the designers make you watch the character walk all the way to the desired location, which will make you impatient; you might even turn-off the game in anger--only to return a few hours later :). SCORE: 7/10 (3 points deducted for tedious gameplay, average visuals, and unintelligent game design)PS: To finish the story, you will need to play this game along with Syberia II.			"

												When I bought this game on Steam, I had no idea what a classic it was. This game was a joy to look at. I envy Kate Walker and the journey she goes on, because the locales are gorgeous. I love the characters. Oscar, her robot compantion, may be annoying to some, but I find him hilarious. I love the steampunk elements in the game. Automatons (they are NOT robots, they told me) are everywhere in this game and a cool mechanical train is the perfect vehicle to travel in. The soundtrack goes well with the scenery creating the perfect atmosphere. This game should definitely be picked up with its companion Syberia II, since the game ends in a cliffhanger.			"

												If I had to describe the game with only one word, it would be ""tedious"". The walking animations are painfully slow, dialogs drag out endlessly, items are often barely visible on screen and there just isn't much to ""do"" in the game. I don't feel like I'm making any decisions at all. I have fond memories of the old Lucasarts adventures (Indiana Jones, Monkey Island, etc.) but Syberia just does not come close. There are no dialog trees, you simple click yourself through ""topics"". Since there is no telling which topic will advance the story, you have to click through them all. On my computer there often is a noticable delay between loading parts of the dialog, which makes it even more tedious to listen to the mostly uninspired conversations. You will do a lot of walking around and the animations are so slow that you want to scream at the protagagonist to hurry the ♥♥♥♥ up. I bought the game to play it together with my girlfriend, but she keeps falling asleep almost every time we played. It might be fun for other people, but it's not for us and we most likely will not play to the end.I suggest trying old Lucasarts adventures, Black Mirror and Nibiru first.			"

												The main story and visuals are really interesting, the game-play is really infuriating.  The protagonist moves slow as molasses, stops before and/or after every scene change (and there are a LOT of scene changes...the devs also put in a lot of scenery that is only there to pass through to make the world seem bigger, I suppose), she stops to consider any door you send her to before she finally opens it or says ""I don't need to go down there"" (99% of doors do nothing), she stops before taking stairs (which are also everywhere) and then goes up or down them as if they are ice covered.  Being an adventure, you have to go back and forth over these same spots multiple times.  It's torturous.  I finally managed to figure out how to make her run (sometimes) after I lost my temper and repeatedly clicked where I wanted her to go while yelling ""move it, for gawd's sake!!"". (double clicking makes her speed up if she has a flat stretch) Don't get me wrong, it's all really cool the first time you see new scenery in the game, but after the first time it's nothing but irritating speed-bumps. There is no map, so definitely no fast travel.  If there were, I would probably enjoy the game instead of only being able to play for an hour at a stretch...by which time anyone tries to talk to me and I explode. Though I am enjoying the main story, a strange kinda mystical story about a female lawyer on the trail of a guy who builds automatons and went in search of mammoths...I would like to see where they go with that bizarre premise...I don't like the side story of the lawyer's life played out in calls she gets on her mobile phone.  [*spoiler*]  The people in her life are selfish, shallow, demanding and uncaring...and she's a complete doormat.  I cringe when her phone rings.  I am sure in the end she tells everyone to take a flying leap because otherwise she is the worst female protagonist ever, but she isn't likeable enough to care.  It's hard to root for someone who takes abuse cheerfully. [*end spoiler*].From what I have seen so far, I estimate the game only has 3 hours of worthwhile game-play but the devs have made it so you can't possibly complete the game in less than 10 hours.  That's a helluva lot of filler.  I don't know if I can bring myself to ever finish it...I think I'd rather pull weeds.			"

												The game wouldn't start and kept coming up with a 3D engine error. I felt cheated by my new broken game, even if I did get it really cheap on a sale. Then I found a very useful guide in the community hub addressing the issue, and I could finally play the game. So if you encounter this same problem, there is an easy solution. The game is just getting a bit too old.Also, mouse right click lets you skip dialogue, and mouse left double click lets you run. Save yourself some time.It's a very old point-and-click game, so I didn't expect much from it and I didn't get much out of it, for the first few hours at least. It starts off very slow story-wise with lots of puzzles and it slowly, slowly builds up to a kind of good story. Back tracking, unconvincing voice acting, corny story, a few vague puzzles, and bizarre leaps in logic are a few of this game's bad points. The ending is an unrealistically, feel-good, follow your dreams sort. This game definitely isn't for everyone, but I enjoyed it in the end. Please do not play this game if you dislike mammoths.			"

												SyberiaPROS:+ good atmosphere+ design and art are superb+ beautiful music (even though there are like 6 tracks)CONS:- for today standards very slow paced, lot of empty walking around- some areas are hard to notice (like doors or passages)The game is a must for every adventure enthusiast. Short game that can be completed in 10 - 12 hours. Very atmospheric and will draw you in with its art and music. Story is simple and quite straightforward, but enough to keep you interested through out the game. Puzzles are all simple and very logical (which could be minus for some players). The main problem for the game in the light of todays standards is A LOT of empty and slow walking. Overall playing this game is like reading a nice art book - it will suck you in and amaze you with its ideas if you give it some time.On the end of the game you can ask yourself are you leading your life like an automaton or a person who wish to aspire, create and fulfill personal (childish) dreams? Will your time pass by and leave you corroded without will to sing like before? Whatever life you led, will it fulfill you on the end? I guess that philosophical point of the game is that even an automaton can change after all.			"

												This is a nice little game to sit down and enjoy. The voice acting isn't terrible but could have been better. I was surprised to find it was a click adventure style with nice graphics. Play this if you have the money (and/or a coupon) and enjoy. Definatly worth checking out the second and third games (coming December 2016).			"

												SyberiaPROS:+ good atmosphere+ design and art are superb+ beautiful music (even though there are like 6 tracks)CONS:- for today standards very slow paced, lot of empty walking around- some areas are hard to notice (like doors or passages)The game is a must for every adventure enthusiast. Short game that can be completed in 10 - 12 hours. Very atmospheric and will draw you in with its art and music. Story is simple and quite straightforward, but enough to keep you interested through out the game. Puzzles are all simple and very logical (which could be minus for some players). The main problem for the game in the light of todays standards is A LOT of empty and slow walking. Overall playing this game is like reading a nice art book - it will suck you in and amaze you with its ideas if you give it some time.On the end of the game you can ask yourself are you leading your life like an automaton or a person who wish to aspire, create and fulfill personal (childish) dreams? Will your time pass by and leave you corroded without will to sing like before? Whatever life you led, will it fulfill you on the end? I guess that philosophical point of the game is that even an automaton can change after all.			"

												Great classic Point&Click adventure with good graphics, really good sound and also a good story.I still love to play the game every now and then, despite it's age and also my kids like it. :)I hope that the next installment will be as good as the first two parts.Personally I still like the graphics and also love the steam punk setting. However, there are a lot of ""empty"" screens, which just serve as background to walk through. Some people may not like that, but I din't find it so bad here, because I still like the graphics even if I have to go back and forth a few times.Puzzles are, in my oponion moderate. You don't really need a walktrhough in most cases.Definitey a recommendation!			"

												Ah, Syberia I and II. This is a well deserved game from my top ten list. The story of a curious lawyer and how she gets in way over her head....This is THE game I compare other point and click adventure stories to. I just wish I could find more games like this one actually. The backdrops are absolutely outstanding, the voice acting is not half bad and the puzzles are just right. With the well designed scenery, the fun and interesting story, the trinkets, the gadgets, the automatons and so much more you are missing out if you like puzzle games and fail to give this one a shot.If you play part one, be prepared to grab part two as well as it is the second half of the story.Let me know if you're going to be playing this, I love remembering parts of the trip and I still remember one of the main songs/whistled tunes from the journey. Enjoy, I know I'll be enjoying it again and again for years to come.			"

												Syberia will forever stand as one of the greatest point and click adventure games ever made.Also Kate Walker is a much better developed character than Lara Croft.Syberia tells the story of Kate Walker, an American lawyer sent to a small secluded town somewhere in Europe to finish the purchase of an automaton company by the Universal Toy Company. From the very start players are thrust into a world similar to ours but not quite the same. As you explore the world and meet new characters more of the world slowly opens up, but more questions then arise. Syberia isn't what I would call a ""point and click thriller"" like the later Telltale games such as the Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us. You don't kill anyone, rather there is very little violence at all compared to modern games. However that is what makes Syberia so special in this day and age. Syberia is somehow able to create a compelling world to explore with memorable characters without the use of hollywood-esque explosions or special effects. Kate Walker's adventure eventually turns into not just a simple business trip but a journey in search of her true self. The way this game presents the transformation of Kate Walker from a somewhat naive by the books girl to a strong independent woman is far more believable than Tomb Raider where Lara Croft suddenly transforms from innocent to murder machine within a few hours. Syberia presents the player with a mature story without the ludonarrative dissonance of today's big budget titles.The actual gameplay is what you would expect from a traditional point and click, find items in your imventory for later use in a puzzle. But the puzzles are some of the most intriguing which I have ever seen in the genre. Nothing is rushed so you always have all the time you need to figure your way out of a problem. And problems you will have. Some of the puzzles in this game are so ingenious that even though this game is 14 years old at the time of this review I was still blown away by them. For example at various stages of the game in order to advance you must use your phone to call  the exact number on a document which you recieved. The game never tells you when to do this, it's up to the player to figure out. Syberia is an amazing game, but an old game nonetheless. There is no denying that the game's engine and visuals are slightly outdated by now. Animations are sometimes funky and the game will glitch out on newer OS's. That being said this game still has some of the best voice acting I've heard in a game and the art style/set pieces still amaze. The soundtrack still stands up to this day. The cutscenes are still extremely fluid and a joy to watch.          So in conclusion if you are either looking for a great point and click or simply a break from all the violence in today's mainstream gaming industry culture Syberia is a perfect purchase.			"

Syberia by MicroidsThis game also listed on my Must Play Games Before You Die.It's a very nice old adventure game. The combined gameplay and musics are wonderful. The missions are awesome and may difficult but it's a good challenge. Microids made something really cool. I already played with the Demo when the game was released, but didn't know this game will be part of my childhood. Syberia 2 was also intensivily good and now waiting for 3rd.(keep in mind, i still played the game before bought on Steam, so don't mention the 0 hour gameplay time.)			"

												I have such a Love\Hate relationship with this game.The story and the setting are absolutly glorious. This is what really makes the game, from the soundtrack, to the artwork to the strange clock-work creatures that inhabit the world. It is great.This is an old game and back then game designers tended not to design games with the end user in mind (players of certain age will remeber that games didn't even come with a save option)Here you have to run Kate back and forth from screen to screen, a lot of which serve no purpose.For instance there is a location where you are likely to return to a number of times. Rather than being central, this location is hidden away behind three background screens with a number of animated staircases that Kate tip toes her way up and down.Lots of the puzzles are simply pickup a key and unlock something - the trick is noticing the key (no ""press space for interactives"" here)To save my sanity I found myself turnimg to a walkthrough. I knew what to do; I just couldn't bare the endless treking back and forth.My  time spent on this game was a happy one, even though I used a walkthrough.I do reccommend this  and eagerly look forward to Syberia 3.Hopefully the next game will have a more logical layout with puzzles that are a bit more puzzly.

												There's no way around the fact that this game has flaws, but overall it's definitely worth a play if you're a fan of the point-and-click adventure style.  The backgrounds are very well done; I especially liked the haunting look of the shipwrecks around Aralbad.  The soundtrack is pretty and not intrusive, contributing to the cutscenes especially.There are some bad points.  As a few reviews have already mentioned, movement slower than slow, and even the double-click-to-run mechanic doesn't save some parts from taking for-freaking-ever to complete.  I also discovered about halfway through that I could right-click to skip dialogue in case I accidentally clicked something I didn't mean to.  I would've loved to have known that earlier as I suffered through long repeated conversations.Despite the backgrounds being visually stunning, the character models themselves show their age and I learned that, at least on my system, alt-tabbing caused some graphical difficulties.  Nothing was game breaking and most glitches cleared themselves up if I changed rooms/views, but it was irritating for me as a chronic multitasker.The only part of the game that was almost a dealbreaker for me was the character development, not of Kate (your playable character) but of the people she interacted with by phone throughout the game.  The selfish, shallow jerk of a fiancé, the annoying, shallow mother, the ethically-questionable, shallow best friend....all of them were honestly awful.  The worst was Kate's interaction with Dan; where she should've told him to♥♥♥♥♥♥off after roughly the second conversation, she instead kept taking responsibility for his poor behavior.  Even as her character developed more of a spine as the story went on, her interactions with him were still grating.  He was a self-obsessed ghoul throughout and I honestly wanted to run our little train right over him.  No combat in this game, but he might make you regret that.But, the rest of the story was extremely unique and very truly overcomes the glitches, the slow speed, and the ridiculously badly-written supporting cast (Hans and Helena are notable exceptions to this, though, they're delightful).  If you feel like the ten dollar price tag is too much for an older game, pick it up in a bundle or on sale.  It's worth it.			"

												From the very start Syberia is a cinematic treat. Its unique characters and gorgeous settings are shown in great detail, rich animation and creative design, and this carries on throughout the entire game. In fact, both get even more elaborate. There are a few annoying animations and the occasional empty areas you are forced to walk through that only serve to connect point A to point B, but they don’t take away from the game that much.The sound effects help bring the world to life and are fitting for each area whether it be beautiful sounds of nature or the mechanical sounds of the city. They help to immerse you in the world that Syberia creates, although there are some volume issues with quiet lines of spoken dialogue or overly loud sound effects but these are few and far between. The music… my word, the music is a treat. Cinematic orchestra swells in and the low woodwind bellows help pull you into this game that only feels like a movie.Of course, the real treat in Syberia is the story. It caught me off guard. What starts as a story about a toy factory turns into one of the most beautiful dramas about heart and humanity that I have seen in a while topping most movies and TV shows I have seen. Even the subplot between our hero and her boyfriend begins to take center stage and melds with the main plot at the end that could bring tears to your eyes.If you love adventure games or great stories in general, you are doing yourself a disservice by not playing Syberia.

												Syberia is a beautiful and very immersive game. You get caught up in the art deco world of Validilene at the start, and before you know it you're hurtling off into the unknown (including grand universities, tropical train stations, and former Soviet factories). This is not an action-packed adventure, nor are the puzzles too challenging. This is really the kind of adventure you curl up with on the sofa on a rainy night, to relax and dream away with. It is soothing and engaging at the same time, mainly thanks to its wonderful scenery and design, and high-quality storytelling and characterization. It's almost like an interactive novel that you unfold step by step. Highly recommended.			"

												Syberia is a strong adventure game with an interesting story that does a great job of integrating the slightly fantastic elements of clockwork automatons and mammoths. It shows its age at times but still looks and sounds very good for a game released in 2002. The point-and-click adventure game format might feel a bit slow for newer gamers, but I enjoyed Syberia despite my usual preference for faster-paced action games.

												Review by xTzharkz.Syberia - awesome story puzzle game. Click and move based.All you need is mouse and a good head to play the game.Short version: - awesome story - great voice acting - old graphics (nostalgic) - slow moveing  - easy to get stuck in progressIt was really easy to get stuck in the puzzle if not paying enough attention or missed some item from somewhere. Eventho I was stuck at various places and had to use internet help I still like it a lot. Another thing that got little nerve eating was the slow movement. Will play the next game as well - story continues. Kate Walker - the charecter you will play as - reminded me Lara Croft a lot. I recommend this game to people who like puzzles/story. There is no big action so yeah, only to puzzle and adventure story lovers.xTzharkz [Eric].			"

												I played this game for the first time when I was much younger, and when I saw it on Steam with its sequel, I couldn't pass it up. For the lovers of point-and-click adventure games, I would definitely recommend this.  The story is intriguing, and the art and graphics are beautiful.  The characters are also quite unique.  I don't want to say that the puzzles in this game are challenging (some are very simple) but you'll find yourself running circles and scanning the same room from time to time.  Personally, using a walkthrough every now and then did not make me enjoy the game any less, so don't be afraid to use one. :)			"

												I have to say when I bought Syberia I thought that it would be as boring as Myst something I would most likely play for about fifteen minutes and then never play again. Yet after playing Syberia for fifteen minutes I was hooked, and well fifteen minutes became about ten hours. Syberia has such an amazing character development, a story that takes hold of you and makes you want to play to the end, and very unique and interesting environments. I will admit that the graphics are definately not the best, but for a game that is a decade old they are still decent. There are certain points in the game where you may scratch your head and have to really think about some of the puzzles yet nothing so difficult that you will become enraged and just quit the game.

												I saw this game some while ago on Steam and bought it during the Summer Sale 2014. It's the first ""Point and Click"" adventure I've played in a long while (and it basically reminds me of the first PC game I played as a kid). The story is suprisingly well developed, engaging and heart-warming and the main protagonist has a highly creative personality, which makes her very likeable. Running from one place to another may become annoying at a certain point but these ""filler"" maps just add a very realistic touch to the game (we all have to walk and Syberia represents the journey of a man and woman). All in all, the game has a soothing atmoshpere, making it easy to relax, and I'm happy that I don't have to shoot anybody for some time. Great adventure game for older teens and grown-ups who are looking for a piece of nostalgia.			"

PROS:+ great story telling+ atmosphere of an adventure+ (mostly) fun puzzles+ very good voice acting+ likable protagonistCONS:- couple of puzzles make almost no sense- many graphic glitches (especially when hitting Alt+Tab)- lots of empty running around- sort of cliffhanger ending (but this can be fixed by playing Syberia 2)Comment:It has been about 10 years since I played Syberia 2, which I never finished. Then I saw Syberia bundle on sale so I bought it.....and left it in my backlog for a long time. But I am glad I got to playing Syberia. While clearly this is an old game it still keep a certain charm about itself. The story while starting slow (and a bit boring) picks up and is interesting. You get that feel of a quest or adventure as you follow Kate Walker. The voice acting is really good and I guess this is one of the reasons why Kate is likable. Gameplay is not bad but could have used less walking/running around empty corridors. Puzzles are fairly challenging and, except for a couple of them, rather logical. The graphics are old but still decent. However I encountered a lot of graphic glitches along the way. The game ends in a cliffhanger-ish manner and so I am looking forward to playing Syberia 2. So do I recommend? Well, if you like good stories and point&click games, then I absolutely do! But get the Syberia bundle!			"

												I really enjoyed Syberia. The storyline develops nicely, with some fun characters throughout, and the puzzles are clever enough to engage your brain but not to the point of frustration.I managed to complete the game in about 12 hours, so it's good value for money.I highly recommend this to any fans of point and click adventures, and I look forward to playing it's sequel.

												This is a fairly decent point-and-click adventure.The good:- Beautiful background locations that feature a clockwork art nouveau aesthetic.- A simple mouse-controlled user interface: right click to move your character or interact with objects, left click to open your inventory.  Your expanded inventory allows you to access and reference important documents, as well as to call NPC's from your cell phone.- An interesting plot hook that will propel your character through four unique quest/puzzle hubs.- The snarky comments from Oscar and James.The okay:- The puzzles are very intuitive; however, I did run into trouble a few times because I either missed a dialogue cue that was necessary to advance a puzzle, or I overlooked a small clickable object due to undelineated bounding boxes.- There are several large screens that have absolutely nothing to interact with.  They may be pretty to look at, but they make backtracking a bit of a pain.- The music is good, but some of the themes are overplayed.The ugly:- Can we talk about the female protagonist?  She is introduced as a hot-shot international corporate lawyer, so I thought she was going to be savvy and assertive, but she spends most of the game being emotionally manipulated by her fiance, being verbally abused by her bosses, having her femininity questioned by her backstabbing shallow co-worker, having her life choices questioned by her overbearing frivolous mother, and being jerked around by various unsavory NPC's.  The few times she starts to stick up for herself, she actually back-peddles and APOLOGIZES, and seems to be completely okay with people treating her like a doormat.  While she is smart, resourceful, and does have a fair bit of character development over the course of the game, I would have liked to see her make a conscious choice to put her foot down instead of making excuses and avoiding the issues.  Overall, I would give this game a 7.5/10			"

												An amazing classic from 2002. The gameplay is what you'd expect from titles such as Broken Sword, Monkey Island, Leisure Suit Larry, etc. That's what you get from point-clickers. That said, the storytelling in this game is fantastic, a classic, something I never tire of with this kind of adventure genre. This game is well worth picking up for nostalgic reasons, and simply because Syberia has a pleasing feel to it.			"

												""No need to go down there!""""It's jammed!""""No point, it's locked""  You'll be hearing these lines an awful lot.  The graphics are dull, often muddy and extremely low resolution.  It's not uncommon to miss critical objects because they are virtually indistinguishable from their surroundings and sometimes only a couple pixels wide.There is almost no interactivity with the environment.  If it's not critical to a puzzle, you can't click on it.  There's virtually no ""flavor"" anywhere.  What is that strange object over there?  *mouse over it*  Nothing.  The painting on the wall?  Nope.  The mannequin with the dress?  Nada.  The statue in the fountain?  Nil.Many of the puzzles are unnecessarily obtuse, requiring sometimes inputs with absoutely no clues what they're supposed to be.The phone calls are EXTREMELY annoying and I want to slap every single person on the other end.  If I were the main character, I'd have chucked the phone into the first river I came across.  Only a very few of the calls are really necessary, maybe 4 out of the couple dozen you make or recieve.  Most are either your idiot boss berating you for things that are outside of your control, or they're about your relationship with your fiance.The worst part, however, is the walking.  You'll end up walking back and forth and back and forth over and over, even if you know what you're doing.  There are screen transitions every few steps in some areas; most train platforms are 5 or 6 screens wide.  And the main character moves so slowly and has such difficulty with stairs that she must be part Dalek!I'm a long time player of point-and-click adventure games, going back to titles such as Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Space Quest and Maniac Mansion, and I have to say that this is one of the worst such titles I've ever played.

												Overall:Initially the idea of the game is great; very narrative. Now, just about an hour into the game, the narrative form is killing the excitement. The dialogs are illogical and very clumsy, to the point I can't remember haven seen in games for more than a decade. In the interest of fairness I probably should note that the game indeed is more than ten years old.The dialog and story line problem:When I ask about ""Y"" I am told that ""Y"" is not relevant, when I ask about ""X"" I am told that I need to know about ""Y"" first. Same thing with the places your character can visit. You can choose to go to place ""1"", ""2"" or ""3"", but if you go to ""2"" or ""3"" you are told that it is not time for that yet - in a more game like fashion than that - but the point remains valid.Conclusion:All in all, if you are looking for a computer adventure game I suggest you spend your money on something better than ""Syberia"". On the other hand, if you are looking for a graphic story to click yourself through instead of yet another movie night then ""Syberia"" might just be worth a dollar or two - in my opinion not more than that though - certainly not ten!

												I can't believe I didn't hear more about this game before I decided to play it. It really deserves to be a well known classic, alongside The Longest Journey.The world of Syberia is similar to ours, but slightly different, in its possessing intricate automaton inventions. There are many things to admire in this game, such as the details in the character and background animations, the absolutely gorgeous environments, and the creativite plot and settings. You can definitely feel the love and effort the developers put into the game. It's hard for me to describe one of the best things that Syberia does well... but I'm going to try: the world it creates is not exactly exciting, but rather relaxing in its wonderment. The atmosphere is calming and whimsical. There are no death screens, no way for you to mess up or have to start over, just you exploring a rich world. Although it might not be big on action, Syberia definitely has a lot to say. Throughout the narrative as Kate changes, the game tells both her and the player that you are capable of much more than you think. The game will move you at parts, if you let it.Keep in mind there is a sequel to this game, so some issues are left unresolved, but I feel that even without a sequel, the themes and character arcs of this story work well, even standing alone.A few things that detract from the game are the inability to make Kate move faster during some animations like walking up stairs which makes backtracking irritating, some difficult puzzles that you might need a walkthrough for, and interactive items that are sometimes easy to miss. I highly recommend using a walkthrough if you get stuck to prevent the hair-pulling frustration of combing over every pixel on the screen to find something to help you progress the game. (I don't like using walkthroughs myself, but I had to bend in this case.) However, these things ultimately do not take away from how much the world will enthrall you, and how much you won't want to leave when the story ends. Pick up this game if you're looking for a calming point and click adventure to help you unwind.			"

												When it comes to adventure games, this is one of the most beautiful looking games in them, anyone can easily vouch for that. Reminds me a lot of pre-rendered backgrounds I used to see when I was playing Final Fantasy VII. The story is one of those stories that just come at you out of nowhere, like who could've thought of that or how elaborate could this writing be, which made it all the more interesting for me. Syberia also gets a 10 in my book for being the adventure game with most graphical bugs I have ever played. Hair sticking out, Face rotating, Eyes popping out, Being able to see through the main character's face, you name it. It was an enjoyable experience.			"

From Benoît Sokal's beautiful artwork to the charm of each character, this is a game which will never get old and which is worth playing and remembering.Pros:+ Magnificent unique style for a breathtaking world.+ Charming and imaginative story and characters.+ Good sound and mostly good voice acting.+ Easy to learn and with enjoyable puzzles.Cons:- The voice acting gets shaky at times and the actors seem confused by some terms.- Despite there being a sequel, the ending is too abrupt and not hinted enough.

												After finishing the fantastic point-and-click, adventure game, Syberia, I must say that it is one of the most epic games I've ever played. If you're a fan of adventure games, then you must try out this game. The visuals and graphics are still good looking, the puzzles and mechanics wroks great. The setting is what defines Syberia: Cold, dark, sad, grey and beautfiful.Syberia is stacked with interesting characters, good voice acting and good dialogues. 10/10			"

												Nominating this game for the ""I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award"" awardI had fond memories of playing Amerzone, another Microids adventure game, as a wee lass, and I discovered this hidden treasure through a Steam sale a while back. Hands down the most immersive gaming experience I've had in a long time. The story is fun and intriguing, the characters and locations are all wonderfully charming, and it was a beautiful adventure from beginning to end. The puzzles definitely get your brain moving, but they're also generally quite accessible and never succumb to ""adventure game logic"". I have since recommended this game to absolutely everyone I know, including you, reader of this review. Can't wait for the release of part 3.			"

												Great ""classic"" Point and Click Adventure with lovly and a bit strange set of characters, awesome setting and scenery. It keeps you interesstet till the end. I can definitely recommand this game to everyone, who likes to play oldschool adventures. In my opinion its difficulty is something between easy and medium, with very different yet logical puzzles. It runs perfectly on Windows 10, but you can not expect modern resolution. Due to the fact that the backgrounds are prerendered there is no opportunity to modify that.  "

												If you are tired of quests, where is hard to understand, what to do next, or just can't find a solution and where and how to use a bunch of crap in your inventory, this quest game Syberia could be for you. Storyline is a bit unusual but more or less interesting, gameplay goes on very easy and quick. Not much conversations with annoying and endless dialogues, not so much stuff in inventory. Easy quest game for sunday morning.Funny place in game, when main character (fancy girl lawier) isn't taking oar from river, because it is dirty, and asks to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boy to get it for her... :DOverall positive feedback from me.

												I'm a big adventure game fanatic, so I'm picky.  This one is pretty good and I think it's a great one to start out with if you're new to adventure games, because it has a good story and the problems are typically at a beginner level, without being absurdly easy.  One thing I particularly liked about the game is that it shows you very clearly what you can click on.  This is something that a lot of games lack.  I want to pull my hair out when I've been thinking and thinking about how to solve a problem in an adventure game and it turns out there was something I just didn't know I could click on (like a one-pixel wide item or something).  WIth Syberia, that's never an issue and it means that they can't rely on poorly thought-out solutions based on flailing around with the mouse to see what you can click on.My only complaint is that there were a couple of places in which the solutions to problems were, in my opinion, not terribly intelligent.  I'm perfectly willing to take my hat off to a really clever problem that I didn't get, but it drives me nuts when these games have solutions that aren't at all clever, just non-sensical.  I'll try for hours only to give up, find an online walkthrough and then tear my hair out that the solution doesn't even make sense.  I'd advise that you don't spend too, too long on a problem you're stumped with.  Don't be ashamed to find online walkthroughs, because occasionally it's just that the problem was poorly designed.  Fortunately, those sorts of things are few and far between.  The plot is fairly original, centering around a scientist who made ingenious automata that do all sorts of amazing things and who was obsessed with the idea that wooly mammoths never died out, but still exist in some isolated part of the arctic.  My only complaint with the plot is that Syberia refers to a legendary place, not to Siberia, even though it could easily be somewhere around there.  Nobody once mentions that Syberia and Siberia are different (in fact, I don't think anyone even mentions Siberia at all) and yet, even when they're speaking orally, everyone seems to just get that Syberia means the legendary place, even though it's pronounced exactly the same. That little bit kind of rubbed me the wrong way, but, otherwise, it's quite well done and very creative.One thing I particularly like is that you have a cell phone and you can make calls any time you want, though only to preexisting contacts, which you can add to as the game progresses.  I thought that was a nice touch.  You also get calls sometimes from people like your boss, who wants updates, and your mother and boyfriend who are both worried about you and want you to come home. All in all, a good game.  I'd recommend it.			"

												Well. After having this in my library for something like 4 years, I FINALLY played it through. I started last fall, then took a hiatus in Jan., then finished it up over the last week. I had bought it as part of the Meridian pack, and there are STILL a lot in there I've never touched--yet. Anyway. I understand this game is somewhat controversial in the favorability department. I hand it a thumbs up, albeit a less than enthusiastic thumb. First, I found the artwork and character design very good, if not actually outstanding. The steampunk vibe is excellent, and reminds me of Sierra's old masterpiece ""Lighthouse: The Dark Being"", considered by many to be the most insanely difficult adventure game ever made, and certainly among the best. In fact, at one point, my wife, who doesn't even play this type of game, looked over my shoulder and asked if that's what it was! Said it sounded a lot like it. Another aspect I found pleasing and familiar is that heroine Kate Walker bears a resemblance to Alex Vance, heroine of Half Life 2 and its sequels, probably my favorite game series of all time. And while this is a very different style of game, Kate also has that same tough-as-nails determination and willingness to get her hands dirty. In one sequence, she escapes a ruined underground complex through a ventilation duct -- shades of Dr Freeman himself! In fairness to Microids, let it be noted that Syberia was released more than 2 years BEFORE Alyx was helping Freeman shoot zombies.I found most of the puzzles to be of satisfying difficulty, right in the Goldilocks zone, not too hard, not too easy, but just right. I believe I only had to go the hints (UHS reader, a valuable classic!) twice, and BOTH involved using the telephone -- I don't think it's a spoiler to say that at least twice you must make phone calls to get necessary clues -- and the first time (if I recall correctly) invokes an absolutely ABSURD coincidence! The other game it reminded me of irresistably was Douglas Adams' ""Starship Titanic"", with its menagerie of eccentric automatons, and one puzzle involving a mechanical bartending machine with an organ-like keyboard on which buttons are pressed and keys played seemed as if it could have been right from that ill-fated spaceship. One very clever and beautiful gimmick is a sort of music box which when wound up performs a bit of backstory from the childhood of two of the central characters, which sequences segue between the music box display itself and flashbacks to ""real life"". Gameplay itself is episodic, and you progress from one city to another on a full-size wind-up train with your mechanical engineer/conductor, Oscar, solving each segment of the game. Oscar generally proves of little help to you, as wherever you stop he is afraid to leave the train because of the windy/dusty/sooty/sandy climate outside. Your quest, as Kate Walker, is tracking down a certain Hans Voralberg, creator of all these wondrous automatons and machines, to obtain his signature on a contract. Spoiler -- you succeed. This climactic moment plays out in paradoxically anti-climactic fashion -- a moment, and it's done. Then -- ah, but then you get the REAL conclusion to the saga. While not especially surprising, there is a dramatic suddenness to it and a tension which grips the player -- although at this point we have stopped really playing and are watching a cutscene play out the game's last moments. One small issue is sequentiality. A number of times I performed some task only to find, after, characters giving me clues or Kate herself saying something which made it seem that said task still needed to be done -- or conversely, making reference to something I did NOT know yet but in a way which indicated I already had discovered some fact. Another, perhaps larger issue, is that the characters here TALK and TALK and TALK. I understand that this is something of a characteristic of European games of this type. And the accents don't help. I've also seen complaints that it is TOO episodic, and there is little sense of continuity from the beginning to the end, and sequence to sequence. Although I understand the point, I largely disagree, or disagree, at least, that it is a negative: it's just how the game plays, and is no more episodic than Myst or any of the other classic graphic adventure games. However, I must concede that it lacks SOMETHING -- but I'm not sure what. The art and music are good -- the music in fact is outstanding at times, and a musical performance is one of the key events. Some of the cinematic sequences are close to breath-taking -- I'm thinking in particular of the launch of a rocket and the flight of an airship. But the whole thing is lacking a certain spark, that special magic that takes you out of yourself and into the game itself, makes you believe that you really are immersed in a different world. It doesn't ruin the game, not by far, don't misunderstand me -- but it keeps it out of that highest level of entertainment, achieving that true suspension of disbelief. Except -- except perhaps in that final cutscene. That's where it comes closest. And I think too that a lot of players in a way ignored that conclusion, and failed to realize that the heart of the story isn't about Kate finding an old man and getting his signature, the heart of the story is KATE HERSELF. Understand this, understand the final scenes, and I think you'll appreciate this a bit more. In any case, I am now eagerly awaiting Syberia 2 to finish downloading (also part of the Meridian Collection) and look forward to playing it as well. It is coincidence that I've just found that S3 has just been released, and the first reviews and comments I've seen are rather harsh, at least with regard to the English translation and voice-acting. At $40 I'll probably wait a while until it's a Steam Special -- but play it I will! So bottom line here -- I DO recommend this -- somewhat tentatively, perhaps -- be prepared for a thoughtful, slow-paced ride with Kate, Oscar, and their friends & enemies. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but will be a rewarding and refreshing cup for some.			"

												What an amazing game!I cannot believe I have missed out on this for all these years. It strongly reminds me of ""The longest journey"", one of my favorite point and click's of all time, and Syberia easily competes with that one.The story in this one is incredible, it is deep and it covers a lot of ground. The characters are rather unique and offers a wide spectrum of personality, even though most of them are not actually in the game at all, or pretty much. The only ones that annoys me are Dan and Olivia, but them being the depiction of 'regular' people are absolutely spot on, and that is another reason why this game gets thrilling.The escape from society, clearly and creatively motivated by means of great narrative and original imagination, is a story worth replaying from game to game. This one truly is a hidden gem, and absolutely a must to anyone who enjoys the charm of point and click storytelling. The ingame lecture was actually great, it even beats some of my real life lectures from school in terms of being interesting.I found a guide on how to force the game into 'windowed mode' in the Steam community guides section for this game, I highly recommend it, as the fullscreen can get a bit buggy due to the aging of this game. Especially if you use more than one screen. It also covers the same function for the second game.*Tips hat to that*The greatest mystery of this game however, is easily the following question:How did Kates luggage get on the train? She did not manage to carry it up on her room by herself, so how did it get onto the train? Now that is a timekiller for ya..10/10 - Loved the chess reference.			"

												I finished the game quite fast because at the end I was going through with solution to speed up a bit.Simply after so many years , no matter how great that game is, it's just old and very slow.After being used to all modern titles this game seems to be a bit to obsolete.Maybe my problem was that I didn't have a chance to play that before.Anyway, I would still recomend that game to everyone who likes nice stories, challenges and beautiful artwork. After so many years this game defends itself very well with so well done graphics and amazing locations.But most of all totally awesome steampunk theme!!!:D I can't wait for Syberia 3! Solid 7/10.

												Syberia neatly packages creativity and wonderful storytelling into a compelling point-and-click adventure. Offering stunning artwork, engaging voice acting, and supported by beautiful music, it is very well crafted. In addition, the puzzles require a decent amount of thought.Syberia does have a few minor faults, although nothing game breaking. The low resolution graphics quickly show off its age and in certain spots makes it difficult to see objects. There are a couple spots where the screen scrolls as you walk toward the edge, however there is no indicator that identifies that aspect. Lastly, some of the puzzles just end up being frustrating because they get overly involved--almost anal retentive in a way.Overall, the story is what makes this game great and it leads perfectly into the sequel. It was definitely worth the time spent.			"

												Steampunk before it was cool...Syberia is a little nice title mixing up a charming world of automatons and a mysterious adventure of investigative protagonist. Parts where you can get stuck with a logical nonsense for a long time occurs actually very little. The game has also a very nice nonviolent way of settling main character's thoughts and opinions which is great for pulling a player into the story. Conclusion: A nice story with a magical atmosphere which I recommend to every Adventure games fan. 3/5			"

												Syberia is an old school puzzle adventure. I borrowed it once from a family friend years ago, and absolutely loved it.The game takes place in Europe (from France to deep eastern Europe), and is mostly drenched in a form of Steampunk; this all due to the Automatons involved.The setting is very pleasant, and the whole atmosphere is simply relaxing. There is no rushing, no stress, just plain puzzling in beautiful environments.An absolute must try for Myst fans.(I'll have to finish this one before reviewing Syberia 2, obviously...)Oh, and a great thing: it's available in multiple languages! I can play it in the original French! whoop!Though the graphics are by now somewhat dated, the game still gets a very nice 9 out of 10, for the feeling it gives me while playing :)			"

Definitely worth the money if you're an explorer who enjoys a good story.Finished the game back in 2002, when the graphics were something of a selling point.Edit:If you're ever stuck, the game has a ""Walkthrough"" file in the main directory, so that's always handy if you get stuck...

												This is one of the real classic adventure games. It borrows a lot of the good from older classics like The Longest Journey, but applies a very unique steampunk style. The graphics are a bit dated by 2012 standards, but they are still very pretty to look at and they complement the story well. This game is an adventure first and a puzzle game second. The puzzles are fun but not very hard and not very numerous. I used hints once or twice, but that should not be necessary for most players. The game is well designed in that there are always cues to let the player know what needs to happen next. I would recommend this to anyone who likes adventure games. I don't remember a lot of bad language or adult themes, so I think this would be a good games for older children/tweens.			"

												Syberia is one of the best adventure point and click games I have ever played. It has an excellent story, a very likable main protagonist that grows, great side characters, challenging, but logical, puzzles and progression (one of the few adventure games that I felt nailed progression and puzzles without being frustrating or too obscure), just... a wonderful game. One of the few things I will complain about is that it does look a bit dated, and also that getting from one area to another can take way too long. But besides that, I give this a 9.75 and a very high recomendation for all adventure point and click/story lovers.			"

If you are having issues, try lowering your resolution (I have it working at 1920x1080)Get it in the sale, what a bargain!			"

												Never a protagonist on an adventure game caught my heart as Kate Walker. Syberia can be described as a very straight forward story that spans for about 10 -12 hours and dont bother to bump the player experience with intricated puzzles, everything here is simple but at the same time well put to created a fluidy experience that focus on the narrative.

												Syberia will always have its place in my heart. When I have first played it I was mesmerized by its graphic, music nad story. This feeling didn't left me even after many years. It still has the ""magic"" feeling for me.I think that Syberia is an adventure with big A. I find the characters and dialogs well-made. The story is interesting and really captivating. Kate Walker, our heroine, is sympatic, funny young women. I enjoyed every voice in the game. Puzzles are hard enough, sometimes its easy and sometimes you must try. You can make it without walktrough. During my playtime I have not experienced any problems with the game itself.I can recommend this game to anyone who likes mysterious adventures games. I think that you wouldn't be dissapointed. 10/10P.S.: English is not my native language, so please excuse any mistake that I have maybe made.			"

												Visually Syberia reminds me of my absolute favourite game The Longest Journey, and the two games have some further similarities as well. I'm a huge fan of point and click adventure games, but what bothered me most about Syberia was how I sometimes found myself running through many consequtive screens which seemed to be made only for that - running through. Yes, the backgrounds are stunning, but after passing through the same screens over and over again and clicking through three or four screens to get from point A to point B, it did get really annoying. However, despite its small flaws, I would definitely recommend the game.			"

												This is one of the real classic adventure games. It borrows a lot of the good from older classics like The Longest Journey, but applies a very unique steampunk style. The graphics are a bit dated by 2012 standards, but they are still very pretty to look at and they complement the story well. This game is an adventure first and a puzzle game second. The puzzles are fun but not very hard and not very numerous. I used hints once or twice, but that should not be necessary for most players. The game is well designed in that there are always cues to let the player know what needs to happen next. I would recommend this to anyone who likes adventure games. I don't remember a lot of bad language or adult themes, so I think this would be a good games for older children/tweens.			"

												Steampunk before it was cool...Syberia is a little nice title mixing up a charming world of automatons and a mysterious adventure of investigative protagonist. Parts where you can get stuck with a logical nonsense for a long time occurs actually very little. The game has also a very nice nonviolent way of settling main character's thoughts and opinions which is great for pulling a player into the story. Conclusion: A nice story with a magical atmosphere which I recommend to every Adventure games fan. 3/5			"

												Syberia is an old school puzzle adventure. I borrowed it once from a family friend years ago, and absolutely loved it.The game takes place in Europe (from France to deep eastern Europe), and is mostly drenched in a form of Steampunk; this all due to the Automatons involved.The setting is very pleasant, and the whole atmosphere is simply relaxing. There is no rushing, no stress, just plain puzzling in beautiful environments.An absolute must try for Myst fans.(I'll have to finish this one before reviewing Syberia 2, obviously...)Oh, and a great thing: it's available in multiple languages! I can play it in the original French! whoop!Though the graphics are by now somewhat dated, the game still gets a very nice 9 out of 10, for the feeling it gives me while playing :)			"

												A solid entry in the adventure genre. Syberia is a beautiful, story rich adventure game. The game features an utterly charming unique setting with a  slight steampunk-ish style. I was truly engrossed in the style, the story, the characters (even the ones I hated), the visuals and the sounds. I don't want to give anything away, so if you're looking for a game with a great story, visuals and characters, I highly recommend this game series. If you decide to get it, get the sequel as well since this ends on a cliffhanger. The only complaint I have of the game is that you can click outside the game (which causes temporary graphical glitches) if you have multi monitors. So either watch out when clicking on a side you have a monitor setup or play windowed.			"

												Overall, loved it!  The story is gripping and one of those hard-to-stop-playing adventure games.  I'd only recommend this to people who love point and click adventure games as well as culture, travel and history (albeit mostly ficitonalised).PROS:-engaging storyline for culture/travel/steampunk/semi-fictionalised history buffs-relatable human touch with main protagonist, Kate's, personal dramas over the phone in love, work and family-charming personal sibling history between focal characters, Hans and Anna, -interesting and quirky side characters from a wide spectrum-beautiful steampunk graphics in every scene-creative puzzles and challenges (easy - medium)-lots of fun travelling and intricately detailed and exotic steampunk places, a real gem to see.CONS:-slow-going gameplay in that there's a lot of awkward running/painfully slowly walking up and down stairs between several empty scenes and some long backtracking too which grated my nerves-some superficial side character exploration, I had lots of questions about issues raised but they weren't really answered-disappointed by how short the game was and main protagonist's reactions or lack thereof when interacting or in the face of injustice (found myself snarkly answering back what she should say), which did make her rather bland at times.Otherwise, I still really enjoyed it so I'd say if the pros outweigh to cons for you, give it a go!p.s.MOST MEMORABLE PART: I found the barge owner's 'foreign' dialogue in Barrockstadt very funny given he was speaking a crazy mix of German, Russian, Spanish and French in each sentence!  Added fun for the multi-linguists out there.			"

												Syberia is a point-and-click adventure game in which you play as Kate Walker, attempting to track down the owner of a toy factory in order to facilitate a sale. Through the game you move through a series of locations along a railway line, each of which has a series of puzzles which need to be solved in order to allow your trip to continue.As noted in many other reviews, Kate moves rather slow, but can run if you double-click. However, when moving up/down stairs, or any other obstacles, she does move at a slow pace. As there is an unfortunate amount of backtracking involved in the course of the game and they frequently have these sorts of stairs, it can lead to a stuttered, somewhat lethargic pace.The story feels meandering until you reach close to the end of the game, when it starts to pick up. As this game takes place in a fictional history, some items (such as how a railway would supposedly work) don't really make /sense/. If you're the sort of person where these sorts of things bother you, you might want to pass on this game. Ultimately, the question which needs to be asked is whether point-and-click adventure is something which appeals to you - while it can take some time to get truly gripping, the story is worth experiencing, provided you like that sort of gameplay.

												Despite its age, this game is surprisingly good! Though this game is presented as a puzzle game, it's rather an exploration game. It's all about exploration and storyline. You might even say that it's more of a graphic novel than an actual game. But it's a good thing.The fascinating story, beautiful landscapes and great music will give you the right taste of the Age of Steam. Although the actual events take place in 2002.I'd give 10/10 for this game, but main character's pace was just a little bit too slow sometimes, therefore my overall rating is 9/10.			"

												First of all, I love point & click adventures. I'm rather forgiving about errors in these games, simply because I enjoy playing them in general. But this game... I simply couldn't continue playing it.I also love steampunk, so a game that combines both should be perfect for me, right? Right?Well... it says I played this game for 4.6 hours as I write this. And while I certainly love the environment and the art of the game... I can't enjoy the game itself. Why? Because the one word that describes this game best is: ""boring"".First of all, everything seems to take forever. You slowly walk from point to point, from scene to scene, and you just wish you could somehow fast forward. This gets particularly annoying if you have to cross like 4-5 screens (one of them may be a scrolling screen), just to get from one hotspot to another.Second, the dialogues. They are long and tedious, and more often than not, nothing helpful is being said. You ask about one thing and they tell you that you don't need to know about that. Then you ask about the other and they tell you, you must first know the one thing you were told earlier that you don't need to know about it.SPOILERSThird, the story. You're a lawyer, travelling to a remote village to finalize a purchase deal for a factory. Does that sound exciting? Yeah, certainly does. You learn that the owner of the factory died shortly before you arrived, and struggle to still buy the factory for your client. Couldn't they think of a more exciting story?Fourth, the phone calls. You witness random phone calls from Kate's mother, work colleague, boyfriend/fiance (amazing that she actually has signal in such a remote place) and learn about their relationships and stuff. As far as I can tell, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with the story. It's probably supposed to add depth to the character. But was this really necessary?Yes, I know, the game is old, 13 years by the time of this review. But that is not an excuse. There were great games before 13 years ago. There were great point & click games before 13 years ago. Look at the old Lucas Arts games. Indiana Jones, for example, was released 23 years ago, by the time of this review. And it was great. I played it over and over again.This game, however... is just tedious. And boring.			"

												I rarely give up on games, movies, books, or tv shows once I've taken an interest in starting them.  But this game I had to put down after just getting in to chapter 2.  I started the game with two impressions: 1. That it would be an overwhelmingly great experience (based on reviews), and 2. that I would be having an adventure in the cold and exciting lands of Siberia.  Neither was true.I did have a great ""feelilng"" about the gameworld in the first hours, mainly due to the artwork and lighting and ""ambience.""  The main character had some... quirks... but I didn't mind at first.  And the ""puzzles"" were a little silly but I had decided at the outset to use a guide and avoid any frustrations with obscure puzzle solutions (see: Longest Journey).  So they were manageable, but tedious.  Maybe if I solved them on my own, I'd have found more reward in the puzzles, but I doubt it.But it became very clear after a couple hours that there was nothing fun or engaging to do.  As I said, the setting was fantastic (even if I was wrong about thinking I'd be playing in Siberia).  But the story was only mildly compelling, the puzzles were not fun or clever, and the characters were truly annoying.  The main character is a huge stick in the mud.  Both the writing and the voice acting for the main character are unbearable.  The same goes for the robot and every side character you run into.And then there's the running around.  Its as bad as even the good reviews say it is.   And that was WITH using a guide.  I have a lot of patience, but it ran out with the running around and the ""This door is locked"" and the ""I don't need to pick this up yet.""  The imaginative setting was not enough to deal with the pointless running around and flat out time-wasting activities.So as much as I wanted to get into a good sub-zero adventure game, I just couldn't.  The game started out as relaxing, but soon became just plain boring, and what worse thing could be said about entertainment?  I had to make a hard choice to put it down without finishing, or waste many more hours doing something that just bores and annoys.I think this game might appeal to adults looking for a nostalgia fix, or possibly little kids with a lot of imagination.  I'm not sure how many kids would put up with the running around though.  Then again it has hundreds of positive reviews, and I'm pretty disappointed that I didn't have the same experience as the average reviewer.			"

												I adore the setting, the art, the atmosphere, the interesting characters and the marvelous story.It is a joy to discover, especially cylinders and notes. I never even knew how fascinating mammoths are! From the French Alps to Syberia, you are carried away by a music box tune!So why the thumps down? Here comes the killjoy. The gameplay. Too many screens with nothing (no relevance, no clicks) that you are forced to navigate slowly to reach a place that may or may not advanced your story. Everyone who played this game spent more time walking around tedious screens than actual playing. Yes, I do love the art, but too much showcase without interaction dulls the experience. Also, it can somehow be confusing what you need to do and I bet that many will run out of patience to navigate and simply use a guide, which also destroyes the exploring part.			"

												First of all, if you’re playing on a Mac, know that the Mac version of this game is very different—in fact it’s a port of the iOS version, designed for touchscreens, so it has bobbing cursors all over the place and no ability to manage saved games (it autosaves). I highly recommend running the Windows game through Wine or Boot Camp if you can, or else you can read about the changes in a forum post.Now on to the review: In a nutshell, Syberia is about trying to keep a life-size wind-up train wound up so you can journey to find the brilliant nut who invented it.There’s also a mechanical man that speaks. You may ask, how could a machine made out of clockwork gears possibly have artificial intelligence? If “because it’s fun” isn’t a good enough answer, this game probably isn’t for you. But the game is fun, and it doesn’t take itself too seriously, although it does have its fair share of drama.Get this game if you enjoy adventures, clockwork contraptions, and caricatures.			"

												9/10 If you/re into the point and click genre, you will definitely like Syberia. It has lengthy gameplay, nice scenery (amazing graphics for the time), and the storyline is different than many other types of games in this genre, since most happen to delve more into the mystery category (e.g. Nancy Drew). If you're considering whether or not to get Syberia 1 & 2 separately or in the bundle, definitely get it in the bundle. You can't play one without finishing the other, and it's also much cheaper to buy it that way.			"

												Although Syberia is a dated point-and-click adventure game, it is still a pretty enjoyable game if you are willing to play it with the right mindset. If you keep in mind you are playing a 2002 point-and-click game and you are prepared to overlook dated mechanics from it's time for the sake of the story it can be worth about a dozen hours of story + gameplay. If you could skip many unnecessary animations like stairs and ladder climbing, I would say you could cut the gameplay by half. So yeah, be afraid of stairs.All things considered, if you are into the genre, this one is worth it. If you are not sure, just get it on a sale, like I did.			"

Really good for a 2002 point 'n click. Total playtime: 8h 45m (with walkthrough). I'm intrigued enough to want to play the next part in the trilogy.Bad:- Really big open locations, easy to get lost in.- Suffers from one or two ""moon logic"" puzzles that don't really make any sense. (What else is new with point 'n clicks.)- WAY too many ""I'll rub your back if you'll rub mine"" fetch quests, especially at the second location. At some point it starts to feel like a distraction from the plot. (Major gripe: it makes no sense that the bandstand hasn't worked for a decade if I could fix it this easily.)- The music is quite boring and repetitive.Good:- Intriguing setting and plot.- Beautiful character models and locations.- The ""meanwhile in America"" cellphone subplot adds an extra layer to Kate's character arc. - I really like Kate's walk cycle, which is feminine but not overtly sexualised.

												At $3.39 bundled with it's sequel, I thought it would be worth checking out.  I never played Syberia when I was younger, so consider this review untouched by nostalgia:Positives:- Compelling story- A new spin on the point & click (watching your character move around on the screen)- Beautiful sceneries- Kate looks a lot like Lara Croft (this is just a comment, not necessarily a positive.)- Very much like the Nancy Drew games, if you were into those like I was...Negatives:- As you must watch Kate run (double click!) across the screen, travelling time takes a bit longer than other games of this genre- Kate (the protagonist) is kind of...  lazy?  She regularly asks for help with things she could accomplish herself (hotelier carrying her suitcase, asking a little boy to push something heavy for her.)  She also does not engage well with others (cutting her mother & husband off on the phone, Not giving you the option to hear stories from the old man in the street.)  She's a bit hard to connect to for these reasons.Conclusion:- This is a good game to get if you are a fan of games like Nancy Drew.  I would not pay regular price for this -- but I'm happy with the sale price I got it for. :)			"

												I'm glad I played Syberia and Syberia II, since I missed them during their original releases, but would only recommend them for others lacking any nostalgic affection for them who appreciate playing older games for the academic exposure to earlier era gaming. The story is lacking and wastes a promising steampunk atmosphere, characters are comically imbecile and have horribly awkward dialogue, and the relatively small number of puzzles more tedious than challenging. I would recommend the first game over its sequel tenfold.			"

Syberia takes ""casual"" to the extremeI hate to say that I wouldn't recommend Syberia, because there are aspects of it that I really loved, and the amount of good reviews it has gotten has made it one of the few games I considered buying at full price (although luckily I snagged it and Syberia II on sale) but overall Syberia's gameplay takes most of the enjoyment from the game, takes it outside, and beats it relentlessly with a baseball bat.I have about 9 hours listed for playing Syberia, but I'd say only ~4 hours of that was actual gameplay, and the rest was simply clicking furiously at the edges of endless screens trying to make Kate Walker run through pointless scenery until I could get to the actual objective. I've played plenty of adventure games with click-based movement before, but what makes Syberia comparable in enjoyment to a lobotomy is that for at least the first half of the game 95% of the rooms and screens you run across have no objects, objectives, or point whatsoever except to look pretty, and you're left having to run across giant maps with maybe 3 useful rooms in them altogether, all of which are spread out.Oh and here's the solution to every other puzzle: You need a key. Chances are it's nearby. If you don't need a key then prepare for some moderate-yet-annoying pixelhunting, and running through every room 3 times because you got everything right but now there's an extra little something you need to do that seems to have no point other than to add another 30+ minutes of ""gameplay"" to Syberia.I will say the story is interesting enough. It could've been more in-depth but that would've cut into Kate's marathon time I'm sure. I liked listening to Kate's phonecalls as a side-story. The art -as pointless as it was at times - was very well done and pretty especially considering when the game originially came out. And I really did love all the characters within the game, as the majority seem very well thought out.Syberia is pretty, interesting, and it sure does seem like a classic adventure. But the long dragging gameplay will eventually have even the most casual point-and-click gamer feeling more like they're just doing a chore.			"

												Personally, the only thing this game has going for it is its beautifully detailed setting design. As shown in the game's picture description.Ive tried, but the game didnt keep my interest. -Story was meh; Main protaginist wants to buy a factory, unfortunate and mysterious events occured, goal is to find said person. -Characters I could care less(especially the ""automaton"" in the game's cover standing beside the main protaginist). Those related to Kate Walker will call her often and serve no purpose to the story. I recall only once when they are needed to solve a puzzle during my playthrough, but for the most part they are incredibly annoying.-Voice acting is hilarious as most of the voices sound American(SOME will have foreign accent), when this takes place in Syberia, Russia? -Puzzles were too easy and not enough variety. MOST puzzles are ""A puzzle has occured and its/or person is missing Object A, now get to walking or talking to get said Object A, then spam all dialogue options to solve the puzzle."" -Because most of the puzzles are like this, you'll be backtracking alot. My issue with this is the majority of the environments are sooo bland in appearance it makes it an eye and mindnumbing chore when backtracking. -Music is nice, but it drove me insane after being in certain chapters for long periods. Reason is because no matter what location you are in in a particular chapter (hotel, factory, cave, church, cemetary etc.) the same song will continue looping and playing. When you begin another chapter, the song will change, but the new song will be the ONE AND ONLY song that you'll be hearing over and over until you complete that chapter. Insanity for the ears.I stopped at Komkolzgrad: Dark Servitude. Practically 2/3 of the game I've completed. I could just finish, but if am not enjoying it, why bother? Overall, nice looking game, just too boring and mind numbing.Also, why does she have to stop and steadily walk up the stairs like as if she's scared to trip on her face? A nitpick, but it seriously kills the flow.*Sort of a Spoiler here below*Oscar is worthless, uninteresting, unfunny, and more of hinderance than anything.

												Huge flaw #1: While *most* of the time your cursor will change to indicate interactable objects, there are many cases where the cursor doesn't change at all. To find necessary objects requires clicking on every pixel on every screen. Some may say ""but you know you're supposed to click there because it has that interesting contraption clearly displayed"", but there's garbage beautifully strewn everywhere in the game's scenery. There's no way to beat the game without bruteforce or gamefaqs.Huge flaw #2: It takes forever for Kate's lethargic slow body to move anywhere. You can sometimes run by double clicking, but even the running is too slow and her animations are interrupted by things like stairs, doors, and small inclines, all of which cause Kate to halt and ponder each step for precious seconds while she lumbers her way inch by inch. And even if you manage to get the game to run in windowed mode, the game will pause if you alt-tab. So you can't even browse the web or play another game while waiting for Kate's prodigious girth to waddle across town.Flaw #3: The characters are annoying and unlikable. Especially when a dozen times per chapter you are interrupted by Kate's ringing cellphone and a meaningless conversation from her mom or boss or boyfriend or some other jerk you don't give a rat's posterior about.Don't buy the game, watch it on youtube, or get a spare bundle key from someone who can't find someone to unload their misery on.

Simple and disappointingI'm a fan of point-and-click exploration adventures, but after playing Syberia a couple of hours I'm very disappointed.The most glaring flaw is the characterizations.  The game's protagonist is female, but her actions and dialog are those of a stereotypical ""girl"": Kate needs help with tasks she should be able to handle easily: carrying her luggage to her room,  picking up and carrying an object because it's wet and dirty[[/spoiler].  Her relationships with her boss, mother, fiancee, and friend are trite and one-dimensional, but could have been written to show her as a person of strength.  We don't need another Lara Croft, but what's the point of making Kate the central character if she doesn't show some innate strength and intelligence?  The NPC's are all caricatures with some of the most stilted dialog imaginable.  The onscreen controls are sometimes frustrating when it's not clear that a hotspot leads to a new area or one you've already visited.  Strangely there are some screens that scroll as Kate moves, but most others transition to new screens.  The ""puzzles"", such as they are, rarely make intrinsic sense.   The way that clues and objects have been hidden is maddening: key  features often do not stand out from the background, and objects are found in places that make absolutely no sense.  A key hanging on a coat rack?  Really?Music and ambient sound effects are generally pleasant.  Sometimes the music drops into a foreboding minor key, usually signalling an important area, or an important event about to occur.  Other times it does so for no apparent reason.  Maybe it's a clue and I didn't pick it up?I will probably play the game through to completion and will probably play the sequel because the story is just compelling enough.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price for these games, nonetheless. "

												After hearing so much good things about Syberia and being in a mood a for a good adventure point and click game I decided to give Syberia a try. What a disappointment it is and a big one at that. Story You play as Kate Walker, a lawyer. You travel to a little town in Europe to the mission of completing a deal to buy a Toy Factory which actually makes automatons, which seem like robots but a little different as the game explains it, or tries because it doesn’t really explain it. Here we can begin pointing out one of the first of the many problems of the game, nothing is explained to you.The developers create a setting that is different from the usual, so if anything they should try to immerse you in it. One good way to do it would be to explain to you how some of these particular things are, how they work or pretty much anything interesting about it but no, better to be left in the dark, I guess.The story itself is boring and bland. Without spoiling anything while trying to settle the deal for the purchase of this factory you learn about some of the history of some characters. Bare in mind that those characters are either dead or you have not yet met them. To give the game a little credit, this is by far the best part of the game, the backstory of what happened years ago. Of course the game wouldn’t present it to you in a interesting manner, that would be asking too much, instead you are presented with a book to read. About 10 pages or more. It’s not that bad but as it is the best part of the game and the only thing that gives context to many of the stuff that you see and some puzzles one would thing they would do a better job at presenting it.With a boring scenario and story that leaves us to the characters and I’m sorry to say, they’re also just as bad. First, your main character, Kate Walker. She is alright at best. You don’t get much room to see her being relatable but at least she’s not annoying not anything. There are however some things that could make her seems better as everynow and then you get a cellphone during the game as people in your life want to talk to you, be it your boss, boyfriend, friend or mother. The problem here is that when talking to pretty much any of these people, when you think it would help to create Kate’s character, it does, but in an opposite way one would hope. Everyone gets the last word with her, it almost makes you feel sorry for her being kind of stupid and helpless and aside from her friend, every person that calls her seem boring.There are also the characters you meet which believe or not are even worse. One of the first characters you have to interact with is a retar... mentally disabled kid which tags along with you for while and you can guess how much depth he has… zero. This only goes on and on with every character which are boring to the extreme with the sole exception being the robot/automatron Oscar. He seems to be the only interesting and creative character of the game and lo and behold, the only interesting character in a point and click adventure game is a robot. Not your character, not anyone you meet but a robot.  Music What music? It seems the game does have some music but it barely plays. Most of the time you are walking around in a complete silence with only the marvelous sound of your footsteps. Occasionally some music does play and it is beautiful but it’s so rare you barely forget there is any music for about 90% of the time you’re playing.  Graphics The environments do have a nice mood to it. They look nice, of course, understanding this game is some years old but despite of that, the game does look nice. What its’t nice, however, is that every item, door, or pretty much anything you have to interact seem to be hidden behind some huge amount  of crap in the front of it or some horrible camera angles that obscures anything worth noting. I do appreciate when developers take the care to not make items stand out so much they are almost shinning in contrast to the background but here they made sure to make it virtually invisible. Most items you can only probably notice when mousing over them, otherwise you would probably miss them entirely. Gameplay With all that out of the way, it leaves us to gameplay and partially continuing what I was saying about the graphics, when you can’t see anything in a point and click game, you can imagine how the gameplay is gonna be like. This is the killer for me. Everything is a pixel hunt and that only helps to make the gameplay slow.Talking about slow, how about mentioning the movement speed our main characters walks? Let me just say, it’s so slow you can probably do something else while she walks from screen to screen and to add to it, there are a ton of screen to walk around with barely anything worthwhile to do, look, or experience. It seems like it’s padding to make the game seem longer than it actually should be.In fact, it seems like every action Kate does is in slow motion, like climbing a set of stairs, for example. Depending of the stairs they seem to take about 5 to 15 seconds just so she can climb it and another 15 seconds to climb back down. Did I mention there’s a ton of backtracking in this game. Well, then get ready to have fun walking super slow back and forth and waiting for the slowest of the animations to get anywhere.Only thing left to mention is the puzzles and by god, they are among the worst I’ve seen. Most of them feel like they are completely random, especially when you are giving pretty much zero indication about how to proceed. Recently I’ve heard of the term “moon logic” and I think it is the perfect way to express my perception of the puzzles in Syberia. They have no logic one could think of unless they lived in the moon or maybe the crazy world from Alice in Wonderland.  Overall I’ve played games that take a while to begin, many adventure games and visual novels suffer from that, the problem with Syberia is that it never gets anywhere. I love puzzle games when they have some thought put into them. Sometimes, you play a game in this genre but one of its aspects leaves something to be desired, a game may have some weird puzzles but a good story, bad story but with good characters, weird characters but nice music, etc. The problem with Syberia is that for me it did everything wrong.If you would like to see my other reviews, please,  check my blog	[mayonakareviews.wordpress.com] "

												It's an interesting premise, I'll give it that. White-washed steam punk isn't steam-punk, but nice try. The main character is really bad at her job, so playing as her isn't all that satisfying. Automotons and mammoths though...eh, could be worse. I'd recommend this game, but the pacing is so slow that I wouldn't want anyone to have to suffer the way I did.			"

												Decent point and click adventure. But I’m not sure, if the game is recommendable. There is lots of pixel hunting and active objects are blended with garbage, so it is nearly impossible to select them without trying every single pixel on the screen. Logic of some puzzles is also questionable. I must even use walkthrough about six times. Every time I just miss some item. Plot is OK, it started with nice tempo. However once you get through first location it become painfully slow. It’s just collecting random items and talking to random persons. The ending is open (you should buy Syberia 2 too). Besides that, it is just one really big example of dues ex machine.  "

												Not worth it.  Not at all like MYST (the only reason I got it) The only reason I played Syberia for so long is that I am literally addicted to point and click adventure game, but I reached a point where I though ""why in the flying ♥♥♥♥ am I playing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game!""  The game is just waaaaay to ♥♥♥♥ing slow, for example clicking on an object causes the main character to take FOREVER to go from one side of the screen to the other.  Also, the puzzles range from ridiculously easy to ""wtf..... really I was supposed to click the object just like this instead of this;  I quit immediately after encoutering such events more than once.  Also, the plot was full of holes;  I won't ruin the story, but in one place, you literally cannot proceed because birds are in your way!  Point and click adventures are typically like this, you cannot proceed until you unlock the puzzle, but for ♥♥♥♥'s sake, birds!  It's just cheesy as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  DON'T buy, even Syberia II which is practically the same (graphics-wise, I didn't actually play it)			"

												I can't keep playing this. Every single thing you do in this game is SO PAINFULLY SLOW. You will be forced to walk across zones multiple times and endure excruciatingly painful stairway and ladder animations. This game could have greatly benefitted from a fast travel or skip to next area function. The situations you get into are absurd and so is every single character you interact with. It also suffers from adventure game logic which will force you to look for a guide more often than not. I'm apparently halfway through, but I can't put up with this any longer.			"

												I think this is one of those adventure games that has aged in a bad way. It's not that the puzzles are difficult, per se, but it has an extremely frustrating mechanic where you are forced to talk to the same person repeatedly to unlock the next part of the story, and if you click through the dialog at reading pace instead of listening to the full audio then it doesn't trigger the unlock. As a result you can spend a lot of time backtracking and sitting through conversations you already had just so you can interact with an unrelated object elsewhere, which in turn unlocks another long dialog in the first location. This would be fine if the characters were compelling, but the universe is just not particularly to my tastes - it is sort of a quirky magical realist steampunky thing that makes me wish I could get back to the ""real life"" story on the other end of the phone. Maybe worth the effort if the universe captures your imagination, but not for me. I gave up partway through Syberia II. For old adventures I would recommend The Longest Journey over this series.			"

												Now I want to say I don't recommend this game because it is bad, I personally feel it hasn't aged well and since I did not play it originally I have no fond memories of it to uphold for me. I did get this in a bundle sale with Syberia 2.The storyline is interesting and the art/graphics for it's time is very well done, but I feel the mechanics aren't necessarily the best. I HATED that it makes you do fetch quests, especially to areas you have already been to several times before. I felt like that was what makes the game ""longer."" Now I have not beaten it yet, but as you can see by my hours logged into playing it, I spent a good amount of time playing. Most of it again being me running back and forth. I have currently arrived at ""Komkolzgrad,"" and I do plan on beating the game. If i feel I need to update this review I shall. P.S. I hate Oscar...			"

												Good graphics, challenging puzzles, captivating storyline. What I didnt like about this game - lots of sections where you could walk to the edge of the screen, but there was no sign of that from the mouse (meaning it only lit up in certain spots telling you to go there but not in others), you had to figure it out yourself and that got me stuck a few times not knowing where to go. Also, there were a lot of sections to walk thtough that were pointless. Couldn't pick anything up, couldn't do anything in them. They were jus there for graphics and when you are running back and forth trying to figure out a puzzle thats a pain. I like challenging puzzles but some of the puzzles were insane and there was no hint option or anything which I also didn't like. Wouldn't play the series again.			"

												Maybe it was good in its day(when it was first released,) but games have advanced enough that I don't have the patience to play games with such slow movement mechanics, and hardcore linear gameplay. Was a blast from the past for a short afternoon. It could be rereleased with some major upgrades and then I would consider playing it again, until the end. I tried for hours and loved the story. But eventually frustration set in and I uninstalled.			"

												Good graphics, challenging puzzles, captivating storyline. What I didnt like about this game - lots of sections where you could walk to the edge of the screen, but there was no sign of that from the mouse (meaning it only lit up in certain spots telling you to go there but not in others), you had to figure it out yourself and that got me stuck a few times not knowing where to go. Also, there were a lot of sections to walk thtough that were pointless. Couldn't pick anything up, couldn't do anything in them. They were jus there for graphics and when you are running back and forth trying to figure out a puzzle thats a pain. I like challenging puzzles but some of the puzzles were insane and there was no hint option or anything which I also didn't like. Wouldn't play the series again.			"

												I like that it's an old-school adventure game. I like the steampunk-ish automotons.That said, this game is excruciatingly terrible. The controls alone will make the most patient man tear out his hair. The voice acting is atrocious. There is no game manual--I had to scour the web just to find out how to RUN. And believe me, if you have any shred of sanity, you won't want to spend the entire game WALKING back and forth between boring destinations, going on mindless fetch quests and arguing with beauracratic non-humans. I paid $3.74 for this and its sequel. Not a lot of money. Still, I wouldn't wish this on someone who got it for free. Don't waste your time, go play Riven or Beyond a Steel Sky instead.			"

												I'm not going to fault Syberia for its pacing or its Guide Dang It puzzles or its demand to hunt pixels. I used to play Sierra games back in the day and Syberia is an artifact of its time, which makes it rather slow, linear, and obtuse from a modern viewpoint.No, what bugs me about Syberia is its savoir faire. It has a style, and that's fine... but when that style is built with backstory and plot to basically make a Gary Stu the most important man in the world, where everyone must love him if they have a soul, and everyone /does/ love him because he's so special... that bugs me. Okay, so there's a guy who's such a mechanical genius that he can make mechanical life. Fine. But then he makes all his mechanisms toys because he's simple, you see, he's so innocent and pure. If that's not saccharine enough to make your teeth hurt, the developers start to assume you're some sort of mouthbreather and actually spell it out for you: he is pure and innocent and just and kind and has never done anything wrong ever, in pretty much so many words.Maybe it's because I'm an engineer by trade, but the game smacks of an alternate history wondering why we couldn't all be more innocent. Why couldn't our society be made by toymakers with quaint clockwork mechanisms running everything? Others have spoken about how the game is anti-American; I think it's more anti-modern since it hails back to pastoral scenes in rural towns and, of course, the clockwork... yet as much as they say that the Good Old Days were so great, said Good Old Days never were and the clockwork fantasy underlines that they don't even want to sacrifice anything for the Good Old Days. We want our toymaker utopia, but with faster, better trains and /artificial life/ slave labor. I've no time for backwards-looking utopias, since the past wasn't as great as everyone makes it out to be. I've got even less time than that for backwards-looking utopias that want all of the benefits of technological society without any of its drawbacks, because mechanical magic will somehow keep the spring-loaded spaceships from being missiles or the wind-up automatons from being soldiers or the super-fast super-green trains from being tanks.

												Syberia has good graphics (albeit dated), and music but the story and gameplay just aren't on the same level. Maybe it's because it's more of a interactive cinematic experience than a game, but it seems so unnecessarily long. While you'll get ~10+ hrs of playtime, most of it is spent walking/running/climbing stairs and trying useless locked doors around rather than solving puzzles. There seem to be gratuitous long shots and panning shots of scenery that serve no other purpose than to show off the scenery, because there isn't anything that can be interacted with in those scenes, which means lots and lots of walking/running to get to the next screen. There are also lots of stairs and ladders that cause Kate Walker to slow down and climb step by step and normal pace. Throw in some backtracking and the minutes of walking/running/climbing add up to hours. For a game with a story, sometimes you have no idea what you're doing since it's rather easy to do things before they make any narrative sense, especially in Valadilene where you aren't told much of anything. Mostly, in the first two areas (Valadilene and Barockstast), you're just wandering around trying locked doors because there are no maps or directions to so-and-so place you're supposed to go. You'd think Kate Walker would at least try to ask someone where the notaary was or the rector's office instead of wasting time running around trying to find the place.The story felt flat to me. It doesn't really go anywhere for most of the game and ends in a cliffhanger. You get Kate Walker's backstory through incessant phone calls that interrupt gameplay, but the subplot or even Kate Walker's story seems pointless in the grand scheme of things. Every phone conversation felt like Kate Walker didn't particularly care, even though her relationships were falling apart. That's probably no surprise given how she has no qualms about breaking and entering, theft, and manipulating people, but given how every NPC is incompetent, unhelpful or insane, that's probably the only way the story advances.It's frustrating how almost every NPC is incompetent, cowardly unhelpful, and/or insane. In fact, the incompetency and cowardice drive the puzzles on the journey to search for the heir, and the puzzle aren't even directly related to the plot. It's just multiple long chains of small favor type quests after Valadilene. There just aren't any likable characters, except maybe the hotel manager at Aralbad, who seems to be the only person with any good sense.			"

												TLDR:  Double click to run and right click to skip dialogue, you may also want some tranqualisers and a yoga instuctor to hand for mental health purposes, as this game is that frustrating.  Oh and gals; prepare to feel like you did in the 80's in terms of progressive female leads in the gaming industry. Disclaimer:  I'm completely shocked by 1. the copious positive reviews for this game, and 2. that the game was made in this century.  I love a good adventure game, but I'm struggling to find any lately, hence going back to some old ones and this was recommended in one of those lists, thank god I bought it on sale is all I can say at this point.   Also, it's circa 2005 with no autosave feature, I'm pretty sure other games had this by that point, what a wierd thing to not include?  Anyhow, here goes.  +vesIt's prettySome inventive puzzlesInteresting storyline underneath the surperflous padding-out nonesense-vesBoringlacking in content and in stuff to doSome pretty outdated ideas of feminity - as in like a century out of date, whilst superficially trying to appear modern.Needlessly drawn out game play:  animations, dialogue, spread out environments - STAIRS!No maps in really convulted areasToo much boring dialogueUnskippable animationsMore on stairs - Kate has a serious almost crippling phobia of them it seemsSoap opera side plot which ironically provides an excellent example of why the Bechdel test is so important It's really wierd for me to bring this up as it's not really been an issue since the 80's - I've been gaming since I was 7 which was in 1988, and although some games may have some superficial problems with sexism (GTO being the worst offender, and not superfical about it either), most games by this point are far, FAR more inclusive than they were back then.  My biggest gripe with this as a female gamer is that the femminist revolution seems to be something that happened somewhere else - if the writting here is anything to go by at least.  As most of us are aware this occurred in the 60's, yet the protaganist has this strange twee way of speaking, more akin to the 19th or early 20th century.  Then there's what she's saying;  and we are supposed to believe that this woman is a lawyer?!  She spends the entire game being submissive, impassive and the entire point of her existence seems to be for her boyfriend or boss; both of whom are petulant children who need to be told to ♥♥♥♥ off, like now.  How the hell did this gal get through law school?  The side plot revolving around this is hilariously predictable and the culmination is as dull as its content.  It gets worse, the women in her life can't even get the game passed the Bechdel test (yes they only talk about Kate's boyfriend and boss) - it strikes me as stereotypical female drama (think rom-coms, I ♥♥♥♥ing hate rom-coms) as seen through the eyes of a man, a man most likely born in the 40's - it's somewhere between complete ignorance and straight up contempt.  And I don't know whether this is more confusing for me or the guy that wrote this, it's just frigging wierd.  Even by the time our protagist shrugs off the shackles that is her peer group (spoiler not spoiler - its at the end), you'll stil want to smack her in the face.  Grow a pair of ovaries love, seriously, you're embaressing the rest of us.  Then there's her personality - she's all over the place, and it doesn't really represent the unimaginative arc she's given;  Which I think is, a woman finds herself by being thrown in to a wierd adventure and in doing so realises that she can't keep sacrificing herself for what others expect and demand of her, and finally - but not really - she tells them all to do one.  What about the mechanics?  Aaaaarrrrrghhhhh!  Kate will run if you double click, this is one of the few elements this game has incorportated from more modern adventure games.  However there is no screen wrapping and every time you hit some stairs (and yes they are all over the place), kate stops suddenly as if she's come to a precipice, she then painstakingly prepares herself like an elderly person due for a hip raplcement at the bottom of said stairs, before  ardously climbing them: I'm pretty sure people pass kidney stones quicker than this.  Then there's the inventory system which is clumbsy and no you cannot combine items.  And there's the bugs, I had two crashes for no reason, and if you alt tab to say your media player on your second monitor, the background graphics get knocked out until you change scenary and trust me; you will want to watch something whilst playing this, in order to quench the sheer monotonous boredom.   You will also have to restrict the game to 256 colour in the game.exe properties in order to get it to run on win X (and most likely any OS later than XP).  Finally, beware of the huge amount of content in the form of diaries etc, as it's all as excruciatingly dull and verbose as the verbal conversations and adds very little to the story or as clues for puzzles.Puzzles?  I can barely remember them as they are completely overshadowed by the extremely slow pacing, there were some good ones in there (I think), but the spread out environments really hurt them and are clearly another exercise in dragging the game time out.  Then there's the multitiude of unskippable animations to conversations or interactions with certain objects, it passes bordering on the ridiculous after about an hour of gameplay.  Of those puzzle's I can remember some are very poorly implemented.  For example, there's one involving a blood sample that I had to read a walkthrough for as the game gives you only one way obtaining the second sample and if you miss it and do what most people would do, you will not be able to fix it and proceed - I ended up going back a save and found that the missed option is only noticiable when you are looking for it and does not in anyway resemble the way the first sample is obtained.  This is not an isolated example and it amounts to some lazy writting and design imo.Other problems:  The reading, oh my god the reading, there's so much and its written so, so, so badly.  The only time where the dialogue seemed less twee was in a diary, but that's only because it starts in the early 20th century!  The voice acting is nativity play calibre, and that comparison might actually be more insulting to the children.  To make matters worse these uninspired conversations go on for what seems like longer than the aforementioned diary, and they are all frigging terrible.  I wonder whether the acting would be so bad if the actors weren't so clearly directed to speak so ♥♥♥♥ing slowly.  You will roll your eyes to the point of muscle strain.If you're new to adventure games, I'm again recommending the Broken Sword series, Discworld Noir and more recently Still life.  The modernised telltale fair are pretty good too although I would definitely avoid The walking Dead Michone series and Game of thrones, as they are also boring and eye roll inducing.  The rest of the TWD are great and ignore the horror porn comments about the female protaganist in the second season and frontier, cos guess what?   Kids go though some serious♥♥♥♥♥♥sometimes and I dont think it helps anyone by shying away from that reality, especially when talking about a sodding zombie apocolypse!  The wolf among us and Life is strange however, put most of these to shame, so save them for last as they may spoil you in terms of expectations in other games of this ilk.  This however, kill it, kill it with fire.			"

												This game has that great style of graphics that was popular in the 90s where games were played with 3D models of characters with immaculate paintings for scenery and props which makes it immersive and fun to explore the game world.However, the visual triumph of this game is ruined spectacularly by it's major game mechanics - point and click, and puzzle solving. This game is outrageously confusing and unlike good point and click adventure games, this one doesn't give you the sligthest hint of suggestion or guidence (which can done well if the suggestions are subtle and not in your face), there is absolutely NOTHING telling you what you're supposed to be doing! For example, I found my way to this train, I figured I needed to travel to Syberia via this train, I found a robot that was specially programmed to drivie trains but needed new legs, so I went around finding him some new legs and he got to the train and I was all set and ready to go but he wouldn't take me. Hours later after I had searched the ENTIRE mansion and land around it I find nothing of use, so I looked on the internet to find out wtf to do and it turns out I needed to go to this church WAY back at the start of the game WHICH WAS ALWAYS LOCKED FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE TIME I SPENT IN THAT AREA, MIGHT I ADD.When I have to look online for walkthroughs on how to play a point and click game is when it fails as a point and click game in my opinion.

												Syberia would work better as an interactive novel (like Device 6) or even a motion comic. I'm judging it in 2014, so it's hard to put on your 2002-goggles and see the game when those mediums weren't nearly as popular as they are now. It has fantastic art, a unique setting, and the sort of characters you'd want in any form of fiction, but the gameplay isn't just plodding and unchallenging, it completely detracts from the experience. Even when you know exactly what to do or where you want to go, you often have to traverse multiple empty, pointless, often pretty scenes. It takes 5 minutes to do absolutely anything (start run animation, come to full stop, change scene, start run animation...) and much of the game involves running back and forth between 2-3 points. It's certainly not a bad experience, but it wasn't one I needed to spend 8 hours on. Maybe I'm spoiled by modern action packed short games like Telltale adventures that focus on fun, but you can tell Syberia is an art project first and game second. The closest gaming analog I can think of is Gadget: Past as Future if that's your sort of thing.			"

												They should have called this game ""Kate Walker Wanders Aimlessly About in a European Village."" I cannot believe how much of the game play is watching this character move through a handful of screens consecutively only to interact with an object that leads her to need to walk another painful distance to interact with a single other object. Again and again, with only a few dialogues on the phone here and there to add some semblance of a story. Agony. I really was interested in watching a story unfold, but I couldn't get over the staggering amount of boredom between trivial additions to the plot. This would even be acceptable if exploration was interesting in this game. Sadly, it is not. I can only listen to the main character declare he she ""can't go in there"" so many times before I throw my entire PC out the window.It is my recommendation that you take such action with your own PC if you find this game in your library.

												Unless you're on an old XP desktop or earlier, i'd advise against taking a chance on this one- because I'm getting a bit sick of steam selling flat out broken games. It is nearly impossible to get Syberia to run on a modern machine. I somehow managed to do so for one ~30 min session, only to come back later and find that it is once again completely unable to function. Which is unfortunate because what little i got to see of the game looked promising. I'd honestly try for a refund but i got it on sale and steam's refund policy is so needlessly draconian that i'm not going to bother.			"

												This game is a showcase as what killed the Point & Click Adventure game genre.Your money would be better spent otherwise. If you like adventure games, try the Blackwell Series. If you have already played those, well, try watching grass grow. It's more fun that way.For most Point & Click Adventure games, I'd tolerate as I am really into this genre. However, this game is too much an agony that I cannot finish even with the help of walkthrus.Please, it's not enjoyable when I have to spend minutes doing NOTHING but watching the main character running across the screen. The 100th time.And no, it is not enjoyable when you give me an address, and every single door in the game comes WITHOUT any sort of identification, causing me to spend HOURS trying every single door. And please, do not mock your humble players with that ""You can't miss it"" line. It is not funny.Don't even get me started on those plot items.I could have written pages about how this game went wrong, but no, I am not paid for teaching the devs how to make games right. And especially with Steam not having a return policy that I can't have my money back.In short, play something else unless you have a very good reason to punish youself with playing this ""game"".

												It's pretty to look at, but I can't find many other pros.The story is very simple and it doesn't make a lot of sense. Plus there are no big surprises, nothing exciting that you find out as the game proceeds, which makes the characters quite plain and the game not very interesting.The worst thing is how much you have to run back and forth to complete a puzzle. You spend more time running than doing anything else.For these reasons, I found the game very boring, and the finale of both #1 and #2 were quite disappointing.I think there are way better adventures out there, in terms of story, characters and puzzles.

												Boring game. Might have been once a rather pretty game to look at but these days (2013) there are no points to be gained there. To be honest I am not much of a fan of adventure games but I've played some. Probably the most uninteresting part of this game are the automatons that are in the core of this game. Automatons and mammoths. Neither group interests me.After I noticed this was not really my game I picked up a walkthrough guide and dashed through. I was not impressed by the story although there were several 'ok' elements.  I would say however that if you are not a hardcore adventure game fan this game does not really have anything to offer. It's all seen before (by now) and all notable things have been implemented better in a title or another. I'm not saying this game is bad but it's not in any way interesting either.			"

												Honestly, I didn't last too long playing this. Alt-Tab'ing seemed to break the game until you moved to a new room/location, and trying to figure out what I had to do next was a rather frequent and irritating problem. I'm not really a fan of point and click games, nor of older games in general, so I'm not the kind of person who would normally play a game like this.

												Pros:+ unique premise+ pre-rendered scenes still look goodCons:- real-time rendered characters do not look good anymore- annoyingly voiced dialogue (English)- serious holes in plot for a story-driven gamePicked up this game on Steam sale on the promise of a good story and reasonable puzzles. I was disappointed. While the game is one of the few to actually present an original premise (so many are derivatives of a “you are a quiet antihero looking for vengeance”) the entirety of the plot is really presented in the first few minutes of the game. Character development takes place through a series of phone calls which are supposed to show the personal growth of the main character through the use of a sub-plot, but really have no connection to the main events of the game, nor do they server to connect you to the hero. It is also unfortunate that the English voice-acting (can’t speak for other language tracks) is overdone, so that you find yourself skipping dialogue lines as quickly as you can read them, rather than listen to the hammy delivery. In spite of this, I could still have lived with the story, were it not for a number of serious troubles with the plot (see spoiler section to read my beefs).Story was to be my main attraction, but the game still could have been saved by looking pretty or playing well. Graphics have aged considerably, and no longer look presentable (excepting fixed-angle, pre-rendered scenery), while the game features a boring “click and wait while your character walks slowly across the screen” interface. This dynamic is exacerbated by the fact that many puzzles have you walking from one place to another to deliver an item or take a second look at an area now opened by dialogue.***************SPOILER ALERT – Complaints about Story***************Hans sent plans so a train could be built. Who built the tracks? Who built the winding stations? Why didn’t Hans just follow them to (the presumably final) destination of Syberia?Except for his role in obstructing your progress, what does the automaton do that you couldn’t? Why not just leave him and drive the train yourself?Where has Hans been in between the University/factory and appearing at the salt flats? He isn’t said to have recently departed anywhere you visit, but he shows up at the same time as (and presumably with) a plane headed to NY?The Professor’s lecture says that the mysterious aboriginal Russians have not been observed in their native practices for 100+ years and then goes on to give extensive detail about their habits and legends. Unless he is somehow omnipotent, this whole lecture makes no sense.			"

												This is, in all honesty, quite poor. The story is, however, very interesting but buyers should note it doesn't really conclude stopping half-way through the story arc one is led to believe you are on.The graphics are very pretty in a slightly old-school rendered way, but the main character's animation is poor and inventory implementation etc rather clunky and ridiculously large considering the small number of objects you can collect.Puzzles are generally very simple if you pick up everything that's not nailed down as you wander around - most of the challenge lies in understanding the odd programmers assumptions about the main character. I was stuck for many hours at one point because I didn't understand that apparently a girl won't touch an oar that's been in the water and needs to ask a disabled boy to pick it up for her.Arguably worth it for the retro-adventure fan as it was kind-of pleasing, but only just even at the very low prices it goes for now.Worth noting you have to mess around to run it on Win7/8/etc			"

												A lot of people fondly remember Syberia, which strikes me as odd because, finally having played it, I find it's pretty bad. I guess it got marks for being released at a time when no one was making point-and-click adventures so it was the only way for fans of the genre to get ther fix.First off it has really boring puzzles. The only time I ever got stuck was when I couldn't believe that the puzzles could be that simple. Yeah, the genre gets flak for having incomprehensible logic behind the puzzles, but that's a huge part of what made them fun and memorable. That ah-ha moment when you find the designer's line of logic and it all comes together. I'm streching to even call these puzzles. One major one involves tring to fix a mechanical bandstand. The first part of the puzzle is basically a trading quest to get the obvious item needed to open it up and when I got inside I assumed there would be some kind of Myst style mechanical puzzle to fix it. Nope, you pull a lever and it's solved. That's this game's puzzles in a nutshell.Then there's this game's travesty of a traslation and dialogue. It's not even hilariously bad ala Kings Quest V. You're travelling across Europe for ♥♥♥♥'s sake and maybe three character's even speak with a European accent. Who directed these voice actors? Did they even read the title of this game much less the description? Then the writing alternated between bad drama and bad witty banter. Not ever offensively bad and at times there's a spark of charm about it, but coupled with dull gameplay it's hard to care.I will give the game points for visuals. It looks a lot like Final Fantasy VIII with a lot of old looking European architecture that speaks of a long history, but also of areas that have hit hard times with building slowly falling apart and mechanical things beginning to go to rust. The game has an appealing alternate present aesthetic going on that isn't explored much, but I still kind of liked it. Nothing enough to save the game from dull gameplay.			"

The graphics are not the most impressive, but if you are willing to look past that and the sometimes frusterating puzzles, this is definitely a game to try.

												In one word, this game is charming. Visually beautiful, always interesting, and so full of life, Syberia is one of those games that sticks with you long after you've played it. The people are as colorful and interesting as the environments, even the minor characters you don't need to speak with have distinct personalities. The attention to story-telling detail of this game shows that the makers truely cared about what they made.Typical of the point-and-click adventures of that time, there are moments where you are left waiting for a character to run from point A to point B, and sometimes details can be overlooked and cause frustration, but it does not manage to detract from the beauty and heart of this game. Besides, the game is old enough now that there is a plethora of walkthroughs to pick from for when you get stuck.If you want an adventure and like getting lost in the charm of an old world, this game is for you.

												A brilliant game, ahead of it's time. Of the steampunk genre, both the story and the scenery are beautiful, and the charecters well-developed. With a dash of humor at some times, and a pinch of sadness at others, as well as an overall sense of nostalgia, this is a point-and-click player's dream game. Difficult, to be sure, and at times frustrating, but who wants a game that is too easy?All-in-all, a well-rounded game. If there is anything that might be considered a drawback, it is that the controls are slightly... slow. It is mildly time-consuming just to get around. However, the gorgeous environment generally makes up for that, and the attention to detail is astounding.			"

												A Very Good Point and ClickPros:+Good story.  There's a lot going on and a decent amount of mystery.+Good setting and mood.  The whole thing is set against this backdrop of a company that makes clockwork robots and gadgets, so it has almost a vaguely steampunk feel, while at the same time being cheery and grounded in reality.  At the same time, you travel between levels that each have their own unique feel.+Good puzzles.  Rarely do you encounter things that can't be solved with a little bit of thought and problem-solving skill.Cons:-No ending.  You have to play Syberia 2 to get the next part of the story.			"

												The best and worst thing I can say about Syberia is that it often feels like playing through a European landscape painting.It has that Myst-vibe. The environments are empty, but mysterious and interesting. It's also a design choice: the only objects you can interact with are objects that the main character, ""Miss Kate Walker"", wants to pick up or use or talk to.Thus there's little commentary on the surroundings. No ""look at cliff"" or ""pick up microwave"" - just a few hotspots.Which, to my disappointment, are easy to miss. There is no ""press a button to reveal all points of interest"" functionality. And many of the puzzles are obtuse. The game makes you run around a lot. Often multiple times through same places. Luckily the backgrounds are gorgeous and atmospheric (made even more so by the musical score). Also, an FAQ comes very handy, unless you like running around aimlessly. The game mostly shows its age in how off-putting and non-user-friendly its design often is. Which is a shame. If they ever make an HD remake - they should! - these are issues they should fix. (And they would be easy to fix, too.)The characters and the story are very good, however, and a reason enough to keep on playing. Also, the endgame is very satisfying. I was honestly moved by the story and taken to love the characters, despite some cheesy dialogue.Can't wait to play Syberia II next, because I crave to spend more time in the magical world of Syberia.Rating: 8/10			"

												Syberia is a pure adventure game.It brings you to a breath taking and beautiful adventure where you will discover the life of its people, their culture through out a nice written story and awesome art direction. Syberia has quiet challenging puzzle through out the game and it might take you a while to figure out but they are interesting and nicely put together that makes you never bored of it. Story is just awesome.Sound effects are appropriate and realistic.It really deserves to be a well known classic. Graphicaly its not much in 2014-15 but its nice enough to play with it.Syberia is an unforgettable game and journey for the mind....			"

												This somewhat-epic (length) adventure game has you taking on the role of Kate Walker, a lawyer securing the rights to a toy automation factory somewhere in france. The story takes you across several locations spanning all the way to eastern europe. Most of the puzzles are pretty simple fetch quests placed along with the story filling the gaps in between. The game could really have used a tooltip for clickable locations as it can be hard to find specific items and places due to the cursor system being a simple glowing/not glowing/magnifying glass method. Also the characters seem (vocally) really out of place for their expected locales. Still, at a cheap price, this adventure game is hard to beat.			"

												Mixes very good with very bad.On the plus side, as you can see from the shots, the background art is stunning and imaginative. Also the clockwork fantasy theme appeals on a subjective level, and the script and voice acting are generally fine, bar a few odd casting moments (a cockney-scripted npc read in a jarringly posho way, for example) and fair few irritating characters. Puzzle-wise, the game is pretty fair, especially to begin with, and pixle-hunting is minimal throughout.However it grows increasingly exasperating, with multiple instances of a path, or action, somewhere behind you being arbitrarily ""unlocked"" only after completing an unrelated action, hence there is a lot of aimless back-tracking. This is made all the more painful, and less forgivable, by the lack of any ""fast-travel"" function, and the almost absurdly expansive areas go from being an asset to a curse. Some of this is excusable given the game's age, whereas some leads to the conclusion that the game was simply rushed, as the ambition shown by the landscape design isn't quite matched for quality by the rest of the game. Overall the game would be far better if the work done on the game-world was halved and that time was spent on polishing the puzzles and features instead. The positives will be enough for some (including myself) to soldier through but your patience will be tested.			"

												Very dry and I'd even call it dull at times. That said, I can't really say I don't like this game.  It's a visual treat for the eyes, a mostly realistic world, starting in a small villaiage in Russia, altered somewhat by a fantasy steampunkish clockwork science. Graphics and pretty views are not enough to support a game alone, and I would not give it thumbs up if that were the only positive.  I did say 'dry and dull', but, while it takes a while to get to the point, the story it tells is a solid 8 outta 10,  and a number of the recurring characters are memorable.  Fair warning in advance, this is only half the story, and ends without real closure.  The sequel, Syberia 2 is the continuation, and actually wraps things up, so, if you want to get this one, you'll need to get the next one, too.			"

												This game has an absorbing story and beautiful locations, all of which have depth and a backstory. The whole premise of the game is intriguing and once you've got over the slow start you find yourself wanting to learn more and more.It isn't without its frustrations. Some of the locations exist only to provide scenery, so moving from location to location can literally be measured in ""clicks"". But that's a minor frustration - my wife and I played both Syberia and Syberia 2 and enjoyed them very much.Observations:1) Kate Walker has difficulty with stairs and ladders.2) No one in the game is allowed to refer to Kate by her first name. It must always be ""Kate Walker"".3) The bakery is never open. "

												I bought Syberia and Syberia 2 in a steam sale pack for $1.24. To say the least, I got a lot more than I paid for.Syberia is a point and click adventure game where you play as a female protaganist who's on a business trip to finalize the sale of an old automaton factory in Europe. Before you had the chance to arrive, the old lady that you needed to meet with passes away, leaving you with the task of finding her long lost brother.  Everything about this game just blew me away. I didn't realize it at first, but Syberia is one of those few adventure titles that actually contain everything that I could ever want in an adventure game and the story is so well done. It's very relaxing so don't expect anything with guns and chaos. If you love adventure, pick this series up. You won't regret it. "

This game you play as Kate Walker a land contractor or something along that line and you are sent to buy this automaton-making factory in a small town, and lo and behold the owner to the factory died right before you came. The rest of the story is for you to find out as play. Also, in my opinon, Kate's mom is kinda annoying, calling about what dress she should wear and such.			"

												Overall score: 9 out of 10For me an adventure game is not about gameplay or graphics, it's about story and puzzles. Syberia was launched in 2002 and I first played it when I was still in Highschool. During my first playthrough almost 10 years ago, I found the puzzles to be somewhat difficult, but in the present I find them to be quite easy, and I'm not saying that because I've already played the game, cause honestly I didn't remembered a single thing from my first playthrough. In my opinion the lack of difficulty that I've experienced in the present is due to the fact that  I've got more experienced with solving puzzles and because I think that with the age you see things differently, more logical. Returning back to the game, the story is quite good, although the characters seem too polite in my opinion even when confronted with dangerous situations, the puzzles are interesting and can be somewhat difficult for someone new to the game, the graphics are nice, the gameplay and audio are good, overall this is a good adventure game. It's hard to recommend it for a young person that is used with the HD graphic games of today, but for someone that has already played classic games, especially adventure games, I strongly recommend it. Looking forward to play the second part. "

PROS:*Good story*Entertaining dialouge and memorable characters*Beautiful graphics and amazingly small details in every scene*Lots of settings to explore*The underlining mystery of the mammoths*An interesting alternate universe of our time*The main character grows through the story and various telephone conversations - whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is left to you to think aboutCONS:*Movements of characters are slow and clunky *Lots of backtracking *Puzzles are sometimes infuriating because of backtracking and some objects that need to be picked-up are too well hidden*Ending strays from rest of the story and leaves you hanging			"

												Superb graphics and great storyline, but not your average point and click.You really need alot of time for this one. Unfortunately with the high amount of scenes and accessible areas this can have the adverse affect of simply leading to rather endless wandering and slow monotonous transition to get anywhere. Nothing resmbling a map to be found. Some areas need a single click to transition others seem to take you through multiple angles of a scene before you get to a door.I've seen comparatively few puzzles for this sort of game, but when i have they were at least interesting. I think again with the expanse of areas to visit/view the puzzles end up being a bit lost in amongst them..Certainly worth a look for the scenery and storyline alone, i've resorted to a walkthrough so i can at least see the rest of the game. This is mainly because every time i meet an NPC it only lets me ask them about 1 topic on my list before ending the convo and not letting me speak to them again, thus i'm missing directions as to what to do next.I've got Syberia 2 as well so hopefully thats a bit more structured and makes better use of the scenery with more to actually do. :)			"

Character development was surprising, especially in a game that feels more in the genre of Myst than  Heavy Rain.Much shorter than expected, my played time on Steam lists as 13 hours, but I paused it before dinner and resumed a few hours later, so I don't know how long it was. There were a few times I left it running for breaks , so I'd say its an 8-10 hour game.There are one or two spots that I got stuck enough to look for a hint (hard to avoid spoilers, just needed a nudge). Stuck as in ""there are no clues anywhere"" and it's a bit obtuse, but if you're a fan of the genre, this is nothing new. Maybe it could have gone over 10 hours if I hadn't gotten that one hint.Ending felt abrupt, but overall it was emotionally satisfying. No replay value, but I will remember this story!			"

												It takes a lot to impress me to the point of leaving a review, but this game was wonderful.From the scenery to the cutscenes, from the characters to the playstyle, I absolutely adored this game. It's beautiful, in both setting and execution. I can't believe it's as old as 2002. I played it for six hours straight and I was so, so disappointed when it ended. Once the credits had rolled, I tried continuing the game just to make sure there wasn't more. That can't be it! She's finally found him! She's hopped back on the train! They're off to the snowy depths of Syberia to find this tribe and solve the mystery of the mammoth figurine! RIGHT?!The story is very linear, though, so it'll be a while before I play it again. I wish I'd been able to stream it, though. People need to be made aware of how wonderful this is. Alas, I was unable to play this game on my PC because, for all my Googling, I could not get past the ""The 3D rendering engine could not be initialized"" error. So I had to play it on my Mac and goodness knows there aren't any good streaming programs for that!Wonderful tale, wonderful characters, wonderful voice acting. I wish a place like this truly existed.Cons: At times, moving around was a bit clumsy (like when the camera angle did a 180 and you were trying to move fast and you ended up going back a screen). That's it.Edit: Oh. OH. There's a sequel! Scratch what I said before about the ending! It's all good now!!			"

												For ambience, mood, and setting, this is an easy recommendation, although it favors its overall presentation over anything resembling intricate puzzles or real dialogue tree negotiation. The deliberate pace creates a feeling of suspended time... time that allows you to soak in the static environments (at best, nearly on par with FFVII) and and the initially creepy aesthetic of Voralburg's automatons. There are adventure titles with better stories, and you'll find yourself rushing through the straightforward logic of many of the imbroglios Ms. Walker's finds herself in, but as the end credits roll, Syberia still lingers like a well-directed film.

												Syberia is a pure adventure game.It brings you to a breath taking and beautiful adventure where you will discover the life of its people, their culture through out a nice written story and awesome art direction. Syberia has quiet challenging puzzle through out the game and it might take you a while to figure out but they are interesting and nicely put together that makes you never bored of it. Story is just awesome.Sound effects are appropriate and realistic.It really deserves to be a well known classic. Graphicaly its not much in 2014-15 but its nice enough to play with it.Syberia is an unforgettable game and journey for the mind....			"

												The best and worst thing I can say about Syberia is that it often feels like playing through a European landscape painting.It has that Myst-vibe. The environments are empty, but mysterious and interesting. It's also a design choice: the only objects you can interact with are objects that the main character, ""Miss Kate Walker"", wants to pick up or use or talk to.Thus there's little commentary on the surroundings. No ""look at cliff"" or ""pick up microwave"" - just a few hotspots.Which, to my disappointment, are easy to miss. There is no ""press a button to reveal all points of interest"" functionality. And many of the puzzles are obtuse. The game makes you run around a lot. Often multiple times through same places. Luckily the backgrounds are gorgeous and atmospheric (made even more so by the musical score). Also, an FAQ comes very handy, unless you like running around aimlessly. The game mostly shows its age in how off-putting and non-user-friendly its design often is. Which is a shame. If they ever make an HD remake - they should! - these are issues they should fix. (And they would be easy to fix, too.)The characters and the story are very good, however, and a reason enough to keep on playing. Also, the endgame is very satisfying. I was honestly moved by the story and taken to love the characters, despite some cheesy dialogue.Can't wait to play Syberia II next, because I crave to spend more time in the magical world of Syberia.Rating: 8/10			"

												Very dry and I'd even call it dull at times. That said, I can't really say I don't like this game.  It's a visual treat for the eyes, a mostly realistic world, starting in a small villaiage in Russia, altered somewhat by a fantasy steampunkish clockwork science. Graphics and pretty views are not enough to support a game alone, and I would not give it thumbs up if that were the only positive.  I did say 'dry and dull', but, while it takes a while to get to the point, the story it tells is a solid 8 outta 10,  and a number of the recurring characters are memorable.  Fair warning in advance, this is only half the story, and ends without real closure.  The sequel, Syberia 2 is the continuation, and actually wraps things up, so, if you want to get this one, you'll need to get the next one, too.			"

												This game has an absorbing story and beautiful locations, all of which have depth and a backstory. The whole premise of the game is intriguing and once you've got over the slow start you find yourself wanting to learn more and more.It isn't without its frustrations. Some of the locations exist only to provide scenery, so moving from location to location can literally be measured in ""clicks"". But that's a minor frustration - my wife and I played both Syberia and Syberia 2 and enjoyed them very much.Observations:1) Kate Walker has difficulty with stairs and ladders.2) No one in the game is allowed to refer to Kate by her first name. It must always be ""Kate Walker"".3) The bakery is never open. "

												I bought Syberia and Syberia 2 in a steam sale pack for $1.24. To say the least, I got a lot more than I paid for.Syberia is a point and click adventure game where you play as a female protaganist who's on a business trip to finalize the sale of an old automaton factory in Europe. Before you had the chance to arrive, the old lady that you needed to meet with passes away, leaving you with the task of finding her long lost brother.  Everything about this game just blew me away. I didn't realize it at first, but Syberia is one of those few adventure titles that actually contain everything that I could ever want in an adventure game and the story is so well done. It's very relaxing so don't expect anything with guns and chaos. If you love adventure, pick this series up. You won't regret it. "

												Syberia is a beautiful game!Of the old-school point and click format, some gamers might shy away from this one in favor of a more fast paced. That would be a mistake!You play as Kate Walker, a lawyer from New York who is sent to the small french town of Valadilene to finalize the take over of a toy factory after the owner, Anna Vorarlberg, passed away. After exploration, Kate Walker finds an automaton, by the name of Oscar, in the Vorarlberg factory and learns of a possible heir. From there, the game then takes the player on a journy towards the east in seach of this missing heir who leaves a trail of bread crums behind in the form of puzzles. What makes Syberia a great game is the stunning world, layered characters and challenging(but logical) puzzles. The main protaganist, Kate Walker, is a clever and likeable main character whos own back story is fleshed out in a serise of phone calls through-out the game, which gives the player her modivation to continue on her journey. Her companion during the game is the charming Oscar, the automaton who is really the stand out character in Syberia. When solveing puzzles. it might be tempting to look for the solutions online but, with a bit of patience, I can guarantee you will solve them (Hell, I did!).Syberia is will worth the buy. This atmospheric game will leave you with a sad sense of of saying goodbye to some old friends after you completed Syberia.			"

Replaying this, I was a little less impressed by the characterization Kate, but overall this still held up. It's an interesting somewhat whimsical story with interesting characters and environments. The story kept me interested. The puzzles aren't overly complicated, which I appreciate because I can be terribly oblivious. This is definitely the better story of the two games, even if Kate's character is a little better in Syberia II.			"

												Overall score: 9 out of 10For me an adventure game is not about gameplay or graphics, it's about story and puzzles. Syberia was launched in 2002 and I first played it when I was still in Highschool. During my first playthrough almost 10 years ago, I found the puzzles to be somewhat difficult, but in the present I find them to be quite easy, and I'm not saying that because I've already played the game, cause honestly I didn't remembered a single thing from my first playthrough. In my opinion the lack of difficulty that I've experienced in the present is due to the fact that  I've got more experienced with solving puzzles and because I think that with the age you see things differently, more logical. Returning back to the game, the story is quite good, although the characters seem too polite in my opinion even when confronted with dangerous situations, the puzzles are interesting and can be somewhat difficult for someone new to the game, the graphics are nice, the gameplay and audio are good, overall this is a good adventure game. It's hard to recommend it for a young person that is used with the HD graphic games of today, but for someone that has already played classic games, especially adventure games, I strongly recommend it. Looking forward to play the second part. "

												""Kate Walker"" - OscarThis is such a classic for me. The game has everything a point-&-click game should have (both positive and negative).You follow Kate Walker around as she travels to a mysterious place and come across, amongst other things, an automaton called Oscar.Together they venture the world in search for the alluring Hans VoralbergOn the way they meet good people and less good peaopleIf you are interested in a good point-&-click this is it, great voices, awesome environments and just all the feelsAnd hopefully you won't be stuck at a certain place where so many people have been stuck (won't spoil where though)			"

												One of the best games of all time that successfully merges classic storytelling within a modern setting, and which demonstrates how video games may truly be considered an art form.

			I've reluctantly acquiesced - this is a review/appreciation together with our interpretation of the game for Nuri and myself. Do video games constitute some form of art?

												Syberia is - deep breath, here come all the adjectives - enjoyable, clever, complex, beautiful. ok i could go on, but if you have never played it before, it is a point and click adventure game made in 2002 and for a game of that age, it is not without a few glitches. why is it still around and why are we still playing it, because its good. i think its a game you need to play as a gaming right of passage, not just because its good, but because this game shows us where the classic point and click adventure game was and always should be, it is one of the few games that set the bar in this genre. you cant rush this game, it shouldn’t be rushed. take your time and enjoy it for all of its, puzzling splendor. check out my video below to get a taste of what is in store.part 1 -

												Though a little tricky sometimes and a little arduous at others, the story and atmosphere of Syberia are truly amazing. The whole journey from Valadilene to ever-further east locations- each strange yet alive with its own spirit- is storytelling I have not seen and enjoyed in a game for a long time. And the ending is just...fantastic. Because the story doesn't stop there, and I look forward to Syberia II. So, if you don't mind some point-and-click material, holding up a mysterious but intriguing setting, then I would recommend this game.			"

												I really fell in love with this game. I first played it many, many years ago and, since then, have replayed it several times since. Each time I replay reminds me of why I fell in love in the first place.It is the story that took me. It seem strange at first because the graphics isn't that good, the voice acting isn't the best, and the dialogue can be downright awful at times. You'd think all these factors would make the story difficult to get into...and it certainly doesn't help, that's for sure. However, I suppose what I love is the premise, the imagery, the location, and how it is all executed together.Often, while playing through this game, I get a sense of surrealism. At times, I get drawn into the quaint loveliness of the architecture and people of Valadilene/Barrockstadt then the stark barrenness of Komkolzgrad/Aralbad, and, in the midst of this, the inexplicable impossible spring-operated automatons would be present. It's a weird mixture, but it somehow drew me in. I would feel as if I'm actually in a fantasy world exploring it.Kind of a strange thing to feel considering that's pretty much what many games essentially is and aims to make players feel. Problem is that it seems to be so rarely achieved. In fact, of the hundreds of games I've played over the course of my life, Syberia is among a handful that actually manages to achieve it.For that reason alone, I became a huge fan and the game gets my highest recommendation possible.

												The first point-and-click game I've ever played.  I was quite suprised by this game.  I thought that I would find it really boring because I'm a big fan of action-adventure games.The stroryline is really interesting and unique, not what I expected at all.  The graphics is really good, for a game that was released a while back.  I experienced no problems or glitches in this game which is a big bonus.This game will not be everyone's cup of tea, but try it if you want to play something different than what you usually play.

And though the graphics and custscenes are only fair today, the characters, story, and adventure remain the same.Not a particularly hard game, it a matter of finding the items you need and asking the questions that need to be asked, and eventually you be able to move on. Great characters and an excellent, though sometimes sad and bleak, story push this game forward.Cheap game that is still well worth it.			"

												**Slight spoilers*** Pros: Rich, gorgeous environemnts with a touch of imagination Rich story Lots of colourful characters who were given their own stories and backgrounds and  had importance for Kate's quest - every character does matter and does contrbute meaningfully to Kate's quest and they are all lovely, quirky individuals. I loved the side characters! gorgeous movie sequences- like Kate's arrival, the train journeys- simply amazing!Cons: Story wore off for me, lost its ""wonderfulness""  and didin't deliver the emotional impact I had expected. the main character is too one-dimensional for me, too cliched, not rounded enough. puzzles get somewhat old sometimesI used English version  for this and voice acting was  really annoying, especially the stationmaster and a few others. Syberia is the game I've been trying to buy since its release, but something always prevented me from getting it. It was a recommendation I got from a friend when I was still an undergrad over 10 years ago.. I love narrative-driven games and this one was both satisfying...and not. I loved  the first part, the village and exploring the factory most, it was  then that I had a sense of grand imagination along with an unfortunate story of Hans and Anna that intrgued me and kept me on my toes at first, but later that last part precisely wore off, that magic disappeared. The first chapter on Kate's joruney was what I loved, but as the journey wore on,  the quest lost its charm for me. I still loved the wonderful backstories of Hans and Anna, the  cosmodrome character, the automatons, the three rectors in Barrockstadt, the short-sighted soldier at the Wall, the singer, and the mining complex director. But the journey itself  gradually lost its emotive and imaginative appeal, even though overall I can say it was really tightly woven, stringing together a variety of worlds, histories and traditions. I don't really like  Kate's backstory, too American cliched - this sharp lawyer transforms on the journey blah blah, seen it all too many times, so cliched and only cliched things happen in her life,  she's even got a thoroughly cliched ""fiance"", and their fate is painfully cliched.. Urgh, I was really annoyed by that. It didnt't really contribute anything for me, not to Kate's apparent ""change"" or anything, it was just an annoying cliche and her attitude is so nonchalant to her  friends and family, too indifferent, it really felt like she was a robot or something. I would have wished for someting more ambitious to develop Kate and make her seem more rounded.  This just was extremely trite and it made me dislike Kate. The story was my main motivation to buy it, and I was half happy but in the end I felt it fell short of my expectations set out by the first part in particular and the sense of great wonder I started out with.  I was really happy with all the well developed, touching and sad backstories of the characters she interacted with, but her own background wasn't remotely interesting in all this, her friendship with Oscar was interesting, but also lacked something, maybe it's Kate's personality, I don't really like her all that much and she failed to make me want to cheer for her in any way. I was very indifferent towards her and the quest in the end. She didn't feel rounded enough, it felt like she was just a cliched American female ""badass"", a trope I really despise, I am prejudiced unfavourably against this cliche, she felt too cardboard and one dimensional in all this, and not rounded enough. Yes, and adventure heroine should be resorceful and strong, that's fine but she was really too one-dimensional for me. I didn't feel  like she ""changed"" in any way. She said she did, but it wasn't convincing, it felt dry on top of the major annoying cliche.  I suppose her ending decision- just as typical for american movies- was a sign of some change but it failed to be convincing enough for me. The other plus  are absolutely stunning environments and locations, some filled with a sense of desolation, others with a  sense of wonder and curiosity. It's a gorgeously set game, and it's a shame that story didn't, to me, give them full justice. Overall I recommend it. Maybe playing part 2 will make me change my mind. I loved the stories of the npcs but Kate herself, well i just don't feel connected to her and it's probably why the journey..tired me a little in the end.  couldn;t connect with her and she was slightly overlooked as a character to me, given a treatment that felt completely cliched. I was reluctant to journey with someone I don't like much., she's completely not my style. Maybe if she had a little more depth.. But I love the some of the ideas and the stories of the side characters and the settings and the early part of the story in particular. The automaton factory and the garden cave are probably my two favourite locations and the Barrockstadt station as well as  the cosmodrone. They were worlds within worlds. That' absolutely amazing. I love, love the locations, but emotional impact of the journey felt short in the end and left me dissatisfied.  Something was misisng, something became too cliched, something became too dry. in each location you do have to backtrack quite a bit sometimes, it can become tedious when you are narratve-focused since the tasks are fairly mundane but you have to do them to move forward ad some times something actually inttrguing or puzzling did come up in those mundane subtasks.  Each location has a series of subtasks that lead you to location goal.  I loved a few, I loved visiting the church for instance and doing the subquests there, I loved getting the band stand started in Barrockstadt, I also loved putting together Oscar's legs. I loved the voice cylinders and some of the cinematic sequences with them -  also gorgeous, and well presented pieces of Hans and Anna story. My score is 75/100, it's amazing game and definitely a good purchase but falls short on story for me a little, does not delivver the emotional impact I had expected.			"

												I could die of a stab wound to the foot faster than Momo walks.It's an interesting and fun game but, heck, it's slow. I do get that little burst of satisfaction when I complete little bits of puzzles though. Only a few hours in but I couldn't not say something about Momo, and honestly, the entire AI cast, being so slow.For gods sakes dont mess up the manufacturing of Oscars feet. There are 20 (twenty) screens to go through for this process, each with it's share of stairs or expansive area to get through to reach the other side. The legs are NOT the same as his 'skin' colour. Be sure to set the machine to one of the light browns, maybe tan. Save your game before you hit the switch on the machine If the first thing you see is the automatons drilling the legs and then the legs falling down the conveyor slide, you've screwed up. If you get a movie-like cut scene you're on track. Don't be clever and do a test run 'to see what happens'. Take one minute now to get it right the first time, save twenty minutes of running back and forth.Recommended, with a liberal dose of patience and a lot of game saves. "

												A brilliant game, ahead of it's time. Of the steampunk genre, both the story and the scenery are beautiful, and the charecters well-developed. With a dash of humor at some times, and a pinch of sadness at others, as well as an overall sense of nostalgia, this is a point-and-click player's dream game. Difficult, to be sure, and at times frustrating, but who wants a game that is too easy?All-in-all, a well-rounded game. If there is anything that might be considered a drawback, it is that the controls are slightly... slow. It is mildly time-consuming just to get around. However, the gorgeous environment generally makes up for that, and the attention to detail is astounding.			"

												Bought this game randomly just for the fun of it. Yeah, I do that sometimes, it's not even my genre. But wow, I got myself a piece of gold here. I am not much into the Point'n'Click genre as said, but it is good to know that there are games like this which convince me to actually poke my head below the surface (poor metaphors, yay. no seriously wtf did I just write there).   Well, technically and graphically, this game is... well. Just keep it's age in mind, it's from 2002 yo. But considering that, these backgrounds are just WOW. Probably some of the prettiest and most detailed I know of (operative word is 'I'). Cought myself acting up to take a neat screenshot here and there.   The gameplay is quite slow paced, like in most of the genre's games (I guess; me lacking experience here) - But sometimes I could strangle Kate for her unbearable stair-walking behavior (JUST CLIMB 'EM DOWN ALREADY ahh, wrong side of the train again FML), just saying. The puzzles are mostly comprehensible and challenging enough so that even a beginner like me can solve them just by thinking. No actual brain- or logic breakers here (I still had to take a walkthrough four or five times, but mainly thanks to my own stupidity). The items are mostly located at logical places, the solution may be even located just next to the keyhole where it should be by logic. I like this!   The story is really intense for what I have felt. I actually felt the necessity to accomplish Kate's mission in the first place and solve the problems not for the problems' sake, but to finally get to that damn Hans. Just like Kate, over the time I really got involved into the story behind the automatons and their creators (I inhaled EVERY document - including Anna's wole diary). I can't remember being confused about details that I didn't catch - simply because I did NOT miss out on anything. This is a rare event in more gameplay-driven games like shooters - maybe I should play more games of this kind; or play games in my native language more often... on the other hand... ugh, still prefer the original voices. German localization sucks in most cases. anyway B2T   Long story short: I had tons of fun playing it and figuring out the ways through the story. It became one of these games I enjoyed putting 14 hours of my precious free time into without regrets. The end came a bit sudden for my taste, but the story does not end there; and some day I WILL get myself the sequel(s), definitely.I can just highly recommend this game to whoever is looking for an involving, story driven experience with an interesting setting - and maybe, like me, having never touched Point'n'Click before.And if you are really, REALLY not interested into that genre AT ALL... Man, still give this one a try.I did, too.PS: Maybe it is just me, but I think I had some sound issues on Windows10, which (I am sure of) weren't there on Windows7. Some of the sceneries had almost no sound at all. But if that's in the game: a little minus for sound design ;D			"

												(Still need to Finish) Really simplistic gameplay mechanics, even by any adventure point n' click standards, but it really knows how to cut the fat and give you text you read and don't just fast-forward TLDR, and the pre-rendered art is really unique and exquisite with a high point on how well it blend moments of FMV animation with the scene. I Like.			"

												This game is tough to review.  Story was realtively interesting and gameplay too.  That being said the main characters personality made me graon and the lack of accents for supposed russians made no sense.  Overall it was a fun game.			"

												This game was probably one of the most story rich puzzle games I've played to this point next to the second in this series. I personally felt the story to be so enjoyable and I could see a change in our fair young lady the longer she was going into the story. It just was so much fun to I always felt so accomplished when I finished a puzzle and could continue to the next chapter. "

												One of my favourite games ever!!  Is has very beautiful settings and an interesting storyline.  My favourite part is actually the beginning where it is a rainy French village, so relaxing listening to the rain.  Trying to figure out how to use all the different automatons is sometimes frustrating, but click everything, read everything and ask every question you can and you will figure it out.I love this game so much that I actually have it on PC, PS & iPad.So excited that a third game is coming out!

												A early noughties point and click, Syberia offers almost exactly what you'd expect: a lot of busy pre-rendered backgrounds, puzzles that require the most non-linear of thinking and an incredibly front-loaded plot. But the story takes you to some unique and interesting places and the voice acting is surprisingly solid for almost every character. Definitely worth your time if you are a fan of the genre.			"

												I don't play much point and click adventure games, but when I first played Syberia, I was suprised. I got Syberia cheap and thought ""Well, I should give it a try, even though it looks boring"". First minutes weren't very fascinating, but more I played the more I got hooked in the game. It doesn't have best graphics and some mechanics are bit odd, but in overall, I like this game.			"

												I played this game when it first came out on a cd. Back then the graphics were great. Today it is obviously dated but it was nice to replay a game I never beat and then lost. The story is great. Overall a good point and click that might have done better with some hints.			"

												I've had this game in Steam library for a long time, yet I didn't play it until last week. And when I launched it, I couldn't stop playing until I was finished, and continued straight to Syberia 2,The game is so immersive, interesting, and charachters so likeable that I lost myself in the story completely. For a player like me who searches games mainly for the story this was perfect. The puzzles are mostly sensible and you can figure them out with brain work, most of them are even very fun to do. They don't take too long and what's best, you CAN'T mess things up so that you would need to reload. Always a plus for a puzzle game, because many times I forget to save the progress for hours, sucks to reload in that point :DAs for the downside, there are also puzzles that make no sense, or the game does not hint you about the solutions in any way, you just have to try differet combinations. Some puzzles also depend on finding certain objects, which can be a nuisance because there is no glimmer, noticeable vivid colours on pickable objects, etc. that would make it easier. Sometimes you end up hoovering your mouse over a scene in hope of finding the right thing to do. Luckily there are walkthroughs in the internet to help you in your way, the point is to have fun afterall and not pull you hairs off.There is also a fair amount of running around. The levels are split into very short parts so it gets annoying to run 3 minutes from one place to the other and back for a one minute conversation, etc. Animations are also a bit slow, seems that Kate is fairly stiff when it comes to  stepping up or down stairs, etc. Means that the animation of characters takes time and as so slows down the gameplay.In short:+story, scenery, atmosphere, characters+puzzles-some puzzles fall short-running from one end of a level to the other and back for a short conversation, etc.++music is amazing! :)			"

												TL;DR: this game uses Comic Sans MS for the subtitles but apart from that it is a great game.Syberia was one of the highly-praised games I often heard about as I was playing Myst as a teenager. 10 years later, I eventually bought it and can confirm it deserves its reputation.Thanks to the good writing and remarkable art direction, each of the four locations you visit (a village in the French Alps, an university with a train station in a giant aviary, a former Russian mine town/cosmodrome and a forgotten spa where Soviet elites use to stay) is filled with an unique ambiance, colorful characters and creative inventions (the automate/spring technologies reminded me of the kind of things an imaginative kid would come up with). The soundtrack also deserves praises, it complements well the settings and help create an ambiance. For the time I spent on this game, I forgot everything about my (boring) adult life and joyfully went on an adventure with Kate Walker.On the downside, Syberia is pretty short (it took me 6 hours to finish it) and has close to no replay value as most enigmas are straightforward and none of them is randomly generated. Because of that, it is worth waiting for this game to be on sales and/or buy it as part of the Syberia bundles. Also it uses Comic Sans MS as main font but I could survive; this misstep was probably done to balance the eye-candy sceneries.I hope that at some point in the future they will do a true remake of Syberia with true 4K resolution and additional enigmas.

												Almost 15 years old, and graphically it shows, although the hand-drawn backgrounds still look pretty good.  Story is emphasized over puzzle-solving.  One puzzle near the end is pretty challenging, but the rest become pretty clear from observation.  It's mostly ""get this item and then go back to that other place so you can do that other thing now.""  No combining of random items in your inventory.  Still a pretty good example of the genre, despite its age, if you prefer story over puzzling.			"
