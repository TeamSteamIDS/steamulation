												This is an excellent game for the right kind of person, maybe, but I am personally not feeling it. The thing I love most about Rocketbirds is its art. It LOOKS amazing. I love everything about not only the quality of the art, but the cartoony style. I also love the theme of chickens vs penguins. In a game culture where so many things are grimdark or the same old human space marines shooting the same old badguy marines and/or aliens and/or zombies, there is something refreshing about a change of wallpaper. And what great-looking wallpaper it is.I also was interested in Rocketbirds because it looked like it had some action akin to a metroidvania or possibly something a little bit more contra style. I typically enjoy those types of games, so it seemed like a safe buy. But ultimately Rocketbirds just didn't satisfy me. Here are the turnoffs:1) Movement feels sluggish and stiff, like driving a tank that also has to peel itself off the linoleum every time it stops and starts again.2) Shooting is incredibly simple. You can either shoot straight ahead or you can crouch and shoot straight ahead. That's it. You can't change aim direction while shooting, though, and HB controls and moves slow. So one of this game's favorite things to do is have 2 to 4 penguins come running in from both sides of the screen and attack you from both sides. If you only shoot one way, you'll get shot in the back. Ostensibly what you want to do is quickly shoot back and forth to keep enemies on both sides staggered. However, if you are shooting right and want to shoot left, you have to release the trigger, turn HB around, then start shooting again. Since HB also controls/moves very slowly, this makes it very easy to get ganked in the most frustrating way.3) The platforming feels very bad. The jumps are sluggish as the rest of HB's movements, for starters, but the other weird thing is that HB will auto-grab any ledges he jumps toward---and he will do it at a fairly far distance. This is great if you are actually trying to get up on that ledge, but if you don't want to auto-grab that ledge, then having him auto-grab it is annoying. The same goes for dropping over the edge of a ledge or precipice. If you are standing on an edge and press down, HB will automatically climb down that ledge. This is annoying in situations where you climb up onto a ledge, then an enemy runs on screen, and what you WANT to do is press down to crouch and shoot, but instead HB crawls down the ledge. Sigh.4) Trying to line HB up with a buttons and switches can be awkward due to jerky movements. Likewise, there are also lots of light puzzles involving pushing crates around, but pushing the crates also feels awkward due to jerky movements. This is the ""sticky"" aspect of controlling HB. Because while on one hand he feels sluggish, he is also difficult when trying to make more fine/precise movements, because his movement/animation tends to ""pop"". When pushing crates, they don't just slide across the floor in a smooth, consistent motion. They jerk and lurch forward as you push them. When trying to make fine movements, such as to line HB up with a button, he will jerk to the left and right of the button.5) There are different guns in the game, but it largely doesn't matter which gun you use. They all pretty much control the same, and for the vast majority of enemy encounters, one gun does not provide any advantage over another gun. There are power differences and rate of fire differences, but due to the way the combat works, it doesn't really change your tactics in any significant way.6) You can use mind control on the penguin enemies to take over their minds and make them go shoot their friends, but they control exactly the same as HB (except in the rare case where you can mind control a bazooka penguins), so the gameplay doesn't feel different. This still makes for good puzzling, however.I got frustrated once I got to one of the ships where you had to flip the self-destruct button and escape the ship in time. (Time challenges. Always thrilling.) I was struggling with the controls but eeking by up until that point, but at that point it was just asking for more than I was willing to fight the controls for.Final Verdict: A beautiful looking game with a great heart, but the controls just don't feel very good, which brings the rest of the experience down.

												This game. This game here. This is one of those games where you see it, and you ignore it, because it just has that look to it, that its gonna be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that belongs nowhere other than a bundle, and you only activate it just to add a +1 to your library. BUT... no.... no no no no no...This game is ridiculously fun. The art style is cool, the controls are nice and tight and work well, the sounds are high quality, the music is great, and the humor is so corny you have to laugh. REALLY enjoyed what ive played so far, definitely going to be coming back for more, im loving it. It's not some super hard platformer or side scroller shoot em up. It's a mindless game with mindless shooting just like it appears to be, but its done in a way that makes it highly enjoyable. First i was just running through the levels shooting up the penguin enemies. Then i got to a part where i found my jetpack. It shoots me up in the ait, and theres a huge Zeppelin that's spitting out penguins with jetpacks and we're twirling around in the air having dogfights. Was a lot of fun. I'm only two or three levels into the game and can already tell its a keeper. Even if nothing changes and this same gameplay repeats itself, its still a great game.I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who likes side scrollerr shooters even in the slightest. I can't wait to hook up with someone to play some co-op with. I imagine it would be lots of laughs. As far as pricing, i definitely would not want to pay the full $9.99 for it, it's a great game. But it's not $9.99 great. If you can manage to get your hands on an old bundle code, or you catch it on a sale here through Steam, or elswhere like Amazon or GMG, grab it. $5.00 would be a fair price for it with ease.on a scale of 1 to 10 i give this a solid 9.

												This game might look ridiculous, but I assure you, it is not. This is a gritty story about guerilla warfare and an oppressive regime. While the story is good, the gameplay is even better. Sure, it takes around ten bullets to take down the standard enemies, but this is more than made up for by the ability to ""bullet juggle"" enemies by shooting them continuously. This game also has some interesting and original mechanics that spice up gameplay, but to tell you about them would spoil the story. Suffice to say, this game, while being a shooter/action game at heart, also has puzzles every once in a while as a break from the action.I guess that is what I like so much about this game, that it tells a rather messed up story using irony and moments of hilarity to minimize the effect. Some of these moments may be unintentional (I personally like to roll like a tumbleweed throughout the levels), but some, like the title of the game and the snippets of dialogue scattered throughout, are well thought out.Verdict: 10/10 Because I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this game. I had a lot of fun playing it and everything works well together. "

												I love this game. This gem was clearly inspired by Rolling Thunder, with a bit of Astroid (old arcade game from the 80's) inspired segments thrown in. I can't say too many harsh things about it, but its really a great game in my personal opinion. The game is a bit short, but being im not a fan of excessively long games, the shortness of the game is much welcome. The soundtrack is also outstanding. The sounds of indie rock music that plays between cut scenes and gameplay is welcome and wonderfully fits the game's mood.  The run and gun game play is also just as satisfying. I would recommend this game to anyone who are into old school run and gun games like rolling thunder and, hell even dirty harry for the NES. This is definitely a worthy purchase for future buyers.

												This is a short, run and gun platform game. Even at three hours, it overstays its welcome. The levels are all the same - climb around some buildings, press switches to call the elevators, oops can't go that way, must brainbug an enemy to press a button or something, go grab that crate, run back to where you were, finish the level, oh wait another building except this one is in the jungle instead of on an ice mountain. There are some occasional flying dog fight missions to break it up, but by the end (well much before that) I was ready for the game to be over (make it stop). The end is certainly anticlimactic since the main boss fight isn't even the main boss.There are some collectables - red signs you must hit. However, there is only one in a level at a time. Once you hit one, another will show up. Usually, in a place where you have already gone. Backtrack some more for the fun of it? Yeah, I don't think so.			"

												I picked this game up when it was under 3 dollars. It is well worth it at that price. Lots of fun and great soundtrack. The fact that its linux compatible and full controller support is great. Runs very well on ubuntu with a wired usb 360 controller. It isnt super short either. So you do get plently of game play hours out of it. Overall the game storyboard is well thought out and put together. It is a bit violent but kids over 8-10 should be fine playing. But use your own judgement. Every child is different. This game has not disappointed. I would recommend it at 9.99 but when on sale its a steal of a deal. I hope this helps anyone on the fence about getting it.			"

												Rocketbirds puts you in control of Hardboiled, basically the chicken version of Rambo, and you must fight your way through penguin soldiers in different environments to kill their dictator and save the world like a true hero. While the gameplay could have been much more and length is quite short, this game is remembered for its soundtrack, humour and artstyle, and it is proof that even very simplistic stories can be made intriguing thanks to this great combo.+ Presentation: a war between chickens and penguins. The artstyle mixes cartoon-y and serious atmosphere, with clean graphics and detailed environments.+ Great soundtrack, consisting of ""Science Fiction Rock"" music by New World Revolution+ Decent level design, with varying action sequences and puzzles+ Humour+ Local and network co-op mode- Clunky controls- You can only aim and shoot left and right. There's also a cover system (such as crouching behind crates and hiding in the dark), but sadly, it can rarely be used- Even though it's a separate story, co-op mode features the same maps from the singleplayer story and it is quite short- No music during the final boss fight			"

												Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is a fairly harmless 2D side scrolling shooter that takes a lot of patience to enjoy and would take a miracle to love. Awful controls and shooting, pitiful to frustrating enemy placement and behaviour, and a lack of consistency in the game's own rules (sometimes you can take cover...sometimes you can't!) make the game hard to recommend, even at a bottom-of-the-bucket price point.  While there are subtle hints of a good game here, getting just a whiff of some tasty fried chicken isn't enough to cure one's hunger, now is it? (I will not apologize for that terrible joke.)			"

												It's not the most tight and complex sidescrolling shooter out there but it's one hell of a charming one. The music by New World Revolution is great and the visuals are amazing. The humor is ok, but it's present at least. There's some interest puzzle elements and they'll be the challenge for most of the game as combat is pretty easy and you'll get all healt and anmo back if you die and revert to a checkpoint. There's also a separate co-op campaign for two players though it uses almost the same environments it's decent to play once at least. It could be more polished but I look forward to that on a sequel.			"

It has all the elements of a great side-scrolling shooter with some modern twists to bump it up a notch.It's a big thumb's up for me.I'm glad I got this game because I'd bought some real stinkers recently (Apotheon) in this genre.

												I'm really not the one to write negative reviews about anything, but this game sure deservers a hell of a warning. Since I know that many of you have this game (bundles/sales/free giveaways) I just want to spare you the trouble of ever starting this below-par platformer.First I would like to start with the good things, because it's not all that bad.Shooting is fun. Humour is OK. Political conotations are appreciated. ""Brain bugs"" are a decent mechanic all around.Now with the bad.Level design which is so tightly crammed leaving you no room for outmaneuvering your enemies - meaning the games is linear as linear gets. Really, no paths to chose whatsoever.Puzzle sequences, which are actually not puzzle sequences at al as all you need to do is move some boxes around - going from A to B, then from B to A, then from A to B again, try to jump up a few times and flick the switch that leads to C...Checkpoints, which will often leave you between a rock and a hard place.Lagg in online co-op. Sometimes gamebreaking (probaly not everyone has experienced this, but we did).Co-op was the thing I really hoped will save this game from it's mediocrity. But it didn't. Infact, co-op is probably the worse segment of Rocketbirds. Why? You see, there is a unique mechanic that is essential in co-op mode, the one featuring one player jumping on-top another mostly used for reaching high ledges. There are two major issues with this.The first one is that it is not optinal - you just jump next to your partner and you are automatically on-top of him, which leads to HUNDREDS of falls, fails, repeats, backtraking instances.Second one is that there is virtually no room in those tightly squeezes corridors for this mechanic to actually work properly, leaving you with a sorrow grim on your face time and time again.You know the game is bad when you and your partner laugh about how bad this really is.If you allready own this game, sure, give it a try, why not. You might like it, you might actually love it for some strange reason.If you do not own this game, you are not missing out on anything.Even for 7,99€ (in the time of writing) you can find dozens of better and more polished platformers in steam store.

												Bold and offensive in all the best ways, Rocketbirds has more personality than just about any other game of its kind. As unexpectedly serious in tone as the story is, what's even more surprising is how well it comes together. I genuinely began to empathize with our hero's plight to free his country from the oppressive reign of the Penguins, which is no small feat for a game starring a machinegun toting chicken. The stilted, self aware voice acting and dialog add a darkly humorous overtone onto this which when taken in tandem is a completely unique and entertaining narrative that outdoes the straightforward tale underneath.Gameplay is a side-scrolling shooter stripped to its bare fundamentals, involving little more than rolling from room to room guns blazing and shooting anyone dumb enough to try and stop you. Interspersed are a few sections strapping you into a jetpack for aerial combat, but for the most part the developer chose to keep things simple and uncomplicated, which I think the game is better off for. My only complaint are the somewhat stiff and clunky controls, whether using KB&M or a gamepad (though I would definitely advise using the later if you have the option). You can only shoot directly in front of you, but switching directions takes a split second too long and allows for a bunch of cheap shots from enemies, and can get you into some tight spots during later levels. I did get a hang of them eventually, but they could certainly be improved.But cumbersome controls are in no way able to bring the game down. The art style which places animated 2D character models against realistic, slightly offset 3D backgrounds is brilliant, and the kickbutt soundtrack is impeccable to say the least. Despite being extremely brief the campaign is exciting and full of action, with solid (though entirely habitual) gameplay and a creative, excellently constructed presentation that sets it apart from the rest. More than anything else though Rocketbirds is simply very, very cool and an adventure well worth taking.			"

I really wants more story! (even by DLC)- Rolling action sometimes create chaos in group battle- Different guns in same category didn't feel the different. e.g. MP5 spec is exactly the same as AK47- Grenade is very limited functioning- Jumping is slow and weird- In Rocket scene all characters are zoomed too small to find and followScore: 7/10 (8/10 if pick up in sales)			"

												After playing through Rocketbirds and reading some reviews I feel the need to defend this game.The biggest problem of Rocketbirds may be the way it presents itself. Most people expect a Run'n'Gun with this kind of presentation. A simple, yet satisfying chaotic shooter...but what you get is a game, which is more challenging on your mind than on your trigger finger.But one thing after another. The first thing you'll notice is the amazing artstyle, which is depicting a cartoony approach, with some gory elemtents sprinkled throughout. The graphics are mostly very clear and easy on the eye with some additional eye-candy effects, which in most cases don't obscure the players view. Slight variations in the colorpalette throughout the game give every level a distinct feel and provide a certain variety. The big selling point for the graphics is the 3D-effect. Instead of having a flat view on the scenery, like you would expect with this style, every scene has at least some aspect to give it some depth. And it looks amazing in motion.The soundtrack is also unique. Most of the times you won't notice the music, but in some instances, vocal tracks are played. The rock band New World Revolution provided some tracks for this game and they fit just perfectly. Sound FX are nothing particularly amazing, but they did their job.The gameplay is where it gets really interesting. As I wrote above, this absolutly is not a Run'n'Gun. The stiff movement of your character forces the player to be really aware of the enemys movement and position. The battles are challenging but doable, if the character is in the right position and prioritizes which enemy to kill first. Rushing from screen to screen will punish the player. The enemys are attacking very quickly with very little windup time to their attacks, so caution is needed. This approach to combat is, in my book atleast, absolutely legit, if it weren't for the big battles with many enemies attacking in waves. I found no way to complete these section without dying. You will bombarded with bullets from both sides that will stunlock you. In most cases I just tanked through these battles. This is made possible by the checkpoint system, which allows the waves to be winnable. A new checkpoint is reached after every wave and if you die, you'll get resurected with full health and ammo. The checkpoint system in general makes the whole game very forgiving. If the characters health is depleted and the player has to restart from the last checkpoint, he will be where he/she died in less than a minute. This makes the whole challenge very forgiving and counters frustration.Some light puzzles also made their way into Rocketbirds. But describing them as puzzles is an overstatement. They mostly consist of finding a certain path and evading enemies in time. Three times (or was it four) the game lives up to its name, the player gets a jetpack and leaves the planet to go dogfighting in the sky. A nice diversion, but these sections are short and few.Another game I was constantly reminded of during my playthrough was Abes Odyssey. The carefull aproach you have to take and the stiff controls reference the early oddworld games. I wouldn't be surprised if the developers of Rocketbirds would cite Abe as an influence.After my playthrough I was left with an experience which was perfect in lenght, it did all it wanted to do and didn't stretch itself further than it needed to be. I would recommend this game to everyone who likes Oddworld or is looking for a very unique game.			"

												I have some mixed feelings about this game. It is obviously... content driven. It revels in its art and theme with a silly world about anthropomorphic birds that have political and racial problems, including genocide. That's where the game shines. The art and theme of the game are really charming.The gameplay on the other hand is lacking in thoughtfulness. It has its moments. At its best, the game is puzzle-platforming, including some simple platforming and crate-stacking. It also allows you to possess enemies in a method very reminiscent to ""Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee,"" which is super enjoyable. There's nothing quite like gunning down bad guys that think you're friendly, taking all the risk with none of the.. risk. It's cool! But most of the rest of the gameplay, including the last boss, revolve around its sloppy gunplay.At first it might not be so bad. Shoot a bad guy ~25 times and he dies. He juggles in the air with each shot until death which seems fun until the very moment when 2 or more bad guys are on screen. Your bullets will not go through flying bodies, which means if there are 3 guys stacked front-to-back, you will only hit the guy in front while the rest gun you down, knocking you off-screen to recover, at best, and at worst, stunlocking you until you die.There is a sort of hiding / cover system in the form of a background layer you can move into at specified points, but this is ALWAYS [ALWAYS (ALWAYS)] omitted when you're in a difficult combat scenario. This means your only way of succeeding in the difficult combat sections is just retrying it until you get lucky and the enemy AI just doesn't shoot you as much as usual. Wow it's frustrating.There are also combat sections that involve jetpacking around in the air shooting down enemies with jetpacks. This is kinda fun and feels much less luck-driven, but there's not much particularly challenging, as there's pretty much one strategy: Fly around and don't get shot while shooting. In a word: Shallow.So all this said, there are good things in the game's aesthetic to experience but, for goodness sake, play it on Easy mode. There is absolutely nothing about the game's difficulty that is fun as it revolves entirely around a mechanic that you wish would just turn off.			"

												At first glance Rocketbirds looked like a mix of platformer and sidescrolling shooter. Turns out I was wrong, after playing it for a couple of hours and beating I can say that I enjoyed myself more and more until the end, the soundtrack is amazing, even though the plot is nothing too big it's still funny and the graphic style certainly fits very well to the theme. The gameplay is alright though, it has some ""puzzle"" sections where you need to drag some crates in order to jump on top of them, other than that is mostly jumping, running and shooting, which is fine by me. Overall I think Rocketbirds is not an amazing game but certainly a good one and a very funny one too, I strongly encourage you to give it a shot.			"

												I originally got this game in a bundle, and was intending to trade it away because I didn't want it in my backlog. On a random whim, I decided to try it as a filler game, and was very surprised with the quality of what I played.If you like fairly casual, side-scrolling action, and pump-you-up music, then you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are quite good - the detail in the environment and characters is well-done, and the art-style pops out nicely. The music is very good if you don't mind rock-style - the cutscenes pump you up, and the story is decent (and comical at times).The controls are very basic and easy to pick up. The tutorials are quick and helpful, instructing you on new game mechanics as they are introduced. The learning curve is minimal, however, the most difficult part of the game is probably timing your attacks, as you can get swarmed from both the left and right sides at any time. Because you (and your enemies) can air juggle with attacks (popping a character up and stun-locking them with bullet fire), if you let even a single enemy get a shot on you, you can quickly find yourself in a dangerous situation. Choosing both the appropriate weapon and timing your attacks will ensure your survival.Gameplay is very linear, however, there are parts where you are required to backtrack a bit. Many of the ""puzzles"" require you to collect various colored keycards and/or push and pull crates to allow you to reach higher ledges. There are collectibles in the form of signs that you can reach for extra achievements - some of which take extra effort and intuition to find. Some of the weapons you will find as you progress include a submachine gun and a shotgun. The submachine gun is fantastic for juggling opponents, but does very little damage. While the shotgun is deadly at close range, it is an ammo-eating monster, and can cause you to get overwhelmed if you are attack from the opposite side (as its bullets cannot reach an enemy on the opposite end of the screen). Health and ammo crates are usually common throughout the level, and enemies seem to always drop a small amount of ammo. Ammunition is shared among all weapons, and you do not have to reload, ensuring that action is constant and rapid. Later, you unlock a  mind-control grenade that allows you to take over enemies, which is essential for continuing the game in many levels. Whenever you take control of an enemy, the script they go through is very comical.  Sometimes, I use this weapon just for fun, and to watch the same script over and over again.Overall, the game can be a lot of mindless fun, will be enjoyed by 2D-platformer enthusiasts. A good game for casual, time-filling gameplay.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												I do not recommend the game for three crucial reasons:- The oversensitivity of the controls, these include movement. I tap right and suddenly I have moved a quarter of the screen length.- Puzzles are pretty poor and enemies do not provide any form of a challenge. The game uses the classic ""collect cards to unlock X part of level"" routine. - I know it is the style of the game, but the snapping between different scenes to represent a different sector of the level is done WAY too often for my liking.

												Poor, clunky controls, confusing levels and a lot of backtracking, uninspired puzzles (keycard hunt-a-thon fest 2000). Story is almost non-existent. I read in someone's review that artstyle is ""amazing"", yet i repeatedly had trouble distinguishing foreground from background. Me and my friend missed some door entrances because they looked like BARRED DOORS due to their background.OST is good at times and most of the weapon sounds. Humour is hit and miss (mostly miss). It is short, so if you literally have nothing else to play coop in a short amount of time, maybe MAYBE give it a shot.			"

												I really wasn't sold on Rocketbirds when I started playing. It was a lot of style and not a lot of substance, and I was worried the whole game was going to carry on in that vein. But as I got further in and the gameplay started deepening, I found myself more and more interested in seeing it through. It might not be a perfect platformer, but it paves over a lot of the rough spots with some unique flair.Rocketbirds puts you in the role of the titular Hardboiled Chicken, a Stallone-esque supermerc on a mission to assassinate a sniveling, dictatorial penguin. The journey takes a number of twists and turns, through military prisons, museums, and jetpack jaunts through the clouds, all while dispensing bits of backstory in rock opera cutscenes. I'm not kidding in the least, here... the developers enlisted the musical talents of New World Revolution to provide the soundtrack, and they're used to the most at every turn. Everything in the game is set to vocalized tracks, with the cutscenes completely choreographed to the music. It gives the game a strange feel, like someone set out to make a music video and ended up with a video game instead.Part of this feel stems from the simplistic gameplay. Rocketbirds plays like a more fluid Prince of Persia, with jumps carefully measured and having to keep your character facing the right direction. Adding guns to this formula is historically not the best idea, and indeed the gunplay in Rocketbirds is basically a race to pull the trigger first. Your shots juggle enemies and they take loads of bullets to kill for real, so each foe requires several seconds of constant attention. When enemies approach from both sides, this is a problem that requires a careful balance of shots. Enemies can also bullet-juggle you, so by the end of the game failing to service an enemy can make you dead very, very fast.Luckily, Rocketbirds doesn't hinge its appeal on the gunplay. Combat is less a feature of each level than platforming, keycard hunting, and gimmicks. New systems get introduced almost every other level, ranging from jetpack fights to mind control. There's enough to look forward to to keep you trundling through levels, even if the core gameplay is simple and frustrating at times. There's even a pretty entertaining co-op mode and I'm not usually a big co-op guy. I won't say Rocketbirds is for everyone, but if you ever wanted to play through a 90s animated metal music video, it'll hit the right notes.			"

What it is aboutRocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is an adventure game in 2.5D. The player controls the main character Hardboiled Chicken throughout various levels within the campaign, in which they encounter enemies of different ranks along with different weapons. Through the campaign, one gets to know how Hardboiled Chicken turned from a government-friendly to the enemy of state-chicken.Being a game between mildly difficult puzzles and, due to the weapons, bloody and brutal shootouts, it really is as weird as its name.The singleplayer campaign takes around 3 hours to completion, though one might not reach all achievements, since, additionally, there are signs to be found, resulting in more achievements to be reached (and one special achievement in connection with the signs).In the co-op campaign two players, either on LAN or connected through the internet, can complete the missions together. The maps are the same as in the regular campaign, except the puzzles have to be solved in different ways as the characters are smaller and both players have to help each other to be able to progress.In a nutshellRocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is a weird game with a weird plot and a weird main character in a weird scenario. Though looking like a comic, it definitely is not appropriate for children under the age of, lets say, 13-14 years ?If you like shooting penguins as a chicken in all variations, this is your game.

												Stylish platformer with fun single and coop player modes. The game is not too long - I've got 10 hours and have finished both campaigns. Rocketbirds is not too hard, the puzzles are interesting, art style, soundtrack and direction are great. Played both on keyboard and gamepad and controls are fine - yes it may feel a bit stiff at times, but I suspect that is part of the design, given the main character is a kind of stylised Rambo sort-of-person.Given the length of the main single player campaign, some people will probably this is a bit on the expensive side, but if you take into consideration the coop mode, I'd say the price is ok.

												Score: 6.5 / 10Price/Value: $3.50-$5 Time: 3 HoursDifficulty: HardHardboiled Chicken is a simple action platformer with some puzzle elements. The art quality is superb; although I can't quite comment on the audio - having turned it down to pay more attention to a background program. Grenades and Brain Bugs (Mind Control) are your secondaries and used for puzzle elements. Primary weapons are pistol, uzi, shotgun, mp5, rifle and machine gun.  There are not huge differences between them all damage-wise, mostly how it affects ammo consumption since they all use the same bar. Enemies don't come in many varieties; generally just swapping weapons out (mp5/rifle/bazooka). There are jetpack missions which are short and sweet; flying around shooting down jetpack penguins. An amusing little game, get it cheap if you can.			"

												2D action shooter that has a simple plot but consistent and entertaining story. Hype music, fun graphics and even a short co-op campaign. This game pretty much has it all for what it is. Gun variety, level variety(some sections you are flying with a jetpack), mission variety(you need to use mind control to pass certain sections), entertaining enemies. The co-op is short, but it is different from the main campaign in terms of how you need to play and the type of enemies you face, overall enjoyed it and even finished the Co-op in one playthrough, so I give this a very high entertainment value.

												A short (around 3 hours long) action platformer starring a chicken. What's not to love ? There are 15 missions, and three of these missions will have you flying around with a jetpack (don't worry, you'll still be shooting). There are a few puzzles as well, but thankfully that's kept to a minimum.The game itself has the perfect length; any longer and it would've overstayed its welcome.The graphics look sharp and detailed; the blood splatters on the wall look quite amazing for example. You really can't complain about the art direction here.The gunshots and other sounds are pretty good and the little voice acting there is is average, but passable.All in all an enjoyable game.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												I received this game as part of a Humble Bundle a while back, and while I'm not a big fan of platformers, it did have an odd appeal. It feels a bit rough around the edges; the combat is basic and never particularly challanging, the voice acting is a bit hit and miss, the tone feels a bit uneven, and I was left with a lot of questions about the story. (Why birds?) That said, the game strikes me as a labor of love, something put together by a small team that was passionate about their work. The soundtrack is also excellent.I had fun with the game, but there are probably other platformers where your time might be better spent.			"

												I wasn't expecting a masterpiece - just a few hours of fun - but it didn't take long to realize that this game would be disappointing.Immediately from the main menu, there's music that doesn't really create OR fit a mood, and when I ventured into the options menu I found practically nothing but a list of resolutions. My Xbox 360 controller worked on the menu, but input failed to register once I entered the game. I won't make it that big of a deal, however, since I'm fine with keyboard and mouse. The gameplay itself is much more of a cause for worry.The fist thing you notice is that jumping is stiff, like the infamous Castlevania jump: you can't change direction in midair. There's also a painfully slow windup time and hang time for each jump, making platforming a pain and breaking the flow of transitioning from run to jump. You can grab onto ledges and pull yourself up, which would be kinda cool if the game didn't completely depend on this SINGLE MECHANIC for 100% of platforming from start to finish. Every time I jump or pull myself up I sigh at how slow it takes. But hey, you might wonder, isn't the game also focused on combat? That should be a nice refresher. Well, guess again.Rocketbirds has a ridiculously shallow form of combat. You shoot directly forward, or you crouch and shoot directly forward. You can't change direction while shooting, so you have to stop shooting and turn around if enemies appear on either side of you. The different weapons seem to be there simply for necessity rather than variety, because the only difference between weapons is the amount of time it takes to kill the enemy. You can throw grenades, but it breaks the flow of the game with its clunky behavior and no way to tell where exactly your mouse is aiming so that you can affect the projected trajectory. There's also the ability to take temporary control of an enemy instead of Hardboiled Chicken, but that feature is COMPLETELY POINTLESS because gameplay doesn't really change at all.There are cutscenes, but they're awful, especially the voice acting. The game also tries to be kinda funny, but I had to double take to make sure that certain lines were ridiculously pathetic attempts at humor. Anything I actually like about this game? Well, the artstyle isn't too bad; I kinda like it. There's also a section early in the game that works like a 2D dogfight minigame which I definitely enjoyed, but the rest of the game is just boring, even painful, to play.TL;DR: Rocketbirds brings nothing new to the action platformer, while also managing to ruin the basics of the genre.

												Rocketbirds is a fun game. It reminded me of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee but with birds and guns. The elements of this game are similar to Abe's; it is a 2d platformer where you solve puzzles and quite often control the minds of your victims. The shooting feels powerful, the flying levels are incredibly fun and the soundtrack is amazing.Some of the puzzles are quite difficult, but not excessively so. Most of the time you can figure out the puzzles almost immediately.The only issue I had with this game was the movement. You have to wait for the movement animation to finish playing every time you move, so sometimes you overshoot the spot that you intended to move to. I sometimes would have trouble getting to where I wanted to go.Overall, this game is a good game worth the low price point. "

												I think this must be what people mean when they say, ""Polishing a turd."" There are lots of layers of polish on this game - an original soundtrack, a flashy trailer, 3D environments - but that masks the fact that Rocketbirds is flawed at its core. The movement controls feel awful, the level design is predictable and the gameplay is extremely limited. I couldn't stand more than an hour. Not worth the $10 price tag. But hey, I got it for free.

												Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is a brainless linear game with clunky and slow controls. Moving your character around feels sluggish and painful. The combat is lackluster, the player has no control in shooting direction besides left or right - all you have to do is hold down your fire button and once the enemy has been defeated you rinse and repeat in the next area. The art and the terrain are very odd, at times it's difficult to differentiate what is a ledge or an obstacle with the 2D/3D graphics, they should of just picked the game to either be full 2D or 3D. The levels are linear, you have to collect a key card before you can open a gate; rinse and repeat every single level. Lastly, how the heck have the game devs not fix the bug where the chapter 5 to 6 cutscene's sound/music cutout after a couple of seconds? The story is forgettable and so is the game with its one dimensional and limited gameplay.			"

												I do recommend this game if you are able to get it at a discount price like I did, picking it up for 2 euros. It has very stiff controls, awesome cutscenes that forced a chuckle out of me here and there, and somewhat repetitive combat. Worth checking out if you enjoy cartoonish action platformers!			"

												Cool game. Neat graphics and gameplay, nice story and fitting background music (which may become a little annoying during replays though). It supports 3D glasses and a controller (didn't try them personally). You can complete the main story in about 5 hours or less in the first playthrough, but co-op mode and achievement whoring (100% easily doable) extend the playtime 5-fold. A bit glitchy sometimes, if it happens during a cutscene just press esc and jump it.Some parts are a bit tough compared to the rest of the game, just don't surrender and keep trying until you get it right.In the jetpack stages the mouse influences your movement, so if you aim and control your direction with the keyboard at the same time you'll fly like a drunk and hit the missile you were trying to avoid.

The best part of this game is the story line the story of a rebellion against the penguin empire. 5.5/10			"

												As you can tell by the screenshots, the game looks gorgeous and the character designs look very nice. There's practically no story here, you are a hardboiled chicken hero who must liberate a land from Nazi penguins. The setting works well. The game itself is a side-scrolling shooter but there is a lot of emphasis on top notch animations, which don't necessarily spell better gameplay. Because there are a lot of animation frames dedicated to each action, the controls can seem cumbersome and unresponsive in a genre like a shooter.The game also throws in some bullet hell sequences which are very exciting to play through. Probably the most exciting parts of the entire game.BUT the game itself is pretty forgiving (on normal difficulty anyway) so it's nothing game breaking. Also has local and online Co-op which I haven't tried. All in all, get it in a bundle or in a sale for cheap and you'll probably enjoy the 3-4 hour ride.			"

												I'll be honest with you, I forgot I even owned this game. I must of got it in a Humble Bundle or something. Regardless, I finally got a chance to play this game, and was simply blown away. This game is a singleplayer/coop classicly themed side-scroller, built in a world of war, espinitoge, cloning and genocide.... featuring chickens, penguins and others. Seriously. The storyline is actually extremely engaging, controls are straight forward and responsive, and there is a good variety of missions and strategy to be employed. I found myself determined to keep going forward and overcoming any chapter I was dying in. So, fan of action/puzzle type side scrollers? You shouldn't be disappointed with this title.TLDR; solid fun, surprisingly deep storyline, challenging gameplay - 8.5/10 "

												After playing the MASS majority of this game I think I have the rights to say something about it. It's a shooting side scroller with the addition of 3-D mechanics , seems gimicky but it does make the game look sleeker.The game's humor is alright, I think the concept of what the story is about is actually kind of interesting and snarky in a way.Likable characters - or birds heh. They're cool.You shoot things generally, it's pretty simple, you can also roll around to avoid enemies (for the most part). I like how simple the game generally is- people may not like the shooting aspects as it may come off as dissapointing or extremley simplistic but it gets the job done. The only major gripes I have with this game is multiplayer as the online community is basically high and dry since this game is a pretty vague and unknown indie game (at least that's what i've noticed). Alot of people ran away from this game because alot of PC gamers couldn't even start the game and it faced plenty of crashes, BUT I believe the devs fixed all of this by this point so there's no more to be concerned about. If you're just bored and you want to start up a game really fast and kill your boredom off with a decent game , i'd recommend this baby.EDIT: This game isn't terrible or anything but i recommened buying this if it's less than 10 bucks. Otherwise ehhh I'd skip it. The ending of the game was sort undramatic compared to some of the other sequences that has appeared in the game itself.			"

-Quick Review-Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is an “arcade-indie shooter” you could say it’s an “arcade shooter-indie”, or even an “independent shooter arcade”. Regardless of what you call it, this was the first game I’ve ever played on steam in this genre.I enjoyed the unique game play, the game did force me to play through the story three times, but it’s a pretty short story so I can forgive it. (Thank you for letting me select specific levels, that made my achievement hunting much easier.)-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  The story of Hardboiled Chick is revealed through the gameplay, I don’t want to spoil the story, you play as “Hardboiled” a Rooster who sometimes has a rocket strapped to his back. The game makes many cliché references to “macho first person shooter games”, or movies in general, however it’s all in good humor. (I don’t think it took itself too seriously, thankfully)Game Play: The controls on the game took a bit of getting used to, you shoot the direction you face. There are some controls that overlap, like trying to get up from a crouch and getting on top of a box. I learned how to work my way around that type of cumbersome mechanic, as a whole though, the game played very well. (note: I play all my games with a keyboard and mouse, however this is one of those games that would play much better with a gamepad, I’m sure of it)The place the game shines is when you’re in jetpack-mode thus the name “Rocketbirds”. Then the game plays like an arcade shooter, but that requires the use of your mouse to control the direction you fly. I found myself enjoying the flying more than the rest of the game.Achievements: As with any general game, there are the achievements you get for playing the game, in addition there are many achievements you will miss on your first play through, which may require a second or third play through. As I indicated in my quick review, “selecting specific levels, made my achievement hunting much easier”.Price: Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken’s standard price is $9.99 I could almost purchase Starbound with that money (inside joke directed at Vinehugger & Zauss – whom never read my reviews) as I keep saying, my value system is (Cost / Time = Value), I played this game for 8 hours, I’ll probably put in another hour or two playing multi-player with my brother Jett50Two, (thank you in advance, my poor achievement tagalong) I think that a dollar an hour is a very good quality. As usual insert comment about games are better on sale, blah blah blah, humblebundle, blah blah blah. Conclusion: I think this game did a very good job telling Hardboiled chicken’s story, I LOVED the music (it was rock, how could I not love it?) the game play was par for the course. At a dollar an hour, I think that’s a reasonable price as well.			"

												I don't know why, but the humor in this game really struck a chord with me. I was laughing right from the second I got control over the main character. The plot is quite ridiculous as well and the humanoid bird-people were hilarious. The soundtrack is outstanding and I even continued to listen to it on Spotify weeks after beating the game.As for the actual gameplay, it was entertaining enough to get me through the end of the game, but it was nowhere near innovative. I know it was trying to go for that old 80's action style gameplay, but I don't feel it holds up as well today. The jetpack dogfight sections were my favorite part and added a much needed change of pace. The typical semi-stealth, semi-shoot-em-up 2D sections got repetitive after a while. With the option to use grenades and the mind-control device, the multi-leveled sections gave the player freedom to try new strategies and experiment. On the other hand, the flat, obstacle-less sections forced me into the same pattern of gunplay given the lack of options.I got this game in the Humble Indie Bundle and it was definitely worth the time I spent on it.

												This game was a huge disapointment to me, tried to figure out like 1 hour to play multiplayer to finally end up knowing you need an XBOX controller (only XBOX, PS3 won't work!). So if you plan on playing multiplayer, you better have a XBOX controller otherwise you're done. Not to say that the menu interface is pretty bad and music looping in the menu get pretty annoying after some time. So you have a controller or  you like solo games, then it might be worth to buy it. Otherwise, it's a big nope from me.			"

												The game has quite a good amount of work put into the artwork as well as gameplay, while maintaing an average storyline. I personally feel the sounds used as well as choice of music is simply brilliant! I've found myself hearing it when not gaming quite often. I finished the game within 3 hours and feel that there is a good pace between the jetpack missions along with the standard shoot em'up style of gameplay. Some of the gameplay elements such as controlling the enemy through bots is quite ingenious and will make you think why is the AI making an infinite amount of penguins spawn on the door.However, a couple of things did leave a sour taste in my mouth which can put off some buyers such as > the missions are quite repetitive in terms of what to do. Find a keycard and unlock a door; not only does this get stale after a while, but some of the missions require puzzle solving skills (getting crates from around the mission, planning how to get them over eachother' which can turn away people wanting a pure run and gun game> there is little variety between the guns. There are 3 weapon classes with only 2 weapons in each class, and two throwable weapons (ones that can allow you to control enemies and grenades) Considering the lenght of the game though, I do feel its quite justifiable.Not really a complaint buy some people may not like the fact that the game is a windowed game.If you can look past these quirks though you will find an intriguing game of killing penguins as a chicken with grenades and guns. I do feel though I should note that I got this game in a bundle, so I did not pay anything near full price for it, and this can impact the way I do feel about the game.I hope this helps, and thanks for reading!

												This game feels off. While I did complete it something about it just fails to make it truly compelling. Could be the extremely repetive music, the story that seems far more serious than it should be and the controls feel a little wonky. The rocket pack sections take a little time to get used to but are the best part of the game. Everything else just seems off.			"

												Just... no.  Not much to redeem it; it's pretty repetitive, and while there are many attempts at laughs, the game was largely without enjoyability.  About 25% through the game I realized this.  That didn't change until I realized the story was finished.			"

												When I think of platforming games, I think about having fun. It's a natural reaction for anyone to have. Rocketbirds: Hardbroiled Chicken takes everything fun about platforming games, and ruins it. I'm glad I donated all the money I spent on this Humble Bundle to chariety, instead of giving it to these ""developers"". Only good thing is the shotgun, it can outrange any other weapon.3/10 would eat Chicken again			"

												Well, if you did get this game via Humble (or any other) bundle but haven't installed it yet, it may be worth a try. If you consider buying it: don't. Music and soundeffects are quite buggy, so most of the time you run through empty hallways without any music. Every 3-4 screens you shoot at a random, always-the-same-looking penguin soldier. The controls are a nightmare with their truly delayed input. The ""puzzles"" are not worth their name. Get a keycard, get another keycard and then get a third keycard. To obtain them you have to - guess what - cross empty hallways, back and forth. Cutscenes are well made with some nice music, but cutscenes can't compensate for a bad gameplay.Oh hey, and guess what: Multiplayer is mostly the same level as in singleplay, just that you are two chickens half sized so you have to climb on each other to reach some edges. Wow.			"

												SUMMARY: Wasted potential with this one. Between the linear levels, bad gunplay, and the ""platforming"", this is just not a good game. Unfortunately it's extremely shallow and unsatisfying. Not even the co-op mode redeems this one, which is saying something.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Let's start with the good things about Rocketbirds:- Pleasant art style- Very good soundtrackUnfortunately that's it. I bought this game with big expectations based on the trailer and images.Here's what I found to be lacking:- Unsatisfying gunplay (NO AIMING!)- Linear levels, with some backtracking thrown in there- Co-op seems like an afterthought. Built on the single player levels, you and your buddy will be walking in parallel to press buttons on another level- ""Puzzles"" consist of having your buddy push a button- Difficulty comes from the game throwing mobs of penguins at you			"

												(I played this game through family sharing.)This is very subjective but beside the soundtrack, I didn't love the game.This isn't a kind of gameplay I like. The fighting wasn't very fun. It felt very slow, repetitive and kinda tedidious. (Jetpack is original but not entertaining enough.)Everything also felt very linear and always made you feel like you were looking for the one step to lead to the other without much choices.The voice acting is kinda lame too, or is-it the character? I'm not sure.In my opinion, this game is cool for the cutscenes and the New World Revolution soundtrack, the rest is just like okay. I just wasn't hooked.			"

												This game started out to be alot of fun.  General platforming and some good quality toilet humor along the way to overthrowing the penguin dictator.It has some good things going for it, like lots of chicken on penguin violence and lots of penguin on penguin violence.  I like  that you can exercise mind control on enemy penguins and make them commit fratricide.  After you've used them up like a spent prophylactic you can throw them away by making them commit suicide.  It's quite entertaining.The animation is top notch and the controls are a bit clunky but it rarely gets in the way.  There are a few levels where you strap on a jetpack and do some dogfighting, which breaks up the platforming nicely.There are a few things that drag this game down though.  Artificial difficulty.  At points in the game they just throw enemies at you from both directions (it's 2D).   Therefore to execute your attack, turn around and execute another attack in time is darn near impossible before those guys just surround you and spam you with gunfire so you can't do anything but sit there and flop around getting shot until they drain all your health.  It gets very annoying.The puzzles never change, you must find this keycard to open that door and advance in the level.  The further you get through the story the less intuitive the keycard quests become.  Here is the formula to figure out the path; if you kill a penguin standing somewhere and he is immediately replaced by another you're suppose to take control of him to do your dirty work, ie open a door or move a platform and take out a few of his teammates in the process.  However to do this you have to throw a....lets call it a ""mind control grenade"".... so as the story goes on they crowbar in more artificial difficulty by making you throw it through smaller windows, bank it off a wall, or make the guy pace around etc.Overall it's a decent game, however I'm about 2/3 through it and I believe I've reached the point of diminishing returns regarding entertainment vs frustration due to ramping artificial difficulty.

												You are a Chicken on steroids combating evil Penguins.StoryHonestly I thought this was gonna be a humorous play on Americans vs Germany or some variation on it, just with birds.  While it is indeed similar, the graphic content of the game actually surprised and offput me a bit, and after awhile felt it was way over done just for the sake of being gory or graphic.  Characters are pretty stereotyped, though the animated cutscenes are well done, as is the voice acting.  The dialogue though is really stale for the main cast I felt, though the penguin henchmen you run into had much more amusing dialogue.GraphicsThe sprites themselves are very well animated (minus sliding boxes around), and the environments are detailed and lush.  The problem is the lack of variety, as you'll either be in a military base, blimp, or forest with the same similar backdrops and details minus a few neat areas that I wish were more prevelant.  Enemy types are also for the most part the same with different colored uniforms.  There are a few different enemy types but you really don't run into them long enough to notice, or they are a boss of sorts and are a one off sadly.ControlsThe keyboard personally had a bit of a wonky control layout, but much more response while the controller (which you need to manually go into the options to enable) had better key layout but a weird sluggish feeling to it.  Also rocket levels are a nightmare on keyboard but much more smooth on controller.GameplayI have no clue how some of these mechanics were deemed okay and sent off to the final product.  Maybe I had extremely bad luck in the game, maybe the game just hates me, but beating this game is a bit like gambling.  You can count your cards, do all the math in your head in probability but it still falls down to that 5% chance that the game will have everything against you.  You cannot aim your gun.  You can only shoot left or right, crouch/roll jump and switch weapons.  Later you get neat little things called brainbugs to control your opponent and grenades but god help you if you even think of using anything other then your machine gun in combat.  Rolling does nothing to dodge incomming fire, and the only way to not be juggled around for 5 seconds being shot at is to pray the level designers put a crate (which they never do minus two or three times) or some sort of thing to hide in.  Or just shoot before they do unless luck decides it says no.  You will be put into near impossible situations such as having two enemies on either side of you with no cover, and friendly enemy fire doesn't exist, yet you can kill a penguin, juggle it's body while another penguin camps behind it and shoots through his friend's corpse and at you.  Walking into the next part can also result in death due to them open firing before you can even have the camera slide fully over into what's even killing you and can only hope the enemy is looking the other way when this occurs.  The puzzle element is more aggrivating than most, as you'll most likely need to brainbug and control an enemy (which is cool but the process involved is tedious) and flip switches or slide boxes around cause you're too short or fat.  Aiming the brainbugs is an incredibly slow process and the aim arch moves slower then water boils.  I want to add your grenades use the same mechanic, and also you can kill yourself with them too and make them impossible to use practically in combat as the enemy is either juggling you with fire or in your face punching you.  The only thing they seem to have gotten right is the rocket levels to which there are only three (with a name like Rocketbirds you'd assume you'd just jetpack everywhere, apparently not).  My only qualm is the keyboard control scheme and the fact the camera can have a mind of its own, zooming in close or super far out and you looking like a grain of rice.SoundDon't be fooled by the endorsed music.  The only time music ever plays is the title screen, cutscenes and very specific places in the game.  Otherwise you're left with the ambience of a military base or jungle with in-game chat sounding like two iron plates rubbing together in the slowest form imaginable.  Even the endorsed music kinda felt like your generic emo-ish indie fair, I personally didn't like it, but I'll leave that up to personal opinion.ConclusionI never actually bothered to beat this game, as I'm on the last boss and just got so darn frustrated by all the stupid mechanics I ragequit.  Apparently the only easier way to kill that boss is to do the most obnoxious task of finding all the red flags achievement and being gifted a knife to kill it with.  I can't be bothered with that crap, and I'd rather actually play a game that involves strategy then play Russian Roulette.			"

The Co-Op campaign Isn't too bad either, It's worth trying If you're seeking a new game to try.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but half an hour into it and I'm just done.. it rubs me in all the wrong ways.Allow me to enumerate my grievances.First- the music is terrible. Think of the worst prog rock crap you heard in the mid 90's and then layer random chicken and gun sound effects over it. Okay sure, that's mean- and subjective. But what isn't subjective is the fact that it's repetetive as hell! And not just in a ""this type of music uses four chords and repeats the same crap over and over again"", but the actual system that delivers the music seems to be somewhat broken- often restarting the music for doing simple things like pausing or walking through a doorway. If the music didn't have vocals, it'd be instantly less annoying- but it'd also have the beneficial side effect of masking the fact that it restarts ALL THE TIME. Okay, so you can turn the music off- let's forgive them this point and move on, shall we?Next, the art. The chickens themselves are actually well designed and interesting- I'll be honest, they're one of the main reasons I flushed $5 down the drain on this one. The hand-drawn look is somewhat unique and appealing- but slap it on some poorly rendered quasi-3D backgrounds that look like something out of a late 90's PSX game and it sucks the life right out of it. But as we all know, fancy art does not a good game make- so again, let's forgive them this point and move on.Gameplay. So much potential.. This seems like one of those ideas that was designed on paper and then executed from start to finish without any usability testing or gameplay prototyping.. none of that 'find the fun' stuff- because it's just not fun. At the end of the day, that's what kills this game for me and it's tragic because it really does have a lot of potential. Imagine playing contra where your dude took up half the screen, moved at a snails pace, rolled at the slightest touch of a button. Now imagine playing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized game, only allow shooting left or right, and make it so you waste tons of ammo juggling dead bodies against the edge of a screen while trying to get the guy who's behind the guy you just killed.The one redeeming part of the gameplay were the jetpack segments of the game, which plays a bit like MiniSquadron if you've ever played that. HOWEVER- they manage to donk that up too by constantly changing the focal point of the camera to parts of the sky that your dude isn't even in! So you're controlling a flying chicken completely blind while the game spawns more AI into the field- by the time the camera pulls back you waste time trying to find yourself and orient so you can take on the new enemies. When AI flies offscreen there's no offscreen indicators that hint at where they might be coming from.. so you just fly around hoping to cross paths with them (meanwhile the AI knows exactly where you are at all times).I'm not even going to get into the poorly balanced weapons and ammo system, or the infuriating juggle/stun system.So I can safely recommend that you stay clear of this one, unless A) you're morbidly curious, and B) it's sufficiently discounted.

												(I only finished the single player campagin)This game had great potential to become a great indie game, but unfortunately the game is broken, it feels like a rushed product. Here are my reasons:1. Unfriendly controls (I used a Xbox 360 controller)2. Combat system is broken (The only trick to win gunfights is to shoot the enemy before they spam bullets at you)3. turrets makes no sense ( Well, the moment you forget to dodge, you are instantly dead, which makes people feels unfair for unreasonable deaths)4. Boss fight is frustrating and broken and BORING5. There is no actual reason to switch to your pistol after getting the rifles /shotgun /machinegun (you can only burst fire the machine gun, seriously?) Most games have weapon swaping mechanic because each weapon has its own advantages but pistols have NO advantage in any aspect in comparison to the other weapons6. Grenades does not fit in combat, i repeat, grenades does not work well in combat.In my opinion the game does not worth 10 buck. And I will give it a 5/10 for being an incomplete game.			"

												CO-OP ReviewI felt I needed to specify, as the game has both a single-player and cooperative campaign.  I thought the visuals and mood were a lot of fun, and there were some surprisingly solid tunes on the soundtrack.  However, the controls were imprecise, and the online mode seemed a bit unoptimized and laggy.  In some of the later levels, precision was often needed (having to run past an enemy and turn on a dime to shoot him in the back, negotiating turrets which often killed your character outright if you were caught in the line of fire, etc), which compounded these issues.  The checkpoints were not overly punishing, but being felled by clunky controls never feels good.			"

												Nice and fun platform shooting game. There is nothing exceptional and when you play you don't say ""OMG! This is terrific! Best indie game ever"". No. You don't. But... it is different, some rock and roll BMG, easy to play, short story - even though it is a 15 chapter game -,it is fun sometimes and has a little pinch of humor. Some old platform things, like collect 3 itens per stage. It is also simple to get achievements, but some stages you need play twice to understand how get them. And you can also play co-op, which is another experience.If it on sale, I recommend. I liked and I want a sequel :)Final grade: 7.0/10			"

The game has a ""joke"" atmosphere, though I cannot recall laughing at any moment. Songs are okay, I wish they had no lyrics. The fighting gets old quickly, the controls are a little bit weird, and the game was otherwise very straightforward.The achievements were straightforward also, but use a guide for the ""signs achievement"" or you'll be playing this for 50h.I would give this a 5/10, but okay, I'll lean towards the 5.5/10 just because I loved the sound the enemies make when they die.

												Kinda crap, but the soundtrack might be to your liking. Doesn't seem to know what it wants to be as a game? Basically every level is going to involve a new mechanic, including, yes, a stealth level (one that might actually leave you stumped on where to go for a bit) until midgame, when you begin repeating levels (hi jetpack stages).The problem is, it does none of these things well. Apparently you needed a gun to punch men, as you learn when your weapons are confiscated and you can no longer perform melee moves. Some of the guns flat out suck, but you're going to get a selection of them by the end despite only wanting to use one or two because ???. Combat comes down to ""crouch and fire/punch"" with the occasional ""stand up to shoot because someone is behind 'cover'"" moment. Getting shot up? Walk offscreen and then begin juggling people as they walk onto yours because neither you or the enemy can shoot between screens, and this game is real bad about animation getting in the way of gameplay (see: the huge lead time/cutscene on brainbugs).When I started it, I was a lot more optimistic about the title, and then I kept playing. That was my first mistake.			"

												Rocketbirds, a great looking platformer that never delivers on it's promise. The scene is set, one badass chicken is ready for a fight, everything points towards action action and action, but immediately after dropping into the game, im left with a question ""what are my suppose to do here and why?"", the game fails to explain this to me and it feels like im just running around, level after level only to progress to the next, cut scenes are slow, doll and confusing, like watching an animation created by students, voice over seems to be done by one guy, it's slow and boring, if the point is to kill the sense of ACTION it's a success. this would not bother me so much if the gameplay were spot on, but sadly i found it tedious, repetitive and boring, controls seems heavy and lack the responsiveness we see in titles like super meat boy and Broforce. Levels are hard to read, ""is that a platform i can jump to or not!"", everything in the scene blends together, making it hard to distinguish where to go and why, one time i found myself running above the entire level, as far as i understand i was suppose to do so, but it felt wrong and misplaced.weapons and enemies are so so, enemies are lacking an healthbar making it very hard to judge how many bullets it takes to kill him, there's no indication of how far your weapon reaches, a simple smoke trail would have helped a great deal, only indication that an enemy is dead is the dropping of bullets, and a weapon you can't pickup?, if you like bullet sponges with no indications this is for you.despite all this, graphics is really great, the parallax scrolling effect works well, there's a great sense of depth in the scenes, lightning is great, character animations are great and i did enjoy the flying scene quite a bit. I do think this games deserves a thumbs up, it does have a qualifying production value, but i felt bored playing the game and could not be bothered finishing it, i may pick it up again another day, but until then it's a thumbs down for me.

												Wasnt expecting much from this because it just reminds me of food but it was a pleasant surprise! Gameplay is simple and easy. Best for wasting time, really. Also there are chickens. The story is cute but thankfully not long. Get it if you want a relaxing platformer.			"

												Just worth it buy !!This game is awesome its too cheap for its price and really worth it, If you want a little describtion and fast one so i can describe it with some words ..... Funny, Enjoyable, Interesting, Great Story and Great 2D Game.The problem is that the game story is kinda of too short and needs some DLC's for much more fun but everything in the game is great and has no bugs/issues.You will have too much fun even when you're bored it will change your mood just buy it and have fun !!

YouTube™ Video: Steam Cleaning - Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken

			When the evil penguin army takes to the sky with oversized jetpacks and begin terrorizing the world only one brave Chicken can stop the forces of Albatropolis!		

When the evil penguin army takes to the sky with oversized jetpacks and begin terrorizing the world only one brave Chicken can stop the forces of Albatropolis!The individual elements of this game are a bit weak, simple navigation puzzles, over the top but simple gunplay and loose in air combat.  However, when tied together with a pumping soundtrack and well produced animated cut scenes it all mixes into a quality time.			"

												You know what the best thing about this mess of a ""game"" is? The soundtrack...it's awesome. The aesthetics are also pretty nice...a bit different from the usual, so kudoz on that. Let me think...nope, can't think of anything more. What I really don't get is how this game can get reviews like 5/5 or 9/10...on the store page...this is ridiculous. Even if it wasn't so bad, it would never be THAT good. I read♥♥♥♥♥♥like ""plenty of content""...I beat this in 2.8 hours!!!!!!! And most of it was being stuck...lol. A pro can beat this♥♥♥♥♥♥in under an hour...this is NOT plenty of content...jesus christ.Why you should NOT buy this game, not even during a sale, as I did:You are a chicken...this is cool. You have guns...also cool. This is where cool ends.You can either run or ""roll""...funnily enough the roll move is also the best way of locomotion for 95% of the game. Running was only useful for 1 or 2 precision actions. Rolling can be chained together, it is faster, more responsive, you need it to bypass enemies with shields and 95% of the time whenever you encounter an enemy they will immediately drop down and shoot at you. If you are in ""run"" mode this means you will simply shoot over their heads, miss and die a gruesome and quick death.By the way...enemies. There are a few generic enemy types. Enemies with guns, with bigger guns, with shields and melee weapons and those with rockets. None of those is even remotely challenging on its own, however they have the annoying habit of appearing suddenly BEHIND you, which wouldn't be that bad, but for the following:The game has no continous scrolling background...you move through fixed backgrounds, after about 2-3 seconds you reach the end of a screen and a new screen is instantly loaded. On this screen there can be a number of enemies...you can't know, so I found it best to just be rolling around all the time and instantly shooting as soon as I entered a new screen. Often enough enemies will then enter the screen behind you, while you are already fighting an enemy before you, meaning they will shoot you in the back, which more often than not results in your death or severe health loss and subsequent death on the next screen. The only way to prevent this is to either stick to the very end of a screen, because enemies will not shoot you outside of the current screen or roll behind an enemy and make sure to not have enemies in both directions. They will not shoot one another (the shield guys are an exception, somehow they can be bypassed by enemy bullets).Enemies are also bullet sponges. No matter the weapon, pistol or assault rifle, they will take a whole lot of punishment. This only changes with the final weapon, which does not have a continuous firing mode, but a burst mode...you get that weapon after you have completed 90% of the game...or even more...have I mentioned that you can only shoot left or right? no up/down...nope.Puzzles...this game has ""puzzles"". These puzzles look something like this: There is a Tower with 4 sections and 4 levels or so...the puzzle involves you going from Section A, level 2, to Section B, level 3, collect a card, go to Section C, level 1, collect another card, go to Section D, level 3, mind control a minion, activate some elevator, go to Section C, level 4, ride the elevator down to Section A, level 1, collect another card, lalalalsakgnjfdajkgndfjksgndsjknagjksdnjkganfdgk I can't even! I understand backtracking...what I don't understand is senseless prolonging of levels. I completed this game in about 2-3 hours on normal...most of that time was spent dying randomly or trying to figure some stupid puzzle out that has you going around the whole level multiple times...I especially loved the crates in level 11...♥♥♥♥ you. All the levels are built like this famous ziggurat puzzle or whatever it's called: move the top layer to an empty space, move the next layer to the next empty space, move the first layer back and forth and so on, until you have moved thy ziggurat/Pyramid whatever from 1 place to another...it's horrible design. The final level has you ride different elevators up and DOWN a rocket again, as the villain tries to flee from you!!!!!! WTF? And that after the most boring boss fight in history that lasted ages anyway and didn't even have music...you have to experience this♥♥♥♥♥♥to believe it.Between those levels you can use a jetpack...you might think this would be fun...it's not. The level are literally always the same. There are 2 enemy types, each wave spawning more of each. That's it...survive a few waves then blow up the airships with the same procedure as explained above.You also have grenades, which are pretty useless, because to throw them far you have to stand up. Standing up in a fight usually means you die before you even threw the damn thing. Even behind ""cover""...You also have a sort of brain control thing...this isn't a tottaly useless feature but most of the times you can only use it at fixed points in the game to control an enemy and open a door or move a box or activate an elevator...lame, boring...also sometimes it takes 1 hit, sometimes 3...lol weird.The check points are also a joke. Sometimes you start right after you died, sometimes you have to navigate half of the level again. They are just really awkwardly placed at times. Especially before the final ""wave"" fight...man those are stupid...if you die at the first wave, you have to ride the elevator upwards again...this takes about 10 seconds or so...it's unnecessary. After the first wave though the game saves after every wave and even respawns you with additional health and ammo...lol.The voice acting and writing is so bad, that I almost had to switch the sound off. Luckily they did not use a lot of voice acting. They even have some kind of wannabe Schwarzenegger accent in there...wtf. It's so bad. The writing itself is extremely boring. You do not care about most of the stuff. The best you get out of the story are the cutscenes, which evoke at least some kind of emotion. The soundtrack also helps...You're also being objected to several superfluous text bubbles that you have to endure...nothing really matters but you also can't skip it.The sad part is that I wanted to like this game...but the more I played the more I hated it, so my final voting if I had to would be 5/10, because the soundtrack and the art and the general aesthetic is pretty nice. Gameplay wise this game is junk...sorry.Summary:+ Awesome soundtrack IF you like Alt rock+ Nice setting, different types of birds acting as ""races""+ Nice graphics style in general- bad gunplay- bad movement controls- horrible level design- boring enemy design- at times unfair save points and general situations- no continuous game screen, instead multiple screens per level- boring game mechanics- shallow game play- cringeworthy voice acting- extremely boring story- annoying writing and waiting and elevator rides...so many elevator ridesDo yourself a favour and do not buy this game. Instead by ""Mark of the Ninja"" or ""Shank 1/2"". Those are games that do everything a lot better, have great gameplay and a cool story, while being similar enough to a 2D killing simulator...Ugh...including this review I have wasted about 3-4 hours of my life with this...why?

												This is an amazing local co-op game. Jump on your partner's back, and you essentially become a moving turret. The controls are superb, and the game feels smooth. Sometimes it's a little tricky to see what's going on with you and your partner (plus enemies) on a single floor, but as long as you find the trigger you usually manage.Also, the CHICKEN YOU HAVE TO RESCUE KEEPS RUNNING AWAY FROM YOU FOR WHATEVER REASON AND IT MAKES ME REALLY UPSETHighly recommended.

												i wanted to like this game but ultimatly the bad design poor placement of checkpoints and clunky laggy controlls killed my enjoyment before i reached the end of the game, i still beat it and the final boss was in line with the rest of the game, uninspired and kinda dull.geting stunlocked by 2 enemies because they can shoot through eachother and dead bodies but you cant is infuriating, the part that almost made me grind my teeth was the ending of the museum sequance, after slving a rater simple puzle you fall through a hole and have to fight enemies from both sides who take cover making them hard to hit, stagger their shhoting patterns and, if they hit you, the will most likley stunlock you to death, thenyou have to go through the same puzzle again because the autosave was BEFORE THE PUZZLE.the higlight of the game is the jetpack sequances but even then the fact that you can be stunlocked by 2 unlucky hits ruined the pacing and some of the fun.you can't turn off the paralax scrolling of the foreground making it very hard to find the wy to go, weather it be a small vent with only a corner visable when you are near it or a floor that can be shot through but not moved throughthe controlls need special mention, you can crouch with the down key but cant get back up with it, you can only activate things  like switches and dark cover while standing so you have to press up to stand then wait an agonizingly long second or so befoe you can input any other commands like hide in cover so you dont get shot, esc takesyou to the menu but not out of the menu, you cant use  space  or E to hit resume, you need to use the mouse  or press Enter.  ultimatly the game is fairly easy and a bit fun but the poor controlls alone make it a Cannot recomend.

												I've been having trouble with longer reviews as of late, so I've decided to leave the longer review on Pastebin and post a summary of the shorter review here. Here is the link to the longer review: http://pastebin.com/c7RuD022 .Gameplay: Mediocre stage and enemy design, disappointing lack of variety of weapons, only kinda fun during flight sections, final and only boss is really bad. 4/10.Story: Very confused writing, can't decide whether it wants to be dark or funny, fails at doing both at same time as well as individually, has a cliffhanger at the end which remains unfulfilled three years later. 3/10.Graphics: Much like writing, art style is very confused and tries to be grimdark quite often. 2D characters and 3D environments don't work too well at all here. At least it's optimized pretty okay, but that doesn't help much. 1/5.Sound: OST is either generic or really bad butt rock, voice acting is truly dreadful, sound design is okay but could've been loads better. 1/5.4/3/1/1; 3.0/10.

												Скажем прямо, заговор между пингвинами существует. Это подтверждают мозговые жучки, странные символы клоны. ВОКРУГ КЛОНЫ! Никому верить нельзя! Не верь сопротивлению - я им не верю, они слишком похожи на наркоторговцев. Самый главный свидетель заговора между пингвинами из подразделения рокетбердс хардболед чикен рассказывает свою историю в шутливой манере. Сначала кажется что механика игры тупая, потом хочется обозвать АИ тупым, но вспоминаешь что имеешь дело с курицами, потом интерес подогревается сюжетом и весьма неожиданными нововведениями. Оказывается-то, игра стоит своих денег.			"

												This game is one of the most boring run and gun games i have ever played.The shooting mechanics lack depht and all you do is juggle same 5 types of enemies (the peasant,fat pingu,nazi pingu and 007 pingu),The levels on co-op have puzzles in them similiar to the single player but they are super easy once you get the on trick pony tactic of walking towards the same side except in different platforms.Levels look like each other straight up.All of them are in a base but they change background like air snow or jungle base.There are some jokes in the game and the humour spectrum is between Little big planet and a nickolodeon sitcom.There is rarely any music in the levels.There are so few sound effects that there isn't even an indication of low health sound and when you die there isn't even a game over or death indication.İt just spawns you back to the last save point with a black screen.I bought this game around 1$ price and i could have done better thing with it like buying a tissue to wipe my snot with or a bubble gum.Stay away at all costs.

												The game has a somewhat endearing factor to it when it comes to the cutscenes and general layout/plot, but when it comes to gaming, it becomes a monotonous drone of a thing. Playing becomes a constant go here-go there with the occasional massacre of a simple enemy or two. All in all, not worth the money or your time.			"

												I'm reviewing solely the local co-op version of this game. I have not played the solo campaign.I found the local co-op difficult to play for several reasons. There's no tutorial, so you have no idea what you can and cannot do. It took me until level 4 to discover that when I was out of ammo, RT became melee. You can't duck behind objects for protection, so you take all hits thrown your way. There's not enough ammo or health drops for two playens. The ""puzzles"" consist mostly of trying to coordinate with your co-op partner where you each need to be at any given moment, since you can't split up beyond any one screen. Hopping on top of your partner always happens at the wrong time,and it's never clear what you can and can't reach.The game mechanic seems to *want* to be non-stop shooting (which is fun), and yet it limits ammo and then suddenly introduces poorly designed puzzles to slow things down even further. The actual game is this: can you jump without snapping onto your partner's shoulders?			"

												Tedious, clunky, and infuriating. It's a side scrolling shooter type game where you can juggle enemies by shooting them, but if you aren't quick enough the enemies can juggle you as well. There is almost no way to avoid getting juggled besides shooting first or hiding in the background in certain areas on a few levels. A total of six weapons can be obtained in game; three of them are simply better versions of the first three. Setting and story were somewhat interesting, but the Developers chose not to do elaborate on anything besides providing a basic background for the events of the game as told through music video cutscenes. The music is decent, not great though. It's some sort of British  Alt - Indie rock. Did I mention that the controls are clunky as♥♥♥♥♥♥ You move insanely slow, with awkward jumping and rolls thrown in to round out the crappiness. You also can't aim up or down, which is just as well since most of the time your enemies will be on the same level as you juggling you the second you come into view. The only things this game has going for it are the graphics, which are nice, and the jetpack sections which reminded me of Luftrausers. It's a shame a game called rocketbirds doesn't let you actually be a rocketbird most of the time.			"

This game is MAYBE worth a dollar, but you really aren't missing much if you skip this game. There are much more fun sidescrollers if that is what you are looking for. (ex, metal slug 3 is a much more fun side scroller and costs a little less than this).			"

												I would recommend this for the sale price it's currently at. I've spent a buck fifty on far less entertaining things. That being said, I would agree with the other negative reviews in saying it's not quiiiite worth a full $10. That feels really cheap of me to say, with indie games already being so low cost in most cases compared to AAA titles, but as other reviews have pointed out, the mechanics of gunfighting and the platforming are just not really ""there"" enough. The controls are sluggish and the platforming and a few of the puzzles are kinda frustrating as well. Gunfights in particular are really frustrating, espeically the final ""boss"" once he puts up his shield. You're literally either trying to roll past him (because you have no way to take cover in this particular battle,) or running the opposite direction until you loop around and can fire off one or two bursts before repeating in the opposite direction. For that matter the ""cover"" you CAN get in some areas is pathetic. ""Let me hide around this corner, but no matter how I time it, whenever I pop out of cover the penguins are going to shoot and i'm not going to have enough time to pop off some shots before I die.""That all being said. The game has good heart and some good humor. I'd pay up to $5 for it I think in it's current state. The ending kind of alludes to a sequel. We'll see how that turns out.			"

												Ok, the first and foremost thing you need to know about Rocketbirds is that it is a platforming puzzle game with shooting elements. You might think it’s a shooting game, but really it’s not. There’s about two really nitty gritty fights where they toss enemies at you, three or so rocket pack fight sections, and a final boss. Other than that shooting is pretty much getting the first hit, or dodge rolling to go and get a first hit. That said, the platforming puzzles can be pretty decent. Nothing to write home about, but with its design, setting, and music it makes the game enjoyable for the most part. IF they do a sequel I think the game could be polished up to be something even more memorable. "

												Not a bad game!  It's a pretty nice, short platformer, with some flight battles built in.  The flight combat is sort of hard as you fly where you aim your gun; therefore, you can't fly away from your enemy while also shooting at them.  The other combat is pretty enjoyable, although can get a bit repetitive, especially if you suck like me and keep losing a fight and having to redo it.  As for time spent in game, I was able to pick it up and beat it in roughly 3 hours.  Granted, I didn't find all the hidden signs in the game which would have added some more time, but I also didn't feel a need to find those signs.  Often when I would find one, I couldn't figure out how to get it so I just left it behind.  The reward for getting them all isn't anything too special as far as I understand.  Regardless, I had this on my wishlist and as soon as it was on sale I purchased it.  I don't feel like I wasted any money here.  While short, it was still enjoyable.  There's just something awesome about being a chicken teaming up with cardinals to take down evil penguins.			"

												I played only a few minutes of this game that came hitched to one of the humble indie bundles, and it is just terrible. It sucks immeasurable amounts of♥♥♥♥♥ The gameplay, sound effects, controls and, especially, voice acting are all awful, its a dissapointing $10 game that came attached to a set of otherwise brilliant games. Don't touch it, find a better use of 10 dollars, go set it on fire and wave it at a homeless person.			"

												Why, just why, because Indie games, that's why...ooh.Pro- artstyle/animation- music- good checkpoint system- co-op- shortCon- not for casual there is no 'easy' option, lame- story is a mess also rip-off/generic- control lag- game mechanics rip-off, key cards and enemy control very old ideas- voice acting sometimes and other times annoying gibberish- spamming enemies both left and right and behind player is lame- every time you get shot you fly in the air and flips around losing all the controls- bad difficulty spikes sending waves of enemies and last boss took me 10 min,    running left and right- if you care for achievements you will do a lot of backtracking and also    you need to get lucky because you need to shoot enemies and they      collect flags by flying to them not the player, lame Flash game don't spend more than 1$, i got it in a bundle.5/10 rating.

												OMG.... Fu-ck-in BUY IT peeps... brilliant game... the music is brilliant (the first time I've actuaklly refrained from diasbling music in a game!), the graphics are beautifully done, the story is epic, it's funny and it's different and it's just a typical gun-ho american taking on the world rambo style... the enemies seem to reflect both nazi and russian agressors, sort of like a cold war WWII mash up... Hardboiled Chicken is probably the best side scroller action game to date for me personally! Best part was that i bought it for $2.49USD which was 75% the normal price... Of course I've only but played an hour, but so far, it's definitely worth the full price of $9.99...I'm not sure how long the story goes for... I will update as soon as I've finished it... but it's definitely better than most indies, and it certainly shows the love that was placed into the game!			"

												Rocketbirds : Hardboiled Chicken starts on a fancy cartoon cinematic, with an hilarious premise. Sadly, the game in itself isn't that good. It is sometimes fun, but it's more like ""game prototype made by students in 6 months"" fun than ""actually released game"" fun.Pros :- Cool ""cliché action movie parody"" feel & ambiance- Pretty cinematics- Nice musicCons :- Spending half of the game wondering what is actually a wall or platform, and what isn't- Absurd difficulty peaks every now and then- The jetpacks phases are awfully designed (very poor balancing of enemies stats, absurd camera moves, weird controls)- The controls of the character is sometimes frustrating- The fighting system is very poor and sometimes frustrating- A lot of small details the developers seems to have overlookedIf you like old-school sidescroller and/or action parodies, and have the opportunity to get it in a bundle or during a sale, it may be worth a try. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

Captains Log, 20.10.2016Setting sail for uncharted waters! Destination: Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken. The name is the game! You are Hardboiled, a rooster destined for greatness….wait. What? Yeah, right! You have to free the birds from the brutal penguin reign of terror! For real! Also contains jetpacks.First look at the game: also available as VOD on twitch[www.twitch.tv]Hardboiled Chicken is a side scrolling action-platformer with light puzzle elements and heavy jetpack elements! The game goes for some of the usual: You can pick up different weapons; you can climb and jump, hang on to ledges and first and foremost kill a lot of evil penguins.But that is nearly it with the usual. Between missions in the campaign that take place on the ground (or underground) you have to get your jetpack on and go for some aerial combat awesomeness! That rocks! Besides the usual mp, pistol shotgun routine you get a supply of “Brainbugs” that let you control penguins. And have them do your chores for you. Also lets you kill the mindcontrolled penguin by suicide. Not beautiful or heroic.Did I mention jetpacks?! And there are some parts in the game where you have to move crates around or find a certain penguin to press a button you cannot yet reach. Not the best moments of the game. But let´s focus on the more important JETPACK part, alright?Look and feel and sound: Hardboiled Chicken comes with a nice soundtrack, very good looking environment and solid controls. It seems at times a bit weird how the pistol fires, jumping can be a bit difficult to aim. But in all honesty: It is just damn fun to play this game. Also, just to briefly mention it: It is totally weird and a bit insane at times. But that is fun too! The puzzle parts do feel like a distraction and don´t fit in as well as all the other ideas in this game.Captains Orders:If you got a co-op buddy this game will really shine, as a single-player game it is good fun for in-between. I would say grab it when it´s on sale for 5 to 10 € and go for it.Verdict: Cargo!  Will just put it in once in a while to jetpack around a bit or get a friend to play it with me. That’s just a fun little game! No more, no less.For more Reviews visit  CaptNemo's Log[captainnemoweb.wordpress.com]For Gameplay Videos and live streaming visit CaptN3mo's twitch channel[www.twitch.tv] "

												All the stuff it does right (good art, original premise, some fun sections) is negated by its broken combat system, which often puts you in unwinnable scenarios by no fault of your own. There's no Easy mode available outright, which means there's no options for mitigating that. As much as I'd like to say it's worth it to try it out at least, I can't, unless you got it extra cheap, for free or in some bundle.			"

												Rocketbirds is one of the best indie games out there its really special. While the story is a bit lacking writing you dont get whats going on the same happens for the co op campaing. While the game is alot of fun there are some issues that are game breaking which they might fix them in the future.The co op campaing is pretty simple and easy at times but the problem is that for the other player its lagging as hell so its not very playebel. But minor issues aside the game is really good. The art style is really well done, fun gun gameplay, sometimes smart puzzles and an amazing soundtrack that should be availabel for purchases. If you like platformers this needs to be checkd out. Minor issues aside its a great game and i give it a 8/10			"

												A complete blast.  You are a rooster, or chicken (in co-op) and you are trying to save the general's daughter from the evil penguin empire.  My daughter and I played through the entire co-op and loved it.  Some parts can be frustrating, but overcome with patience.  The end of each level is very funny, because the daughter runs away after you save her each time, which really annoys the roosters.  The music is rock and will come in scripted parts of the game.  The game controller or keyboard set-up both work very well with this game.  If you enjoy simple shooting and puzzle platformers I would highly recommend this.			"

												This is almost a good game; it has decent controls, music, graphics, humor and the elements to make it a good game.But it doesn't utilize those elements, you can hide in the shadows for example but it's pointless. There are no stealth kills, hard puzzles or platforming.You can shoot in a straight line while rolling around at penguins also rolling around and shooting in a straight line, no altering the angle up or down and melee attacks seem to just stun. I'm not sure because I give up after about 10 hits and the bird just rolls away from me and starts shooting in a straight line. Until I easily kill it with a weapon.On some levels you can fly a jet pack that accelerates extremely fast and shoot in a straight line with a fast strong gun that you don't use on the ground for some reason.I feel slightly bad not recommending this game even at the sale price of $1:50. It has so much potential to make it fun or at least some variation.In then end though you will just end up shooting in a straight line using only the left mouse button and space bar, probably getting bored 20 minutes into it. This game seems like it would be good for someone who's hands got crippled in an accident, although some acts like moving a box (Shift + L) may cause difficulty to for progression of rolling around and shooting in a straight line since you can't rebind the controls.

												Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken (just RB from now on) is a platformer with some puzzle elements with occasional ""jetpack"" action... or as the game put it, jetpaction, where you engage enemies in 2D. You, the nameless chicken, was captured by the penguin regime when small and brainwashed into being the ultimate commando, but on a mission, you were shock by the atrocity, and saw a younger version of yourself and reverted back to being on the chicken side. However, you are alone, and aside from a few resistance members, there is no help. But it doesn't matter... You will destroy Putzki, head of the Penguin regime, and end their reign of terror... or die trying (well, there's always reload from checkpoint). The game is basically a platformer shooter where you need to jump, crouch, and otherwise shoot, ambush, and kill your way through the penguin army in your quest. As you continue, you gain additional weapons. You start with a trusty pistol, but you will soon upgrade to SMG, shotgun, and later, assault rifle, and you also gain the use of grenades and ""brainbugs"" that can remote control a penguin if you can get it close enough and have the penguin kill penguins for you, at least for a little while. The puzzles are bascially trying to get the keycards to advance to a different part of the map, and that obviously requires some backtracking, and crate stacking, and so on to allow you to access ledges that were not otherwise accessible. There are ""timed sections"" where you fight your way through a penguin zepplin to the escape hatch, and that can get REALLY hairy! The rocket fights are rather cute, as you basically control this rocket pack, which only has on, or off. You can control the direction, and if you turn rocket off, you go on inertia until gravity takes over. This can let you shake pursuers and shoot them full of lead as they fly by (i.e. the Maverick maneuver from Top Gun) . Penguins also have helicopter rocketeers who shoots guided rockets at you but if you fly carefully you can guide the rocket to hit an enemy instead before they self-destruct due to lack of fuel. Once you got everybody, you either land on the zepplin and fight through it, or you make your way back to the ground for more penguin destruction. The game slowly introduces tougher enemies and the pacing is about just right. Long cutscenes between some levels setup the stage and shows the back history of the world and how it got to the present day. It is quite a bit of fun, and there's even a coop mode (which I didn't try). My only gripe is the timed sections being a bit too hard, even on normal. IMHO, of course. May not be worth full price, but it's definitely worth trying if you like some action every once in a while.			"

The levels are a pretty much all the same but I enjoyed it anyway. I'm not really sure why I enjoyed it it's nothing special. Run 'n' gun  platformer but with a rocket backpack thrown in that you can't use whenever you want. I don't know it's okay, it has replayability and apparently multiplayer though I didn't do any of that. Though the only reason you would replay it is to get achievements I suppose, but there are plenty of completionists out there. I got this in a Humble Bundle so I can't really complain but I wouldn't feel okay with spending £7 on it to be honest but that might just be me being a Scrooge. If you get the chance then get it while it's on sale or in another Bundle instead of paying full price.			"

I would recommend this if you can digest non-serious casual games.			"

												Hidden gem of Steam. If you want to get awesome action platformer, with wonderful music,  solid gameplay, unusual setting and tons of gags - that's your choice! Oh, and I forgot to mention fun 2-player co-op (local and Steam-based), controller support and stereoscopic mode. Still thinking? It's on sale now :)			"

												Yet another indie title i bought, not knowing what to expect, and again being pleasantly surprised by what i discovered, Rocketbirds is as unique as it is quirky, funny at times yet, think too deeply and seems to hide something darker. Philosophising aside, though the gameplay may become somewhat repetitive, the story, mechanics and simply astounding soundtrack give this game a strange allure and a strange desire to keep playing, even once the story is over and done with.

												What a weird game.Nice visuals, unique atmosphere, but the game is boring in itself. The fights against enemies require very little skills. The game is extremely linear, and the rare puzzles are tedious, but unchallenging.The voice acting and dialogue is absolutely terrible, but I'm unsure if it's volontary or not. As for the aerial dogfights, they get repetitive very fast, though they are probably the best part of the game.Haven't had the opportunity to try co-op yet, but I don't think it will hold a lot of content.Finished in about 2 and half hour, do not buy for more than 2 bucks.

												The game quite frankly gets boring after a few levels. this is barely a platformer, more of a go-forward-and-shoot. it has a few nice ideas like jetpacking and mind control but it's nothing to keep me in the game. I dropped it at chapter 8 because if it didn't get fun up until now I won't force it on.Gotta give credit when it's due though: the music is pretty good. but don't let that convince you to play the game.

												Amazing music and satisfying enough gunplay. Could have had more levels where you actually fly, and the puzzles where just alright but kind of frustrating at some levels. It's also kind of fun hearing the penguins talk by themself.Co-op is alright, but it's annoying in a lot of cases: There are absolutely no rocketflying bits in co-op, and some really nice feautures are better in co-op but just wasn't even in singleplayer. Why aren't there as many enemies in singleplayer? The first five levels or so are just plain boring...Overall I recommend this game if you're into the music and epic scenes with birds being slaughtered. If you have a friend who's also interested I recommend it even more.			"

												This game is just dull.Beyond the entertainment of ""LOL FUNNEH CHICKENZ AND PENGUINZ WIF GUNSSSS"" the combat is restricted and reptitive (can only shoot in two directions, standing or crouching. Fighting multiple enemies is all about making sure you keep juggling with bullets before anyone can stand up) the movement is clunky (running has the slowest wind up ever. Jumping is painfully stiff) and to top it all off the ""extra objectives"" require you to backtrack from the middle to end of the level all the way back to the start, and may even require you to restart the level from way back since you had to keep a specific enemy alive in order to reach a marker (there is zero indication of which enemy you aren't supposed to kill until it's too late).Also the soundtrack blows.

												Rocketbirds is a weird little game with a weird story, weird characters, weirder voice acting, and an inappropriately great soundtrack that makes the whole thing seem better than it really is.  Not that it's bad.  But it IS simple*.  And quite short.  TOO short.At first, Hardboiled's (that's the character's name) animations seem choppy, which makes movement seem choppy, which it actually isn't.  It's weird.  Hard to explain.  And then there are the jetpack levels, which are buttery smooth.  Both are fun in their own way, but the jetpack aspect of R:HC in particular bears the distinct mark of unrealized potential.  Now that I think about it, the potential fun of the grenade and mind-control elements weren't exploited nearly as much as they should have been, either.  While these ARE essentially criticisms, they also suggest that any expansion packs or sequels could be fairly great.And I never thought I'd say this, but one missing feature I'd like to have seen is the option to turn off the blood and gore.  There's a younger age group the art style and relatively simple platform-type gameplay would appeal to, were it not for the more adult violence.  Honestly, as silly as the game is, the blood almost feels out of place anyway.Is Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken worth $10?  For me, no.  Would it have been worth $3?  Sure.  Why not.  On payday.*Simple, except for the signs.  Tagging each of the three hidden signs in each level can be quite a chore, if not also mind-bendingly difficult.  Hope you enjoy re-backtracking through emptied stages.  BUT collect them all and you'll unlock... a meaningless achievement.  Meh.			"

												Completed in 5 hours. Not a bad game. Actually, I'd recommend it as a good action platformer (with some unfortunate puzzle elements). However: the areas with waves of enemies in a locked room are broken, with enemies being ""human"" (penguin) shields to your bullets but not to each others. I kept getting killed by enemies that were behind other enemies who could shoot past their allies but I was instead shooting the dead, juggled bodies of their allies instead of them. Also, the jetpack sections are a mess, with a huge zoom-out effect and screen scroll every time new flying enemies appear, making it harder to see the ammo or health pickup you were aiming for or the rocket that is still chasing you (fired from a previous enemy) that you're still expected to avoid, even if both you and the rocket are off screen. Both the waves of enemies and the jetpack sections checkpoint frequently, so they become a battle of attrition rather than skill. These two sections are also where the game showcases its' soundtrack. Short sections of uninspired music looping endlessly. On first hearing at the title screen, it got me in the mood for an action game. But repetitively looped in frustrating, cheaply designed action sequences (the waves and the jetpack), both these sections and the one to two verse or chorus songs had both gameplay and music making each other worse. There are also some ridiculous puzzle sections involving playing around with box stacking and elevators that do nothing but artificially lengthen the game. One section had me chase an enemy up a set of elevators, back down, and then back up again, requiring a floor change at each of about six floors on the first two of those runs. I was not amused.Other than the above, quite an enjoyable game. But if the come out with a sequel, I will not be buying it, given the amount of cheap time-lengthening and unbalanced gameplay of this game. That, and the story of ""Rocketbirds: Hardboilded Chicken"" (what there is of it) would hardly support two or more games.I doubt I'll play this game again, because there's no way I'm putting up with that nonsense again.Oh, and if you get stuck on how to proceed, like I did numerous times (minor SPOILERS), the answer is ALWAYS one of: run past it, use one or more crates, or control an enemy through brain bugs. Don't expect the puzzles to be deep, or you'll just end up confused.			"

Some of the cutscenes revolving around the music are great too.  With that said, the shooting is simplistic, the platforming is a bit clunky.  I still enjoy the game though.  It is much darker than I was expecting, i thought a game called rocketbirds would be silly, but its actually a pretty dark storyline about an opressive regime.  The voice acting is absolutely terrible.  Worst part of this game.  If they left that out entirely it would be a far better game.			"

												It's a very well-polished title with beautiful visuals and damn, an awesome soundtrack! I finished the game in one go, because (of the music!) of the gameplay that effectively alternates the different sequences : - kill nazis penguins with AK47- get your jetpack (hell yeah!) and outperform your ennemis in flight batlles- control your ennemies'mind to resolve some classical but nice platform sequencesetc.Didn't try co-op mode yet but intend to. Kill penguiins alone is cool, but I suppose it's better with a friend...--Super jeu très bien polish avec de très sympatiques scènes animatiques, et fichtre, une BO aux petits oignons !J'ai fini le jeu d'une traite, grâce, encore une fois à une super BO qui met dans l'ambiance parfaite, et à l'enchainement très habile des différents types de gameplays :- buter des pengouins nazis avec différentes armes- séquence jetpack, où on doit se montrer plus habile que ses ennemis en combat aérien- platformer 2D, avec contrôle des ennemisJ'ai bien envie de recommencer une partie pour tenter le mode co-op, qui ne doit pouvoir qu'amener que du bon !

												Y'know what this is? Stupid fun. The guys at Ratloop Asia have made an amazingly fun atmospheric run-'n-gunner where the premise is meant to be stupid. I mean, come on. A chicken taking on an almost Stalin-esqe regime? At first that may seem to be social commentary, but  fact, most of the cutscenes are just watered-down cliches from various war films. The story is ONLY there to give reason to your extermination of the penguin general population. And what an extermination it is. The gameplay, despite a few issues (Why can't the mouse be used to AIM my weapon?) is solid, and it's great fun slaughtering large numbers of fowl. It doesn't look half bad, either. The art is phenomenal, and the psuedo-3D levels, backgrounds and characters are well designed, having an almost comic-book feel. Finally, the coop is amazingly fun, despite having to load every other level and have Hardboiled stare you down for about forty seconds while it loads. In the end, though.. the game's upsides shine through the bugs.    A final word:              The only good kind of penguin is a dead penguin.8.5/10			"

												This game is just dull.Beyond the entertainment of ""LOL FUNNEH CHICKENZ AND PENGUINZ WIF GUNSSSS"" the combat is restricted and reptitive (can only shoot in two directions, standing or crouching. Fighting multiple enemies is all about making sure you keep juggling with bullets before anyone can stand up) the movement is clunky (running has the slowest wind up ever. Jumping is painfully stiff) and to top it all off the ""extra objectives"" require you to backtrack from the middle to end of the level all the way back to the start, and may even require you to restart the level from way back since you had to keep a specific enemy alive in order to reach a marker (there is zero indication of which enemy you aren't supposed to kill until it's too late).Also the soundtrack blows.

												Amazing music and satisfying enough gunplay. Could have had more levels where you actually fly, and the puzzles where just alright but kind of frustrating at some levels. It's also kind of fun hearing the penguins talk by themself.Co-op is alright, but it's annoying in a lot of cases: There are absolutely no rocketflying bits in co-op, and some really nice feautures are better in co-op but just wasn't even in singleplayer. Why aren't there as many enemies in singleplayer? The first five levels or so are just plain boring...Overall I recommend this game if you're into the music and epic scenes with birds being slaughtered. If you have a friend who's also interested I recommend it even more.			"

												I played this game on hard-mode, took me about 3 game hours to finish it(atleast steam says that). It was quite fun though a bit short. It has some basic riddles but which are solved easily. The combat system is intresting and specially the lack of ammo (atleast in hard-mode) is making it quite intresting. There are some parts where you have to have some good timing or else you wont make it ... this can be quite frustrating for some people ;)The graphics looks nice and the soundtrack of the game is really good.I would recommend you to buy this game for 5$/€ or less because of the short storyline.

The game is extremely linear, and the rare puzzles are tedious, but unchallenging.The voice acting and dialogue is absolutely terrible, but I'm unsure if it's volontary or not. As for the aerial dogfights, they get repetitive very fast, though they are probably the best part of the game.Haven't had the opportunity to try co-op yet, but I don't think it will hold a lot of content.Finished in about 2 and half hour, do not buy for more than 2 bucks.

												While I may not have played much of this game, I feel like what I have played is enough to judge it. This is a PC port of a Vita game. The controls are pretty bad. In about 2/3rds of the game, you don't even aim. You just fire straight forward. The only decent parts of the game are the jetpack sequences, which aren't that great either. I'd give this a solid 4/10. Bad gameplay, bad animations, a story that spends all of it time trying too hard to be funny. I'm pretty sre you can play the flash version for free online anyway.			"

												An impressive game with frustrating controls.  The hours I spent playing this game were sprinkled with a little frustration, particularly the jetpacktion ones.  But all in all, the rest of the game was just superb.  The overall look, art direction, all of that just clicks.  Some of the voice acting and bird talking was a little jarring, but I think that might of been intentional.  The soundtrack was well executed and pretty good.  The general action felt just right, lightly frustrating, but easy to execute.  The gun action was simple, but was challenging at times.   I can see this rubbing some gamers wrong, particularly the younger ones who aren't used to sidescrolling action games, but all in all I felt this was a great game, and I'm hoping the sequel makes it's way to steam quickly once it's released on Sony's platforms.

												TL;DR: Skip this, buy BroForce instead, it's better, faster, more fun, and sillier. I would actively not reccomend this game for a multitude of reasons. Some of which is the fact that the game is just no fun at all. I dread opening the game and starting it up. I totally get what this game is trying to do, and that's awesome, but this game doesn't do it well. The controls just feel loose and wonky, certain parts of the game aren't as well thought out as they should be (namely the jetpack sequence), and the game presents no real challenge apart from frustratingly dealing with the game itself. For instance, when killing enemies, just crouch and hold the fire button until they die, because once you shoot an enemy for the first time, they get juggled and cannot break from it, giving the game no challenge. I will say, the music is alright, if totally repetative. If you want a sidescrolling game that is a parody/love letter to action films of the 80s, just invest in BroForce.			"

It sometimes gets only a bit frustrating, however, when I accomplish the challenge it sure is rewarding. I'll definitley say it's a hidden gem. Not a single game in my library has Korean support, but this one does and it very well. I've no idea how they trasnlated it, but it's not a broken translation from google translator or something, texts make sense and is very well optimized for different situations in Korean language.

												This game is very frustrating to play. It's a 2.5D game, meaning they use fake 3D graphics on a 2D plane. This makes it hard to judge what is and isn't a platform or wall. It's almost like you are playing blind. The gun gameplay is really lame. There are only two planes that the guns fire: Standing up or ducking. If the enemy ducks and shoots, you are screwed 90% of the time. You cannot see the bullets at all, making shooting even more frustrating. There is no way to avoid bullets if the enemy is ducking while shooting.  You can only do one thing at a time in this game. You can either move, jump, or shoot. No combinations. On top of this broken gameplay, the game is really boring and has poor sound design. Each time you scroll the screen, the music starts over, or there is no music at all and you are just trying to walk around in silence. The game is so unnatural and unintuitive. I can't say enough bad things about it.			"

												What a weird game.Nice visuals, unique atmosphere, but the game is boring in itself. The fights against enemies require very little skills. The game is extremely linear, and the rare puzzles are tedious, but unchallenging.The voice acting and dialogue is absolutely terrible, but I'm unsure if it's volontary or not. As for the aerial dogfights, they get repetitive very fast, though they are probably the best part of the game.Haven't had the opportunity to try co-op yet, but I don't think it will hold a lot of content.Finished in about 2 and half hour, do not buy for more than 2 bucks.

												While I may not have played much of this game, I feel like what I have played is enough to judge it. This is a PC port of a Vita game. The controls are pretty bad. In about 2/3rds of the game, you don't even aim. You just fire straight forward. The only decent parts of the game are the jetpack sequences, which aren't that great either. I'd give this a solid 4/10. Bad gameplay, bad animations, a story that spends all of it time trying too hard to be funny. I'm pretty sre you can play the flash version for free online anyway.			"

												Really great little game, good looking and nice mechanics. You run and gun against varying enemies, unlocking more weapons as you go, including grenades and brain control bugs. The game also has a puzzle element involving controlling the enemies to unlock and activate to clear your way forward, as well as moving boxes to get to higher ledges etc. You get the point. My one nitpick was the final boss. The design of the boss level was not like the rest of the game and I can't say I enjoyed it. I ended up running constantly, putting a few bullets in him, then running again, which made for a fairly long slog with no checkpoints. It was a shame to end the game on that point and then making it feel like it outstayed it's welcome. Maybe there was an easier way to do it, and this certainly isn't the only game that falls into the 'final boss' trap, it seems to be a developer disease....			"

												Birds. Guns. Two great tastes that taste great together! Especially considering this game costs about as much as a large pizza or half a movie ticket. Rocketbirds is a very entertaining little adventure that has you as...well, a chicken (a really badass one) aiming to liberate the world of the evil penguin regime. Damn penguins...The controls take a bit of getting used to, but it throws in various aspects in gaming in well together. There's violence, puzzles, and most important... JETPACTION! Yeah, you get to fly around in a jetpack, which is probably the best part of the game cause you get to blow things up in a jetpack. I mean what else could you want in life? Seriously.The difficulty is mostly balanced as well, though you definitely need to be quick on that trigger finger when you got baddies on both sides, thankfully the game is pretty generous with health and ammo in tough situations, including the jetpack sequences. Did I mention how awesome those are? You're a chicken flying around in a jetpack with a machine gun shooting at penguins flying around on jetpacks with machine guns! Just...picture that in your head. Now imagine that being a million times more awesome than that could possibly sound.Um...what else...oh yeah! The cutscenes are pretty rad too. Nothing that will question everything you ever stood for in life or cry tears for hours, but they help set the tone, the tone being ""Duke Nuke if he was a chicken but with twice the asskickery"". The music is also sweet. It's indie, but it's not ""in-your-face"" indie. It's just...y'know music that goes well with the game!No more spoilers from me, though. If you want a fun way to kill a lonely Saturday night or just love birds flying around unconventionally while wielding weaponry, then drop a Hamilton on this game and just see for yourself!			"

												This is one of those games that i've kept in my library for a long long time. Shame that I didn't played it earlier because this is a really good game.Don't expect too much about the gameplay. This a simple shooter, with a jump and crouch system, like a old 2D shooter.The storyline, and some dialogues are funny, but they could be way better, especially the annoying voices when some NPC is talking to you.The things to notice in this game are the amazing graphics and artwork in it, and the great soundtrack, from New World Revolution (really good and it fits perfectly in the game).The game is short, about 3/4 hours to complete, but you can coop locally and online, with others characters, which is a good thing and extends the gameplay.I hope that the new sequel, RocketBirds Evolution gets here on steam really soon, cause I want more of this.

Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is a run-and-gun platformer with Naz- I mean penguins and other birds. The Gist of the Game:The game itself is fairly short, running around 3-4 hours without much exploring for achievements. You play as Hardboiled Chicken, a chicken hell-bent on defeating the penguin regime. Throughout the game, you uncover the secrets of the regime and the life of Hardboiled Chicken. After Hardboiled Chicken is imprisoned by the regime, it's your job to team up with the revolutionaries and defeat the regime.Gameplay:The game progresses by using levels. The 15 levels in the game are puzzle-based, which works well for most of the game. However, on later levels, backtracing your steps to solve puzzles becomes tedious. Although, it feels good to finally complete a puzzle you struggle with. Throughout the levels, you pick up various guns to take out enemies with. As the game progresses, you get a good feel for what guns works best in situations you are given. There three ""jetpack levels"" where you use your infamous jetpack to fly through the air and defeat penguins in order to access zeppelins that belong to the regime. These levels are enjoyable and are a nice break from platforming when you need one. The levels are all linear for the most part, as you may have guessed. When it's all said and done, there's not much replay value except going for achievements; yet that is expected. It's a lighthearted and fun platformer that is easy to pick up and play.Overall, I'd give the gameplay a 7.5/10Graphics:The graphics in the game are somewhat simple yet pleasing to the eyes. The artwork is enjoyable throughout the game. It helps with the immersion of the game, if you call it that. Each background throughout each level contains little details that are very satisfying. In the settings, you are able to set the game in 3D, which is cool if thats your type of thing. This plays a part with the 3D design of the levels. As you play through levels, walls and holes are able to be seen as the screen slightly rotates. It is hard to explain, but as you walk, you are able to see another side to a building, ledge, or even tree. The graphics are simple but nailed right on the spot if it's something you prefer.Overall, I'd give the graphics a 9.5/10Controls:The controls feel clunky at times. When hopping from ledge to ledge, it can begin to be frustrating trying to grab hold of one. When pushing boxes, controls don't feel as smooth as they should be. The controls aren't too bad, yet they can be infuriating at times. During jetpack levels, controls feel smooth and great. However, during combat while platforming, the game falls a little short. Switching between weapons is easy, yet taking cover, crouching, and rolling are cumbersome to sum up. I personally played with an Xbox 360 controller. I would imagine that playing with a keyboard would be more frustrating. The controls don't make the game unplayable, but they hinder gameplay at times.Overall, I'd give the controls a 7/10Story & CharactersThe story of this game isn't a deep one, yet it is a good one. Hardboiled Chicken wants his revenge on the penguin regime. He attempts to infiltrate their headquarters, but it caught and thrown in prison. He meets another bird who is part of a group of revolutionaries. Together, you and the revolutionaries progress to finally overthrow the penguin regime. The characters are insanely loveable for some odd reason. I can't get enough of the different penguins, chickens, and other birds throughout the game. Their dialogues can be funny and even cheesey, yet I can't get enough. For a lighter platformer, the story and characters in this game are amazing. The story could be a tad deeper if the game was longer. However, for its length, the story felt just right. I would love to see more Rocketbirds characters put to use! They're just chockful of character. and likeability.Overall, I'd give the story a 9 I'd give the characters a 10Price:I got the game in a bundle, so paying $2.99 for this and several other games was a steal. The game's regular pricetag of $9.99 seems a bit too lofty in my opinion. The game just falls too short for that pricetag. I would recommend picking it up during a Steam Sale. So all-in-all, Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is a fun little platformed that you either absolutely love, hate, or have a love-hate relationship with. Overall, I'd give the game itself an 8/10. I would absolutely love to see more Rocketbirds games with more characters, longer playtime, and more of a story! Please note that I havn't played the co-op mode at all. I would love too though. If anybody wants to play co-op just add me and we can play.			"

												This game is badly broken and unfinished. It goes from being incredibly easy and sparse to frustrating and unclear where you should go. Controller support for co-op is broken and won't work at all, textures are left unfinished leaving ugly black blocks all over. Even if the game did work, the voice acting and dialogue is super amateur and the mechanics they do have are pretty much totally unnecessary. It doesn't even side 'scroll,' you just walk off screen to the left or right and it loads that panel, more often than not you'll pass enemies as you load the next panel and they'll roll back into your panel after a minute and shoot you in the back. I've tried playing a few times and it's just never fun.			"

												Recommended, but only slightly.  To me, this was an ""ok"" platformer.  The best aspects of the game is that it is nice and kinda campy with good graphics, and a good sense of humor such as the over-the-top Rambo-style chicken vs the Russian-esque penguin army, or the stroking of his guns before he picks them up when he finds them.  On the downsides, it gets old kinda quickly as there's not a real variety to the game, no intro to the story at all -- (it's later kinda told in flashback during the game), and the ended kinda as abrutly as it started.Overall it's decent, but not great.  7 out of 10.   I completed the campaign in 3.4 hrs.			"

												Rocketbirds is a weird little game with a weird story, weird characters, weirder voice acting, and an inappropriately great soundtrack that makes the whole thing seem better than it really is.  Not that it's bad.  But it IS simple*.  And quite short.  TOO short.At first, Hardboiled's (that's the character's name) animations seem choppy, which makes movement seem choppy, which it actually isn't.  It's weird.  Hard to explain.  And then there are the jetpack levels, which are buttery smooth.  Both are fun in their own way, but the jetpack aspect of R:HC in particular bears the distinct mark of unrealized potential.  Now that I think about it, the potential fun of the grenade and mind-control elements weren't exploited nearly as much as they should have been, either.  While these ARE essentially criticisms, they also suggest that any expansion packs or sequels could be fairly great.And I never thought I'd say this, but one missing feature I'd like to have seen is the option to turn off the blood and gore.  There's a younger age group the art style and relatively simple platform-type gameplay would appeal to, were it not for the more adult violence.  Honestly, as silly as the game is, the blood almost feels out of place anyway.Is Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken worth $10?  For me, no.  Would it have been worth $3?  Sure.  Why not.  On payday.*Simple, except for the signs.  Tagging each of the three hidden signs in each level can be quite a chore, if not also mind-bendingly difficult.  Hope you enjoy re-backtracking through emptied stages.  BUT collect them all and you'll unlock... a meaningless achievement.  Meh.			"

												Completed in 5 hours. Not a bad game. Actually, I'd recommend it as a good action platformer (with some unfortunate puzzle elements). However: the areas with waves of enemies in a locked room are broken, with enemies being ""human"" (penguin) shields to your bullets but not to each others. I kept getting killed by enemies that were behind other enemies who could shoot past their allies but I was instead shooting the dead, juggled bodies of their allies instead of them. Also, the jetpack sections are a mess, with a huge zoom-out effect and screen scroll every time new flying enemies appear, making it harder to see the ammo or health pickup you were aiming for or the rocket that is still chasing you (fired from a previous enemy) that you're still expected to avoid, even if both you and the rocket are off screen. Both the waves of enemies and the jetpack sections checkpoint frequently, so they become a battle of attrition rather than skill. These two sections are also where the game showcases its' soundtrack. Short sections of uninspired music looping endlessly. On first hearing at the title screen, it got me in the mood for an action game. But repetitively looped in frustrating, cheaply designed action sequences (the waves and the jetpack), both these sections and the one to two verse or chorus songs had both gameplay and music making each other worse. There are also some ridiculous puzzle sections involving playing around with box stacking and elevators that do nothing but artificially lengthen the game. One section had me chase an enemy up a set of elevators, back down, and then back up again, requiring a floor change at each of about six floors on the first two of those runs. I was not amused.Other than the above, quite an enjoyable game. But if the come out with a sequel, I will not be buying it, given the amount of cheap time-lengthening and unbalanced gameplay of this game. That, and the story of ""Rocketbirds: Hardboilded Chicken"" (what there is of it) would hardly support two or more games.I doubt I'll play this game again, because there's no way I'm putting up with that nonsense again.Oh, and if you get stuck on how to proceed, like I did numerous times (minor SPOILERS), the answer is ALWAYS one of: run past it, use one or more crates, or control an enemy through brain bugs. Don't expect the puzzles to be deep, or you'll just end up confused.			"

												Really great little game, good looking and nice mechanics. You run and gun against varying enemies, unlocking more weapons as you go, including grenades and brain control bugs. The game also has a puzzle element involving controlling the enemies to unlock and activate to clear your way forward, as well as moving boxes to get to higher ledges etc. You get the point. My one nitpick was the final boss. The design of the boss level was not like the rest of the game and I can't say I enjoyed it. I ended up running constantly, putting a few bullets in him, then running again, which made for a fairly long slog with no checkpoints. It was a shame to end the game on that point and then making it feel like it outstayed it's welcome. Maybe there was an easier way to do it, and this certainly isn't the only game that falls into the 'final boss' trap, it seems to be a developer disease....			"

												Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken (just RB from now on) is a platformer with some puzzle elements with occasional ""jetpack"" action... or as the game put it, jetpaction, where you engage enemies in 2D. You, the nameless chicken, was captured by the penguin regime when small and brainwashed into being the ultimate commando, but on a mission, you were shock by the atrocity, and saw a younger version of yourself and reverted back to being on the chicken side. However, you are alone, and aside from a few resistance members, there is no help. But it doesn't matter... You will destroy Putzki, head of the Penguin regime, and end their reign of terror... or die trying (well, there's always reload from checkpoint). The game is basically a platformer shooter where you need to jump, crouch, and otherwise shoot, ambush, and kill your way through the penguin army in your quest. As you continue, you gain additional weapons. You start with a trusty pistol, but you will soon upgrade to SMG, shotgun, and later, assault rifle, and you also gain the use of grenades and ""brainbugs"" that can remote control a penguin if you can get it close enough and have the penguin kill penguins for you, at least for a little while. The puzzles are bascially trying to get the keycards to advance to a different part of the map, and that obviously requires some backtracking, and crate stacking, and so on to allow you to access ledges that were not otherwise accessible. There are ""timed sections"" where you fight your way through a penguin zepplin to the escape hatch, and that can get REALLY hairy! The rocket fights are rather cute, as you basically control this rocket pack, which only has on, or off. You can control the direction, and if you turn rocket off, you go on inertia until gravity takes over. This can let you shake pursuers and shoot them full of lead as they fly by (i.e. the Maverick maneuver from Top Gun) . Penguins also have helicopter rocketeers who shoots guided rockets at you but if you fly carefully you can guide the rocket to hit an enemy instead before they self-destruct due to lack of fuel. Once you got everybody, you either land on the zepplin and fight through it, or you make your way back to the ground for more penguin destruction. The game slowly introduces tougher enemies and the pacing is about just right. Long cutscenes between some levels setup the stage and shows the back history of the world and how it got to the present day. It is quite a bit of fun, and there's even a coop mode (which I didn't try). My only gripe is the timed sections being a bit too hard, even on normal. IMHO, of course. May not be worth full price, but it's definitely worth trying if you like some action every once in a while.			"

												If I had to describe this game in 1 word, it would be mediocre. It controls wells, and has some interesting concepts, but it fails to be phenomenal.Rocketbirds is a 2D platform shooter, with some other elements mixed in. The main combat of the game is not very satisfying, as the most difficult encounters just generally devolve into you quickly altnerating between shooting behind and ahead of you. The different guns really aren't all that interesting either. They just do more damage at the cost of more ammo, which is so plentiful that it's hardly a concern.The most redeeming quality of this game is the mind control bugs, which allow you to control the actions of guards. This makes for some interesting puzzles, but they're ultimately pretty shallow. There are other segments as well, like flying, but ultimately, it doesn't do it as well as other games.The story is passable, but nothing super interesting. Music is nice, but nothing Jaw dropping. This game just completely fails to excite. There are better games for $10.			"

												Rocketbirds is a beautiful looking game with stellar art and a kickass soundtrack, but it's gameplay doesn't hold up.PROS:+Beautiful graphics as if it's like an interactive cartoon+Awesome soundtrack to kill to+Pretty funny concept to base a game around+Pretty entertaining cutscenes+Mix of stealth and MetroidvaniaCONS:-Horrible voice acting during cutscenes, it's just soulless and dreadful-Collecting card keys is a huge chore-Clunky controls, it's hard to get down from ledges without Hardbroiled automatically grabbing back on the ledge, automatically rolling around instead of running while shooting and the jetpack is beyond frustrating to control-A.I. is dumber than a headless chicken trying to solve the answer to the universe, making some puzzles pretty frustrating-Boring cliched story involving a resistance group against a dictatorship. It's been done to death already-Despite funny concept, the jokes are not really that funny. Mostly toilet humor and bad bird puns.-Way too shortOverall, Rocketbirds had great potential to be a fun game to play with it's gorgeous art and music, but the gameplay just falls flat. Some people might get a kick out of it, but it's not for everyone. Get it during a sale if you want to try it.			"

												Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is a side-scrolling action game starring a former-experiment turned chicken mercenary (Hardboiled) on a quest for vengeance against the evil penguin empire. The art style is very cartoony but yields a sadistic undertone through various bloody cinematics and player actions. Gameplay in Rocketbirds is vaguely reminiscent of the Oddworld series with encounters that resemble that of Another World. By which I mean: movement and aiming is a bit jerky and awkward and the game will often put you in a situation where enemies will be coming at you from both sides of the screen. In some instances these two factors can result in some very infuriating battles, but since the checkpoint system is so generous, you’ll probably make it through after a few tries. Another neat thing the game gives you is the ability to mind control enemies with a throwable grenade-like device enabling you to use them to solve puzzles and remove enemies before having them remove themselves with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.True to the name, a good part of the game will be spent flying around with a rocket strapped to your back. These sequences are generally marathon sessions of spawn, kill, spawn, and kill again, but manage to still be fun as the controls are pretty good and you can do neat tricks like leading enemy missiles back towards them through clever maneuvering.If I had to pick a downside with this game it would be the extremely short length coupled with the really bad voice acting (the latter was probably done on purpose). Though for the frequent sale price of around $2, it’s hard to complain!  "

Solid art design, but with lackluster voice acting, what seemed like a 30 second music loop (great music, but gets old fast like this), unpolished game mechanics, and novice level design had me exclaiming aloud how much of a disappointment it was. I wanted to finish the first chapter, but just couldn't.Barely gets a 4/10 only because of enjoyable music and art design, but that alone is not able to carry this gameJust sonic roll for days shooting at meat sponges that leave no impact of hype feelings upon killing said enemy. There's not even an animation for your character when pushing things, a button in the controls that is purely for that, so you think they would implement some character interaction with a core gameplay mechanic that lets you progress in the level. He just runs awkwardly into it, and you can't pull, only push. No immersion, and lacks any spirit. Just a solid mehh			"

												I'd never heard of Hardboiled Chicken when I received it in a recent Humble Bundle and, if I'm honest, I was not expecting much from it.I noticed that it did, however, have stereoscopic 3D support, so I gave it a try.The game is humurous, well polished, challenging from time to time and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a little short, but there is a co-op mode that offers some replayability. Unfortunately it does have some rather lackluster controls that feel clumsy and stiff occasionally, but nothing that ruins the fun. The gameplay alone is not what makes it special though, that is down to the stereoscopic 3D. It suits the 2D cartoon graphics amazingly well, making it feel like you're right inside a disturbing, childrens pop-up book. Even the grey-green hue the 3D gives, feels so right, creating a bizzare, Soviet-esque vibe that gels with the story about oppressed chickens, under penguin dictatorship, perfectly.I highly recommend busting out some old-school 3D glasses and picking up Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken as it's one of the coolest looking games I've played in a long time.

												Not actually that good. Even if this goes on sale, it's not really all that fun. The basic run and gun that makes up a majority of this game isn't done in a way that makes it interesting to play, and the motions and pacing are a chore to get through. There are some ""puzzles"" that mostly entail a lot of backtracking, and aren't very clever in their implementation. Most of the actions you can perform end up feeling rather stilted, making it feel clunky to control. And finally, the writing is very poor, without much heart or wit. Finally, the main boss ends up not having any music, making for a fight with no redeeming qualities.			"

												By no means is this a bad game. I played the Co-op only, and we enjoyed it but it wasn't anything special. I can really only talk about the co-op because that's what I played. Anyway, some of the controls are really awkward, and it's sometimes difficult to work with your partner on some tasks (like making sure both of you are faced in the right direction). But the puzzles where fairly inspired, and the game pacing was right. Combat feels really awkward at first but it's alright after a while.The music in this game was actually really really cool. Like, I'm kinda curious who did it so I can maybe look them up. The Overall art direction is also very pleasant, actually. The game also has a ""3d option"", which is very curious but I'm sure it actually works with the enviroments (2.5D). The animation segments are also pleasing, and look like something you would find on Adult Swim, perhaps.I just have no interest in playing single player. In a word, just play Shank instead, a game that's actually something to write home about.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game, but I don't think i'd recomend it for one main reason. The controls. You can't aim up and down with your gun, but enemies can see you if they're above/below you. Also, I personally am not a fan of the art style used - it's just not my thing. And finally, you can't skip cutscenes.But, at the same time it has an interesting storyline that depicts how war changes people (or, in this case, Chickens).What I find interesting is that penguins were chosens as the bad guys, which is a nice change from the norm - in a way it teaches us that 'the bad guy' and 'good guy' roles are relative to who is telling the story.Unfortunaltly, I am so not a fan of the controls that I couldn't recommend this game.

												If you enjoy platformers Rocketbirds is a definitely one of the games you should try. It has a good balance of blasting guns, sneaking around and flying sections with jetpack so you don't get bored repeating the same thing over and over. It also has a good amount of puzzle solving. The puzzle sections are not too hard, but just right to get your brains tinkering a bit. There was never a puzzle that got me stuck, which is very uncommon and I have to salute the makers of this game for the good job.Just like all the good old games, this game has a cheesy storyline to follow(in a good way) except this is a ""real"" storyline that actually makes sense unlike the old platformers.Controls are simple and easy to use and there's no special tricks trying to control your character which makes it easy to just start playing. The Game worked flawlessy with linux as well. The only annoying thing was that switching the weapons with a mouse wheel was sometimes a bit of a pain, especially in tight situations where you are surrounded. But this of course is also related to what kind of mouse you are using.Overall if you find the trailer funny at all and like platformers, this is definitely worth your time.			"

												A good game.  Not great, but fun.I played the network co-op with someone in the same room.  There were sometimes issues with controls cooperating, but we didn't experience any major issues.The game (at least the co-op part of it) is pretty short.  Maybe 2 hours tops.  I recommend getting it when it's on sale for $1.50 or something around there.  I wouldn't buy it at full price.  Or find it in a bundle, if you can.			"

												This game wasn't off to a good start in the opening cinematic, where there was 10 seconds of two unknown characters talking to each other. Except we couldn't hear a word either of them was saying, because the designers decided that playing their ""badass"" rock soundtrack over the image of two characters talking was more important than any actual context or storyline.I mean, it's not like a game needs a story to be good. But if you're going to waste my time with two characters talking, at LEAST have them say something. Is this hard to understand? I don't think this would be hard to understand.That's what I thought, anyway, until the second cinamatic, where characters DID communicate. They managed to say exactly nothing about anything, except that they're going to try to kill me. I don't really know why. I guess I was infiltrating their base?Honestly, maybe they explained this in the first cinamatic. I skipped it because I didn't feel like watching two people talking without dialogue.As far as the gameplay goes, you move forward and you shoot guys. Note I didn't say you have to aim, because you don't. And you don't have to move strategically -- forward is the only direction you have to move.It takes like 10 bullets to kill an enemy. This is probably because the game would be way too short if it took one bullet to kill an enemy.  I couldn't say for sure, though, because in the 8 minutes I actually decided to play this game, I couldn't think of a single reason to keep going. Maybe it gets good at some point. I figured my time was too valuable to waste time finding out.			"
