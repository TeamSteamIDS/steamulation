												Updated: Achievements are now working as I am told.Can't really recommend this game even at it's discounted price.Don't get me wrong it's a relatively fun game. But it's way too short (beat it in roughly an hour) some sections of the game the frame rate drops and is horribly annoying.Like I said, it's not a bad game at all, but to me it's overpriced for how short the overall game is.

												I didn´t expect much going into this game. Another platformer in my library, but i wanted to give this game at least fair chance to show up.And oh boy, it delivers.I really get hooked from first moment. Not by gameplay mechanics, cute visuals, or perfectly fitted music.Writings on the walls really sucked me in. I wanted to know more about what is going on, who is this spoiled bats**t crazy little princess, what my convicted felon character did and how to to get out. It was pleasant, fairly challenging also really hard journey at some stages (my lack of patience really didn't help tho). I can't recommend this more. If you want to spend couple hours tilting and having fun, Freedom Fall will do the service. Grade: A- "

												Here is another game i found myself enjoying and yet got to the end and thought ""IS THAT IT"".The game itself is great,good graphics (cartoon anyone),good music and addictive gameplay and then when you realise all this its over.Its a great free running game (you start at the top of a tower imprisoned and must get to the bottom) and you also gain new gear as you play (esential on some later levels-but there is an acheivement you can get for not getting any gear so it must be possible to get to the bottom without using any).A lot of levels are just making your way down and are quite easy and then comes some of the levels where you actually have to think about how to progress (avoid this trap and avoid that gust of wind) but its not really that hard or that challenging (will say though that some acheivements wont be easy to get).So why reccomend it then,well its still a great game and worth your time but i would pick it up in a sale or wait for it to be bundled (will happen at some point),as its over far to quick and i did feel a little short changed.

												A very charming platforming game with traps laid out for you as you fall down the tower to reach the goalYou play as a boy who is jailed on top of a tower, why you are falling and who laid the traps of the tower for you? The answer you shall find as you thwart the perilous tower.+charming story+like the art, a bit flash style+the price is reasonable+like the way you can pick choices of hard or easy depending on where you want to fall+challenge the leaderboards+the music is nice+-its a casual game, so once you beat it-Could expand on the powerups and concept as you fall maybe adding more gameplay and powerups for the next gamewas only 3 in the game really.-Hoping a 3d version in the future and continuation of the story-lacks a real multiplayer competitive mode of any sort.-Short game			"

												One of best platform games I ever played. I would rate it with score 10 (5 stars). Physics is very quality made and whole game has good and sweet story and enjoyable levels. I really recommend it to all platform fans, because this game has zero bugs and it's kinda challenging for achievements. If you want get all achievements you would need replay game 4-5 times, but trust me, in this sweet game that is not big deal. Anyway, this game has all recommendations from me...			"

												Freedom Fall is a platformer game, in which you play with Marsh, a young boy who finds himself in the top rooms of a huge tower, in prison, but with the door opened - so he steps outside, and after getting through room after room he will finally escape.Originally I wanted to write this section to the end as kind of a reward because I LOVED this aspect of the game, but as a recommendation, it serves it's purpose better at the start: The game is a platformer with slight combat elements, and IT HAS A LEGIT, GOOD STORY. It sounds weird, but it's true. I don't want to spoiler too muc h - the princess who's taken you captive will communicate with you using paintings on the tower's wall - she tells about her life, family, best friend, while mocking you for being a prisoner who probably dies soon, has no friends (so she draws you a cockroach to have at least one pet :) ) - the princess actually has a great character - mix a naive, childish personality with the role of a princess - she kills the to-be-husbands she doesn't like without mercy, even joking about their attempts to escape the tower - while also writing things like she's having tea parties with her best friend (who happens to be a DRAGON).  And you're not invited.  Hmpf.   The game also features a checkpoint system, and this was a huge surprise - the game's story includes the checkpoints, the way you respawn at checkpoints are included in the game's narrative. The game's platforming is really fair and nicely done, but the story, and the way the game tells the backstory to the player is the most outstanding point of the game. If you're intrested in it and don't mind slight cute spoilers, check out the screenshots at the community hub, people created tons of screenies from the best paintings :)  The game consists 14 + 1 bonus levels, and plays like older platformer games - you collect bolts instead of coins, which can be used to buy a granades (can destroy some traps/objects to help progress )parachute, dragon wings to allow double jump and a hoverboard that's more like hoverboards should look like.  There are no enemies in the game besides two bossfights, but each and every level is filled to the brim with traps. Swinging axes, rotating spears, spikes, bladed wheels, bouncing huge explosive balls, mechanical venus fly traps, spiked chains and lightning. While this sounds overwhelming, the game really often divides the tower into an easy, and a hard side, so if you're not really up for a challenge or just want to finish the level in the fastest way, you can always choose the easy path every time. To balance things out, choosing the hard path will reward you more collectible bolts and ocassionally granades, if you want to collect the most possible bolts, choosing hard paths is kind of mandatory.  Speaking about shortest time and collectible bolts -The game is quite short, it can be completed under 2-3 hours for the first time.But each and every level has a par value for shortest time, less deaths and most collected bolts. While all three can be done theoretically at the same time, it requires a lot of practice - but as it can be done one by one, it makes the challenge (and getting the perfect game achievement)  easier to get, while providing some extra gameplay time with distinctive goals. The game also has an achievement for finishing the story without dying - this is a little hasslework as you need to restart the actual level after dying (the game could use a hardcore mode which automatically restarts for you), this also requires a separate run. Every game can be speedrun in less than 3-3.5 minutes - considering one plays the game for fun, then for no death / collecting bolts / speedrunning (these can be done in level selection mode) - and the fact that there's three achievements which require three different ending of the story, the gameplay time can easily stretch into 5-10 hours for achievement hunters.Personally I really enjoyed the game - I usually have low expectations, so I thought it will be an arcade-ish platformer with questionable platforming and randomgeneration, but instead got a solid platformer with great level design, easy and harder paths, a charming story and a really unique way to get to know that story - it may not be the greatest platformer of all times, but it's a really solid one, and I'm glad I picked this up in a bundle and played it.Price-wise I would recommend it during a deeper sale (lowest price so far:5€) or from a bundle if you're not not into getting all achievements - while the story is good, 9€ is too much for a single gameplay's time and content. The multiple endings and collectible ""on par"" goals can create a lot more content and gameplay time for player who love collecting achievements - I can recommend getting it at full price only for them (or to users who wish to support the developer).

												Freedom Fall is a nice little platformer. It has some issues though. For me the length of the game was a little disappointing. You beat the campaign in max. 2 hours. After that there are some additional levels to play, but overall the content is fairly limited. I would expect just a little more. Especially if you consider the difficulty, which is definitely too low. It was not enough of a challenge, in my opinion. Even, if you always choose the hard route (there are many parts of the levels where you can choose between an easy and a hard section), you won't have any trouble completing the game. One more thing: there is not enough variety in the platforming. Gunman Clive's campaign can be completed in half the time, but has so much more to offer (gravity flipping, rocket rides...).On the pro side there is solid platforming (including items for double-jumping and gliding, and switching between them), nice story-telling (every few meters you can read surprisingly funny messages, the princess left there), and a nice twist to the typical platformer story cliche (you search for a princess, yes. But she is an evil, insane sadist). I really enjoyed the game, despite all the issues mentioned above.Overall Freedom Fall gets a thumbs up, but it could have been much better. I wouldn't recommend it for full price. The current 35% discount is not bad, but maybe it's better to grab a bundle key of the game.			"

												Indie down-scrolling platformer with a delightfully deviant sense of humor. Worth it just for the princess' dark wit.The game is fairly short and suits casual players (normal difficulty) and more experienced gamers (hard mode) especially if you try for the Freerunner achievement without buying the glider, wings or hoverboard.There is some replayability with more than one ending, a Par for each level in number of deaths, time taken, and currency collected, and the Steam achievements. It's also fun to play through it again just to re-read the princess' messages; you might find a couple that you overlooked the first time.You should expect to die a lot at first, but this is part of the fun. ""Make them like this"" will be your motto.			"

Thanks to the lovely hand painted art, delightful soundtrack and the original storytelling - it felt quite charming and entertaining despite of its lack of challenge. The two provided gadgets for gliding and double-jumping, and the bombs as weapon are more than enough to offer you a enchanting adventure.Since Freedom Fall it's so short, the only thing that would make it partially worth its full price for me would be a level editor, otherwise i'm quite pleased to have it in my game collection.

												Excellent platformer.The writing on the wall has a very nice ""bratty princess"" vibe going, and it's kept me playing way past when I otherwise might have quit. Spikes aren't usually my thing, but the mechanics (including the way to mitigate falling by ""devices"" such as a parchute, wings that give you doublejump or a surfboard ) and the frequent placement of save points and the imaginative level design meant I wasn't frustrated or bored for more than 2 hours.Now if platforming was my thing, I'd try to get the levels perfect on ""hard"" or maybe do speedruns (there are leaderboards), but it's not; still, this alone would've been worth getting the ""down under bundle"" for. (I didn't even get to see the second ending or the undersea level yet.)Recommended for both the platforming and the writing.			"

												Freedom Fall is a platformer that will test your reflexes.Set in a beautiful steampunk world, the game rewards patience. It starts pretty easy, but the later levels are brutal. You'll die a lot, and you know what? You don't feel discouraged. The soundtrack is so relaxing that will keep you zen all the time. Also, the controls are very responsive, so you'll never be bothered by silly mistakes.All in all, I recommend this game for every platformer lover. You can finish the game with less than two hours, but if you are an achievement hunter, you'll have a lot of fun post-ending with hard but rewarding tasks.			"

												Freedom Fall is a short but extremely fun 2D action platformer where you play as Marsh, a prisoner in an enormously high tower. Your only chance to see the light of day again is to make your way down the tower while avoiding to die by the loads of flaming, spiking, buzzing and exploding traps and machineries, that the slightly crazy Princess has decorated the tower with.STORYThe story is presented in a pretty cool way: There aren't any actual dialogues that distract you from the actual gameplay but instead the Princess communicates with you through writings on the tower walls (she is mute, anyway :p). The press describes it as a ""reverse Rapunzel story"" because you actually have to get away from the Princess instead of saving her. While fitting, there's also an inarguable similarity to Portal - if GlaDOS would be a medieval Princess who likes dragons. The basic idea of the ""Escape-to-Freedom""-theme also reminded me a bit of the movie Running Man. HUMORThe game has an absolutely great sense of humour, which is both cute and cynical. It's subtle enough to not make you feel like you NEED to laugh or chuckle now - you just do because it's genuinely funny without trying to hard. Charming all the way through.VISUALSVisually, the game looks great and thankfully isn't another wannabe-retro 8-bit mess. All the art in the game is hand-drawn by concept artist Lisa Rye and has a colorful and vibrant feel to it. Especially Marsh and the Princess look absolutely awesome.GAMEPLAYAs a nice change from the typical sidescrolling platformers, the gameplay is all about getting to the bottom of the tower. To do so, you have to utilize gadgets like bombs, gliders, double jumps or hover boards, which you can unlock by purchasing them for cogs and bolts that you have to collect throughout the levels. Unfortunately, the levels don't really vary in terms of gadget utilization, so you can effectively beat the game with the glider gadget only without ever touching the double jump or hover board gadget. A missed opportunity. It's also sort of a precision platformer but due the relatively slow pace of the game (there aren't any visible timers or such that put you under pressure), it's not even remotely as stressful as, say, Super Meat Boy, so you can actually take your time and plan out the safest or most rewarding path downwards. There also are a few ""racing"" sections where you need to be fast, but they never get to the point where you feel like you need to be inhuman to beat them.Dying is part of the game (I did so 206 times during my playthrough), so you will definitely get squashed, smashed, sliced, spiked, burned, bombed and electrocuted a lot, but thanks to the frequently placed checkpoints, it's not much of an annoyance and instead actually motivates you to just be better on your next try.PLAYTIME & REPLAYABILITYWith roughly 2 hours for my first playthrough, the game definitely is rather short and can be beaten in one sitting if you wish to do so. However, the game features multiple endings and while I don't know how much the story varies after the split points, this definitely adds quite a bit to the replayability because it gets you intrigued as to how the story unfolds towards another ending.Additionally, if you're a fan of leaderboards, you can try to make it to the top by finishing levels under death/time or over cog par and unlock their respective achievements. A hard mode is also available, but I have yet to try it, so right now I can't really say what the difference between normal and hard is.CONCLUSIONI've gotten this game through a bundle and while it didn't look like a must-play-right-now type of game to me, I went on and actually tried it - and I'm absolutely glad I did. It's refreshing, fun and fairly casual, yet challenging enough to not get boring, but ultimately it's the humour and the writings and drawings that kept me going on until the end.At it's regular non-sale price (8,99€/£6.99/$9.99) some people might consider the game overpriced for what few content it has to offer, so those people are probably better off waiting for a sale or until the game pops up in another bundle, but if you're looking for ~2 hours of great humour and fun action platforming right now, Freedom Fall should be the game of your choice!

The plot is amusing (sort of like Portal if GladOS was a traditional RPG Princess and Chell had a hang glider, bombs and a ridiculous jump height instead of a portal gun), the soundtrack atmospheric and the ending is epic. It is too short, as a lot of reviewers have said, but I think the difficulty of the game and the replayability through the different challenges makes up for it. The only major flaws are that some of the achievements are still faulty and it won't run on computers that don't support DirectX 11.			"

												Freedom Fall is an awesome game. The characters (few) are very entertaining and amusing.I mean, who doesn't like a mute princess who is torturing you for no particular reason and draws on the walls? :)The story will likely grab you if you pay attention to it. It isn't required, but highly recommended you do pay attention.The game mechanics are interesting, and though you can beat the game easily in under 2 hours if you platform at all, there is a good amount of replayability for the achievements. I've really been enjoying this game and I wish it was longer, had more content so I could continue to keep loving it.The only negative I could possibly give it is that the price tag is a little high in my opinion. Personally I think if you could get it on sale for 40-50% off, it'd be perfect. 9/10 Would Spread my blood on the traps again			"

												A fun and short, likely 2 hours tops on first playthrough, vertical-oriented platformer.  You pretty much start at the top of a level and make your way down through various obstacles.  There are no enemies to contend with.  You get a couple of upgrades like a double-jump and the ability to glide but the game can be beat without them.  Dying results in an instant respawn and checkpoints are plentiful so this is the big reason the game is so short, as you'll never have to replay large chunks of levels, you're always moving forward and progressing.  Controls are solid, though the gameplay can be rather simple at times, especially early on.The art is nice, but the one thing that separates the game from other similar titles is the princess's use of painted messages throughout the levels.  They're frequent and usually amusing and charming.  I had as much fun reading them as I did from making my way through the level themselves.I place a lot of value on amount of fun had from a game rather than the length, and I always prefer a shorter experience that I enjoyed throughout than playing a game that's 20 hours long and just okay or average, so Freedom Fall's short length didn't bother me in the slightest and I can see myself revisiting it in the future.  I'm certainly interested in whatever title this developer comes up with next as they made a rather simple game a lot of fun.			"

Vertical incidence.It's about:falling, jumping, bangling, throwing bombs;collecting gears to obtain special equipment;girl with questionable sence of humor (and justice);female's rancour.Why you should play this:unsuall approach: there's mostly falling which is deluted by standard ""from-left-to-right"" levels and few chasing runs;level-design: it's various for different game modes and tower's zones;few levels' forks leading to different endings;a lot of possibilities for success for your particular style:you can rigourously collect every item to buy new equipment and ""clear"" the level;you can ignore collectables and focus on speedrun (yet you need bombs on last level);you can complete the game without any additional equipment;perfectly balanced difficulty: it's hard as it needs to be to throw out a challenge, but doesn't torture you. Why you may not like it:if you not in mood to complete all challenges, ""clear"" all levels and unlock all endings, you will definitely find it short;uncover story details through grafitti not a very good idea - for non-native english speakers it might be difficult to follow, narrator (or princesss in that role) would be much better.Captivating charm of free falling.

												A handful of exceptions excluded, platformers are typically synonymous with the act of jumping up and ascending toward your end goal, with falling down often resulting in death or setting you back. As the name implies, Freedom Fall takes a different approach, placing your stranded at the top of a tower and forcing you to descend through the traps an precariously placed spikes toward your escape. It's a novel idea accomplished with a lot of style, but one that was also originally done for mobile and tablet devices and on its way to the PC has had little effort into better suiting it to the platform. What follows is an enjoyable, but flawed experience that can't reach its full potential, despite being largely enjoyable much of the time.Taking the role of a nameless prisoner, placed for an unknown crime at the top of a dungeon-like tower, you're let loose with the promise that you will be pardoned if only you can make it through alive. Once you step out of your cell however, you become the plaything to a maniacal princess, taunting you through writings left on the wall which also serve to flesh out the backstory of both your character and the princess. Her dialogues are far and away my favorite thing about the game; unapologetically sociopathic musings which are both hilariously morbid and engaging, while giving your on-and-off adversary a level of depth I didn't expect to find in this game. It's disappointing then that the ending is so anticlimactic, but at least getting there is fairly entertaining.As a down-scrolling platformer, FF plays much like any other game in the genre except with lots more, well, falling. You spend much of your time maneuvering through the air as you collect bolts to buy tools which help you access hard to reach areas and generally make progressing a lot easier. An interesting twist is that you are often given the choice between an easy and hard path, the former featuring fewer traps and a quicker way through, and the later giving you more bolts if you can survive through it. It's a smart way to allow for those looking for different levels of challenge, but my main complaint with it is that about halfway through you already have more than enough bolts to buy every upgrade, so taking the harder path becomes a bit pointless aside from your own pride getting in the way. I would have preferred if the item prices had been better balanced, or that the act of buying the items was removed altogether and you were simply given them at certain points in the game, because bolts as they are now seem superfluous and tacked on.Although the artwork certainly looks good in stills, the way it moves is what makes it such a joy to behold. The background and foreground subtly shift apart giving the impression of 3D, which creates a very neat effect when your character runs through it (who's hair I should mention animates beautifully). The soundtrack is an excellent collection of rock and ambient tunes, with several great guitar lines standing out as particularly memorable. Unfortunately as much as I love the art and music of FF it has some unmistakable problems. The splat popup when you die looks horrible and is completely out of place, like a forgotten placeholder that made it into the final game. Numerous bugs pop up throughout, from broken animations to consistently poor performance, and many areas could have used more polish. Unrelated to the presentation, the biggest thing holding me back from fully recommending Stirefire Studio's creation is the extremely short length and unreasonable price. I completed the game in about an hour, and unless you are obsessed with climbing the leaderboards for each level there isn't any reason to go back. For the $3 it originally costed on Android it doesn't seem too bad considering the game itself is a lot of fun, but for $10 it's undoubtedly overpriced.I like Freedom Fall quite a bit. It's an interesting twist on platformers with a smart tongue and a great soundtrack that feels just long enough despite its brevity. Be that as it may, for its current price I don't believe it to be worth it, and would suggest waiting for a sale for those interested in picking it up. I'm not sure why the price was raised so much for the PC version, but regardless of the reasoning I believe it silly and those who pay full price will likely be disappointed with what they get. It's by no means bad, there is just very little of it.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												-A large supply of checkpoints-Lots of spikes & other traps-One touch = deathYep, it's a platformer. Well maybe not the kind I grew up with, but a platformer all the same. What does Freedom Fall do to stand out in such a crowded genre? By being a quite good game.There's a kid imprisoned in a tower, that's you.  The cell-door is unlocked, that's good. The way out will likely cause you to die many times, that's kinda bad. Oh yeah there's also a princess who just loves to hear herself talk..or read herself write..or..anyway that's all in the background. Each stage of Freedom Fall is comprised of a variety of traps, with new ones doled out at regular intervals. You have all of the basic techniques like jumping, wall-jumping, and grabbing onto ledges to progress. While this definitely isn't necessary, you can also build a few pieces of equipment to get an edge. This requires the acquisition of gears, which are strewn all over the tower. This is a score-based game so moving quickly, dying less, and taking those difficult optional paths to collect more gears, are all essential strategies for climbing the leaderboards.One of the things that usually bugs me about falling in a platformer, is that all too often it results in ""leaps of faith"". Aside from down, you have no idea where you're going, so death is a very real possibility. Freedom Fall features exceptionally well-designed levels. Despite having the ability to look down and get a better view of below, I was never concerned about those leaps of faith. Each level is tight and offers enough feedback so you always have an idea of what's below. Platformers are great when you don't have to think over your next move. At first the large-size of the player's hitbox was a bit disconcerting. If so much as a single hair on the player's head is singed, it's back to the last checkpoint. After awhile though it became second nature. A smaller hitbox might be nice for those ""hey I coulda dodged that...right?"" moments but overall the game shows utmost conviction in its design. For a game where death comes easily, solid mechanics are a must. Freedom Fall succeeds not only in its hit-box design, but also in the fundamentals like jumping. This a game that just feels good to play. I like that.The Princess deserves special mention. It's her tower and she'll remind you every step of the way. Berating your ability, insulting your mum, bragging about her dad, laughing at the misfortunes of the prisoners that died before you, it can be absolutely hilarious at times. Plus all this writing serves another purpose in telling the story of the game, without any need for cut-scenes, intros, or anything that could get in the way of the pacing (unless you're a slow reader). This is a very smartly-designed game. A play-through will run a bit over an hour (maybe less), there are far worse ways to spend that time I assure you. It's also great that Freedom Fall offers a well-designed hard difficulty setting. Unlike some games where hard difficulty apparently means no checkpoints, this game actually adds more traps to deal with. Thus you're encouraged to play better, not play safer(there is a difference).  Altogether this game is worth checking out. "

												After having this game on my steam wishlist for about 6 months, I got it as part of a bundle for $1. Let me say that I kind of wish I had bought it months ago for full price- because this game is fantastic. Yes, the game is pretty damn short- let's just get that out of the way. For how short it is, I'm not sure about the $10 price tag. But if $10 isn't going to bankrupt you, and you love a good platformer- definitely do yourself a favor and buy this. The graphics are vibrant, animations are good. The music is great. The literal 'writing on the wall' that you see as you descend through the levels is amusing and occasionally downright hilarious. And despite how short the game is (a couple hours at most), there is some great replay value here due to collectibles, leaderboards, etc. The game really feels like it belongs in the tier just below the greats of platformers. You have your Mario/DK Country/Rayman Legends/Super Meat Boy tier, and right below it is Freedom Fall. It really is that good, in my opinion. It's just a shame it isn't longer.			"

												Nice platformer. A bit short, but it has replayability if you want to challenge the times and get all achievements. I'm not overly bothered with that so for me it was a nice way to pass some time. It's not overly hard or frustrating, quite forgiving and the good part is: you actually get the choice to do a harder route if you want to. Excellent for when you start to get frustrated so you can just take the easier route.The story is rather funny with a crazy but fun princess that will torment you with her writings and castle design.Give it a go when you feel like a platformer that is not designed to just punish you all the time, but still offers some challenges.

9/10This game's a riot. It was one of those games in my library from all the games I've collected and thought to myself, ""I'll play this when I'm exhausted and don't need to concentrate."" Buuuut it ended up taking my full attention. It's definitely tough, but has this flow about it that just kept me playing. The craftable powerups are actually good—one of which, the wings, I think would make speedrunning very interesting. The soundtrack, rock and hip hop influenced, is really good. The graphics are ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful.It did only take 2 hours to beat the game on Hard including the extra level, but with the intention of 100%ing it, I'd definitely say it has high replay value.So, why the 9/10? Hitboxes are really inconsistent. Fire seems to have a hitbox far extending outside its graphic. Marsh (your little, silly faller) has extended feet hitboxes. You get used to it after a while, but I mean, it shouldn't be a problem to begin with. See second edit.Anyway, 10.99 CAD is a good enough price. You may or may not get 10 hours out of it, which just depends on how you play games. Are you going to perfect it? Yeah, you'll get those hours. Are you going to play through it once and be done with it? Nah, you definitely won't get those hours.Either way, it's a fantastic game and a great port (from mobile, if that wasn't clear from the gameplay).EDIT: Figured I'd elaborate on what makes it a good port:+ No low FPS cap+ Custom keyboard controls+ Fluid graphics which don't degrade at higher resolutionsEDIT 2: So I went back and perfected the game. I think there are 3 secret achievements or something? There's a guide in the community hub if you're looking to complete it. So, the 4 other runs I did after my original run made me realize the hitbox issue is strictly for fire. There's just so much huge-hitbox fire in the final levels. And confirming: 9 hours for perfecting the game? 10$? Yeah, definitely worth it.			"

I played through it as part of a short LetsPlay series on my Youtube channel and was greatly surprised by how much fun I had playing it.It's a very unique design for a platformer game, in that you are going downward most of them game instead of the typical left to right motion.  I highly suggest trying this game if you get the chance.  It's one of those rare games that has a great replay factor in order to get all achievements as well as its available on Android and iOS as well as PC so it's easy to find a way to play it.Social MediaTwitter - https://twitter.com/kovicplayzYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/kovicplayzTwitch - https://www.twitch.tv/kovicplayz/profile "

												With only 13 levels + 1 bonus level, this game doesn't offer much. You can beat the game for 1 hour only. Considering the price point is 8 USD, it's heavily overpriced. A bundle would have been fine and I recommend you to wait until this is bundled (again).It has, however, a good challenge especially if you want to complete all achievements.The gameplay is quite unique - you need to free fall and avoid spikes, traps, hazardous materials to finish the level. Throughout the game you need to collect cogs in order to purchase equipments to speed up your finishing the level. How fast you do the level will also account into some of the achievements and scores.The game's art also is quite nice looking, there's an art involved and not resorting to 'metro games tribute' way.Best played with controller. I've tried the game (Steam version) on older controllers' Dinput mode and it works just fine.Overall, recommended, but how short the game is quite putting off. Why they did not include more levels before selling it on Steam is beyond my comprehension.			"

What is Freedom Fall?Freedom Fall is a down-scrolling indie platformer set in a very tall prison tower. You are a prisoner who is trying find your way down to the bottom of the tower through all the traps set up by a twisted princess. The goal is to get your freedom back by escaping the tower. The writings on the walls in the tower are funny and drives the story forward as you get to know more about the princess. If you are any kind of fan of the platformer genré then you should definitively try to pick this game up. The game is for Windows and Mac which is always nice and the replay value of the game is pretty good since you can try to improve your scores and times for the levels. As far as I'm aware there are two different endings you can get decided by which way you go in the tower. At the time of writing this review the achievements are glitched but I'm sure they will fix that soon[EDIT: They have indeed fixed it]. The menu screen is good and you can have a few different save files. I personally like the art style and level design in this game and these kind of games are right up my alley. The game has full controller support but I haven't had time to try it out with a controller yet and the keyboard controls work just fine. Another part of this game that I enjoyed was that you can choose between harder platforming and easier platforming. The harder platforming rewards you with more cogs than in the easier parts, cogs which are the in-game currency that you can use to buy equipment like a pair of dragon wings or a glider. As the game progresses it gets harder but even if you aren't very good at platformer games it shouldn't get too hard and it is not a game that frustrates you as for example Super Meat Boy.Conclusion:As a conclusion I would like to say that I recommend this game with all my heart even though it is a bit short but as I stated above the game has good enough replay value for me to still really recommend it for anyone who is looking for a good time. The music is nice and fitting for the game and there are also trading cards which everyone always seem to like :) - Liam			"

												Even if a first run through takes only two hours, I heavily recommend Freedom Fall. It's generally just really enjoyable: the music, the humor, and the art are all top-notch. Combine the fun factor with both the difficulty of the game and the achievements (multiple endings, beating the game without dying), and the lifespan of the game continues to grow. I've put about 21 hours into it and just now finished up all the achievments/got all the endings, and I'm still planning on playing it again just because it's fun.			"

												Excilent game overall!I just finished my first playthrough, and I've already started my speed runs and completionist playthroughs.Pros - The levels are complex but simple at the same time. Some of them take some head scratching but they are enjoyably hard. The humor is also quite fun, I would recommend spending you're first play through reading the wall writings.There are also multiple endings (I won't spoil the ones I've found, but there are many of them).Cons - I did notice the story on it's own is maybe around 3 hours long if you're casually playing it, and I've seen some leaderboard scores of finishing the game in about 1 hour. (redeemable with the ""New Game+"" features and replayability).Overall, this is a good game for an afternoon game time.			"

												In a similar sub-breed of platformer as Super house of dead ninjas, freedom fall is a vertical drop platformer. With a garnish of super meat boy style difficulty. However while the platformer is difficult in areas, the difficulty curve comes too late in the game and mostly in the bonus level that appears after the game. On death you respawn at the last check point you passed and getting to the end of the level can be broken down into simply brute forcing it with failures. Only during the bonus level and a few select time rewind based check points do you actually get denied progress if you do not successfully do well enough to beat the puzzle set. I felt this mechanic could have been utilised sooner and in a much broader way to give much further depth to the earlier levels. Instead the main game plays fairly quickly and the only real challenge is in earning the awards for beating the level under a par set for time completed, deaths and amount of items collected.The game has a nice aesthetic with clean HD graphics and a cute story that plays out through writing on the wall narrative. A one sided conversation between the protagonist and antagonist. The antagonists personality however is a little disjointed with the way she writes and the way she acts at the end of the game.Tentatively Recommended: A fun game that ends before it can realize it's potential.

												Let me start by saying that I've been avidly awaiting this game's release on Steam for quite some time, so I might be a bit biased about it.Now onto the review itself.Freedom Fall is fun and charming, if a little frustrating at parts. The music is about as unobtrusive as you can get, while still adding to the mood, and fits the levels very well. The art (my initial draw into this game as I follow the art director on a popular art site) is VERY well done and the animations are smooth and natural. Marsh is adorable, our dear little Highness the Princess is beautifully handled, and everything just has this almost childlike charm to it.The design choice of telling the story through graffiti on the wall is excellent in ways I cannot describe.But there is a reason I said that its frustrating. While the gameplay is smooth and the default controls are solid (though personally I would have had the three glider types set to A, S, and D rather than having to change between them in a loop with C) I keep hitting X when I mean to hit C and C when I mean to hit V and there are times where you only have a split second time frame or have to jump from a specific pixel in order to have the slightest chance of successfully completing the jump. Compared to the fluid ease of the rest of the game, these specific parts quickly become frustrating and irritating. This is made even worse by the large hitbox on obstacles in later levels (to a brutal extent in the bonus level).Early on, these parts are a nice challenge, but in the later stages it it quickly becomes apparent why this game doesn't use lives.However, even with those issues, Freedom Fall is a nice, short game that can be completed in an hour if you know what you're doing, and three tops if you don't. Its a fun game well worth picking up and more than worth the money.Do be warned of some bugs that myself and my friends have encountered.I'm using a MacBook Pro OSX:-I have encountered random temporary ""hiccups"" in loading (all animation will cease for about half a second). These did not affect my gameplay but they are a thing.-On my second play through I got caught in a Lightning trap and was returned to a redstone as expected, however Marsh was stuck in the electrocuted animation loop. I did not attempt to replicate this bug, I simply restarted the level.My PC using friends:-For one of my friends, Freedom Fall will fail to open. Steam will claim it is open, and Freedom Fall will claim its open, but it cannot be located. I'm unsure how he fixed this, if he did, but restarting Steam did not help.-Another friend had the game crash in the middle of the fight against Madam Sharkie Twinkletooth the 3rd. We do not know what caused it to crash, and she could not replicate it.-Around the ""You weren't supposed to get this far"" graffiti, the same friend's screen bugged out again, slowing down and moving Marsh to the side of the screen and going completely unresponsive. She had to close the game and reopen it to fix it, and we're not sure what was done to cause this.			"

												Freedom fall is a quite interesting game. It is a platformer with an emphasis of going down rather than right. The gameplay works good, you can move the camera down and up, you can do wall jumps, grab on ledges, and later on even do double jumps. The story, which is written on the tower walls, was interesting to follow. However the best thing about this game was the graphic style. The game isn't long, and easy to 100%, but it's definetly worth it's money.			"

												Freedom Fall is a fun game.  The art is well done, the controls work well and consistently, and the level design is interesting if not particularly inspired.  Probably the most engaging part of the game is the way it conveys it's story, limited as it is.  None of the characters speak, instead the tower's designer communicates with you through the scrawled grafitti which litter the levels.  Many of these messages are rather ammusing, and putting together the bits of background they offer to work out what's going on was an engaging exercise.For completionists, there are three medals to be earned in each level, gained by attaining par scores for loot collected, time spent, and deaths.  Failing to obtain these medals will not hinder you from moving forward though, so they serve as extras for those interested rather than barriers for those who are not.One runthrough will probably only take a couple hours, though there is a branching point in the story late game that will entice some to replay simply to see how things play out if a different choice is made.  the replay value will depend on how much you enjoy the platforming and the idea of trying to hit leaderboards or just beat personal challenges.  Overall, it's certainly worth a try.			"

It is not amazing, but it is good enough to make me want to read it to the end, and to endure just a little bit more of jumping and dying.

												Freedom Fall is a wonderful platformer. The game is short (2.5 hours completed) but not nearly everything that I could have done. The premise is that your character is at the top of a tower and must fall (with style) and avoid many different means of death. There are leaderboards based on time/score and achievements that can require some focus and time. I'm personally not an achievement hunter, so I played through the rather enjoyable story just to see what happens. The game can be difficult or relatively easy, depending on your goals for the gameplay. Highly recommended.			"

												Freedom Fall is a short and quirky platformer. There are a few ""descend the tower"" games on Steam but this one in particular stood out for me as more well polished graphics wise. Freedom Fall is probably one of the easier ones once you get the hang of it but I enjoyed playing a few times. Despite the entire game being played out in a castle tower there was a lot of environment diversity. Each set of stages felt like a different location from the gardens to the aqueducts. Since you play through the stages quickly no stage ever gets stale. The story is told by the princesses' writings on the walls. As you descend she'd leave you notes either berating you or talking about her family. It was all very lighthearted and funny to read as you descended the tower. For a character we race a few times and meet at the end of the game her personality really shone through her writing. And while the 3 endings aren't terribly different from each other the replay value that this game has is based on the layer challenges of time trial, no death count and most cogs collected. Usually the game provides you with a 'hard' and 'easy' path to follow integrated into your journey so you only need to choose which path to travel. For an even easier play there are 3 accessories you can purchase This is also a game where achievements add a second layer of replay ability. Can you get through the game without buying anything, or how about no deaths ever? These are just a few of the challenges achievements that add value. I found this game to be interesting and a bit of a challenge that killed a few hours.			"

												This is my favorite indie platformer of all time. The mechanics are tight, each level presents multiple challenges (time, score, survivability), and the game is robust; these are the basics. The secret sauce in Freedom Fall is personality: the game has unique character, and it comes through in the storytelling and humor, both subtle and overt. Additionally, the game has seen solid support since release, with new features, levels, and challenges added, and various issues fixed. Some games you want to see sequels because they feel (or are) incomplete; with this one, you'll just want more.It's worth it just to read the graffiti on the castle walls.			"

												I remember upvoting this game quite a while back now, and my first impression was that i really don't recall seeing anything like it before. I picked it up this morning and and have just started playing but it definately seems like an entertaining game, even just to pass the time. The entirety of the descent is broken up into smaller playable 'levels', so you don't have to concern yourself with not making progress each time you open it. So far it seems like it could be very addictive, I myself am keen to see what is the next level down, as slowly more ways to die are introduced, and avoiding them made more tricky. Very playable, very simple and made more entertaining by the writing on the walls as you descend. I recommend to anyone who has a few bucks laying around and likes to jump into something to pass the time, or anyone who likes a quick laugh at excruciatingly painful deaths. Somewhere here is a middleground that I am sure I'm missing, but nevertheless... "

												Since the first time I saw Freedom Fall I didn't expected much from it but after playing it I found out that despite being a simple game it still managed to be a good one. Probably the thing I most like about Freedom Fall is its graphicstyle and the character animations such as the way the hair waves as you move and as your character moves as you move. The soundtrack is kinda nice too but it isn't really my style. The gameplay is pretty simple, it's a standard platformer with some items that you can buy/build by collecting some kind of metal throughout the levels. Each level puts you at the top of it and you have to descend the tower where you've started. Basicly you start off the game by waking up on a cell on top of a tower and you start your way down until the exit of the tower and the story is told by written text on the walls that was written by the daughter of your King and that's how the story unfolds. Overall it's a nice 2-3 little game, it's a good game for what it is, I won't certainly say it's a must play but you might wanna give it a try, just don't expect too much from it.			"

Cool idea and concept, but lacking overall due to the constraints of the original platform, and can currently be ""beaten"" in 1-1.5 hours.Currently, even though the game is quite good, the price point is wrong, and some of the infrequent freezes are even in the PC version, having played the Android version (and being unable to get very far in due to frequent freezes) and coming to this, the Android has less content I beleive, but the price of $2.50-$4.00 is more acceptable for the length.Otherwise, controls very well, looks crisp, and the game does a good job in pushing you forward, as well as testing your ability, to the very end.It is a cool game, I just wish the game was a little more fleshed out, there was a decent amount of potential here concept-wise. It could have been longer, it could have had puzzles, it could have had more notes and storytelling, it could have had more character development even; but that is asking too much of what was originally a mobile game.

												Not exactly sure how or why the protagonist is at the top of an impossibly tall tower, but the only way out is to go all the way down.Freedom Fall is primarily a action platformer with a few occasional puzzles tossed in.  Controls are swift and responsive with quality level design that offers players multiple paths to choose from.Narrative in the game is told via scrawled words and pictures that while they appear simple have a great comedic timing that makes the player want to progress to see more.

												This is a fantastic game.I must address the obvious first.  Yes, the game is short.  Not extremely short, but you may well complete it in little over an hour if you're a pro at these games.  Most people will probably take a bit longer, and die many times in their first playthrough!  I died over 20 times in my first try at some levels, I am not afraid to admit!You are held prisoner at the top of a trap-filled tower, the domain of a purple-haired princess who loves to watch her prisoners die in their attempts to escape.The value is there mainly for people who want to fully complete the game and get all the achievements.  You'll probably need to play through three or four times to get them all.  First, complete the game.  Ok!  Now complete it with no equipment.  Ok.  Now complete it without dying a single time.  Wow!  And these are tough, but fair to complete.  It is challenging, but without relying on pixel-perfect jumping or restrictive controls like many 'hardcore' platformers do.  It's just plain fun to play, because the protagonist controls so beautifully.The level design is excellent.  It is so clever that they made each level fit each style of playthrough with the right level of difficulty.  The humour is wonderful too.  The princess leaves you messages painted on the walls as she descends ahead of you, and they combine the cutesy with the psychotic in a hilarious way.  She is a great character.So, for some people it may be overpriced, but if you are like me, you will get a lot of high quality entertainment from this title.  I hope there will be a sequel someday!

												Fun game but it was beaten in an hour (little over an hour for the bonus level). Although it's enjoyable it's not worth the money for a game you can beat in an hour. I've played flash games that felt very similar and are completely free for me to play.			"

												I want to say this game is good, I really do but there is too much I was let down by, it's short, they have a few themed levels that really needed expanding and the soundtrack, though great, is badly looped having notable skips as it loops. The art style is amazing as well as the humor though most of the jokes have been done before and better. The main story will take a casual player about an hour and a half, maybe less. There is a bonus level that is pretty fun and cute but unless I am missing something that is all there is to the game. One other let down is the controls, they are very contextual and because of this you may find yourself getting needlessly killed. Its just a shame, this game was so close to being an amazing experiance, instead it just because a overpriced way to kill an afternoon and forever gather dust in my steam library.			"

												Good game, but way too short for that price. The final boss is too easy considering the difficulty of the game, and the end was just botched. Animations are quite poor, the death anim is just a joke... I'm not saying you didn't work hard on your game, but the lack of finition and the short lifespan makes you look just lazy....BUT! The story and writing are fun, and I only finished it to know how it would end ^^			"

												A great platformer with some interesting mechanics. If you're the kind of person to run through a game multiple times to get all endings and achievements, then this game is worth the full price. If you just play through once, then I would reccommend that you wait for a sale. I finished the game in about 1.2 hours for the first run through. "

												So I've been silently following this game off and on through whatever means possible.  I had high hopes for it and I've been awaiting the day of release on Steam feverishly.  The day came.  And not only that, but in celebration it was on SALE.  And not to far from my birthday, so I could excuse the purchase as a ""Early gift to myself"".  Awesome!It installs... And I run it.  Instantly I'm hit with beautifully painted and animated scenes and awesome music that I wish I could listen to outside of the game (WAV/ALAC/FLAC/etc OST please?).  The effort that went into the whole game is clear from the very beginning and I LIKE that in a game, indie title or not, and is something sorely missing from most modern games, I think.When I beat it, I at first felt disappointed because it was over ""so quickly"".  But then I looked at the clock; 2 hours had passed.  I mean, okay, lets be honest, two hours ISN'T huge.  But I thought it was less than half that.  This says more about the quality of the game than I can with an essay of words.  It pulled me in like a good book, wrapped me tight around it's little finger, and time seemed to pass at incredible pace.  I plan on playing it again, and soon.  Maybe I'll buy it for my Nexus 7, too.The game itself is simple, platformer-like, and quick to grasp.  That said, it's not easy to master, and some levels may have you bald very quickly, depending on how quickly you rip your hair out in frustration.  One level, I'm ashamed to admit, had me dead 86 times.  That said, I don't think I've played a game in this style that I enjoyed this much in a long time (Unless it was an original game produced in the 80's/90's).  This is a game that will someday be mentioned in the same breath as all the retro classics and will have a special place all it's own among them.Oh, and the first ending I got seemed to play at a possible sequel... If this is even a remote possibility, consider my money spent.			"

												The game is fun and it has alot of quirky and charming moments but alot  of the bugs glitchs and just down right annoying deaths that it brings to the table make it unplayable sometimes and frustrates even the calmest of people, i had once had to fully restart the game  over becuase i had somehow managed to bug the game, some platforms where spikes are cause you to die when you hang onto them and climb up even tho the trap had already dropped down, and a ton more other annoyances make me not reccommend the game.

												Ten dollars is a lot to ask for Freedom Fall.  It tries to coast by on its art style and almost Portal-esque storytelling method; here, instead of a robot, it's a catty little princess writing us messages on the wall of the tower we're descending.  Finding out our main character's past is supposed to be a big carrot to dangle in front of the player, but the payoff is not worth putting up with the middling controls and trial-and-error gameplay.This is a game where you play a greased-up klutz jumping around sharp things; if that's what you're after, just pay the extra five bucks for Super Meat Boy and be done with it.

												Freedom Fall is nod back to the days of old school gaming like things such as Sonic on the Genesis or even Mario on the Super Nintendo. You jump, slide down walls, and avoid traps as you try to get down to the bottom of the tower, including with some hilarious messages from the Princess as you move through the area to survive.It can get pretty challenging at times, but it has restore points and save spots rather often, so you don't have to worry about getting nearly at the bottom and going straight back up to the top.I find it highly enjoyable, great fun, and if you like old school games with a bit of challenge. I do recommend this! Just make sure to watch out below. ;)			"

												Remove the portal gun from Portal, halve the budget, but retain the fun, speed, puzzles, and wit, and you have Freedom Fall.  It's a 2-d platformer that has you going down an impossibly large tower, run by a rather psychotic, but humorous, mute princess.  The puzzles and platforming are fun, often requiring good timeing and speed, but what will keep people playing is the hilarious and often dark commentary.  See, nothing is voiced in game, but the princess who runs the tower loves to write on the walls.  She will reveal her past, tease you, lie to you, or even joke and admire you, like in Portal, and the writing is often quite funny...and grim...but still funny.  They also do some intersting things with the idea of respawns and how it plays into the narrative.Overall, a fun game.  It's only about 2-3 hours long if you just run through it without trying to get high scores, but still, I enjoyed it.  Fun and funny little title.			"

												Freedom Fall is a light take on dark comedy with game mechanics similar to all the other sidescrollers (with tiny twists, of course).  Having only put a few hours into it, I may be speaking to soon when I say this title is highly repetative with little-to-no replay value.  The quips written on the wall take after the Portal series humor type, and are good for simple laughs for the first 15 minutes, but I quit reading them as time went on.  The collectables hardly seem worth going out of your way for, so they lost my interest quickly as well.  And regretably, I felt underchallenged with the difficulty, as ""lives"" and ""respawns"" are infinately abundent, making death feel cheep and progress unrewarding.I got this in a bundle, and think it was worth the install, but unless you get the game this way, I wouldn't recommend it.

Very short at about 2 hours its a below average platformer that you should really only get from a bundle to be a valid purchase.			"

												To start this off, I don't like binary review systems. Now to the review: This game is relatively short, about 1 and a half hours. Not really challenging compared to other PC platformers, although it was entertaining in terms of a funny script written purely on the walls, Also the soundtrack and game-mechanics were solid. However, The game's shortness and easiness make it not worthy of its price, the killing blow however is that you can't play as the loveable loli princess. 4/10			"

												Cute platformer with a difficulty curve to suit all players. Overall length (as has been noted in other reviews) is relatively short. 1.5-2 hours for a standard playthrough, 30 mins if you're attempting your 2nd or 3rd playthrough to get some of the tougher achievements. I wouldn't mark this against the game as any longer would stretch the story too thin.This is however a perfect opportunity for the developers to add in Steam Workshop support and let the community create their own devious levels and extend gameplay, and enough meat on the bones for a competent sequel.Overall: solid gameplay with rewarding freerunning mechanic, cute/funny story, accessable to all.

												I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this game. The levels are well-designed, and fun. The game is very good-looking, and the story kept me interested.There's not a whole heck of a lot of story, it's mostly just messages written on the wall, but it's presented in a way that keeps you motivated. You don't feel like it's unfair. There are many ""checkpoints"" along the way, where if you die you'll restart at the nearest checkpoint. You will get scored at the end of a level, and penalized for how much you died. So it's not entirely a ""keep going until you finally don't die"", as it will motivate you to play again in the attempt to get through without dying.But man... you will die. But it's fun.			"

For me it ranks right up there with classics like LIMBO and Braid. (Remember LIMBO is short too.)If you enjoy indie platformers with standout atmosphere and story then this is a no brainer.

												This is a great game to play on the side, I loved this game from the moment I hit play. With quirky little humor thrown in and a nice backstory that seems to twist and turn at times it tends to keep you wanting to get to the next level. The gameplay is fast paced, very forgiving when it comes to dieing, and even has an arcade like scoring to it for those highscore buffs. I recommend it to those who like drop-down platformers with a sense of humor!Only downside is it is a quick game to beat, took maybe three to four hours to beat, but it is a joy ride to play while you do it.

												This Game Is great.The Levels are wonderfully designed in a risk-reward system that works great Beutiful Graphics Amazing Soundtrack And a good story too? Count me in! But, It Does Have flaws it is very short only taking about an hour and a half to beat. But There is a great deal of replay value with multiple endings and 20 challinging achivments with an extra after-story level.Also Every Level Has Three Pars, One for How Many times you die in a level,One for how many cogs You collect (which can be used to build gliders to make your decents slower and easier),And How long you take to beat the level.There Are 13 levels (Including the after-story one)and are all fun and challenging.Also The Only other character in this game is The Princess Who is Very GLAD0S-esk exept She Is Mute and uses writing on the walls to taunt,torment,etc. you But you slowly grow attached to her as the plot of this game starts to unfold (Which Suprises me looking back at how short the game is).For My Final Thought This Game Gets a 7/10 For me its Fun but a bit short but also has good replay value,i reccomend this game But only at its discounted price, its great but $10 is a bit steep for this particular title. I hoped this Review Helped you decide wether or not to get this game (plus im going to do a let's play of this game soon on my youtube channel of the same name of my steam profile).			"

												Pros:+ High replayability factor : 3 endings, leaderboards, and contains achievements which are rather fun/add edge.+ Fantastic art/character/level design.+ Very nice soundtrack gives each level a distinct feel.+ Main game doesn't over stay its welcome. [double edged sword]Cons:- If you do not like besting your own score, the challenge of ending up on the leaderboards, replaying levels to meet time/cog/death par, or are not an achievement person, then this game WILL be very short and is probably not worth $10.NOTE ON PRICE:$$$ Justification of depends on how much you believe you'll be replaying this game. If you're a fan of time-trial/replaying to best your own (or others!) score, then you'll get 5-12+ hours worth out of this title depending on how addictive you find the game. While you can get this game on iOS/Android for ~$3 or so I believe it's a lesser experience than the PC version [played iOS version]. TL;DR:1) Bookmark game for future sale if you're unsure how much you'll play it. Easily worth $3-5 imho. Not worth $10 if not someone who replays games once done.2) High degree of replayability if you're into leaderboards or achievements.3) Great soundtrack.4) Best version.			"

												Freedom Fall is a pretty looking game that seems to involve… falling for your freedom. And it doesn’t disappoint, the game is an exquisitely crafted, easy on the eyes, smooth platformer in which you escape from death row by navigating an ever perilous descent out of a deadly tower.Really, this game is pretty. Perhaps because I have been playing some games that have been disregarding graphics lately but I really enjoyed the visuals in Freedom Fall. The towering heights, the deadly spikes and spinning blades, the cloudy backgrounds, and best of all the graffiti scrawled around the tower. You’re treated to some equally impressive visuals if you make it to the bottom and looking around at this fantastical world.So the justice system in this strange world involves locking people up in insanely high towers and then giving them the option to wait in their cell and be executed or attempt to find freedom by navigating a fairly suicidal descent. It’s a brilliant premise and I really am almost gushing at how brilliantly the story is told in this game. Developers and game designers take some notes here! A way to tell a fairly deep and engrossing story without heavy handed cut scenes or dialogue boxes and never interrupting the flow of game-play.The princess in the tower is not some damsel in distress that needs rescuing nor a helpful guide that you might think she is at first. No she is a monstrous, murderous, malevolent creature who has designed this mad death trap for her own amusement. Although you’ve thrown a wrench into her intricate mechanism by your uncanny ability to resurrect quickly after each of your painful deaths. I guess that’s why you got locked up to begin with, stealing (or being framed for stealing) the elixir of life, making you immortal.You might be immortal but there’s plenty of ways to send you back to the nearest resurrection shrine throughout your descent. The variety of deadly traps is quite impressive with spikes, blades, scythes, flames, fireballs, water, electricity, killer mechanical shark, and a dragon all out to kill you. The levels keep coming at you with more and more challenges but it’s not so frantic and unforgiving that you want to quit. The best feature is the game quickly resurrecting you, not wasting time on monotonous death scenes or loading screens and instead throws you right back into the action to try again when you fail. And you will fail a lot. A LOT!The only problem I really have with the game is it’s short length. Once you’ve gotten used to the various death traps and mastered the upgrades you’re fighting the final boss and then it’s over. Taking my time I beat the game in a little over an hour, then played again trying to go faster and beat it in under 50 minutes. Despite it’s short length and price tag though I was really satisfied by this game. It is highly concentrated goodness that delivers. Better to make a really good short game than a really long, drawn out, bad game.I recommend if you pick this game up to go slow your first time, read all the notes from the princess, the story that is told is really worth it. Then after you beat the game once, try again going as fast as you can for some extra challenge. I got a nice thrill testing my blade avoiding parkour skills as I tried to beat the game a third time as fast as possible while trying to die as few times as possible. And with a built in leader board you can compare your skills with all of the internet for bragging rights. I can understand not wanting to pay the full price for a game that can be completed in under an hour but at its current 35% off sale it’s definitely worth it!Final Score:Graphics: 9/10Game Play: 9/10Music / Ambiance: 8/10Story: 9/10Value: 5/10Overall: 8/10Read more of my indy game reviews on my blog!http://markofithian.com "

Always nice.Affordable, even with my perpetual lack of funds.Cons:The difficulty swings between challenging and annoying.It is short. Woefully short.The game hangs up on occasion, which can end up addign a layer of fake difficulty.Overall, Freedom Fall's a cheeky, good-looking game whose main downside is how small it is. If you like platformers and don't mind ludicrous amounts of dying/games you can finish far too quickly, you'll like Freedom Fall. "

												This is a great game to play on the side, I loved this game from the moment I hit play. With quirky little humor thrown in and a nice backstory that seems to twist and turn at times it tends to keep you wanting to get to the next level. The gameplay is fast paced, very forgiving when it comes to dieing, and even has an arcade like scoring to it for those highscore buffs. I recommend it to those who like drop-down platformers with a sense of humor!Only downside is it is a quick game to beat, took maybe three to four hours to beat, but it is a joy ride to play while you do it.

												I was debating if I should recommend this or not, but I think that it's worth the price. Barely. The problem I have with the game is, it relys on the player being a completionist and wanting to ace every level, but for someone like me, it falls a bit short. I love the art style and the characters, all of that is wonderful, but the 1-2 hour game length for $10 is kind of pushing it a little. People gave Ducktales bad rep for it's 3 hour length at $15, so I'm afraid this falls under the same catagory. Personally, I beat the game in about an hour and 15 minutes, and I had fun, some definitely might think that 1 1/2 hours for $10 is too much money, but I think it was worth it, but like I said, barely. It won me at the art and character and I think this is a wonderful game. (Even though it makes you rage every once in a while.) This game is a ""rage plaformer"" like Super Meat Boy, however I found it a lot easier then SMB, so I think that gives it a more wide range for players, because some (like me) just are not good enough for SMB. And hey, it has trading cards, so prepare to sink even more money into it XD.			"

												Pros:+ High replayability factor : 3 endings, leaderboards, and contains achievements which are rather fun/add edge.+ Fantastic art/character/level design.+ Very nice soundtrack gives each level a distinct feel.+ Main game doesn't over stay its welcome. [double edged sword]Cons:- If you do not like besting your own score, the challenge of ending up on the leaderboards, replaying levels to meet time/cog/death par, or are not an achievement person, then this game WILL be very short and is probably not worth $10.NOTE ON PRICE:$$$ Justification of depends on how much you believe you'll be replaying this game. If you're a fan of time-trial/replaying to best your own (or others!) score, then you'll get 5-12+ hours worth out of this title depending on how addictive you find the game. While you can get this game on iOS/Android for ~$3 or so I believe it's a lesser experience than the PC version [played iOS version]. TL;DR:1) Bookmark game for future sale if you're unsure how much you'll play it. Easily worth $3-5 imho. Not worth $10 if not someone who replays games once done.2) High degree of replayability if you're into leaderboards or achievements.3) Great soundtrack.4) Best version.			"

												Its a fun game designed for gamers who like fighing for the high score.  It is very short, basically designed as an extended speedrun track, with lots of somewhat tricky jumps and traps.  The level design is ok, not spectacular, as are the controls.  I personally like my characters to control a little tighter than this, but then I think I was spoiled by Super Meat Boy.Buy it if you want a fun platformer and like to race for high scores, not because its long.  I beat it in under 2 hours in one sitting, and that was taking the more difficult paths.			"

												Freedom Fall is a pretty looking game that seems to involve… falling for your freedom. And it doesn’t disappoint, the game is an exquisitely crafted, easy on the eyes, smooth platformer in which you escape from death row by navigating an ever perilous descent out of a deadly tower.Really, this game is pretty. Perhaps because I have been playing some games that have been disregarding graphics lately but I really enjoyed the visuals in Freedom Fall. The towering heights, the deadly spikes and spinning blades, the cloudy backgrounds, and best of all the graffiti scrawled around the tower. You’re treated to some equally impressive visuals if you make it to the bottom and looking around at this fantastical world.So the justice system in this strange world involves locking people up in insanely high towers and then giving them the option to wait in their cell and be executed or attempt to find freedom by navigating a fairly suicidal descent.

Freedom Fall is a non stop challenge that maintains fun all the way to the end.  The right amount of challenge without ever being frustrating.  Love the art style and the story as played out by the wall writings remains fresh and enjoyable throughout.  I played the game from start to finish using a 360 controller and it played fantastic.

												Pretty awesome platformer, though a bit on the short side.The artwork is amazing, the puzzles creative, and the controls feel tight and responsive.  Also, the taunts the Princess makes toward the player throughout the game are a nice tough.  Overall a very fun game, albeit with a few frustrating moments (the shark boss comes to mind); also multiple paths that can be taken through the levels as well as various challenges for time, least deaths, etc. make for some decent replay value in spite of the shortness of the game.Definitely worth checking out!

												A really cool ""backwards"" platform in which you must fall down levels instead of climbing them to proceed (even though there's still much jumping around involved). As an escaping prisoner, your objective is to reach the bottom of every level whilst circumventing contraptions of any sort. You can collect various screws and cogs which can then be used with workbenches to buy bombs (used to detonate traps or specific bricks) or power-ups to ease our quest. A series of check-points ensure that our premature death will not spell a restart from the beginning of the stage, even though, as a couple of achievements require us to not die at all during our run, an option to disable said check-points would have been useful.The story is simple but told in a captivating way: as our hero is a rather taciturn one, his story can be recollected from the countless taunts that the evil princess who built this infamous tower enjoy writing on the background walls. The messages' childish and sadistic nature had me giggling and cringing at the same time very often, and were a further incentive to complete my mission and see how everything would wrap up in the end.Graphics and music are reminiscent of the golden age of 16-bit arcade titles, coated in a shiny HD presentation, while level design is a perfect mix of mnemonic knowledge and just the right space for improvisation. Once the main game ends, there's still some challenge in the form of completing stages on par with time, cogs gathered and number of deaths: unfortunately, those parameters are not displayed during your run, so you don't know how good (or bad) it is going until you manage to reach the exit. That would have been a remarkable addition, too.All in all, I enjoyed my time with Freedom Fall and will try to snatch those challenging speedrun achievements. I'll surely keep tabs on any future Stirfire Studios' projects!			"

												This Game Is great.The Levels are wonderfully designed in a risk-reward system that works great Beutiful Graphics Amazing Soundtrack And a good story too? Count me in! But, It Does Have flaws it is very short only taking about an hour and a half to beat. But There is a great deal of replay value with multiple endings and 20 challinging achivments with an extra after-story level.Also Every Level Has Three Pars, One for How Many times you die in a level,One for how many cogs You collect (which can be used to build gliders to make your decents slower and easier),And How long you take to beat the level.There Are 13 levels (Including the after-story one)and are all fun and challenging.Also The Only other character in this game is The Princess Who is Very GLAD0S-esk exept She Is Mute and uses writing on the walls to taunt,torment,etc. you But you slowly grow attached to her as the plot of this game starts to unfold (Which Suprises me looking back at how short the game is).For My Final Thought This Game Gets a 7/10 For me its Fun but a bit short but also has good replay value,i reccomend this game But only at its discounted price, its great but $10 is a bit steep for this particular title. I hoped this Review Helped you decide wether or not to get this game (plus im going to do a let's play of this game soon on my youtube channel of the same name of my steam profile).			"

Although the game is rather short, the controls are solid and there is a amusing story being told here. Definitely a game for those who like platforming, but not as serious as other famous platformers.For achievement hunters, with some effort, 100% achievement is definitely doable for easy stats.			"

												Freedom Fall ReviewWhat makes the Indie scene a competitor to the AAA market is truthfully a massive quantity of games.  I've seen this game in at least two bundles, and that's where I recommed you buy it, as Freedom Fall is simply too short for $10.  However, a massive quantity doesn't mean all the games are bad, in fact I'd argue Freedom Fall is one of the better games you can find in the Indie game scene.I just beat it a few minutes ago so the game is still fresh in my mind.  Although I remember frustrating parts and an akward jump glitch in the beginning of the game, what really sticks out is the story.  Specifically the writing on the wall that you will be reading from the beginning of the game to the end - that's why I wanted to continue playing and ended up beating the game in one sitting.  Of course if you want to know what happens go and play the game, but basically your character is imprisoned in a castle for a supposed crime and the princess of the king and queen is a psychotic b!tch who installed all kinds of traps and spikes into an escape route.  If you can escape then you are granted freedom.Gameplay is basic platforming, jumping, double jumping, hovering with use of tools you buy from collecting bolts and screws, Ratchet and Clank / Megaman and Bass style.  You'll find ""shops"" throughout and you'll buy the stuff you need early on in the game.  In fact I wonder what the point of the whole system is, you get the stuff so early that you won't need the currency bolts later on, it just seems kind of pointless, they may as well have started you with the tools.  You do have a weapon by using bombs (they're more like mini-grenades) that will destroy some traps if you so wish.  But, I'd advise against using it because there are parts where the bombs are mandatory and I don't remember them being on hand anywhere.  The levels do change up the style with you going through some watery levels, fire levels, and what was the most unique was a metallic-plant level, a ""garden.""  There are boss fights as well as an easy final boss fight with the aforementioned psychob!itch.Every level has what I call the Angry Birds rating system, that is to say, three things you have to accomplish to fully beat every level.  I didn't three-star any of the levels but then again I played it on hard mode.  Although it does lenghen the game unquestionably, I still wish there were more levels as the game felt short on one playthrough.  You can beat it in like three hours, my time currently says four but that's because I left the computer on doing not nerdy things!So anyway, yes, play this game, I will come back to it another time to try and complete the Angry Birds rating system!  But be warned, I COULD NOT get a controller to work with this game.  I do not have a Xbox 360 controller (I know, I must be stupid or crazy how dare I) and instead have a generic joypad.  That wasn't compatible so I tried Joy2Key and I swear the game just wants you to use a keyboard no matter what, the buttons responded but the directions, including the D-Pad and joysticks, just didn't do anything.  That's kind of a crime for a game that requires precision platforming, don't you think?  But it's a Friday, I don't feel like being a complainer.			"

												Freedom fall is a short, simple, and very fun game.  It does pretty much what the trailer shows.  It's a brisk and often deadly platformer that usually scrolls downward.  It took me 92 minutes to finish the game once.  There are a lot of reasons to go back.Grafiti from your character's captor is presented very often in small doses. The game's story unfolds through those messages, and made the first playthrough very much worth it. There is also replay value, including at least one story branch, different solutions to the first boss fight, and a small wealth of achievements. Yes, this is a platform game with a seemingly 16-bit inspired visual design. Yet it owes much to modern games.  There are ample checkpoints.  Death lurks around every corner. The player experiences the kind of slow-release narrative found more recent games such as the Portal series.Although they seemed to draw inspiration from all over the last thirty years of gaming, Stirfire Studios cherry picked the best fits for the game they made.  The end result was fun on every level. Very highly recommended.			"

												This game is fun. It is a platformer where you avoid traps to progress while collecting stuff to buy upgrades. The story is given mainly though writings on the wall very unobtursive. You generally don't lose a lot of progress when you die keeping frustation from some of the harder segments from getting out of hand. So far I've only played it on normal difficulty.			"

												Now THIS is how you make an indie game! Using very limited resources and simple platforming gameplay, it makes an outstandingly good game! It has good writing yet without stopping the gameplay for storytime, it conveys the (sole talking) character memorable entirely through what they say, it has properly structured levels that each have their own level design theme, difficult sections have checkpoints right before them rather than wasting your time with walks-between-deaths, and - in what feels like a real rarity - has a proper difference between difficulties rather than just bumping numbers! In other words, it just does everything right!The one downside is that it's so short. I absolutely recommend it on the spot for people with more money than time, but if you're strapped for cash, you might want to get a longer-lasting game.			"

												I expected this to be a little, goofy platformer. Nothing super serious, and a good way to kill a few hours.What it really is would be the video game equivalent of The Princess and Mr. Wiffle, by Patrick Rothfuss: a dark, creepy tale about a princess who you only come to realize is super unbalanced as you progress through the story. The controls are quick and responsive, falling is actually kind of fun, but the Princess is really what keeps me going through the game. Her tales are told through colored scrawls on the wall in the background, which you should definitely read. It's challenging in places, you will probably not get through all of the levels without dying a few times. But, the restore points are frequent. My one gripe is that it's occasionally killed me when I've gotten just a smidge too close to a hazard. But, it's fluid enough of a game that this doesn't ruin anything.			"

												While the platforming itself is somewhat by the numbers (the jumps feel a bit more floaty than I'd like), the entire premise and art direction is great and is definitely the major reason to buy. The gameplay is alright, but not something that made me want to do multiple runs over and over. That said, it really encourages replayability if you're into that kind of thing.My only major gripe is little incentive for actual completion outside of ""enjoy your completion achievement"", and if you want to get multiple endings, you have to go through the entire game again - for which there are about 3 endings.All that said, it's a fun charming game that is very fair at its normal price - if you're willing to 100% it. Otherwise, I'd say wait 'till a sale.			"

												A short but enjoyable enough platformer, that definitely has carved out its own personality. The princess' writing-on-the-wall narration is interesting and amusing and gives us plenty of insight into her character, which I did quite like. Unfortunately, the main character is not fleshed out at all, sooo. You got halfway there at least! Gameplay-wise it's pretty solid. Standard running and jumping plus a bomb-throwing ability (with limited bombs of course). As well, you can collect bolts and gears to build machines to aid in your mobility. There's double jump and two other abilities I have not tried out at all, because I love the double jump in this game and how overpowered it is. Seriously, breaks the game entirely. Hard mode adds a bit more challenge to the game, but it's still not that hard to complete (I did so in an hour and a half, which included going back to replay some previous levels for higher scores/rankings. There's also a challenge to complete the entire game without dying (which is easier than it should be, fortunately.) There's replayability here, but even still, wringing the game dry of all its content, I still got 100% in 5 hours of play.I can't compain though, there's not much to knock here besides the price tag. I wouldn't recommend this game at full price but on sale it's certainly worth a look.			"

												A cool, humourous, well animated action/ puzzle platformer which I got as part of Groupee's Bundle in a Box. It looked pretty neat from the screenshots, but I was pleasantly surprised by this charming and extremely addictive little game. You are a prisoner in a tower full of fiendish traps and hilarious graffiti scrawled on the walls. You must descend from top to bottom, trying to die as little as possible, since deaths are tallied up at the end and will affect your score upon level completion. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys 2D platformers!			"

												A short, simple and charming platformer with a nice touch of personality. While we know nothing about our main character, the escaping prisoner. the game is full of notes from his captor, a teenage princess with severe family issues and a knack for building death traps. The wrightin is brilliant: these short notes she left you on the prison walls create a believeable personality with enough depth to empathize with, even though it's her who has put us through the gauntlet of blades and flames. Here is some really nice storytelling without much challenge gameplay-wise.			"

												Freedom Fall is a fun little game. It's only about 2 to 3 hours in length to the finish but there are two possible endings that drastically alter the story, and 8 different ending artworks depending on how you complete it. The notes the princess leaves you are very entertaining to read and it's an interesting way to handle the story. It kept me playing through to the end as I was anxious to figure out just what was going on. The gameplay itself involves descending a tower while taking on various platforming challenges. It can get pretty difficult as you near the end but the game never becomes frustrating. I'd say for the price it's well worth it.			"

												I had my eyes on Freedom Fall for really long time and finally, I managed to get myself this game and played it. I expected only some enjoyable platformer but got something more: story! It's not in form of comic, short movies, in-game scenes or something like that. There is tons of stuff writen on tower. As you play, as you try to beat next element of each of level, you see shorts messages from Princess all over place. This kind of story telling is really fun and fits in platformer game. As for game as platformer, it's really well done - there are easier and harder levels, every each of level have something unique. Also, many levels have few ways you can progress while moving down - hard and harder (there are some easy ones too but only in early stage of game). It's really cool that we have a choice and if you feel like you want to take a more demanding path, you won't be dissapointed. Levels aren't very long but are well designed, graphics aren't really great looking and some animations could be better but somehow everything fits together perfectly.I really enjoyed my time with Freedom Fall and if you love platformer games, you must check it out.

												A solid, charming game about a boy navigating traps in order to reach the bottom of a gigantic tower. Mechanically the game is solid but what takes it over the top for me is the art style and the fun narrative form. There's no cutscenes or plot dumps of any kind. There's only messages on the walls behind you written from the perspective of a sadistic princess who mostly wants to see you die horribly but kinda wants to see how far you can go before you do. The game is great at what it's offering and doesn't overstay its welcome. I'll be sure to look at whatever game Stirfire Studios makes next.			"

												This is a game that i picked up with no expectations. I just wanted a platformer to play.When i started up the game and got through the tutorial, i was blown away by how much fun i was having. It's like a 2D parkour game, with some puzzle elements, by which i mean how to get past obstacles.The art actually looks fairly good. I mean, it isn't spectacular, but it still looks good.The game hardly pulls any cheap stuff, and there is always a clear way to proceed.I would reccomend playing it through first using everything you can use, and then go for the harder modes to get achievements.All in all, i really like this game, and i wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as i did.

												This game is freaking adorable!  It's a fun infinite-death platformer, in the same vein of meatboy, so on that front it's not doing anything new.  The controls are fairly tight and mechanics are sound.  The game is a bit short on content though.  But the place it really shines is the story and characters, both represented entirely from the scribbles on the walls as you progress through each level.  Game devs take note:  this is an excellent example of how to mix story/character development along with enticing the player through the level.EDIT:  I MUST mention that I got this as part of a bundle, so it basically cost me 50 cents.  At that price this is a no-brainer.  However, at $10 it is a bit steep, ONLY due to the short length.  Wait for a sale, and then grab this one.			"

												Great platforming game where instead of the right side of the screen being the objective, it's descending a huge and seemingly endless tower. You're a prisoner who has been let out of your cell and you can receive pardon if you can escape the tower without dying.The game has great visual language in terms of letting you know exactly how you need to jump and fall without dying, and the challenge of course is controlling the character in that way. Which is easier than it sounds of course, because although the controls are really tight, the challenge is in timing and spacing to avoid spikes, fire, and other hazards.I also like all the graffiti written on the walls. This princess isn't your typical cutesy damsel in distress, she's actually sadistically entertained by you and other prisoners who try to get out of the tower alive. Her messages are scrawled all across the levels to mock you and poke fun at you, and there's just something about it that makes you wanna get out of the tower faster so you can kick her in the♥♥♥♥♥♥for being such a snooty ♥♥♥♥♥.In an endearing kid of way of course...Highly recommend it. At the time of this review it is $5 and I would say it is the perfect price for this simple, fun, and challenging game.			"
