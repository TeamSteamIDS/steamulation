												It's a good port! You'll probably want a controller for it.This was by far and away Yuji Naka's best game. It's an early illustration of how games can be art. Naka proved through level design and gameplay you could create a cohesive story with virtually no narrative. Armed only with metaphors and imagery; the story is imparted in a way that no other art form could allow.In my 15 years owning NiGHTS on Saturn; I never realized any of this. It was only when I repurchased this game recently that I started seeing how brilliant the story is. I won't ruin the imagery and the different ways it relates to the overall theme. I will say however that it's a timeless coming of age story. Each and every piece of scenery is a metaphor for growing up. One can quite literally relive different phases of their childhood through this imagery.When I say every piece of scenery, art, gameplay, and level design. I mean it quite literally. It was all designed metaphorically to relate to the process of maturing into an adult. You could write a book about how the art can be interpreted alone.Not only this, but it's so simple anyone can complete the game. Yet so complex you'll never be able to truly master the tracks. If you're a Sonic fan and want a sense of speed. This game gives it to you like no other. By taking away the platforming elements. The developers could focus the gameplay on acrobatic moves and highscoring through high speeds with few obstacles to slow you down.The dynamic/evolving music engine was also quite novel and innovative. By nurturing the nightopians, breading them with the nightmarens, or destroying the nightopians the moods of the creatures would change. Depending on their mood the music would change slightly. This system allows the music to stay fresh and familiar, but never truly repetitive. Being able to interact with the nightopians in such a unique fashion really gave some players a bond with the world of NiGHTS.Edit: Formatting and grammar.			"

												40 hours of playing NiGHTS into Dreams. All I can say is I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! The gameplay may look boring, inane, or weird but if you give it a try, I promise you will love it. If you are a SEGA or Sonic fan, you have no excuse not to purchase it. It should be illegal not to buy it if you adore sonic.NiGHTS will always be my favorite game. I've never had so much fun playing a video game. The soundtrack is just gorgeous. The album version is better! It comes with two alternative songs for each level. The gameplay is difficult to explain, to be honest. Your objective is to collect 20 orbs as fast as you can. With the reminding time, your goal is to gain as much points as possible by flying through hoops without losing your chain. My only comaplains are the boss battles, 6 long levels (around ten minutes long) and locked at 30FPS. In addition, I did not like the boss battles. They may be advance during their time, but I found them ambiguous to beat. However, eventually, you will want to try again and again to beat your scores. NiGHTS has that feeling like playing a Sonic game.It comes with bonus features like the SEGA Saturn version and a remastered christmas theme of Spring Valley.Overall, if you see this game on sale, its a must purchase game. You will love it! My steam friends comments on game:""I really like it actually. I usually dig Sega games, and this one came through. It's very unique! Loved it!""I STILL LOVE THIS GAME TODAY. :D			"

												One of the greatest games of all time. NiGHTS definitely deserves a little more recognition for the beauty and creativity of the game. Controls are easy to learn, and I'll often find myself playing for hours at a time trying to beat my old scores or just releasing steam with a boss run. The characters are colorful, easy to love, and full of personality! This is a feel-good game!I'll be honest, the first time I saw NiGHTS as a young gamer raised on Nintendo consoles, it was in the NiGHTS into Dreams pinball table alongside Sonic in Sonic Pinball Party for the GameBoy Advance. Needless to say, having just recently been introduced to Sonic, and having a mindset that most girls didn't play videogames, NiGHTS appeared to me as SEGA's lady-Sonic character... the feminine colors of pink and purple hadn't always appealed to me.Many years later, revisting some of my older games, I picked up Sonic Pinball again, and I thought to myself: ""I remember the NiGHTS table having something the Sonic one didn't: Bosses! You're older and much more skilled now, so why don't we give this a go?"" After a few practice rounds, I'd cleared my way through all 6 tables, their Nightmaren bosses, and eventually unlocking the secret NiGHTS ""Twin Seeds"" table, which led to my first encounter with (and triumph over) Wizeman the Wicked.I was hooked. I wanted to learn about the REAL NiGHTS. After finding very few videos on Youtube over the original NiGHTS into Dreams, I did my own research, and found the game was available on Steam for just $10. At this point in time, I didn't have a Steam account, nor was I interested in TF2 or Garry's Mod, Counter-Strike, any of these legendary titles I'd seen friends playing in the past.That's right:The whole reason I made a Steam account was for NiGHTS.So the next time you see me on your team in TF2, or the next time you see me post a Garry's Mod animation, you can thank the whimsical dream-jester, and the geniuses who've brought it to life.

												Having been a fan of NiGHTS since its original release back on the Sega Saturn, I can tell you a LOT of love went into this port. In addition to the original game itself, included also is the rare and coveted demo disc Christmas NiGHTS, opening up unlockables and a varient of Spring Valley primarily centered around Christmas (though the theme sometimes changes depending on the holiday/date, such as April Fools, Halloween, summer, Valentines, etc). This alone makes this port worth it to the die-hard fan, but on top of this, you've given the option to switch between the original Sega Saturn graphics, or the graphics of the formally Japan-only PS2 remake.For those of you unfamiliar with this title, you can choose between to play as either Claris or Elliot, two children whom by day struggle to overcome their fears, and by night aid NiGHTS in overthrowing the king of all Nightmare, Wizeman. As you fly through linear circular stages, you'll collect orbs and other goodies, destroying captures that hold Ideya - raw dream energy - that had been stolen from the two children. Its story is left intentionally vague to encourage the player's own imagination to interpret the events. There are also many goodies and easter eggs to be found hidden around, including the curious Nightopian AI (these being creatures that breed, grow, die and can even hybridize with enemies within the level). At the time of its original release this game offered groundbreaking techniques in graphics and gameplay style, giving it its own place in history and recognized by many as an unofficial secondary mascot to Sonic Team.And now for the downside. Unfortunately, the game is incredibly short and can be 100%'d in only a few hours, though the extras help to provide some replay value. Also, while the controls, for the most part, are pretty tight there are areas where NiGHTS becomes difficult to control - particularly areas like the bobsled, mermaid and rail portions from their respective levels.Still, despite those problems, for the price and what it comes with, I would consider it well worth it and highly recommend it to anyone interested in a timeless masterpiece and a piece of gaming history. If you're still unsure, I would say to consider waiting for a sale. Either way, NiGHTS into Dreams is well worth having in your collection.			"

												Game plays very well with an analog controller, You need the XBOX 360 Controller or your out of luck playing with a keyboard it wont work well.  - However I feel that this game is locked at 30 FPS and you cant achieve higher performance even though you have the higher end hardware. The good news though its very smooth and fluid and stays true to the original Sega Saturn game. The only complain that I have is that in Sega Saturn Mode- the game is not a true emulation - its a remake using texture mapping without filtering - nothing more. I guess Saturn Emulation is hard to achieve. While there are many emulators out there they require a high system requirement and even at that you don't get accurate results. Nonetheless though , if you want a trip down memory lane , its here for you , but if you know how to beat the Sega Saturn game, you will finish this in mere moments......			"

												The best £7 I have ever spent, it's up there with the best games I have played. Unique gameplay, awesome music, a story that moves without words and it's just so fun to play.The only downside is that it's rather short at 7 (+2) levels, but I've played for 227 hours and it's still just as great as before. There's also no tutorial so expect to be totally confused when you first start, I certainly was :). A 360 controller is recommended.While you're at it you should buy Journey of Dreams which is almost as awesome as this.			"

The game is rather short if you just want to get to the ending with both characters, but is much longer if you're going for the highest rank in each Dream (including the Christmas Dreams levels), and also to top your own scores each time.

I felt like it was supposed to be a Peter Pan game but maybe that was just me.It takes a little bit of skill and memorization to fully master the game at an ""A"" rank.

AUDIOCharmingVISUALSurrealDIFFICULTYConfusingVIBEBizarreCRAVINGTime-AttackON SALEFrequentlyPROS: Port seems to have very few issues. New textures look very nice, but classic version is available to be played as well. Dream themes go beyond mere trippy visuals and mimic actual facets from thoughts and anxieties. Clearly a projected crafted with much love.CONS: FPS caps at 30, (Not a problem for me but worth mentioning for those who are irritated by things like that) the game itself has very little instruction. If you're unfamiliar with the gameplay for NiGHTS, you're going to be confused. Controller settings reset often for me, I have not figured out why. Control-style and 3D graphics are obviously a bit dated (What did you expect?)WORTH: A bit dated and quick to go on sale, NiGHTS is a purchase best made during a steam sale. Add it to your wishlist and wait for the e-mail.OVERALL: I can see why this game is both cult and classic; it's not very friendly to newcomers and by today's standards, the score-based style gameplay would only appeal to a selective audience. But it's still very fun once you've gotten a grasp on it, as it's lenience for low passing scores allows you to enjoy the story without necessarily being good at it.SCORE:7/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

It also includes some of the content seen in the Christmas Nights into Dreams, the Original Bonus Disc for the Sega Saturn. Even if you already own the Saturn Version of the game (Which I do) or the PS2 Remake (which this HD Port is based off of) don't hesitate to pass this one up! : D It's worth going through this game again!

												I did not grow up with the Saturn (or the Dreamcast), so I was kinda looking  forward to playing this game for the first time. I honestly did not expect much from the gameplay going into it. I committed to getting all the A-ranks and achievements, and I ended up having a lot of fun (and some frustration) doing it. First of all, I was suprised with the game's soundtrack and sound design. I absolutely love the soundtrack and have been listening to it all week. NiGHTS' character design is amazing, and although the 3-D cutscenes are looking dated, I had to remind myself that this game came out in 1996. All things considered, I'm pretty impressed by this game, and there's no denying that the ending, with the credits and the song, definitely put a little tear in my eye. They also included some unlockable goodies (cutscenes, artwork, an interview with the creator, and a different game mode which is mostly a reskin). Aftering experiencing NiGHTS into dreams, I definitely wish I had grown up with this game. If you're into the SEGA style of games or story-telling (like Sonic Adventure stuff), then you might give this one a try.			"

												I didn't even know this game existed until I happened to glance its name on a TV Tropes page, and the only reason I bought it was it was on sale and I'd heard mixed things about it. But then I actually got to playing it. According to various sects of the internet, this game hasn't stood the test of time, and the only fans are nostalgic 90s kids who played the game when they were young kids. So in 2016, as a late teen playing the game for the first time ever, I can safely say this is one of the best games I've ever played. The game's atmosphere is perfect, the gameplay is simple but fun, the levels are very replayable, the soundtrack is great, and the simple but charming narrative tells a story without a single word. And even though the game is kinda short and the character models are a bit... dated, this is still a great game I'd recommend to anybody who wants a more unique experience or a refreshing break from modern gaming cliches.

												I was hesitant to buy this game again because I've played it to death, but I'm glad I did. As soon as the music hits, it brings me right back to sitting in my basement playing this weird game on my Saturn that none of my friends had heard of. There's a lot of memories here. Everything is instantly familiar. Flying is a joy. The time limit provides a satisfying sense of urgency. Overall the gameplay is still just as satisfying as it was years ago.This also reminds me of how much I miss Sonic Team's golden age. I'd kill for a Burning Rangers port, but I won't hold my breath... Either way, I highly recommend this port if you have a strong, nostalgic attachment to pre-third-party SEGA; when all was right with the world.			"

												This is one of those games that you hear about every now and then, and all the buzz about it makes you really curious. You want to try it out, but never had the chance nor time to. But one day, you have some spare cash, and see this game on the home page. You decide to buy it and see if it's as good as people make it out to be...and, oh man, did it blow me away!How do I properly descirbe NiGHTS Into Dreams? Well, it really is just like a dream! The visuals are colourful and imaginitive! The music is nothing short of beautiful! The game controls extremely darn well! And the gameplay is something that, while not everyone's cup of tea, is absolutely fun in my opinion! That's just the basics of the game.The game truly is an experience!I can usually tell that whether or not a game truly is a gem by how often I find myself smiling while playing it, and needless to say, I smiled all the way through this game!If there is one thing that I feel is a bit of a flaw, it's the length. This game is rather short. However...This specific version includes the original game, a graphically remastered version, Christmas NiGHTS, and a ton of unlockables, all of which is only $10. I don't know about you, but all of that for only $10 is quite honestly a steal!So overall, while it might not be for everyone, but for what it is, it does it's job very well. It's a beatiful, imaginative, and just overall fun experience and I am glad to have finally gotten the chance to play it. It's easily one of my favourite games of all time now! I highly recommend NiHTS into Dreams!			"

AboutNiGHTS Into Dreams remains one of the best games from the Sega Saturn. NiGHTS HD recreates the Sega Saturn classic with the addition of a theater mode and art gallery, plus the Christmas NiGHTS extra story.GameplayThe game ultimately boils down to speed runs. There are 7 stages in total and the aim is to rack up the highest score by chaining links, combos and performing acrobatic stunts, all the while collecting dream energy to unlock special dream energy and returning it to the checkpoint. The game can be a little tricky to figure out at first but once you learn the patterns, you will have fun flying through the levels at high speed. My only concern is the controls doesn't quite have the same finese that the original has, but I am using an Xbox360 Controller. I would like to try this game with Steam's own controller.There is also the option to explore the worlds a little and admire their design, however if you take too long the game pushes you to complete the level. This isn't a bad thing as afterall you are in a dreamworld.DesignA game that was developed in 1996 still stands as having some of the most imaginateive landscapes and character designs. Each level is a representation of the characters emotions and the challenges they must overcome in real life, The levels are bright and colourful and you often spot something you never noticed the last time you played the level. After the wonderful dream levels are the darker boss nightmare stages which contrast the adventure levels. The boss levels just feel like a nightmare and give you the sence of dread.The HD textures and character models are really good, and there is an option to play in Saturn mode, with the low poly models. Unfortunately the Saturn mode also reduces the screen to it's original 6:4 format.VerdictWhile the game is excellent, and it has all the charm of it's original. I still find myself wanting to play the original. However, I still highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a quick game to pick up and play a few rounds after coming home from school or work. You are looking at maybe 5 hours worth of Gameplay if you want to get all the achievements,I bought the game at £9.99 and I fully entend to play this game for years to come.			"

												Only two hours in the steam version, but I put hundreds of hours into the game on the Saturn. The game is a huge nostalgia rush for me in every meaning of the word.NiGHTS is a whimsical game about flying through rings, collecting orbs, and comboing up a massive high score, set against a backdrop story of dreams and nightmares, and two children learning about life and growing up and overcomnig fears and challenges in the real world, while defending a dreamscape from the evil 'Wizeman', who is stealing dream eenrgy and hope from sleeping children, causing nightmares and fear. The titular character, NiGHTS, represents the growing maturity and overcoming challenges the children face, as the levels go from lighthearted and bright, to dense night time cities, arid deserts, and cacophanous carnivals. Each stage is concluded by fighting one of the great Nightmare bosses, all of whom have unique ways of fighting them and present their own time attack challenges to affect your score.While the game itself is very short, it can be replayed for score, which is an impresive thing to do that relies on heavy knowledge of all the levels, how to best use the kids at the beginning of the level, and knowing exactly how far you can push extra stage laps to squeeze as much time as possible out of the bonus sections. Every level can also be interacted with in a number of dfferent ways and have various paths you can take through the sublevels. The music will change and alter itself based on how you interact with the non-hostile Nightopian angels, and the Nightmaren monsters around the levels, including breeding them into small hybrids. Nightopians would later go on to become the absis for Chao in the later Sonic Adventure games, as well, giving the system even more longevity.The music is top notch and memorable on every single stage, and the opening and ending songs are songs I can still hum along to by heart even years later with a decade and more gap between the last time I'd heard the song. As a port it's wonderfully done, and the game lets you choose between the original Saturn graphics, or redone HD graphics from a JP-only PS2 port. The game also includes Christmas NiGHTS, which is a tiny essentially demo version of the game set to various holiday themes that, while defaulting to Christmas, while change based on the date clock of your computer for things like Halloween and Apirl Fool's Day.A pure trip through nostalgia, and a wonderful game that deserved much more than just a single sequel on the Wii..

												I find it unfortunate that Sega had flailed about so badly after their glory days of the Sega Genesis, and  I admit to an uncommon difference of opinion that I found Sega much more compelling during its declining days of the Saturn and Dreamcast.  To be sure, the Saturn was ineptly engineered, but it possessed a handful of absolutely beautiful gems that were not to be found anywhere else.  Among them, Nights Into Dreams.The beauty within Nights isn't about any one thing, but the experience taken as a whole.  Gameplay is simple time-trial courses, but the whole ""child's dream land"" themepark combined with the grace of acrobatic flight is positively surreal.  Each of the end stage bosses is its own deviously crafted challenge.  I was ecstatic when Nights first came to Steam, as it brought Nights back from an obscure past of long dead gaming consoles for more people to enjoy.  Understand that for all my gushing -- I had played Nights quite a bit back in the 90s.  These days I find myself with more games than free time (hence my rather low time investment in the Steam version).  However, I remember Nights on Saturn as one of the greatest of classics, and the Steam release is fully worthy of that memory.Nights is not the kind of game that will appeal to everyone.  ""Andrenaline pumped 'this is gonna be epic' Bruce Willis passively sauntering away from fiery-splosive collateral damage"" type of gamers probably should keep on sauntering.  But!  For the gamer that appreciates a great video game much like a museum curator appreciates Vincent Van Gogh -- look no further.			"

												Never in my life have i played something so whimsical. Though now a pretty old game, (roughly around 20 years old now) It was released for the Sega Saturn in 1996, but got a re-release on XBLA, PSN, and Steam in 2012. It looked really ambitious back in the day, and if i grew up with it, I would have loved it even more.The first thing I immediately fell in love with in this game was it's musical score. This is easily one of the soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game. It captures the feel of the game nicely and it really flows together really well, as well as being really catchy, the tune 'Dreams Dreams' will always get stuck in my head.The visuals, I'm sure that 20 years ago it looked quite good, I think they still hold up, not particularly on the looks of the game, but it's imagination, and scale, which compliments the games levels, which are, for the most part 2-D gameplay in a 3-D world. But sometimes the game will like to change it up with other parts of the level. The backgrounds and the entire look of the levels, while may look outdated visually, they look impressive from an artistic standpoint in my opinion.There's a time limit in every level, but the game isn't exactly punishing if you run out of time. This is what i like to call a 'laid back' video game, a game that you can really sit back and relax too. The games controls beautiful with a controller, tho for PC users, the keyboard and mouse are a little wonky, not terrible, but do take time to get use to.If you haven't tried NiGHTS into Dreams yet, then i think you should give it a shot, it's not that expensive, unless you're going out of your way for an original Sega Saturn copy. It's normally around $10 which is a pretty good deal, and it comes with some nice extras if you're going after the HD Re-release. NiGHTS is an experience, one that can't be overlooked.			"

												This has been one of my favourite games since the Saturn, and this version is pretty much the same game with shinier graphics. I haven't had any technical problems with it so far and the controller is smoother to play with than a Saturn controller. NiGHTs is difficult to compare with other games, it is like a platformer but with lots of flashy acrobatic flying around the screen instead of jumping. The system will take a lot of getting used to but after that it's actually quite a simple game to play. It is good for short play sessions, most of the challenge will come from trying to beat your own scores as the process of completing the game is quite easy. The story and world are fun, you are in a dream world being invaded by nightmares, it ranges from chill-out to surreal to faintly creepy. There is no death, only running out of time, but the timing can be very tight and enemies will knock 5 seconds off your 120 second time limit. The music is pretty cool, if a little experimental.			"

												Game created by Sonic Team for SEGA Saturn. You can really feel the matter of speedrunning and going for perfect scores, espacialy when you have limited time. It has both remastered and oldschool version of the game. I prefer remastered one. I might some day try to master it though it's not easy.Pros:- Good game for both casuals (just to pass levels) and hardcores (fully complete);- Sonic fans might like it;- Mechanic at first confusing but later on easy to understand;- Great music.Cons:- Honestly I don't know what's bad in this game... IMO I don't like kids in this game but without them the plot would be in chaos. "

												Another reason why SEGA should still be in the console market. Sonic team alone have made NiGHTS and Billy Hatcher (which also needs a re release) Which are all fantastic games. If you played Journey of Dreams and didn't like it, thats okay - Journey of Dreams was awful. This is different, it's really fast aerial acrobatics with stunning visuals, a fantastic OST and a enough charm to captivate fans for years to come. Get the game, it's a steal.			"

												NiGHTS Into Dreams is a brilliant game that was a relatively large part of my childhood. Playing it in HD with this Steam release is a huge nostalgia trip. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how good people may find it if they never played it in its Sega Saturn heyday.That being said, it's still very quality. In NiGHTS Into Dreams, you control a flying character who is able to manoeuvre themselves up, down, left and right along a preset plane in a 3D level. So the game curves you around and chooses where in the level you go basically, but you can backwards/forwards, etc. (It's sort of hard to explain, I'd recommend watching a YouTube video)The idea is that in a given level, you have to collect 20 ""blue chips"" (glowing orbs) and, once you've done that, activate the ""ideya palace"" (which is this machine-looking thing that acts like a start/finish line). You must do this four times, with the course changing each time you've completed this task. After this, you are teleported to the boss. It is simple in practice, but very hard to master, and its in-game score system goes very well with Steam leaderboards.The music is varied and amazing; it helped shape my current day love for video game music. The visuals are very vibrant and complement the music perfectly, in my opinion.With this Steam port, you are able to fully customise your controls (which are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by default so do that as soon as you get the game), and the game gives you an option to play with the updated HD port or the original Saturn graphics (very big difference).All in all, I'd rate this game a solid 9/10, maybe 8/10 if I try to subtract the nostalgia value it has for me. Before doing anything, I'd recommend you look up a video for it and see what you think.Thanks for reading! Appreciate it.~Swate			"

												NiGHTS into Dreams is a game everyone should play. The levels are filled with beautiful and creative imagery, and each level has it's own distinct features to compliment the core game mechanics. The bosses have very memerable designs and have unique ways of being defeated. For those of you who enjoy story there's not much to be seen here, but I feel the minimalistic approach to the story helps to immerse players into this world of dreams and forge their own stories from the few cutscenes they are presented. I, myself, have a lot of fond memories of this game and feel it still holds up well even compared to more modern games. You even have the option to play with new, updated graphics in a modern screen ratio or go totally old school. It is a bit of a shame that not all the fun ""presents"" from Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams are featured in this version, but you will find certain things change depending on what day it is. ;)I'm glad that after so many years NiGHTS is reborn into the modern world to give a whole new generation of gamers a chance to experience this amazing game. This short, but addicting game will bring you hours of fun, whether you're trying to beat your highscore, top the leaderboards, or just wishing to fly through the sky in a wonderful world of dreams.

												One of the first console games to use an analogue stick controller and did so wonderfully. A Sonic Team and SEGA classic through and through. More than just a port but rather a respectfully remade tribute to the Saturn's answer to Mario 64. You can switch between the original Sega Saturn graphics or play with new models and textures that enhance the visual quality of the game without changing the artistic direction. This game is fast, bursting with vibrant color and catchy music that you'll never forget. My only complaint is that the game only runs the at the console's original speed of 30 frames per second. If you grew up in the golden age of gaming then NiGHTs Into Dreams should be in your collection.			"

												This game is MASTERPIECE!I enjoyed playing it so much! It is short and very good, it has both Sega Saturn version and Brand New HD version. And I played them both! ^_^ NiGHTS is one of those games that can really take you away in a world of dreams! And while I was playing it was always making me feel so nostalgic about my own childhood regardless I didn't have this game when I was a kid, sadly... The soundtrack is amazing!For the first time you can think that this game is very easy till you finish all locations and there is no final boss, then you realize you had to work harder on your ranks! :D So it can take some time.No regrets I spent 11 hours on this game.Honestly this game is flawless for me. Regardless that it is old I got what I really wanted, what I really needed. Thanks SEGA so much!			"

												One of those ports that don't get downloaded as often as you might expect. This game is pretty good, and while I wasn't even alive at the time the original game was released, I think this is an excellent game SEGA needs to give attention to. I really hope that Journey of Dreams comes to Steam as well. For the people that played Sonic games since the Classic/Dreamcast era, this is the perfect nostalgia core. You'd expect something like a Sonic Generations in a Sonic fan's Steam profile, but not NiGHTS into Dreams. This game isn't known much, and if you were to say 'Sonic the Hedgehog' to public, almost anyone would at least realize what you mean, or at least what Sonic looks like. The same cannot be said for our beloved jester NiGHTS. NiGHTS had 2 of their own games, and a few cameos and appearances in some Sonic games. I really wish SEGA would make another NiGHTS game, maybe one that even has Sonic in it.Anyways, I recommend this game to anyone who loves imagination, Sonic games, and games where your character flies freely around the stage.

												I honestly only bought the game so that I could relive my childhood. One of the most frustrating and nostalgic experiences. I remember reading the guide that was in a gamer magazine to tell me how to beat one of the bosses. The idea of being in a dream world with a vibrant and rich world and lively characters fascinated me along with the idea of a novel Sega game that wasn't sonic (don't get me wrong, I love sonic, but this was a nice breath of fresh air). And let me tell ya how much BETTER it is to play with the graphics being more solid as opposed to the Sega Saturn! (which I still have with the original NiGhts into Dreams. And I didn't have the analog controller, so it was freaking hard. So is playing on a keyboard.)So yeah, really only thing this can offer me is nostalgia.			"

												If you grew up with this game, this is a good conversion (though a controller is a must) and the HD graphics mode offers a nice, if subtle upgrade to the original graphics. However, like most of Sega's early 3D games (Virtua Fighter excluded), it was somewhat lacking in polish to begin with and as such hasn't stood the test of time well. I have a lot more respect for the team that did Journey of Dreams after revisiting this than I did before because, while that game failed spectacularly, the original NiGHTS didn't exactly give them a lot to work with. A lot of the reason why Journey of Dreams was bad is that NiGHTS itself, by modern standards, isn't very good.I'm giving this a recommend, but that only applies if you're already familiar with the game and would like to play it again without dealing with old hardware. On that level, this succeeds abundantly, and I hope Sega will continue to do re-releases of their older games. But if you're not already a fan of NiGHTS, this is a skip. It's a product of a bygone era of gaming, and a company that was struggling to find its identity in a changing industry, and it shows. NiGHTS was clever and beautiful for its time, but now it mostly seems counterintuitive and dated.			"

												i still have the saturn version and controler and this is a good port and emulation.  you also get christmas nights but it dont work as cool as the real thing on saturn.    but you can run the game at insane res so everything looks good you also get the ps2 remake.   any controler you use is not as good as the real saturn 3d controler though there is something wrong with the dead zone in the center so it is not as precise on fine movements and tricks.  this is basic a port of the xbox 360 and ps3 versions of the port of the saturn and ps2 remake.  i played this port of nights mostly on the xbox 360 the pc version is the same other than the obvious pc hardware improvements higher than 720p/1080p res gpu filters ETCthe A-life system seems to have been changed for the emulation and port job.  in the saturn another fille on the system flash ram was made that kept track of what you did to the nightopians and their AI in the game I dont think this one does it in the exact same way.ALSO if you do not have a analog stick controler of some type this game is almost not playable there is a reason it was bundled with a special controler on the saturn. if you plan on useing a keyboard forget about it a lot of special tricks and harder courses will be 99.9% impossible with digital controls.

												NiGHTs into dreams is a port of the classic SEGA Saturn gem from 1996. The goal is simple and requires capturing stolen Ideya by collecting at least 20 blue orbs and destroing the capsules. The sooner you destroy the capsule, the more time you have to collect more points before the time runs out. Once you've collected all four Ideya, NiGHTs is warped into a boss battle. There are four stages for the two characters, Claris & Elliot. The fourth stage for each character, Twin Seeds is the same and in order to unlock it you need at least all C's on previous stages. The game is short, but sweet. However, it can be a real challenge to get all A's on the stages, which is required to unlock the Christmas NiGHTs. SEGA has given the game a nice HD improvement, thus boosting more colorful and vivid visuals than the Saturn version. You can play the game in two modes, HD & Saturn. The keyboard controls for this game can take some adjusting and I would reccomend getting a Xbox 360 controller since this game was really meant to be played with a controller. This is indeed a good port of a very good game, probably Sonic Team's only masterpiece. Truely a gem.			"

There are two game modes ""Sega Saturn Dreams"" and ""Brand New Dreams""  From what I can tell, Sega Saturn Dreams is just that -- Full Saturn Port.. No high-res graphics.. But!Brand New Dreams Fixes all of that, fresh new graphics, full 1080p support WIth at least the first level being almost exactly the same, but better!

												Very fun game. I always wanted to try a Nights game out because I have always been a fan of the sonic games. On to the review.Nights Into Dreams will no doubt give you a game that you've never played before. You (like me) may have thought the idea of just flying through hoops is boring, but this is by far one of the most original games I have ever played. It reminds me of the days where Sega was one of Nintendo's greatest competitors, and this title definitely compares to the quality of fun you would find in any Nintendo game.The boss battles are interesting, though this game is sort of played in a trial and error style, since I don't recall the boss battles ever having been explained. You sort of have to figure it out, and since the boss battles are timed, any moment you spend trying to figure out how to face the boss is time you lose harming the boss, which may cause you to have to repeat the stage all over again.If I could find any flaw in this game, that would be it.So in summary:Pros:*Original Ideas            (very unlike any game you've played before)*Nostalgic                   (the original sega saturn version is also included with the game, along as an HD remake)*Immersive                 (Every level is timed, including the boss battles so the entire time you are playing you are trying to                  collect as many things, to break other things, to get to the boss battle and complete the level. *Your parents might enjoy it as well, even if they don't usually play games. (My mom does)*Unpredictable         (this game may seem like a 2D game at first glance, but there are times where you can run around in circles, jump, or fly in directions that you never expected to be there. This game may seem very new every time you play it.Cons:Better played on a gamepad with an analog stick, but the game is definetely enjoyable by just using the keyboard. "

												I can see from the other reviews that many of you can't figure out what to do. I don't really blame you because the game doesn't directly explain it. You have to collect at least 20 of the small blue orbs to destroy the large blue orb, then go to the gazebo looking thing to advance to the next part of the level. The stars and rings and such are all for points.This game is extremely fun once you figure out what you're doing. If you're in the right mood, it can even be a magical experience. It's easy to see why it became a cult classic.The remastered graphics in ""Brand New Dreams"" look great, but even the original Sega Saturn graphics hold up surprisingly well.The only complaint I have with this game is that it's very short and easy, but leaderboards and achievements give it replay value.

												This is a very fun game... for me. This is not a bad game at all. If you missed out because you had the commen sense as a kid not to buy a SEGA Saturn, or do not live in Japan so you could not easily obtain the PS2 version of this game released in 2008, then YAY here it is. This game is short to say the leas of it. If you are good at the game or just pick up things fast then this may at best take you 2 hours to complete the game. There is a lot of replay value in it though. Note the fact that the Sega Saturn version of the game mod you can paly is not like the actual SEGA Saturn version though. Simmilar, but frame rate differences and draw distances are not the same. The Saturn version to me is easeir to play. the graphics are nice and pritty for what it is. I own both NiGHTS into Dream and Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams so I know the differences. Sadly I can say much about the PS2 version, which this is for the most part an exact port of. The A-life system is fun to mess around with adding in the content from Christmas NiGHTS that tells you the status of your winged baby freaks.(NiGHTOPIANS) To be honest it is worth checking out, just be aware it is on rails when you are NiGHTS. Also they cut Multi player and Sonic into Dreams so that kind of sucks, but still.			"

												Ahh, NiGHTS. The instant I entered this dream, I was hooked, I became an instant fan of this flying purple jester. I have discovered this game a little later in my life, so I'm pretty much jealous of the guys who actually GREW up with this game. Must've been a magical experience for you all...Anyway, my thoughts for this game. Played the Sega Saturn version of this game (on an emulator, at least), and it's controls are simple enough. At least two buttons to drill dash and two more buttons to do some tricks. With that, you're all set for a flying adventure that will make you dizzy and your fingers aching the first time!Now what can I say about this port? It's everything I envision in its HD remake: smoother models, better resolution, HQ textures, and an actual main menu! The controls are also optimized well for PC gaming, and that's well appreciated. The music? Still as good as ever! NiGHTS music really has this certain thing to it that distinguishes it perfectly from Sonic's musical scores (which is just as good, btw). I still listen to it from time to time and it really is a great music for daydreaming :PThe story? Unlike its sequel, the story really is a bit hard to catch since we're only given a few cutscenes explaining how Elliot and Claris ended up in the night dimension, and I get that each stage and bosses means something storywise, but it's always not easy to understand.The bossfights? Creative! Each level has its boss, and each one has a different tactic required to beat them. My personal favorite is Reala's, because it's straightforward; no timing, no patterns, just aerial acrobatic action! After a while though, it's gonna get repetitive, so savor the awesome feeling you get in the bossfights while you still can!Overall I give this game a 9/10 - you must try this at least once in your life! It's a good game, and one that will help you remember what being a child is like, should you forget.			"

												What a breakthrough year 1996 was for three-dimensional gaming. The most popular titles left and right reveled in this new format, from ""Tomb Raider"" to ""Quake"" to ""Super Mario 64"", to what would be Sega's best game since ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2"".""NiGHTS Into Dreams"", with its years of reputation as a cult classic, is the most exhilirating and structured 3D effort in the Sega library. It really does make sense that Sonic Team would be the ones to create this game, because it translates every last good detail about the Sonic games into 3D. What this game nails most of all is the sense of how dynamic speed becomes its own experience as you play. The faster you zoom through each level's circuits, doing more and more things while your score climbs into the tens of thousands and upwards, the more it's revealed how the game uses 3D to create a space for all this action. By placing the focus on score-attacking, the 3D spacing of ""NiGHTS Into Dreams"" allows every movement and press of the action buttons to build into a chain of arcade-style accomplishments. It's less vast than other games from 1996, and most of Sega's 3D forays after this game, but it's leaner than any of them.The fantasy setting of this game, about two kids uniting with a friendly creature to fly through a dreamscape, grows out of its structure. It's used nicely, and the pop-psychology themes about courage and the subconscious become one big stocking stuffer to go with everything else in the game. This Steam version is a bigger stocking than the original game, with bonus content and the option between PS2-quality and Saturn-quality graphics, and the main game is just as great.			"

												A charming and beautiful updated classic for those who are willing to give something a little different a try.  Let me address some of the complaints;  First off, yes the game creators didn't quite make the objectives entirely clear (There were no ""in-game tutorials"" in 1996!) so I would reccomend hitting up any of the player guides available online,  it's not rocket science, and it will open up a really worthwhile experience.Secondly, the game DOES in fact support native plug-n-play controller support.  Again, this may not be obvious to the unintitated, but if you left-click the game title in your Steam library, it will bring up a Menu.  Select ""Game Configuration"" and presto, you can activate your in-game controller.   I personally find the Xbox 360/One controller work admirably for this game.  With some of the fundamental complaints out of the way, let me heap a little more praise on this game;  It's memorable, unique, and charming in a way that gamers usually only find in a Miyamoto developed title.  A true classic, and it makes me wish Sega would invest a little more effort in updating it's back-catalog of similar gems.			"

												(Update - Turns out you can change to fullscreen AND enable controller support. Simply right click on the game in your Steam library and go to Game Configuration. All changes are made there instead of in-game. In my defense, the game does nothing to explain that this is how you change these settings, but at least the options are there. So please disregard the majority of my gripes in the following review. This version of the game is perfectly fine and I highly recommend it.) Oh dear, if I hadn't gotten this at an amazingly low price from Humble Bundle, I would be a great deal more irritated right now. I'll start by saying that Nights into Dreams is a great game. No denying that. The main character, music, and graphics are all delightful, and there's a great deal of replayability by learning the courses and memorizing the most effective paths. Aside from the camera being a little too zoomed in which makes it hard to see your surroundings, I could see myself putting some legit time into this game. Unfortunately though, not this version...First, the biggest red flag. No controller support. This boggles my mind in so many ways. You'd be hard pressed to find a game on Steam that doesn't work with a standard Xbox controller. Maybe some that don't work with third party controllers, but generally Xbox is good to go with no problem. Not this game. Nights feels like it was DESIGNED to be played with an analog stick. Not this cumbersom WSAD format. Also it uses the J and U buttons to spin, which I found less than comfortable. So I at least expected to be able to rebind the keys, but you can't even do that. You can't use a controller, and you can't rebind the keys. This version of Nights will be played the way it wants you to play it. A second big gripe for me, no fullscreen mode. Man, never before has a lack of such basic options felt so restrictive and distracting. One thing I can commend the game on is that it offers a How to Play guide in the options menu. I was prepared to complain about a bit of a learning curve for new players since nothing is explained when you start the game. But this How to Play guide takes care of that issue thankfully. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this version of Nights into Dreams. Should the developers patch in these basic functionality options, then I can recommend it no problem. Until then, get it on PSN or Xbox Live.			"

I used to just like running the pretty fields in human mode until the clock caught me XDMusic - Amazing (Check it out on youtube at the very least)Graphics - Classic Saturn graphics, so nothing modern reallyGameplay - Awesome, with two different sets of levels to playMemories - Priceless			"

												Every night, all human dreams are played out in the two parts of the dream world - Nightopia and Nightmare. In Nightopia, distinct aspects of dreamers' personalities are represented by luminous colored spheres known as Ideya. However, the evil ruler of Nightmare, Wizeman the Wicked, is stealing this dream energy from sleeping visitors, in order to gather power to take control of Nightopia and eventually the real world. To achieve this, he creates numerous beings called Nightmaren, including two acrobatic jester-like, flight-capable beings called NiGHTS and Reala. NiGHTS rebels against Wizeman's plans, and is punished by being imprisoned inside an Ideya Palace, a gazebo-like container for dreamers' Ideya. One day, Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair, children from the city of Twin Seeds, go through failures. Elliot likes to play basketball, but is challenged by kids from another grade and loses. Claris wants to sing in a play but is overcome by stage-fright in front of the judges. That night, the two of them arrive in the dreamworld and suffer nightmares about these incidents. They escape into Nightopia and find that they each possess the rare red Ideya of courage, the only type Wizeman cannot steal. They release NiGHTS, who tells them about dreams, Wizeman and his plans, and the three begin a journey to stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia. NiGHTS into Dreams... is split into seven levels or ""Dreams"", each divided further into four ""Mares"" and a boss battle. The levels are distributed equally between the two child characters; three are unique to Claris, three to Elliot, and each play through an identical final seventh level, ""Twin Seeds"". Initially, only Claris' Spring Valley and Elliot's Splash Garden are available, and successful completion of one of these unlocks the next level in that child's path. Previously completed stages may be revisited to improve the player's high scores; a ""C"" grade in all the selected child's levels must be achieved to unlock the relevant Twin Seeds dream for that character.Various acrobatic maneuvers can be performed, including the ""Paraloop"". Flying around in a complete circle causes any items within the loop to be attracted towards NiGHTS. The game features a combo system known as ""Linking"", actions such as collecting items and flying through rings are worth more points when performed in quick succession than they are individually. After completing the four Mares, you're transported to Nightmare to confront one of Wizeman's Nightmarens, and you have two minutes to defeat the boss, the time taken contributing to your total score for that Dream. After defeating each boss you can play a level again, and choose via the menu which boss to fight. The game keeps track of the moods of the Nightopians (harming them will displease them, for example), and it features an evolving music engine, allowing tempo, pitch, and melody to alter depending on the state of Nightopians within the level. Combining original graphics and gameplay with beautiful soundtrack and atmosphere, Nights into Dreams... is considered by many the best Sega Saturn game, as well as one of the best games ever made.

												A mediocore port of a spectacular set of games.  This set includes the Sega Saturn Nights into Dreams, the Japan only PS2 update of the game, and Christmas Nights, the festive pseudo sequel.  The graphics are quite good, even the older version, but with the updates it looks excellent, giving a dreamlike visual to a beautiful world.  The music is excellent, suitably cheerful most of the time, but apprehensive when fighting the bosses and above all else, ethereal, dreamy, and very appropriate.I am a bit biased, I love Nights, I admit, however we do need to talk about the controls.  The original had the Sega Saturn controller with a special analog stick offering unparalleled freedom and maneuverability with Nights, our main character.  The Steam version uses...the keyboard.  Good god...it is very clunky and to my knowledge, the game does not support the use of a control pad.  However, if you have a logitech controller, you can map the keys to the control pad, which is HIGHLY recommended.  Otherwise, the controls are a chore for such a beautiful, stellar game.  With a controller, while not as good as on the Saturn, it is...enjoyable enough.Do I recommend you get this package?  Well, the Saturn version controls better, but for the price, convenience, and the graphical updates, I must recommend you pick this up...just be sure you have a logitech controller to map the controls to it, otherwise you may not enjoy the game as much as you should.  Nights is a classic that should not be missed, just be prepared to tangle with the controls.It is a great amount of content for the price.			"

												I always heard this game mentioned as one of the best games on Saturn... so I see it's released and I think ""Hell, I'll give it a shot"".  Lesson Learned: Never listen to someone with Nostalgia Goggles on.   They're seeing the awesome time they had with the game when they were 9 years old or whatever, and you're not 9 years old and this isn't 1996.  If you're desperate to try this game, wait for it to go on sale at least.   I don't think it really was worth $10 :(			"

												*Rose-tinted glasses not included. I remember as a kid going to local Toys r Us toy store and playing the SEGA Saturn demo kiosk for what seemed liked hours. It was either the pitter patter of Sonic R or the mystical trance of NiGHTS. Those days, those times, that dumb young me? Amazing and hypnotizing stuff that has it's place in game design history. But ol' Father Time did a number on my whimsical memories of the game. While the port is plenty fine technically the game just isn't all its been built up as these past decades. Sometimes cult classics are best left as fond memories. I was happy to have the chance to revisit the game from my past but it simply wasn't a rewarding or fun experience. The game boils down to spamming the A button for 90% of regular levels. The boss battles bring something to the table at least. But aren't very intuitive if you've never played games from the past or grew up on them. I just didn't find it fun and I more or less beat the game out of spite which was mercifully a mere 2.4hrs (only challenge left after the story would be 'A' ranks on each level). Sure its nice to finally say 20 some odd years later that I did beat it, but I kind of wish I never came back and still had those rose-tinted glasses on with the fond memories. Which all makes me hesitate to even recommend it to fans of the game. And I really can't recommend this game to somebody who would need to be scouring the reviews for information on the game. The price is right if you're feeling frisky. No recommendation here though.			"

												Had to tinker with my Nvidia settings to get it to work from the black screen but it is working 100% now and bringing back all that awesome sega saturn child hood nostalgia.. Definitely a must play and definitely get a controller for it.. The dual shock styles of modern controllers make it nice and easy... almost like the orginal NiGhts saturn controller. Bet you cant get 105 links on one circuit!			"

												I'm shocked to say this, but I don't recommend this game. The whole feel of the game is sadly unintuitive and confusing. The goal of each of the stages is to free four orbs from these alien orb holder things on four different preset planes (one for each orb) that guide you around the same environment. While you fly around to find these aliens, you need to gain meter to be able to fight the aliens. You gain meter by flying through rings, defeating smaller enemies, and getting combos. The problem is your camera is very restrictive and it's very difficult to see where else you could be to get more rings, and you'll often complete levels with poor ratings and have no idea how to possibly improve. If you run out of time in these stages, you will no longer be NiGHTS and are stuck as a kid who can't fly and you'll be forced to stumble through an environment that was obviously not built to be walked through; and the time limits are not forgiving at all. Nothing is communicated to you besides randomized loading screen hints and it's likely that you'll be confused how to play when you boot up the game. You're just kinda thrown into the first level and then your orbs get taken away. The bosses are also pretty flawed. If you fail the boss, you have to do the previous stage from the beginning. The bosses have even less forgiving time limits because finding out how to beat them on your first way through is a crapshoot. Here's a dragon. Here's two minutes. Here's no visual clues on what to do. Good luck. (you have to fly at the dragon's face... in what game do you just fly at the oncoming monster and not wait for the dragon to stumble or a weapon to spawn.. come on man). Time limits are way too short.I owned the Wii sequel and had fun with it a long time ago, I'm not sure why it is I find this game to be inferior when basically everyone disagrees. The music in this one is charming and the character is nice, but I'm just frustrated with this.			"

												No controller support is a serious deal-breaker here. I can not stress enough how uncomfortable this game is to play with WASD. I know, I know, some people are going to say, ""just map the keys to the controller with Xpadder."" But I shouldn't have to. It's as if nobody at SEGA took a couple of minutes to try playing the first level of the game with the keyboard to see how terrible it is playing with a keyboard. My whole left hand was cramped within minutes.Of course, if you get your controller set up, there's a fantastic game here. This is an undeniable classic from SEGA. A whole world of fun. It's a very simple game that anyone can pick up and play.  "

												I had never played NiGHTS before today, so I didn't have any nostalgia factor.  I tried the upgraded version first and was blown away: why would anybody make a flying game that you view from the side?  After giving it a fair shot, I decided that it was awful.  I came back here to give it a review, and saw how many people truly loved this game.  Just to see what I was missing, I booted back up and tried the Sega Saturn version... LIGHT YEARS BETTER.  It replaced some 3d graphics with 2d versions, changed the control scheme a bit, and made a fiew other tweaks that really made me see why so many folks enjoy this.It's still not my cup of tea.  I cant really reccomend this, but if you get it: for the love of god play the original Saturn version.			"

												As much as it pains me as an original owner of Nights (Sega Saturn was my favorite system of that gen) I can't recommend this game to noobs. Not because it wasn't fun, but because it hasn't aged well and Sega made no effort to upgrade it. Not much is different from what you can find in games now with analog control and free roaming. It feels alot like modern games since it was at the beginning of modern games, but it's just not as good. The world isn't really open and the models and textures suck. In this golden age of gaming, where casual games you can play in short burts are becoming the new AAA all they would have had to do is upgrade the graphics--some ugly models and textures. Don't let old hardware limitations ruin a lasting experience and lasting long-tail revenues.Secrets of Rætikon actually reminded me of Nights, because of it's beauty and controls, it hit me like playing Nights for the first time did, but it was new. Nostalgia alone just doesn't get it sometimes. Sega may have got my money, but for people like me who always wanted this game back, just skip it and wait for the new indies to release games that actually have more content, better grahics, and some just as good of designs and gamplay as what used to be $40-50+ games.

												There are many reviews which comment on this being a strange game and that I will agree with. The actual objectives are: get 20 blue orbs, hit weird snow globe thing, get back to start, repeat 4x. After that you get a boss which is essentially a puzzle of ""how do I defeat this?"" They seem to be rather short.How you play is even strager. You actually only move on 1 plane at a time (up, down, left, right). There are set paths sometimes which you can branch on to be on a different plane, but it's not just open. You can fly, so it's not really a platformer. But it still feels a lot like Sonic but with many less enemies and no challenge to the actual stage.It is very colorful with decent variety to the very small amount of distinct stages which is nice.But in the end, I didn't find this fun. I never exactly felt challenged. There is essentially no story (you can read it as part of the ""How to Play"" menu if you'd like, but I almost immediately forgot it since it doesn't actually feel like it is anywhere in the game). Without story, the gameplay has to carry it. And the gameplay isn't fun to me.If you do just want an arcade-y point grabbing experience with pretty good music and interesting visuals, you could do much worse. If you want a game where your actions feel like there is a point or that points don't actually provide happiness, go somewhere else.			"

												This is a score attack game with some boss battles at the end of each set of courses. I couldn't endure the experience long enough to get very far because I did not find it enjoyable at all. You fly around, collecting things, doing some variety of tricks, and generally don't have any idea of what's happening unless you've somehow managed to play it a lot. Everything requires a lot of guessing, especially the boss battles, because there's little to no feedback if you're doing something right.Each course becomes increasingly difficult, and it's not just due to the layout or design, it's because it's hard to control your character. Turning is a problem because you have a wide turning radius, so be prepared to collide with things and generally miss your targets. I had a huge problem with the loose controls.Don't buy this unless you have a case of the nostalgia.			"

												After all this time, NiGHTS into Dreams remains a unique action cult classic, with a strong arcade influence. The non-pervasive cutscenes may be heavily dated and rather cheesy, but fans of score-based action games will find a lot to enjoy here.Initially, the colour schemes may cause confusion while reading the levels, and there's no helpful tutorial to introduce you to controls or goals, but once you've discovered how the scoring system works, and have adjusted to the visuals, the game can provide hours of fun. You've got the option of Saturn graphics or ""HD"" graphics, and I'd recommend the latter, particularly if you're playing on larger screens. While the game does have intro and outro videos, there's no real narrative interrupting the play either; NiGHTS is a game you can pick up and play for short or extended periods of time depending on what fits your mood.The HD release includes Winter NiGHTS into Dreams (i.e. Christmas NiGHTS) too. Fans may get an extra dose of enjoyment from playing Splash Gardens, decked out in a Christmas theme, listening to Jingle Bells as they play. Other additions include a gallery of unlockable art work and photos.			"

Then I suggest playing NiGHTS into Dreams... as Yuji Naka and Sonic Team made such a beautiful 3d/2d game from Sega's Saturn days in HD. Fly with NiGHTS in Elliot's or Claris's Dreams. It is one of those games that did deserve a sequel but the one it got could of done better but NiGHTS is one of those games that is more for relaxing or casual gamers. I wasn't dissapointed with this at all, besides, if you get a great score after each level you will be at the top while Sonic is second to you on the scoreboard. Speed doesn't always win.			"

												I enjoyed this game quite a bit, especially the bosses. I like the fact that every boss was unique and interesting to fight. The levels themselves are okay, but don't give a lot of reason to replay outside of trying to achieve the highest score (and trying to unlock Christmas NIGHTS, which is really just a reskin of the first couple levels). You don't really get anything for achieving the highest score in every level as far as I can tell, just bragging rights to the very few who care. You could also replay the levels because you enjoy them, but who does that anymore? ;)All in all, I'd say the game is good. Maybe not the best, and probably average to others, but I liked it.			"

												This is, hands down, the best game i have played in my entire life. The first time i played it was on my Sega Saturn when i was like 6 or 7 years old. And since then it has been my absolute favorite game. Feeling down or irritated? Maybe your day hasn't treated you very good? Well if you play this game i can guarantee you that you will feel uplifted and happy. It's like drugs in game form but without side effects!Basically the game tells a story about two kids learning to believe in themselves and their abilities by being visited by the dream demon Nights while sleeping. Through these dreams they are also brought together eventually in real life too.I have played through this game countless times on different platforms. First the Sega Saturn, then the PS2, and now it's also on the PS3, 360 and recently here on steam as well. It's like a dream coming true to play this game in Full HD.Buy it. Now. It's not even as expensive as it should be.			"

												One of the most unique titles you will ever find. Controlling Nights in this game is amazing. With the graphics upgrade (the Saturn version was awesome, but hard to look at) it's a no brainer purchase. You will always look for ways to push for that higher score. The fat opera singer Boss is one of the most memorable moments in gaming for me. Would recommend this game to anyone who appreciates a unique challenge.			"

												""I consider the Sega Saturn to be a gem of a console. And this game is one of those pieces from that gem.""In the game you pick from either the boy or girl character, but what you're playing is a dream essence called NIGHTS who flies around obstacles in your dream-world while collecting random items, to then move onto the boss battle at the end of each level. Just don't take too long or else time will run out and you could wake up from your dream, then its game over.For a game that came from the same team behind the original Sonic The Hedgehog, NIGHTS Into Dreams is a delightful experience and a really good stress-reliever to play. Visually it's very bright and colourful with lots of unusual textures to make the gameplay feel like you're flying around in a whole new world!My only issue with the game is because there hasn't been too many sequels, this game does feel a little aged...Whenever I play this game, no matter what system, it feels like I'm playing a game from 1997. But that doesn’t ultimately make the game bad! I still think it’s worth checking out if you have never played this game before.Definitely a Sega Classic and one to try if you're a huge Sega Fanboy! ;)			"

Part racing game, part platformer, and bursting with the kind of bright colors I thought were illegal in games these days NiGHTS takes your deams of flying and puts them through the filter of SEGA at the top of their game. Plus my 3rd party controller works perfectly without any configuration, which is always a plus.			"

												The first thing I learned about NiGHTS when I first played it is that it is virtually impossible to explain what it is through text or even videos. It is just so far from anything else out there that there's no base to compare it to. The reviews and gameplay videos I'd watched beforehand had done little to give me a mental image of what it actually is, so it was still largely a mystery to me when I finally got to try it.My best attempt at an explanation is as follows: it's an arcade-style pseudo-platformer which revolves around semi-free flight through a 3D environment on a shifting 2D plane. You collect floating orbs with the goal of gathering 20 of them as quickly as possible, which allows you to break open a bigger glass orb once you find it and enter a bonus mode in which you try to collect as much stuff as you can and return to the start (the 2D path forms a convoluted loop) before the timer runs out. Each time you do this, the 2D path which you travel along will shift to incorporate different parts of the 3D world. After completing 4 such paths, you leave the main world to fight a boss; the faster you defeat the boss, the more your score will be multiplied, and the better your letter grade for the world will be (with one of the game's 100%-completion goals being landing the A rank on every level - which is no easy task!).Recommended if you're looking for a break from the norm that won't be a huge time-consumer. That said, it might be good to wait for a sale, as for all the incredible uniqueness it offers, it is sadly quite short with only six normal levels and a seventh shorter level.			"

												I  was one of those weird kids that owned a Saturn, and NiGHTS was one of my favorite games. It wasn't a game that a lot of people ""got."" But I loved it. It's like a racing game, where you constantly want to replay to improve your performance. I'm excited about having Steam based leaderboards because my scores on the Saturn were huge. I'm hoping once I shake off the rust I can top the Steam leaderboards.This is also a terrific port. Assets have been cleaned up or redone to look better at higher resolutions. Although it's very misleading that the the game is split into ""Brand New Dreams"" and ""Sega Saturn Dreams."" The 'dreams' (levels) are the same in both, it's just the ""brand new"" one has imrpoved art assets.But you can tell the people who did the port put care into it. When you beat the game it says ""Dedicated to the players and createors of the original NiGHTS."" Now Sega just needs to do this with their other Saturn classics. Panzer Dragoon Saga anyone?			"

												This is possibly the best of Sega's ports so far from a technical point of view. Everything about it just works, and I haven't heard about other people having problems with it like with the other ones. The visual enhancements are pretty well done for the most part too. It still looks like the same game, just cleaner and clearer. Flying around in the levels still feels wonderful and has aged surprisingly well. Looping and zooming around, whether to collect items, go through rings, or for fun/no reason at all, just feels right in a way most games don't seem to understand. Unfortunately the boss battles are still often frustrating, with a complete lack of highlighting or even hinting at what you should be doing in some of them and camera angles straight out of the mid-90s. Come for the flying in the normal levels; throw your controller at the wall and uninstall the game after one too many boss fights.			"

												This is....One of those games. It never says a word, nor does it ever have anything in game to explain the story in full outside of what you see and play. It never holds your hand, nor does it ever make it's ever incresing challanges easier. It has no 'super-guide' nor diffaculty setting ether in case you get stuck. It also only ever presents the play 7 stages in total making it a very 'short' single play experance.Yet because of all of that, it is chances are one of the best games ever made in all time. It's got a MASS of hidden depth and secrets for the player to poke at and find, it offers a fast pace gaming style even Sonic would blush at, all while presenting a world so colorful and vivid that it would be sucessior couldn't even mimic. It's story is presented in such a way that, while no one ever says anything, you still understand what's going on, what these two kids are struggling with, and how NiGHT's is trying to help them with such before even they need the assistance of the kids in the end. It's wimsyical, magical, and perhaps given just a bit more prase then it's fully worth. Yet I think if you really talk towards anyone who played this game in any fashion, more less played it yourself, you might too understand just what got birthed doing a time when gaming was in it's true 'golden age'.

												This underrated gem (although anything released on the Saturn was bound to be forgotten) receives a PC refurbishment adding fresh visuals to an already aesthetically pleasing game. Levels are designed in such a way that makes playing both casually or hardcore fun. Basic controls are simple to get one's head around; it's implementing tricks and well-timed flight paths into your run that adds complexity. Both the characters, bosses and scenery are beautifully crafted and the accompanying soundtrack of Sega's usual calibre create an outstanding overall experience. However, controlling with a keyboard can be awkward (Xbox controller is recommended) and this remake lacks some original features such as the date-oriented bonuses and almost all of Christmas Nights, subtracting partially from the enjoyability. Not perfect, but certainly up there, and one of Sega's best games to date.			"

												This is one of Sega's gems, and certainly one of the Saturn's best games.  The PC version is almost identical, which means don't expect next-gen graphics.  This game was originally written for a 32-bit machine, and the PC port shows its age.  However, this is still a ""must play"" game.  Totally original, bright, colorful, and a blast to play.  Older gamers will ""get it"" right away, but younger players may try to play it like an adventure game...  it's not an adventure game.  It's actually like a race against the clock to rack up as many points as you can while flying around a 3-D ""track.""  Once you've collected and deposited 20 blue Ideya orbs, they'll turn gold and you will want to use the remaining time to collect as many gold Ideya orbs as possible.  This will ensure high scores.  Each world has about 4 different tracks, and you'll be judged A, B, C, D, or F according to your score.  Then you'll face a boss, and each one has a different weakness.  Sometimes it's difficult to determine what you're supposed to do to defeat them.  This game actually would've been right at home in the arcade, in my opinion.  It's wonderful, and every gamer should give it a try.  (It was created by Sega's famed Sonic Team & Yuji Naka, the creator of Sonic The Hedgehog...) "

Then I suggest playing NiGHTS into Dreams... as Yuji Naka and Sonic Team made such a beautiful 3d/2d game from Sega's Saturn days in HD. Fly with NiGHTS in Elliot's or Claris's Dreams. It is one of those games that did deserve a sequel but the one it got could of done better but NiGHTS is one of those games that is more for relaxing or casual gamers. I wasn't dissapointed with this at all, besides, if you get a great score after each level you will be at the top while Sonic is second to you on the scoreboard. Speed doesn't always win.			"

												After all this time, NiGHTS into Dreams remains a unique action cult classic, with a strong arcade influence. The non-pervasive cutscenes may be heavily dated and rather cheesy, but fans of score-based action games will find a lot to enjoy here.Initially, the colour schemes may cause confusion while reading the levels, and there's no helpful tutorial to introduce you to controls or goals, but once you've discovered how the scoring system works, and have adjusted to the visuals, the game can provide hours of fun. You've got the option of Saturn graphics or ""HD"" graphics, and I'd recommend the latter, particularly if you're playing on larger screens. While the game does have intro and outro videos, there's no real narrative interrupting the play either; NiGHTS is a game you can pick up and play for short or extended periods of time depending on what fits your mood.The HD release includes Winter NiGHTS into Dreams (i.e. Christmas NiGHTS) too. Fans may get an extra dose of enjoyment from playing Splash Gardens, decked out in a Christmas theme, listening to Jingle Bells as they play. Other additions include a gallery of unlockable art work and photos.			"

												So, now not only can the Japanese enjoy the NiGHTS Into Dreams PS2 remake of 2008!Sarcasm apart, it's just a port from an old but really solid game (and as many old games, suffers from Megaman Syndrome: you've got to learn how to do everything by trial and error; there is absolutely no tutorial, just some intro clips telling you the backstory - voiceless, which is kind of honorable). Waaaaaaaaaay Better played with an analog control, although still beatable by keyboard or D-Pad. Short to beat, hard to master: you can clear all the courses with a C rank and watch the final cutscene in less than two hours, but you will be coming back again to do ever crazier, faster, and more satisfying combos (or ""Links"", as called in-game). Also included is Christmas NiGHTS and a Art Gallery, which are nifty bonuses.Low system requirements mean that even decent old computers (like 2007 old, with a dedicated GPU) will be able to enjoy it without problems. Graphics are pretty, but nothing spectacular (there is still some pop-in, altough it's barely visible in most stages); expect late-PS2 standards with better resolution. They also include a ""Saturn Mode"", where you can play with the original textures and low-poly models, and there you can really feel the difference between the updated version and the original. Gameplay seems identical to the original, with the exception that Gillwing's tail is now much harder to paraloop (they even got an achievent for that!).			"

												This game, what can I say about this game. It is, effectively, my childhood in a capsule. Developed by Sonic Team, back when that was still considered a good thing, the parallels to a sonic game are definitely there, with chip collecting, high speed gameplay, and short but sweet boss battles feeling very similar to a traditional sonic from the Genesis era. The primary difference beyond theme is that there is an emphasis on aerial maneuvers and acrobatics as you float through the dreamscapes. It's not enough to simply go fast, you're meant to go fast with flourish. I originally played NiGHTS and the special holiday demo Christmas NiGHTS originally back on the Saturn, and the re-release does a lot to keep the charm and innocent magic of the original. There are two graphical modes, the HD-Remaster and the classic Saturn graphics which, thankfully, share the same gameplay progression. The new HD mode looks quite nice and definitely makes a more modern, easier to stomach version of the game for people who might not carry the same level of nostalgia for the franchise, but I found myself playing through with the Saturn graphics most of the time, at least for the first run though. While I have not quite unlocked them yet, Christmas NiGHTS is also available in this release, which I believe was also given the same HD/Classic mode treatment. The one thing I found absent was the Nightopian collection (a small gallery of Nightopians you've come across in the game) but I'm hoping that will potentially be unlocked along with the Christmas NiGHTS portion. The rest of the gallery however appears intact and contains the all important Music selector.All in all for newcomers NiGHTS provides a a weird little game that's fun, colorful and can just be picked up and enjoyed without worrying about investing hours of playtime or unlocks or anything like that. For those with a previous history with the game, its a unique portal back in time, which brings with it the same sense innocence and wonder the game has always drawn on.Update: While I can confirm the Nightopian Collection did make it in, Christmas NiGHTS only unlocks as a remastered version without the Saturn option. They're still great levels though and easily the most memorable part of NiGHTS.			"

												Good game. Not a whole lot of extras, but about as much as you can expect given the original game, and the extra, formerly exclusive christmas mode, and original Saturn graphic mode is a nice touch.Each level has 4 stages, each last a max of two minutes, including boss fights. There are 8 levels total for the main game. So it's a rather short, fast paced, on rails game.Honestly, if you didn't see it in stores on the original Saturn, or played it ""back in the day"", this game is incredibly simplistic in every way and I could understand it not enticing to newcomers. The charming music is pleasant enough but it's not much of an actual game.			"

												This is my first time playing this game, I read about it in Fleetways sonic the comic a while back, and I had been meaning to try it, so when it was 75% off on a steam sale, I quickly purchased it. NiGHTS is a game that much like sonic 3 is so unique that age cannot tarnish it, I have never played a game quite like NiGHTS it is simple while also being quite complex, and presenting a very unique experience. To be honest I’m not quite sure how to describe it, just buy it you wont be disappointed.  "

												Excellent port. One of the best re releases for a Sega game period. The gameplay is pretty much similar to Sonic. You fly and pass through rings, and you have two forms of attacks. The spin, and the para loop. To do the para loop, you simply move NiGHTS around in a form of a circle, and with the para loop, you can use it to defeat bad guys and get bonus points. The music in this game is fantastic. One of the best soundtracks for Sega games, and I cannot get enough listening to the theme when fighting NiGHTS and Reala. The controls are smooth, but as for graphics go, it can get disorienting when moving around, thinking you are able to move in 3D, but it's designed to be in a 2D perspective. When you play the game, you will know what I mean. All in all, its a good port, but if you are not sure, I recommend you buy it on a sale.			"

												I've put off reviewing this game for a while as it's really quite difficult to express just how good this game is with a simple description alone...Reading some of the reviews around here it seems this is a bit of diversive title with some people saying it's a gorgeous little game and other slating it as an utter bore...I will give credit to the latter group as this title did at times seem a little repetative but it must be said it it's defense that what it lacks in diverse and veriaty based gaming it more than makes up for in terms of evolution of the existing gameplay and it's looks.NiGHTS into Dreams is a rather difficult sell. the premise is thus. you play as NiGHTS a Jester like figure who lives in the rhelms of dreams, your mission is to fly around the various stages of the level (Which is rail locked to up and down or left and right) collecting orbs that will allow you to free up bigger orbs that in turn will allow you to fight an end of level boss, once all the bosses are defeated you play a final boss level and thats about it. it's against the clock and if the time runs out you turn into a small child and you get chased by a giant walking clock till it games over it's a simple premise but it's crafting more than makes it worth it...the gameplay is simple enough for an introductory player but elevates in difficulty as you go along...it really takes the rail elements and experiments with using them in immersive 3d levels...it's a very experimental game it must be said...It's also utterly beautiful to look at, with the original sega saturn version or a new remastered for HD version available both look simply gorgeous and it's art Design is a beacon for what was possible in that strange time of evolution in the mid 90's...Can I reccommend this game? I would say it depends on your preference...if your one for constantly changing missions and wide veriaty or even more traditional platforming elements...I dont know if I can say this game would be for you...but if your open to having experiences and to playing a game for immersion and the more creative elements that gameplay has to offer then I would say give this game a shot, it'll broaden your horizons and may even change the way you think about video games...

Loved my Saturn. :) I had Bug, Croc, NiGHTS, Resident Evil and Tomb Raider. Wish I still had it. :(The only complaint about this port, is that the controls are absolutely horrible.

												""If there's one game I regret never creating, it was ""NiGHTS"".—Shigeru MiyamotoFor those of you who never had the Saturn, NiGHTS is one of the handful of games from that era that represents the glory days of SEGA and Sonic Team. The colors are vibrant, and the soundtrack is cheerful, unique, and quirky with some tracks being surprisingly ambient. The story is told without words using only music, cinematics, and imagery.In game, you control the titular androgynous character who flies around on a twisting and turning track, sort of like one of those remote controlled racecar tracks. The controls themselves are simple and effective. NiGHTS has it's flaws, the biggest offender being the camera which will sometimes have trouble keeping up with NiGHTS or will ""cleverly"" hide point collectibles in such a way as to make you fly at an awkward angle to be able to see them.Overall, NiGHTS is a very charming unique game that is worth a try .This HD remake also includes bonus content in the form of  Christmas NiGHTS, which is a fun little remix of one of the first stages.

												This is possibly the best of Sega's ports so far from a technical point of view. Everything about it just works, and I haven't heard about other people having problems with it like with the other ones. The visual enhancements are pretty well done for the most part too. It still looks like the same game, just cleaner and clearer. Flying around in the levels still feels wonderful and has aged surprisingly well. Looping and zooming around, whether to collect items, go through rings, or for fun/no reason at all, just feels right in a way most games don't seem to understand. Unfortunately the boss battles are still often frustrating, with a complete lack of highlighting or even hinting at what you should be doing in some of them and camera angles straight out of the mid-90s. Come for the flying in the normal levels; throw your controller at the wall and uninstall the game after one too many boss fights.			"

												This is....One of those games. It never says a word, nor does it ever have anything in game to explain the story in full outside of what you see and play. It never holds your hand, nor does it ever make it's ever incresing challanges easier. It has no 'super-guide' nor diffaculty setting ether in case you get stuck. It also only ever presents the play 7 stages in total making it a very 'short' single play experance.Yet because of all of that, it is chances are one of the best games ever made in all time. It's got a MASS of hidden depth and secrets for the player to poke at and find, it offers a fast pace gaming style even Sonic would blush at, all while presenting a world so colorful and vivid that it would be sucessior couldn't even mimic. It's story is presented in such a way that, while no one ever says anything, you still understand what's going on, what these two kids are struggling with, and how NiGHT's is trying to help them with such before even they need the assistance of the kids in the end. It's wimsyical, magical, and perhaps given just a bit more prase then it's fully worth. Yet I think if you really talk towards anyone who played this game in any fashion, more less played it yourself, you might too understand just what got birthed doing a time when gaming was in it's true 'golden age'.

												A pretty fun remake of it's classic version on the Sega Saturn, ""Nights into Dreams.."" stars everyone's favorite gender confused jester, Nights. i don't really have much to say about this game except that I bought this through my purchasing of Sonic Adventure's 1,2.  Graphics are a bit outdated but gameplay is smooth and well paced. Nights is a character that flies into sleeping children's dreams and destroys their nightmares. I recommend this classic PS2 title to those who never gave the Nights series a chance and true long time fans of Sonic Team's work. You'll be in for a magical adventure......at least if you're a kid anyway. lol			"

												This game, what can I say about this game. It is, effectively, my childhood in a capsule. Developed by Sonic Team, back when that was still considered a good thing, the parallels to a sonic game are definitely there, with chip collecting, high speed gameplay, and short but sweet boss battles feeling very similar to a traditional sonic from the Genesis era. The primary difference beyond theme is that there is an emphasis on aerial maneuvers and acrobatics as you float through the dreamscapes. It's not enough to simply go fast, you're meant to go fast with flourish. I originally played NiGHTS and the special holiday demo Christmas NiGHTS originally back on the Saturn, and the re-release does a lot to keep the charm and innocent magic of the original. There are two graphical modes, the HD-Remaster and the classic Saturn graphics which, thankfully, share the same gameplay progression. The new HD mode looks quite nice and definitely makes a more modern, easier to stomach version of the game for people who might not carry the same level of nostalgia for the franchise, but I found myself playing through with the Saturn graphics most of the time, at least for the first run though. While I have not quite unlocked them yet, Christmas NiGHTS is also available in this release, which I believe was also given the same HD/Classic mode treatment. The one thing I found absent was the Nightopian collection (a small gallery of Nightopians you've come across in the game) but I'm hoping that will potentially be unlocked along with the Christmas NiGHTS portion. The rest of the gallery however appears intact and contains the all important Music selector.All in all for newcomers NiGHTS provides a a weird little game that's fun, colorful and can just be picked up and enjoyed without worrying about investing hours of playtime or unlocks or anything like that. For those with a previous history with the game, its a unique portal back in time, which brings with it the same sense innocence and wonder the game has always drawn on.Update: While I can confirm the Nightopian Collection did make it in, Christmas NiGHTS only unlocks as a remastered version without the Saturn option. They're still great levels though and easily the most memorable part of NiGHTS.			"

It is what it is. Great enhanced port though. Everything looks vastly improved. It's based on the remade Japanese PS2 version and I think they improved some aspects of it ever further.

												NiGHTS Into Dreams is a much needed different take on the sonic formula. NiGHTS is very fun for learning new ways to beat a level faster and faster and takes you into very fun and unique dream environments.The gameplay can get repetative as the mechanics stay the same throughout the entire game, but each level provides new unique challenges.The ""HD remake"" lives up to its name, it feels identical to the original but looks way better. It also gives you the option to play with the original graphics and unlock the ""Christmas game mode"". I havent had a single problem with the port and have been playing with a controller.if you like fast paced combo-esque gameplay or exploring dreamlike fantasy I would definately recomend this game. In my opinion its too bad Sonic got so popular while NiGHTS wasnt given the attention it deserved. I'm still happy to see one of my favorite games on Steam.			"

												NiGHTS Into Dreams... was the flagship game of the Sega Saturn console.You play as one of two children, Claris and Elliot, lost in dream worlds of their own as they fight against their fears and recover their inner selves. The two children encounter a dream entity called NiGHTS, captured for rebelling against his master -- the master of Nightmares -- Wizeman. By merging with NiGHTS, the children can explore their dreamscape, defeat Wizeman's minions, and finally confront the master himself.Despite the premise, the game is light-hearted. The player controls the children through colorful and musical 3D worlds, complete with their own artificial life. Once you merge with NiGHTS, you begin a play through four courses that will take you around the level, collecting pickups to unlock each course successively. You control NiGHTS on a 2D plane that weaves around in 3D space, so you only have to worry about going forward, back, up, or down. Courses are also timed; letting the timer run out turns you back into a child, legging it back to the start, and scattering the pickups around you.In order to progress to the boss of a level, you must finish four courses with a good enough average score to proceed. Score is improved with the pickups you bring with you, as well as how often you went through loops, or picked up items, in succession.NiGHTS Into Dreams... is not a long game. However, it takes a while to truly master its scoring system. Until you gain the mastery of doing acrobatic loops through the skies, you'll be accompanied by dynamically changing music tracks, uplifting beats, and controls that are easy to pick up.There is more to the game than I've written above -- the ability to hatch and help the artificial life grow, the addition of the Christmas NiGHTS limited edition content, updated graphics, and more. This HD re-release is a port of the uncommon PlayStation 2 version. While a timing bug has crept in, making the animations a bit too fast compared to some musical cues, this edition is still faithful to the original's gameplay and spirit. The music alone has sold me to this game many times over.			"

												***I have changed my review to positive because it has been pointed out to me that many of my greivances were incorrect. You can indeed change to controller mode and fullscreen (just not within the game). I am a huge fan of Nights into Dreams and being such, the Steam port is a huge let down. -No Controller Support!       This by far is the greatest transgression. The original game came with an analogue controller that allowed you to move the character like butter. Now instead we are given digital (on/off) keyboard controls. What's even worse is that when I use joypad to keyboard software to use a controller, the input available is still only digital and only up/down/left/right. No diagonal movement, making the character stutter, move erratically and not at all gracefully. Unless this is changed (and I know it won't) the Steam version of Nights into Dreams is completely worthless-No Fullscreen       I cannot believe this is not an option-Graphic ""Upgrade""        Even the ""Original Saturn"" levels don't look like what they did in the original. It takes away from the nostalgia. Which for most people who would purchase this game is the whole point and the ""Remastered"" levels are hardly touched up. It's difficult to really tell the difference.For those of you who have never played this game, this is not a good representation.For those of you who have fond memories of this game. Find it literally ANYWHERE else.Sega, this is a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor excuse for a PC port of your classic Nights into Dreams. If this is the best you can muster for your loyal fans then there is no reason for anyone to buy an official port of any of your classics.			"

												A charming game, and one of my favorites ever. This game is nothing more than a labor of love from the ~original~ Sonic Team. The game play is hard to describe. It's like a flight-stimulator, a racing game and a Sonic platformer in one. The visuals are very unique and stylish and the music is fantastic (and actually changes as you play the game). The controls could be slightly better, not as fluid as the Saturn original but not unplayable either. Im simply glad that Sega had the ambition to release this on Steam. In my opinion, this game is well worth your Steam-bux.			"

Defo worth the purchase if you want that old school nostalgia trip of a unique and excellent game. One thing I would add would be i've only played it on the PC for 10 minutes or so but the keyboard and mouse controlling it is very difficult (unless you can remap or set it up differently) I think you really need an analogue controller to get the full playability out of this. As if I remember correctly back when it got first released on the Saturn they brought out a special edition unique analogue controller for the game.			"

Looks very good in HD for a 20 year old console game.Cons: Some of the more obscure extras from Christmas Nights are missing. Burning Rangers next, please.			"

												Another game I purchased for pure nostalgia reasons. I had this on the Sega Saturn and it's an amazing game I put so much hours into this. The general feel and gameplay is great, the different zones, the bosses and the music are all awesome. Defo worth the purchase if you want that old school nostalgia trip of a unique and excellent game. One thing I would add would be i've only played it on the PC for 10 minutes or so but the keyboard and mouse controlling it is very difficult (unless you can remap or set it up differently) I think you really need an analogue controller to get the full playability out of this. As if I remember correctly back when it got first released on the Saturn they brought out a special edition unique analogue controller for the game.			"

												One of the best games from my childhood. As a kid growing up in the 90's, and having the oddball Sega Saturn system, I got to play this little slice of Sega Pie when the system was still on the market. I loved how it was back then, even if I never really understood how to beat the cat boss. As an adult I got this game in a Sega Humble Bundle for seriously chump change! I think it is totally worth the price of admission even not on sale!It has both the original 1996 Sega Saturn Graphics mode, or a remixed cleaned up version of the PS2 update graphics, but this time in full HD. It still looks amazing in HD as it is such a colorful 90's game. This is Sonic Teams most experimental game, and it really is something nice and refreshing to play if you are sick and tired of Sonic The Hedgehogs latest mishaps.I think this game is grossly underrated and a true hidden gem in the purest sense of the term.

												Great music, cool hybrid 2D/3D gameplay, good boss battles. You could probably consider the main character the mascot of the Saturn. The gameplay is pretty much 70% 2D and 30% 3D. Unique artstyle, easy to learn gameplay, multiple endings. Also you can redo stages for a better letter grade. Now Steam just needs Journey of Dreams.			"

												A charming game, and one of my favorites ever. This game is nothing more than a labor of love from the ~original~ Sonic Team. The game play is hard to describe. It's like a flight-stimulator, a racing game and a Sonic platformer in one. The visuals are very unique and stylish and the music is fantastic (and actually changes as you play the game). The controls could be slightly better, not as fluid as the Saturn original but not unplayable either. Im simply glad that Sega had the ambition to release this on Steam. In my opinion, this game is well worth your Steam-bux.			"

												""I consider the Sega Saturn to be a gem of a console. And this game is one of those pieces from that gem.""In the game you pick from either the boy or girl character, but what you're playing is a dream essence called NIGHTS who flies around obstacles in your dream-world while collecting random items, to then move onto the boss battle at the end of each level. Just don't take too long or else time will run out and you could wake up from your dream, then its game over.For a game that came from the same team behind the original Sonic The Hedgehog, NIGHTS Into Dreams is a delightful experience and a really good stress-reliever to play. Visually it's very bright and colourful with lots of unusual textures to make the gameplay feel like you're flying around in a whole new world!My only issue with the game is because there hasn't been too many sequels, this game does feel a little aged...Whenever I play this game, no matter what system, it feels like I'm playing a game from 1997. But that doesn’t ultimately make the game bad! I still think it’s worth checking out if you have never played this game before.Definitely a Sega Classic and one to try if you're a huge Sega Fanboy! ;)			"

												I can easily see why some people love this game; it's rather beautiful (for its time, of course), it controls fairly well and it looks unique. I bet that if I would have own Sega Saturn and this game back then when I was a kid, I would have probably cried tears of joy like I did when I heard Sonic Generations' classic version of ""Green Hill Zone"" . (No joke)Although, I can find some faults which bother me a bit. First of all, the story is rather meh imo. But then again, I think that the stories of the games weren't the main thing back then (unlike nowadays; game has a bad story, it most likely will get bashed to ground). The game is fairly short too. Not that many games were long back then either. The re-mastered version is rather hard to navigate too in my opinion, hence why I stayed in the Saturn mode most of the time.I'd say it's worth of it's 8€ price tag.			"

												I never played NiGHTS on the Dreamcast, so I'm not blinded by nostalgia when I say it's a gorgeous and innovative game. Part racing game, part platformer, and bursting with the kind of bright colors I thought were illegal in games these days NiGHTS takes your deams of flying and puts them through the filter of SEGA at the top of their game. Plus my 3rd party controller works perfectly without any configuration, which is always a plus.			"

												Here is how you will experience this game if you never played it before:-You fly through the first level at your own pace. wow such color. You collect orbs, break open a capsule, and return stolen orbs to your start area.-The second lap starts and wow your exploring a new area of the same level. Then the third.-You finish with horrible scores and then do the boss. You wounder why he dies so quick and easy.-Your bad scores get you frustrated but you attempt to complete all the levels anyway.-You do or dont finish all the levels and then drop the game with the mindset of ""Its a pretty game for how old it is, but there is not much here. oh well.""- you watch this video and learn you are just stupid but its not your fault 


YouTube™ Video: BEST & WORST MEMES OF 2016 

			Views: 293,538		

			OK SO HEY HERE IS A ALIST OF MEMEMS ASFOR 201455 T HAT WERE THE BEST AND WORST EMMES JOF HTE YEAR! 5 OF THE BEST AND 5 OF THE WORSDTMEMS THAT HAPPENENED THROUGH THE WHOLE YEAR.		

-You give the game a second shot, become addicted, and return back to it for a few quick runs through a level every once in awile because it gives you that same thrill you got from playing Sonic on your Genesis.The game has an open world you can explore as the kids at the beginning of the level to give yourself an edge with the score. You can have enough blue orbs to instantly get the first crystal ball thing back.The faster you get your stolen crystal ball things back, the more bonus time you get. During the bonus time, blue orbs turn gold and give you double points. Dont go to the 2nd lap! Instead, pass over the goal to do more laps with your extra rewarded time. Once you figure this out then everything makes sense and that feeling of ""JUST ONE MORE LAP"" kicks in and it becomes insane and challenging, but only as much as you want it to. Also the first boss feels like a too easy chore the first time around, but once you learn that your score can be up to doubled based on how fast you kill the boss at the end of each level, it becomes a intense race to kill him. And an even greater feeling when you learn the trick to killing him in one single hit. (and getting a trophy for it ;) )The game also has these angel guys similar to Chao from Sonic Adventure. You find them throughout the worlds. You can hatch them and help them out. As you make them happy and grow their population. Depending on your relationship with the creatures, the music of every single level changes. They have darker and happyer versions of each level's soundtrack. Not only is that an impressive amount of tracks to indulge in, but it makes your actions feel like they have a inpact on the world your exploring. It feels less like running through a race track, and more like visiting Animal Crossing.In a summary though... for $5, you can get your moneys worth just by doing a quick run-through of the game. But if that is still not enough, If you are looking for something deep and addicting, you will find it here if you give it a second chance.			"

												This is a game very near and dear to my heart. In fact, it's what I consider to be my all time favorite video game. I first played it a little as a child at my cousin's house. Then, when I was in middle school, I borrowed said cousin's SEGA Saturn for two whole years JUST for this game, and only returned it because he eventually asked for it back. In recent years, I've gotten some of my friends interested in this game as well. So naturally, I have a bit of a biased opinion towards this game. Even so, I will try my hardest to leave a fair review of it, and will try to address how it stands from a gaming perspective, as well as an HD remake and PC port perspective.The premise is as follows: Two children who are struggling with their personal aspirations in the waking world find themselves in the dream world, teaming up with a flying jester to stop the Lord of Nightmares from acquiring enough of a type of dream energy that would enable him to enter our world. The plot is a bit weird yet simple and creative all the same, and the feel of game captures that quite well. On top of that, the characters, while equally simplistic, are harboring both the same goals and doubts many of us have also experienced at their age, and over the course of the game, they are made to confront and attempt to overcome their personal demons, with two moments in the final level really capturing those elements of their journey. The gameplay is unique, distinct, and really does capture what it feels like to be in a dream world with its visual presentation and the music found throughout the game. The difficulty can be pretty hard for newcomers, though some may get the hang of it pretty quickly. It's pretty simple and straightforward, but performing well, especially for getting higher scores, can be quite challenging. Once you've gotten the hagn of it, though, you could probably beat the main game in one evening. That being said, it is VERY replayable and addictive, and I often find myself coming back to play it whenever I've had a rough day. After all, we usually go to sleep so that we can relax, rest, and have the physical, mental, and emotional strength needed to confront the ordeals of tomorrow, and at least for me, NiGHTS into Dreams helped me do that at a time when I needed it most.As an HD remake, the game gives you the option of playing all of the original game's levels with either the original graphics or a far higher resolution. And let me tell you, the HD graphics are breathtaking! In addition, the remake also includes a special winter themed level that was included in the Christmas NiGHTS version of the original Saturn game, as well several other time and date based elements introduced there. However, the multiplayer versus mode that was in the original game is inexplicably missing, along with a lot of other bonus content found with the Christmas NiGHTS game. Having played the Xbox 360, PS3, and Steam versions of this game, the only real differences I have noticed are that the PS3 version has slightly longer loading times which happen more often than either of the other versions. Beyond that, though, I haven't found any noticeable gameplay differences, so you can't really go wrong no matter which version  you pick.Regardless, this is a game anyone can enjoy (heck, it was originally rated K-A, or Kid to Adult, when it was released on the Saturn), and for good reason. My own history with the game aside, it is just the right blend of relaxing and intense: beautiful graphics, creative stages, simple yet addictive gameplay with just the right amount of challenge, a story that is easy to understand and characters who are easy to identify with, and an absolutely wonderful soundtrack. I would highly recommend buying this game and giving it a shot, especially if and when it goes on sale. You will not regret it. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and sweet dreams!			"

												Such an amazing HD remake! I never played the '96 version since I've never owned a Saturn, but the game itself is just amazing. When I first discovered NiGHTS, it was back in Sonic's Pinball Party. The pinball itself was great too. It had all the elements from this game. But, I never really knew who NiGHTS was back then. Hell, never even knew about this game as well! I played the sequel and that was fine, but I feel that this was much better than the sequel. I became a die-hard NiGHTS fan back in early 2016. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves NiGHTS. I possibly might not recommend it to newcomers. They may not know exactly what to do, but I feel that they will become more accustomed to it. Have an Xbox/PS controller with you!Overall, great game. A very underrated piece of work that SEGA threw at us and has forgotten about it all these years. A person may dream for a 3rd NiGHTS game.~C			"

												Take it or leave it, buy it on sale, or wait for a definitive port to come out 6 years from now.This enhanced port is missing a ton of features? Buy 2 or 3 of these newer Sega ports and you'll start to get a bad taste in your mouth. It's sad that more care is not taken to provide an experience that mirrors and enhances the original without botching some random part of it. In this version the controls suffer from not being true analog. Everything looks a little more cheesy in the redone graphics, and a there are many other inconsistencies to the original that I wouldn't complain about if they made the game any better. But you still get a decent framerate and resolution which is more than you can get on the Saturn.This port could easily be patched up to fix the problems it has and in that case I would fully recommend it--NiGHTs is such a fun game that it doesn't matter if this port is kinda a hackjob, it's still just really fun, and I'll either play it on Steam or I'll play the real version on SSF.The graphics look great, I'll give it that.It's really hard to not recommend a game in the end, if that game is NiGHTs. I just wish there was a truly complete port of the original with all these added features to boot, and maybe some extra 2player LAN/online modes. I'd easily pay double the asking price for that.			"
