												If you enjoy pinball and action/adventure games with a lot of characters and upgrades galore, you should take to this little game quite well. The main game is short but the arena mode offers some extra replayability if you like to compete for high scores or you just enjoy a good game of arcade pinball. Give it a go sometime if you haven't already.			"

												Wow, where has the past 16 hours of my life gone. What a fun game. Being a huge pinball fanantic I couldnt wait for this to be released and jumped on it. Once I began, I couldnt stop playing, it is now 8:40am. Must sleep.Very Challanging multi level platform pinball. You have to think of which ball to use to get through some of the levels.I really hope there are more in the future. "

												If you've ever wondered what a combination of pinball and an RPG would look like, the way I see it you have two options: play this game, or track down a copy of Pinball Quest for the NES.Now, that said, this game has an interesting combination of pinball gameplay (it IS a pinball game, after all), RPG elements (like experience points, special abilities, different characters, and new gear), and puzzles (like figuring out how to get to certain areas of a given pinball table/level. As far as I can tell (I'm just about an hour in right now), the storyline is pretty much stock fantasy, but I wouldn't come to a game like this looking for complex moral judgements and deep allegories for our time. The characters are all fully voiced, and the acting is pretty good. The character art is fantastic. The level designs are easy on the eyes as well.Considering the price vs. the amount of fun to be had in this game, Rollers of the Realm is a pretty good buy.On another note, I'm finding the gameplay somewhat reminiscent of Wizorb - if you've played this game, RotR is probably right up your alley as well.

												First Impressions:""Rollers of the Realm"" is a family-friendly pinball game with light RPG elements.  Most of the major characters are represented via pinballs and each have different stats in terms of size, density, and etc.  It's very easy to jump into and play and I'll be the first to admit that I absolutely suck at real-life pinball.  Ideal for gamer families who may be looking for something nonviolent and lighthearted.

												Rollers of the Realm is the most unique game I've played in years. The concept is what originally caught my attention. A combination of pinball and RPG elements, how is that going to work? Well, it probably shouldn't, but in this case it does. The quirky pinball characters are unique and even funny. There's great replayability here, too, as you'll need to decide which character, or ball, is best suited to a task, considering width, height, weight, and special abilities, like healing, increased damage, or special attacks.The graphics are beautiful, and the controls are responsive. There is a challenge to some of these areas and puzzles, too, so experienced pinball players and puzzle enthusiasts should find plenty to appreciate here. It's evident that a lot of time and attention went into the detail for the characters, environment, clothing, speech, and story. The outcome is a very consistent experience that's easy to get into and enjoyable. Gamers of all ages should consider giving ROTR a try.One thing that I want to point out is that there is an interruption in flow as new goals are met or characters are introduced for the first time, and that can seem awkward at first. However, that interruption is part of the story and RPG aspect of the game, so it's definitely necessary, and it's easy to get used to. Afterward, the pinball gameplay is uninterrupted, and players can revisit areas to obtain loot or treasure they might have missed, without repeating the story. This is certainly not a negative, but it is something I noticed that others are very likely to experience. It was awkward for me at first, and I wondered if I was going to be able to enjoy the pinballing aspect of the game. I hung with it, though, and soon that wasn't even a consideration.I'm fascinated by this game, and I applaud the developers for taking such a bold risk by pairing these gaming elements into one cohesive experience. I intend to play this game again, and I hope to see more.			"

												Rollers of the Realm is a pinball RPG.  Sorta...  Basically, instead of plain pinball tables to play, you've got these areas that look like a village courtyard with flippers and bumpers on the sides of it. You use Mana points to enable certain special abilities, and gain mana by bumping into various targets on the field. There are also people milling about as obstacles or enemies.  Depending on the story, bumping your ball into people may attack them or it may merely rob them of some gold.  In some cases, enemies sap you of mana points.  You start out with the lowly thief with a heart of gold and her trusty dog sidekick.  As you play through the story new characters are added and you have the option of hiring other characters (once every 4 levels). Each character has their own special ability, and you can use these abilities to add extra balls to the table, or prevent the ball from draining from the playfield (depending on character). There's also a store to buy new equipment which adds to your character's abilities.  Thankfully you can return to each level after completing the story part and attempt to farm some extra gold.There's also two levels of difficulty...casual and challenge mode. I had originally thought that challenge mode would remove the ability to change the ball direction with the analog stick, but apparently this is not so.  I guess the enemies are just tougher and the traps may be easier to set off. Traps?  Well, there's at least one level where after a certain number of times the ball hits it, the barrier will disappear leaving a way for the ball to exit the playfield (thus ""killing"" your character).  Thankfully, you can easily revive them later in the game, and if there's no immediate danger (enemies on the playfield) losing the ball doesn't kill your character off.  It also seems to revive characters between levels so it's not like it kills the character off for good or anything.Things I like about this gameIt's Pinball! Though the focus is more on story than scoreIt's got RPG elements.The art style is cartoony, but it fits the medieval theme well enoughThe music does a good job of staying in the background while still accenting the action in the gameThe voice acting is pretty good.  You can change the difficulty at any time Things I didn't like about this gameThe story and characters are a bit cliche at timesA few of the characters voice actors don't say exactly what the subtitles say (minor quibble)Casual mode is maybe a bit too casual. I'd like a bit more challenge without it being a dragChallenge mode is still pretty casualAll in all though, the game is good fun and worthy of spending your time on.  If you're a big fan of a challenging pinball game, well, this is a bit too soft, but if you're a fan of pinball and you love a good story, then check it out.			"

												Rollers of the Realm is one of those games that seems to be based on a dare.  ""What if we combined an RPG with a Pinball game,"" which needless to say is a rare thing to see in games  Much like Puzzle question and other fusion games before it, pinball or no, the real question is ""does the fusiion work?""The short form?  Rather well.Rollers of The Realm has the characters represented as balls. Some are small and fast,others big and slow.  Some are easy to put ""tilt"" on, some can't be redirected so easily.  All of them have a unique special ability.  Surprisingly, this works, and allows you to develop a lot of strategies, and solve puzzles by . . . forgive me . . . juggling the right balls.The game is as such - go to an area, enter a board.  There you can find all sorts of things you have to deal with to win -  enemies to attack, obstacles to overcome, puzzles to figure out environments to navigates, and other challenges to face.  Ramming a character into an enemy attacks it.  Striking some objects raises mana to use special abilities.  Some characters can even derive mana or gold from some targets in the field.  And there are seemingly inaccessible areas that you can get to with the right combination of characters, wits, and flipper-usage.  There are also keys to find and treasures to unlock.By the way, characters who exit the field often die (until ressurected) and flippers can be damanged.  So you don't always have time to just sit there and try things over and over, and losing a ball can be very traumatic to your strategy.Surprisingly it works - it's a pinball puzzler with some resource management and combat-like elements - and, of course, boss monsters.  It also allows for bite-sized play as any one board doesn't take very long, and they can be revisited for more loot and exploration.At it's core, it's pretty clever, but there's also an actual plot and character backstory.  Nothing epic, but it adds to the game as characters have motivations you understand - and as this is a game that is representing characters as colorful spheres, kind of needed.  The voice acting is decent to good, and thankfully lacks overdramatic elements - plus the characters sometimes make witty remarks during play that provide more atmosphere.The game does lack in a few areas - character status screens are minimal and special abilities aren't always well explained.  Font choices on status screens are also a bit tough to read.  A few boards are rather dull or their layots not always clear.  Documentation is virtually nonexistent (even though, yes, it's basically RPG Pinball, so its a bit simple).However, these are minimal criticism in that, for $9.99 American you get an excellent fusion RPG that makes its seemingly insane premise work well, nicely done visuals and character portrayals, and enjoyable pinball puzzles to solve.  A precice game that delivers exactly what is promises, does it well, and throws in some surprises.A definite buy for fans of unusual RPGs and game mechanic experiments, and something to consider for a gift for people with a taste for the unusual.

												Very well-implemented RPG system with the basic pinball goodness. Surprisingly deep, and surprisingly skill-based. The changing of characters as different balls works very well and the idea of mana and the skills avaliable make the game interesting to play. With items to collect,and various different level objectives, it's been really fun for the first several hours without me stopping.

												Rollers of the Realm is a pinball game, but it's not one that I've ever seen before, where the game is a character driven adventure pinball game, or to put it in another word, an Role Playing pinball Game. Just a note, i didn't finish the game, played through half of it.Now I'm not a major pinball person, only playing the space pinball game that was pre-installed on Windows XP, playing it when i should have been doing my school homework, and that was just a fun score-based pinball game, but with Rollers of the Realm, it has a focus on story, characters, with abilities and damage/healing numbers. Also, your balls are your characters, with good voice acting (fully voice acted by the way), and with different looks, size, and physics.Now from what I've played, and the future levels I've yet to finish, and the extra replayable content after that, priced at 10$, i see this, as a person who only played a digital pinball game years ago, as a good purchase if you're into pinball games, with this one having a considerably big, and arguably good, different approach too it.Shamless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.

												Now, I'm not one who normally reviews games. I pick it up, poke it 'til most of the fun comes out, and move on to other work or play. Most of the time, I don't really feel like a game would be worth reviewing--I'd either be one of the many, or I wouldn't be able to review it in a positive manner. Rollers of the Realm made me rethink this, for 2 major reasons. Now, I'm a pessimist at heart, so I'll start with the lesser reason first:This is not a long game. Normally, I wouldn't have an issue with this in an indie game for $10, but I draw the line here. I'm just beginning to feel like I know what's the what in the game, only to discover my playthrough is over 90% complete, and I STILL don't know what the handy hired help skills do. So let this be an illustration: the amount of gameplay here is small, but the depth is huge. They set out for RPinballG, and they succeeded. Clever/smooth mechanics, and they succeeded. Graphics that don't leave you frustrated halfway through with mind numbing repetition? success.Now, why is being short an issue to me if this game has so much going for it? It's actually because of Reason #2: The levels, the gameplay, every second of my first playthrough of this game was one thing: exquisite (okay...there might've been a little corny voice acting...but what fantasy game doesn't have it?), and lo and behold, I go back to see some of the unique levels/scenarios again, but find them to be locked (all bosses except the final ones can only be defeated once each playthrough). In case I haven't been clear: I want the story to go on, I'm actually interested in these characters which aren't just cookie-cut archetypes. I'm interested in a puzzle that challenges my MIND, instead of my reflexes...(some of them were close), but most of all, it seems like Phantom Compass mastered the mechanics they wanted to use, applied them well, but hasn't gotten to use everything in its bag'o'tricks yet.--Eagerly awaiting DLC/Sequel!

												First off, I'll admit that my review is somewhat biased because I have a nostalgic love of pinball games.But to combine a pinball game with RPG elements, and story-telling, is pure genius.PROs:- good voice acting (really makes the characters come alive)- excellent inclusion of story and story-telling - beautiful integrated art style with pinball maps- can swap between characters in mid-game to utilize character skills- RPG upgrades to characters to increase skill set- EXCELLENT boss battles (really need to be creative on how to utilize your characters)CONs:- very short game (spent 8 hours playing, but a good chunk of that time was spent grinding for gold in the arena maps)- sudden arena ""round change"" pauses (game pauses in the middle of game to signify round progression, which sometimes blocks view of ball, and leads to frequent gutter balls)- annoying menu navigation (switching between story and arena modes, forces you to wait for opening title screen to load every single time)- limited RPG elements (RPG elements are a great concept, but having just a handful of pre-determined upgrades, and limitless gold to grind to purchase upgrades, limits a player's creativity on how to build class characters)Overall, a very fun and at times challenging game, with LOTS of room to develop and grow.  I'm hoping that this is just the first of many RPG-Pinball games.			"

												It's a cool idea, and maybe if they get the chance to iterate on it with another game it would be better. Unfortunately,  I don't think this game is going to make pinball fans or those looking for an RPG happy. For starters, there's just not much there in terms of what you'd expect from an RPG. You can buy some upgrades that make very little difference to how the individual balls perform, and you cand spend a bunch of gold on buying another party member. That's about all. It's very thin if you're looking for any kind of character customization, which could be forgiven if the other aspect of the game - the pinball - was stellar. It isn't. This game's idea of a good pinball table seems to be stationary targets that you have to hit over and over - and over and over- and when you finally ""kill"" one, another comes out to stand in the exact same place. Instead of interesting shots and modes like you'd expect in any real pinball table, you get to bounce off these targets a few inches from the flippers again and again. Honestly, the weakest tables in Pinball FX are more entertaining. Like I said, I like the concept. I hope either these developers or someone else gets to take another crack at it, and before they do I hope they play some better pinball tables.			"

												Best Pinball/Something other than pinball - mashup since Odama.Basically, in this game you use pinball mechanics to collect money, mana (sometimes loot) and fight the baddies.The balls represent your characters, who are a Street Urchin, a fallen knight, a healer and many more. They have special powers (sometimes multiball) and can be upgraded by finding treasures (using pinball mechanics) or buying upgrades.There might be some room for improvement here or there eg replayability is rather low for a pinball game, but overall it is a well rounded experience. Most definitely it is a unique experience - there is so far nothing like it, so if you are at least a little intrigued by the concept, give it a try.			"

Gameplay'Rollers of the Realm' is a game that combines pinball and RPG (role-playing game). And it does so quite successfully. The pinball aspect of the game is classic: you push buttons (on your keyboard or on a controller) to move flippers in order to control the ball and prevent it from dropping down the drain.The RPG aspect of the game consists of the following elements: The ball represents a player character who has stats and skills. There are 10 playable characters. They each have a 'class' like knight, rogue or healer. Each of them has strengths and weaknesses and a specific 'special skill' that can be triggered when you've collected enough mana (magic points).  You will be performing tasks ('quests') like killing opponents, looting containers, finding a way to advance, ... by hitting NPCs, containers, levers and such with the ball. How exactly you're supposed to perform these tasks is explained very well at the start of the game. You gather gold while playing. Gold can be used to buy equipment that increases your characters' stats. Completing a quest yields experience points (XP). When a certain amount of XP is reached, the character levels up. A higher level means the character can buy even more equipment to further increase his or her stats.  There is a fantasy story that serves as a setting for the game. Don't expect an in-depth narrative though. The story is very basic but serves its purpose.The campaign consists of about 35 maps to complete. After finishing a map, you can revisit it to gather more XP and gold. While playing through the campaign, you'll unlock 'arena maps'. These maps are optional but the experience and (a portion of) the gold you earn carry over to the party's campaign, so they are a good way to grind a bit of both if you're having trouble with the campaign.Graphics and soundThe graphics are isometric and look colourful and vibrant. The music fits the game splendidly and it's reminiscent of some typical tactical RPGs, which 'Rollers of the Realm' basically is, too. The dialogue is completely voiced. I would call the level of voice acting mediocre: not overly impressive but not particularly annoying either.Options There are two difficulty modes: casual and challenging.  You can remap keyboard keys and controller buttons.  You can change the resolution, select a graphics quality, enable or disable V-Sync and AA. You can change audio volume and enable/disable music.One thing that's missing is the option to disable controller vibration. Not only for people who want to play using a controller but don't like the vibration, but even when you use the keyboard and mouse, the controller will vibrate. If you don't want that to happen, the only solution is to unplug the controller.A word about Steam's extra features. 'Rollers of the Realm' has 10 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 5 just for running the game. There are 32 Steam Achievements to be triggered. About half of them are quite challenging, actually, especially some of the 'arena' achievements. This game is certainly not 'an easy 100% achievements'.			"

												This is a great game, but wow is there a gigantic difficulty spike at the very end. They've added a checkpointing system to alleviate it, but the last boss is just insane compared to the rest of the game.See, for most levels you're able to use any of your characters, because they all have different uses. In the last stage though, there's a series of three different levels, each with three boss enemies - and only one of your characters is capable of dealing significant damage to them. For the first two bosses, that's fine; you just clear out the board a bit, then pull out the special character and poke them until they die. If your special character dies, it's no big deal; you can just gather mana with someone else and revive them. It's not fast, but you make consistent progress. For the third boss, though, you just can't do that. This boss has two special attacks: he does something which causes a lot of damage, and he does something else that drains your mana. This means that instead of the normal repertoire of six or seven characters, you've only got three that matter: the healer, who restores your health; the ranger, who is immune to mana drain; and the special character, who's the only one that can significantly hurt the boss. If any one of those three dies, you're boned. Healer's gone? Well, you're going to take a lot of damage, which means you're more likely to lose another character. Special character dies? Now you're playing catchup, because the person who does the next-highest damage to the boss deals 1/5th the damage. Ranger dies? You might as well give up. You're going to have a really hard time building up enough mana to restore another character, because there's no mana charms on this stage and to reach the mana gathering spots you need to go around the boss.And going anywhere near the boss is super dangerous - if you ever make the mistake of hitting him head on, he smacks your character with a friggin Chaos Dunk and they go flying straight into the middle gutter. It's really, really hard to recover from that. Overall though, this is a great game - it's just a pity the difficulty went from Super Mario World to Dark Souls over the course of one boss.			"

												This is the second game of the Atlus ""Playing with balls"" collection; the amazing Rock of Ages being the first in the series.This game is a ""Pinball and RPG hybrid"", first of all, with the former being the core gameplay mechanic. As far as RPG elements, one can buy items that buff certain ball types (rogue ball steals coins and backstabs, knight ball can fight and defend, etc) at an in-game store. You also grind EXP to level characters. This is about as RPG as the whole thing gets.Story is alright so far, but nothing amazing. As a pinball fan, I honestly don't care if the story turns out one way or the other. So no big deal at all there.Experience and gold are gotten by hitting targets, or sequences of them, and hitting enemies enough times to vanquish them. As hinted at before, one has use of different ball types, or party members, to accomplish various goals. A rogue can backstab and pickpocket innocents by hitting them from behind. A knight would be a better choice if one is facing an angry mob of baddies, and so on.Got this in a bundle, and I've seen enough to know that this will be a solid game. Avoid if you only want a quirky RPG game, because this is all about pinball with a hint of RPG. And that's just fine, because a similar system (albeit match-3 and not pinball) worked out pretty well for the first Puzzle Quest game.Pros: -Atlus-PinballCons: -None worth mentioning if you like pinball.Recommended.

												Long story short: They pulled it off. It's a fun, unique, and interesting game.The boards are fun and complex always with multiple flippers on each side.Each might have different goals like some you might need to use the Thief ball to bump into the backs of peasants to collect some gold, others (quite a few) you defeat enemies, or you might need to make it to a different part of the board as part of the story.The characters being represented by balls of different size and materials works well. They feel and play diferent, so where the small almost-too-fast Thief does a ton of damage from behind (much less from the front) and gets knocked around by the flippers easlily, the Knight is big, slow, heavy, does a fair bit of damage from any angle and can occasionally knock down enemies briefly. Meanwhile there's also the Ranger who pasively fires arrows when near enemies, or the Farmhand who wrecks objects and knocks over enemies easily.All of the characters (balls) have an activate-able ability. The thief has an extra ball in play (her dog), the Knight blocks the balls from going down between the flippers for a short time. The character/balls can also be upgraded at the Port (a shop) buy buying them. Some may increase damage, lessen the special ability mana cost, modify their special in some way - usually making it stronger and/or last longer.On a personal note: My favorite has to be the Barmaid, a hire-able side character who's good all around and can be upgraded to be able to heal the flippers on mana gain when her special is active which happens to make her more agile and do more damage to begin with.""Not the kind o' spoonin' you were expectin'?""There is some limited bad, however, in that several stages feel SUPER frustrating because there's too many enemies crowding the flippers so all your balls bounce off of them and in the hole. Perhaps the Farmhand is the character I was supposed to hire first so he could bowl through them.As of yet, if you use a controller with vibration there's no way in game options to turn off the rumble so some stages I needed to take a break until my hands stopped being numb.

												It was fun for a while, then got very repetitive. Having beaten it the game seems to have very little replay value. The RPG element is superficial. The graphics are pleasing but for me at least the voiceover was wince-inducing.  I am confused by those confused by the difficulty of the final levels. They aren't that hard, they just involve noticing one thing that the game very blatantly draws your attention to. I played through some of the bonus levels and they are pretty dull as well. That said, it was funner than not playing a superficially-RPG themed pinball game.			"

												I was turned on to this game following a few Let's Plays on Youtube. It's certainly a unique premise, pinball RPG. Oddly enough, it works. It works really well. The game mechanics work. The creators spent a lot of time on making it work and it shows. Once you play a few levels, you'll be asking yourself ""now, why didn't I think of a pinball RPG?"" it's that well designed.You will receive quite a bit of enjoyment from the game. The story is good enough for a generic fantasy setting. The characters are strangely compelling for little balls. WIth little dialogue, the creators gave these little balls more character and development than most ""character-driven"" AAA releases. There are a few moments that removed me from the game (the Baron's chamber sees a large difficulty spike out of nowhere, you can't see hired swords abilities before you spend the 5000 gold, some enemies take an extraordinary amount of damage, and most of the voice acting is poor but not terrible). I bought this game for $7.50 and it certainly was worth my money. I hope it sees more development. I'd pay for DLC and even a sequel.			"

Imagine pinball with an epic story lineA great game! What a fantastic concept.I am working through it with my 9 year old. He likes the ""Old school"" games... But for him old school might be anything before mincraft.For the most part the concept is quickly grasped, but there is enough newness to the play that there are still challenges and a sense of progression.

												I'm a fan of games with weird concepts or improbable mix of genres. This is one of those games, and it does it very well. I've been fond of Pokemon Pinball since its launch, and I never saw any other game try to do something special with pinball (ok, there was Odama, but let's forget about it). Each of your balls represents a character and has its own abilities. Some are fast but deals almost no damage, some can heal your flippers, some are great at destroying objects, etc. You can switch between them, but when you lose a ball, this character dies (it can be revived, but basically this is your reserve of balls for a mission). The game is very short (I played it on easy and beat it in 2 hours), but you can always replay missions. This way, you can level up, unlock new characters and buy them better equipments. Seriously, I can't believe I'm talking about a pinball game right now.The level design is awesome, and it manages to convey a feeling of variety and novelty even though you're always playing the same pinball game. Awesome.			"

												If you like pinball you will probably enjoy this game as it puts an interesting twist on the classic experience.Whereas a normal pinball machine gives you so many tries with one ball, this game gives you one try per ball. The kicker being each ball is a character complete with stats and abilities that really change the game up. Some new characters are recruited through story progression whilst others can be purchased with gold earned in the game's stages. Upgrades for each character can be purchased by earning gold in each stage or through the skill necessary to unlock the games many treasure chests.Honestly I had given up on this game for a long time and I had seen many reviews talking about the difficulty. It used to be very brutal and I see how this can be a rage quit game. Yet with the release of the ability to change the difficulty between challenging  and casual I'm giving it the thumbs up. Stuck on a level? Drop the difficulty down. Raise it up on the next level and you will probably be able to pass it. Either way. Dogs/hawks and wolves, 7/10			"

												The point of this game is a pinball-driven combat system that's both strategic and skill-based. The table design is nowhere near Zen Studios quality, and the physics aren't quite as good as theirs, but realistic physics and traditionally-designed tables would probably actually get in the way of the game's core strength.Be sure to play on Challenging; if you play on Casual you're likely to end up ignoring some of the combat mechanics that make the game interesting. Challenging mode does encourage a little bit of level-grinding towards the end, but many of the tables have changes when you return to them later, so backtracking for gold and experience isn't as tedious as it might be.

												It's no secret that I <3 pinball, and examples of video pinball that let you do things that can never be achieved on physical tables. This game takes video pinball into other genres of video game in a more in-depth way than I've ever seen before. You control a group of people who are each represented by different pinballs; each one is made of different material and plays differently - your first ball is a ""rogue"" character who is a little polished wooden ball that moves fast. Your next is a ""knight"" character who is a large metal ball that often runs over enemies rather than bouncing off them. There are also water hazards that slow down the ball, which is interesting.Each level is a table (or multiple single-screen tables), often containing wandering enemies to target, or little physical puzzles to solve, to get through. That's a bit like ""Super Mario Ball"" or the old ""Crush Pinball"" series by Compile. There is also gold to collect on each level, with which you can buy new equipment to power up your characters between levels. This is something that's new to video pinball, as far as I know. It's an interesting addition!The graphics are very nice, the voice acting is diverse and good quality, the music is grand but pleasant, and most importantly - the physics seem spot on. There is only one issue with this game - it is too short! At least, it was for me. 6 hours and I've finished the game... and one hour of that the game was on pause while I took a phone call.I would certainly like to see more of this game. :)			"

YouTube™ Video: Rollers of the Realm (PC) : Impressions (Indie game RPG pinball gameplay and review) 

			Views: 1,067		

			Rollers of the Realm: Impressions Rollers of the Realm combines RPG elements with Pinball gameplay. It's an intresting indie game with an interesting take on genre blending.		

Rollers of the Realm takes 2 very different genres and mixes it up into one game. It takes the party building. character progression,  and narrative, of RPGs, and put it into a pinball setting. Each ball represent it's own character with it's own traits, stats, and specials. Each pinball table plays out more like an RPG quest than a traditional pinball table, where quest goals, and some times navigation are designed with precedence over classic pinball score attack.The game looks great overall. Each table / environment are well detailed and stylized in the expected RPG motifs, with some pretty impressive art design and lighting. Though some of the character profiles, the 2D illustrations, I found to be not quite as strong as the 3D models. The sound design is what you'd expect from pinball games, but throw in some grunts as you hit enemy mobs, and other classic RPG sounds when you do RPG things. As a game on it's own it's pretty enjoyable. The mixing of 2 very different genres itself grabs attention, and certainly playing an RPG based pinball game I was ecstatic at first! But as I played more I realized, through the blending of 2 genres, certain aspects of both were lost in the process. The character progression in the game is very simple when compared to other RPGs, while the tables are less exciting and creative than other pinball games due to it's need to be designed around a quest, or a goal, rather than score attack. So as a game on it's own, it's enjoyable, but when compared to either of the 2 genre it's blending it can leave a player wanting.Overall Rollers of the Realm is a very curious game, that the idea of blending pinball with RPG alone should turn some heads. It's enjoyable in it's own right, but might not hold it's own when compared to either of the genre it's blending. But if you are looking for a pinball game with RPG elements, there's not too many other options out there, and you could do much worst than Rollers of the Realm.Pros:- A very interesting blend of genres- Good Looking Pinball tables- Enjoyable under it's own merit- Easy to learn, very accessibleCons:- Good game overall, but doesn't excel as either an RPG or Pinball- Simple progression system- Some Awkward tables			"

												Wow, what a blast!  This game was an absolute treat that I have been waiting to play since I saw a demo at SXSW this past year.  The RPG twist on classic pinball gameplay was a fresh breath of air into a somewhat stale genre.  I could rant and rave about the voice acting for days - simply put it was phenomenal.  The multi-level stages were a ton of fun to play and every new zone brought with it unique puzzles and quirks that kept the game interesting at all times.  I have yet to really explore the arena mode but if it is the same caliber as the rest of the game you will get hours and hours of repeatable enjoyment.If you like pinball, excellent voice acting, and RPG gameplay, you will find yourself engrossed in this masterpiece from start to finish.  Happy flipping!			"

												I bought this game because I was looking for something similar to the all time legendary classic ""Adventure Pinball Forgotten Island"" and this one seemed the only similar one. For those unacquainted with the aforementioned title - it was a pinball with some creative interpretations in a colorful tropic island setting.Rollers of the Realm is an amusing, narratively driven pinball game. If you're looking for a different interpretation of pinball go for it. Unfortunately I have to say that there is too much focus on the narrative here for my liking, but I like the concept in general and I think it's worth buying.			"

												First Time Played.  Duration - 5 hoursRollers of the Realm is an interesting cross between pinball and an action RPG.  There is a story line which progresses you through a sequence of maps.  As you proceed you gain gold, experience and new companions.  In the pinball segment each character is represented by a different pinball.  The balls all have different statistics, some are small and agile while others are large and do lots of damage. You often need to fight enemies, smash through obstacles and navigate through different ""layers"" of the pinball table.  Overall, Rollers of the Realm is an interesting exercise and is short enough not to get stale.  If you want more game time there is an arena section with different challenges for a number of the tables. In between areas you can visit the port to hire more characters or buy equipment to make your balls better. You can reply tables for more experience and gold.  7/10 for its uniqueness.			"

												This is to pinball as Puzzle Quest is to Bejeweled. If you like pinball then it's definitely worth a look.As a weak to middling pinball player who still enjoys pinball games, the great thing about this game is that progressing through the levels actually provides a sense of achievement, instead of trying to beat your own score vainly trying to complete the minor objectives of a regular pinball table. The RPG elements are well done - each ball/character has a specific use and it's nice to be able to build up the capabilities of the ones that fit my playing style.The way that combat works on the tables is neat. Approaching enemies create a real sense of impending doom because they drastically increase the likelihood that you'll drain your ball, but you also need to worry about archers damaging your flippers, so you need to juggle your targets and characters.The major downside of this game is the balance often feels a little off - trick shots don't feel like they're very tricky, or otherwise simple levels feel like they're nearly impossible.

Probably won't be much of a challenge for pinball experts (although I'm only up to chapter 3 of 5, so that might change, and the difficulty seems to ramp up a little when you replay a level), but the concept is pretty solid and the presentation is good.Can't help but wish sometimes that the ""tables"" were a little more complex - many levels are quite simple in their design, but many of the boss levels are very well designed, large, and sprawling things, and there's the odd level here and there that'll make you go ""oooh, clever"".You'll easily get your $10 worth.

												When I first discovered this game, my first thought was that it reminded me of old pinball games like the 3D Ultra Pinball games. It's just lovely to see a creative pinball-based game after so long.This one mixes in a little bit of RPG elements, but not an awful lot, and strictly nothing you have to pay too much attention to. It's all about making the ball go where it needs to go, and there's a story to go with it. The story is nice, if not terribly original, and the characters are charming. Around the pinball tables are different kinds of stationary targets that award ""mana"" to use with special powers, moving/attacking enemy targets that block paths and attack your flippers, piles of money, chests and corresponding keys. The tables are varied and often consist of several playfields. Oh, and you can swap between different balls (RPG characters) that are of various sizes and other properties, and special powers that ranges from reviving to setting enemies on fire or launch additional balls into play. You can also directly affect left/right movement of the ball to get into difficult spots.The game is perhaps a bit short, with gameplay of about 4-5 hours or more (on casual difficulty) depending on your skill and how much time you want to spend on collecting money for upgrades. On the other hand, I've played shorter games that were a lot less satisfying. The game ran surprisingly well on the fairly low-end hardware I was using at the time, but in a couple of levels the performance was noticably worse than average. It's probably not an issue for newer/better hardware. The game supports Xbox 360 compatible gamepads out of the box, so I chose to go that route.Not much to complain about. It was a game I enjoyed, and will warmly recommend, at least on sale. I just hope they add some additional DLC content or a sequel, because I'll likely buy it!			"

												You go through a simple RPG story while you play pinball. I used an X360 controller (because it makes sense for me to use LT/RT for the left and right flippers) although it does allow for keyboard controls. You control the flippers and have limited control over the ball (you can make the ball go slightly left or right).You have a selection of pinball characters to use. The more characters you unlock, the more balls (lives) you have. If you lose a ball (you let a ball get past your flippers or down another hole) you can revive it by gathering enough mana. Each character has a different set of passive abilities/attributes and (usually one) active ability that uses mana. You can switch characters during the level as long as you currently have the ball trapped on the flipper.Levels are often (but not always) a mix of defeating enemies and getting the ball to target locations. Ranged enemies damage your flippers so you usually want to defeat them quickly. Melee usually just serve as blockers and can either block or hit the ball back at you if you attack from the front.As you hit things you gain XP and gold which are used to upgrade your characters. XP limits what is available to buy and gold is used to buy them. Upgrades allow you to have more passive/active abilities, hit harder, and control your ball better.Worth a try if you like pinball and like idea of a simple RPG layered over it.Other thoughts: It's a little annoying that you get nothing when you fail a mission. It would be nice to get a reduced amount of XP/gold. It's a bit of a♥♥♥♥♥♥move that the game opens a window just to tell you how much XP and gold you missed out on when you fail a mission. It would be nice to have the option to turn off vibration. Even if you're using the controller and haven't touched the keyboard it still displays keyboard icons. I liked to use the swordsman/healer combo against bosses. The swordsman's active ability deals a burning DoT that adds up while you're trying to land another attack and the healer is necessary to repair your flippers. There is one main healer character/ball that can heal your flippers. I believe there is another character(s?) that can heal but they need upgrades to do it and they don't do it as well. For me, that meant the healer was my most important character to keep alive. "

												It's not quite the best pinball simulation, but the mix of RPG elements and pinball mostly (but not entirely) works. It is an interesting attempt to push the quest, in all 1980s pinball games on, to build a narrative layer around one of the most quirky of ludic controls. However, the party size could have been smaller (just four balls to choose from would have made the most sense) and the level variety could have been better.			"

												Picked this up for $4 on the steam sale after watching some videos on youtube, loads of fun! The mix of RPG and Pinball is done amazingly through the variety of party characters (balls) and their upgrades which can be be purchased with gold or found in chests during the campaign.The arena adds plenty of length to the game as players compete against friends and strangers in online leaderboards on a variety of different boards. The 2 different difficulties means there's a suitable challenge available for both pinball wizards and more casual gamers.After 10 hours (on casual) I'm still playing the campaign and have only unlocked 3 arenas (which I spent some of the time on) so there's plenty of balls for you quarter if you want to replay old boards to get some extra gold for upgrades.

It can keep you involved for hours and becomes as frustrating as a normal Pinball game.The visuals are nice and they set the tone very well for each stage. The charactors area bit strange, being normal people that area as big as kids. The sound is okay. I never heard anything that really stood out from the sounds of the charactors talking and the pinball noises.Is it worth $10? Yes if you like Pinball. If you don't like pinball a ton then get this on sale for at least 50% off.			"

												Unfortunately Rollers of the Realm is hoisted by it's own gimmick: the idea that you have a variety of ball types (based on RPG classes) with their own stats and abilities for dealing with enemies, obstacles or terrain is cute but very quickly gets tiring once the appropriately gimmick based ""tables"" come into play. Bosses are guilty of this, particularly the last one because it is an extremely long level with some awful design decisions.Honestly if you have it and want to give it a good go, put it on casual because then at least you won't have to worry about grinding up to a decent level and to buy equipment. Also it becomes a lot shorter and more tolerable. There is an arena mode but after the story mode it just seems pointless.			"

												I hope you like pinball, because that's what this game is. But instead of the standard bouncing off bumpers and hitting targets, you will be bouncing off the scenery, hitting enemies and plundering loot.What could be just a cute skin on a pinball game turns out to be rather more than that though. For one thing the levels are a lot less complex than what many newer pinball games are like, but what it lacks in complexity it makes up for in variety. Throughout the game you'll be traversing ""tables"" on the theme of caves, castles, forests and cities. Sometimes even multiple things in the same table with some nifty transitions.The different characters are different balls, instead of being just a reskin though, they differ in abilities. The knight is a larger than regular ball, but he does a good deal of damage to enemies and obstacles he hits. The rogue however does very little damage (unless you manage to hit from behind of course), but is very agile. Agility is handled in game by being able to veer the ball left or right. The agility score of a character determines how effective this is. You can actually roll the rogue up slopes after some upgrades if you really want to.I've mentioned combat a few times now, and that's because most of the levels will focus on either hitting an objective or two, or killing all the enemies before proceeding. Apart from being able to knock your ball away, enemies can also damage your flippers, causing them to grow shorter and shorter if you let damage stack up. Some characters will be able to heal them however. This means you'll be trying to find the right character to attack with, and swapping to a healer once in a while when your flippers are getting dangerously short.Swapping characters is as simple as holding a ball in one of your main flippers and pressing the swap key to cycle through your available characters. Should a character die (down the drain marked by a skull), you'll have to play with another one until you've gathered up enough mana to resurrect a characters. There's a good deal of them, and yet in the later levels I've found death coming so swift I've had to restart a map on more than one occasion.The storyline of the game is nothing too impressive, but they've managed to at least give a sense of purpose to why you're in the map you are, and why you must achieve the goal of the map. Generally they're well voice acted, though one or two characters have had a few lines which felt not quite as well acted.My biggest problem/gripe with the game going in was that it looked to be rather short, packing in 6 chapters (unless this ""final chapter"" is a ruse and there's a bunch more). Regardless I've enjoyed the time I've played the game, and at €10 it's hard to expect more. This is a game I could see myself buying expansion DLC for if it became available.Pros:* Rather unique, not many other games have mixed pinball with combat and quests in this way* Good looking colourful graphics.* Runs well, I've yet to encounter any actually problematic technical issues, even on my modest notebook. (edit: It seems some integrated graphics chips has some texture issues, my system running throttled at 1ghz dual core and intel HD 4000 worked smoothly)* Controls well, what with the agility and the amount of flippers on the tables and fairly good physics, you rarely feel you're losing because of sloppy controls or bad physics.* It's cheap, always a good thingCons:* Nearing the end combat might feel like it's getting a bit repetetive* Length, it doesn't seem like the longest of games, but for the price it doesn't feel too short either.

An interesting experience and a deviation from the norm when it comes to Pinball games, Rollers of the Realm make you care about balls dying, paddles getting destroyed and literally everything but score.I must say I quite enjoyed the time spent with this game, working through the paradigms unusual or straight-up unheard of in the classic game of pinball. It is much like a careless stroll through the dungeons in an RPG games, but the party members are balls that confront quite human-looking enemies. They can die, be healed, use special abilities and even summon pets, all to prevent the enemy force from destroying your paddles so hard that you can no longer operate the table properly - which usually results in your balls meeting their end nearly instantly after being released.If you thought that is abstract, wait for me to tell you that the balls swing actual weapons and one of them shoots a bow... on top of your starting one being able to pickpocket NPCs on the stage. Why would she do that? To buy equipment that strenghtens your spherical party, of course! For all the things that should be obvious, I found myself scratching my head quite often, wondering how did it happen that people didn't make a game like this earlier (at least to my knowledge).The gameplay is as self explanatory as a modified pinball can get, and for the most part quite pleasant - the urgency of hitting specific objects is multiplied quite dramatically when they are capable of killing your paddles off, and  clearing all adversaries is the objective of majority of the levels. Not all, however - there is a fair bit of maze-like adventures that ask you to figure out how to juggle your balls well enough to traverse to the point marked as an exit, all while seeing treasures hidden in the corners and trying to get to them as well, for the sake of easier time in later, combat-focused stages. I would like to add here, that great many of 'combat stages' actually has additional quirks to them, so it is nowhere near as dull as one would expect from the very generalized name I assigned them.While I would like to say that the tables were consistently good across the entire game, that isn't the case, sadly. As the story progresses, the player is thrown into increasingly more crowded and smaller stages, where a single mistake can make them lose the ball in nearly an instant, while the onslaught that whittles away paddles' healthbars continues. This is really problematic because there is only one ball good at healing, and losing it places you in a serious trouble. While there is a secondary method of healing, it uses the same precious mana that is required for reviving the balls. I am aware that this is largely the issue with the balance of the game, but when combined with merciless table design, it turns the last few levels into a complete nigthmare for anybody not crazily skilled at pinballs (like me).There is a story to the game, and presented quite nicely - while I can't say the plot was particularly memorable (nor was the music) it kept the warm, familiar vibe of a fairytale, with well-chose voice actors for the entirety of the cast. No line felt like it was forced, as cheesy as it might've been. Really good job there, especially the Girl and the Knight.After the campaign is concluded, you are free to explore the arenas which prove additional challenges, usually about clearing already discovered maps off enemies, with their own sets of additional objectives. It is a simple device for a replayable experience. Doesn't hurt, but wasn't all that interesting for me.Overall: worth a play, will take at least a few hours of your time. If you want a high count of hours per-Euro, consider waiting for a sale. The 8h I have on the counter include replaying the final levels a fair amount of times.			"

												This game is a lot of fun.  I loved the idea of it, and the first couple of levels; but kept getting confused with the ""lean"" aka agility move (influencing the tilt of the ball while rolling).  After you beat the first couple of easy levels, go back and re do them a bunch of times for more gold and it really starts to sink in.  This game would probably work better with a game pad or controller; I'm mashing keys on a keyboard.TL;DR version: if you like RPGs and Pinball, just buy this thing.			"

												Despite being poorly made, this is still a fun pinball RPG... if you play on ""casual"" so that you don't have to constantly repair your flippers. An important tip: several characters have multiball abilities. Don't use them, and don't waste gold upgrading them! Unlike a normal pinball game where you only need to worry about keep one of the identical balls in play, secondary balls in Rollers are weak, the character still dies if its main ball falls into the drain (and it's often difficult to tell the balls apart in battle, especially with the Rogue's balls' dull colors), and secondary balls can't activate special board locations that advance the level. That last point leads to some almost buggy situations where, for example, on a very long board you can get a secondary ball up to the distant top of the board but the camera won't follow it. The only good part about multiballs is that the some of the Ranger's extra balls stick to enemies, so they're good for dealing with enemies that hang around right beside your flippers.Oh, and the game makes it sound like Arena levels are good for grinding gold. They're not. You don't get to keep most of the gold that you earn on Arena levels, so just stick to grinding on old campaign levels.The levels and enemies are so blocky and ugly that it looks like a port of an N64 game. I know that this is a low budget Canadian game, but there's just no excuse for a modern game being this hideous. (It even got $221,784 of funding from the Canadian government - where did my tax dollars go?!)So instead of creating challenge with intricate, well-designed levels and creative enemies, what does Rollers do instead? Enemies wear down your flippers until they're nubs, that's what. I could understand if there was a rare special enemy who could briefly deactivate your flippers or even delay them, but shrinking your flippers is just a bad, frustrating game design crutch. Having reliable, full size flippers is the one thing that you should be able to count on in a pinball game.I'm fine with hunting for a secret exit once in a while, but the game fails to tell you basic stuff like which button activates a flipper. (It's tough to remember in the heat of ""battle"", especially when the flipper points straight down!) On a level where you advance up to another screen, falling back down the drain should return you to the lower board, right? Nope. You just die.Balls and character are often needlessly difficult to tell apart. Some of the balls have textures on them, so it should have been easy to visually distinguish them, but it's like they were deliberately made hard to tell apart. It was almost shocking when the game finally gave me a deep red ball.Rollers is even terrible at giving you clear information in the item shop between levels - items have a wall of confusing statistics, and their flavor text isn't differentiated from the description of what they actually do. I guess the Canada Media Fund didn't give them enough money to afford italics? When you get a new character, the game shows you a summary of his abilities, which you NEVER get to see again. The wording on upgrades is so unclear that I'm still not sure if the monk can heal flippers by default, with an upgrade, or not at all.			"

This Pinball-RPG hybrid puts a twist on the standard pinball genre.Each ball represents a different character or members of your party.The characters each get unique abilities.Abilities that can be activated by purchase of items and collecting mana.A fun and different game.Then Rollers of the Realm should be part of any pinballers collection.I would love to see a Sequel!.

												One of the most fun and creative games I've played in a while. It's a pinball game with RPG aspects and there's even a story! All of the characters in the story are actual pinballs with different strengths and weakness's. Example: The knight is a big armored pinball while the rogue's is smaller and easier to control. Another cool addition is the ability to guide the ball in other directions, which helps give you more maneuverability than just using flippers. On top of all that you can do quests, buy different characters (pinballs), collect items to make your pinballs stronger and buy upgrades too.The keybinding for the steam controller works great for this game. I was able to play with the default setting without changing a thing.I really hope the game spawns a sequel.10/10!			"

												Absolutely NOT what I expetcted.  This RPG-Pinball game is the best possible combination of the genres.  I personally don't like pinball games very much, but the abilities of the balls (characters) compensate for the ""luck"" element in pinball.  Instead of ""tilt"" there is a no-penulty ability to influence your balls slightly left or right.  How easy this is to do is based on the agility stat.  Different balls are good for different jobs, and you can switch when the ball is resting on a flipper.The maps are great, well designed screens that are pinball tables that look like - well not like a table but rather a scene suited to the story.This really is an example of a well thought out game.  I can see how this could have been horribly bad if it wasn't so well executed.  Give this game a go, you wont be disappointed.			"

												I love this game. A HUGE surprise win after a short time playing. It manages to be a decent analog game (pinball), mixed with an RPG (something like a story, cuz everyone loves dogs. also upgrades and additional party members, um, balls), mixed with digital control (i used the steam controller for it and LOVED it) and together, it makes this game a truly 1 of a kind; a memorable meshing of things that don't even belong in the same sentence, much less a game together,.a very fun CASUAL experience (if you are looking for an easy brain dead game to play at the end of a long day, that while challenging, is still ""fun"" and achievable, TRY THIS GAME). this game is way out of left field, but a perfect way to kill some time without memorizing keybindings all night instead of, well, playing game and enjoying yourself. this game is easy to play, deep enough for a casual hardcore, yet light enough to play a few hours in the time needed to even learn another games keybindings. In other words, short time played, this game is EPIC WINinstead of ""which way should i attack them from?"" strategies, you now have the ""randomness"" of pinball to use to ""sneak"" through a level.The ""mazes"" of each level are pinball scenerios, and your balls represent different party members with different abilities. This game is a classic. if you even remotely like rpgs and/or pinball, you gotta try this game. it may not do either 1 perfectly, but it sure is fun!Well played!			"

												I don't really do reviews, so I'll keep this short.This game is good, really good. I think the reason I'm writing about this is because I wasn;t really expecting much from a pinball rpg, but the game is great. The voice acting is high quality and well delivered. The story starts a little slow, but is suprisingly engaging. The chracters are a bit generic fantasy fair, but develope through out the story and are well fleshed out.The game mechanics are really solid. Probably the best non-tradition rpg I've ever played. At its core its ofcourse pinball, but the various properties of different chracters(balls) lend themselves to different roles. RPG Mechanics help to define the chracters strengths and differences, and ofcourse let you lean on the style of play you enjoy. As for the mechanics themselves enemies serve as destroyable bumbers(essentially), different characters deal damage, and losing you ball will kill the character. But by amassing mana(points vaguely) you can revive characters or activate special abilities. Run out of characters and well you lose, Defeat all the enemies and or the boss and you win, or whatever other objetive a stage may have (collect x gold, break the statue). Ranged enemies and mages can damage your flippers, but your healers can restore them by collecting mana. The end result is a game that while starting off slowly and easing you in(early on you can't even die in certain sections), but ends up evoling into a hectic struggle to keep your characters alive and your flippers healthy. You learn when to switch your character for the different sections of the level and you probably end up replay the levels a few times.The end of the day the game is on the lighter side, but has a good amount of depth and is throughly enjoyable.

												Not great.  An interesting idea poorly executed.  The game lacks the sensitivy pinball requires for precision, but it demands that you hit specific targets, go up certain ramps, and attack moving targets.  Success or failure in missions is random luck more than skill, and characters special abilities basically range from distracting to useless.  Of particular annoyance is the lack of the ability to control bumper strength, meaning most deflections result in the balls shooting off at maximum speed.  I don't know if this game was built with pressure sensitive buttons on console controllers in mind, but it certainly doesn't play very well on PC.  Charming art style, interesting tables, just very bad gameplay.			"

												Summary at bottom for those who like that sort of thingI got this game in a Humble Bundle along with several other games that I had been wanting to try out. Fact is, until I copied over the CD key I didn't realize it was even in the bundle to begin with. So when I say I didn't really expect much from this title, I really didn't expect anything out of it. In fact, I thought, ""It might take my mind off of things for a few hours."" One weekend and part of a Monday later, and I just finished this thing (would have been much sooner except my laptop lagged on a couple of levels, forcing me to redo them).The game had me from the opening sequence. I felt for our poor little orphaned protagonist and I loved the knight. The story properly foreshadows the ending, while simultaneously creating a believable set of events that lead to it. I really never felt whiplashed because the characters leap into some complicated scheme that makes no sense in the wider context of the story (which happens all too often in video games). Everything occurs in a way that properly makes sense and is believable for the cast we're dealing with. And while we're talking about the cast the one liners the characters spout off were both mildly funny and never grew old (and I don't think they would after hearing them a thousand more times). All of the elements of the game tell us something about these characters, their hopes, their dreams, and how they live: From the drunken knight to the fiery barmaid, which for me, is how it should be in gaming. I even grew teary eyed during a few dialogue sequences, which considering how this is more of a short story than a Final Fantasy esque novella, it was really quite impressive. I was quite attached to a fair number of the cast by the end. I should also mention that the cast was quite diverse and didn't feel at all cookie cutter, which is refreshing.The game play feels like it is well balanced for the most part even though the campaign never really just completely devastated me. I did have moments where I used most of the main cast, though I did end up completely ignoring the last two characters and the majority of the hired hands (maybe due to the OPness of the Farm Hand). However, I think pushing the real limits of this game are reserved for the arena, where getting to the higher scores requires mastering the more 'squishy' characters and properly using the whole group. That being said the two easier characters in the game had to of been the Farm Hand and the Knight. If you want a more difficult game I suggest avoiding those two when possible. Though maybe do a few rounds in the arena with them, their one liners are pretty awesome.The pin ball mechanics played well with the story, plot, and level design. It was actually sort of surprising. It was quasi-JRPGish, but not in a way that made you feel like you were going down a hallway (it honestly didn't occur to me until I started to write this review just how JRPGish this game really is).  Additionally, I felt fully engaged with what was going on combat wise which was partly due to great visuals, voice acting, writing, and 'action' despite the fact that the majority of targets were stationary. The last pinball game that I played did feel very 'abstracted' as to what was 'said' to be going on, so it honestly caught me a little off guard as to how well this game played.That being said, there were issues. Primarily there isn't a lot of depth in leveling. All leveling does is unlock more bonuses and characters, so for those of us who like to power game by min-maxing characters or developing specific strategies (leveling wise), there isn't a lot there. I should also point out that while the story is very well written (4 out of 5 stars in my book) it is extremely short. I spent, I want to say about 12 hours finishing up the campaign, if that, which from where I'm sitting just makes this game all the more impressive. It might also behoove me to mention some of the characters are particularly well ignored. The Alchemist and Farm hand don't get a lot of dialogue in the main story (a few short lines north of zero). These are less big thorns in my britches and more me just being honest with people looking at this game. The devs have turned out a well polished ball of a game (hehe, I shouldn't do puns).I really do hope to see more games released by these developers. Not only was this project an amazing game that seems to respect the intelligence of the audience, but it also does it's part to create a very equal caste from a diverse set of backgrounds. It doesn't force anything on us, but there's a part of me that feels that good writing that doesn't force people of other backgrounds into race/gender stereotypes, bad guy only roles, and/or quasi-inferiority to other, more (culturally) privileged main cast members is something that really needs to take the gaming scene by storm. Though that might just be me (I hope not). Either way, I want to see more games like this and more games from this developer.To summarize:Pros:+Wonderful (but short) story that is fully fleshed out, both touching and mildly humorous.+Amazing diverse cast of characters that you'll grow attached to: Almost every element of the game gives us a chance to explore the personalities of our party and fall in love with them+Unique RPG battle system whose core is a pin ball game: Which is a lot more fun than it should be +One liners that never seem to grow stale and help us explore the personality of characters+Game play is well balanced for the most part+Arena offers more extended play for those that wish itCons-Extremely short story, which might be a problem for some-Leveling and RPG mechanics are rather simple-Some characters are especially ignored when it comes to writing-Some characters are kind of OP (looking at you Farm Hand)To Devs-Keep on keeping on (AKA, moar!)

The RPG boards are OK, but limiting.RPG elements: Clever use of balls as characters, but not much RPG mechanics otherwise. I'd call it an adventure rather than an RPG.Price: 10$ is a fair launch price.			"

												PRO TIP: RECRUIT THE FARM BOY BEFORE OTHER HIRED HANDS, YOU WILL NEED HIM.This title is quite daring, and largely succeeds in what it sets out to do. Combining pinball and RPG has never worked this well before, and it delivers gameplay that feels engaging and just honestly fun. Physics are a bit skewed, but you quickly learn to work with them. Graphics are stylish and overall very good, while the music is fitting and the voice acting is passable. There is quite a little bit of story going on during the campaign, and while simple, the characters make it enjoyable.As far as length goes, you can probably finish the main quest in circa 5 hours, but to really experience all that the game can offer, the time would be around 10-15 hours.

												I would not recommend this game to anyone that is used to playing pinball games such as Zen Pinball, or any 'classic' RPG style pinball tables such as Pokemon Pinball, Sonic Spinball, etc. . While this game tries to capture the spirit of previous games in the genre it completely fails to do so. Let's begin with some of the positives. It has some good voice acting, and an interesting design overall. Who wouldn't be stoked for an RPG pinball game? The RPG elements are incorporated into the playfields (more on that in a moment), and the idea is interesting.I don't believe the execution was very good however. To begin with the most glaring issue, the controller support is awful, and feels terrible. A patch was issued so that some players not using Xbox style controllers could even play, but even with my 360 and Xbox one controller it still plays poorly. The menus feel horrible with a controller, there is no 'dead' zone, so the selection is bouncing all over the screen. On top of this there is a mechanic where you can select party members once in the game. This mechanic again suffers from the lack of dead zone. So you're trying to swap characters with a quick flick on the stick, and you just keep bypassing them in the list, hoping that you'll make it there eventually. There are also unbound keys by default, so only the flippers and launcher/special ability button work on a controller. Consumables cannot be used straight out of the box.Once you get past the less than stellar controls, there are the mechanics themselves. You have some control over the ball when it is moving in regards to shifting its motion left or right. This is not done via bumping the table, but direct control on the ball which was extremely odd to me. After getting to the third area I've realized why they did this, and it's the biggest failing of the game. Almost every single level turns into a shooting gallery where you are attacking characters that stand in the middle of the playfield. There are three main types I've encountered: Guys that throw things/shoot arrows at your flippers, guys with shields you can only hit from behind, and guys with swords (sometimes with large healthbars), that try to knock your ball out. I wouldn't mind this if it wasn't the main mechanic for all but a few scant bonus levels but it happens all the time, and sometimes there are multiple waves of these enemies. It turns into 'get up around the side, try to cheese it by bouncing around on top of a guy using ball control, hope you do enough damage to kill them'. It's a poor design decision that leads me to believe they were unable to come up with more unique mechanics and tables that would enable such mechanics.This frustration and boredom of the tables continues due to the size of most tables, they're very small, sometimes there are a few screens worth of areas, but often times those sections repeat mechanics. Additionally there are issues where special character abilities don't work, for example the knight character can block the main area between the flippers so you don't drain the ball, but the ball can bounce AROUND this area, and still drain, totally defeating the purpose of his special ability.When looking at this game in a vacuum it might seem okay, but when you compare the mechanics here against older games in this genre, or even Zen Pinball tables, you can get more bang for your buck with a single table than I've played so far here (almost completed 3/6 chapters). The physics feel bad and floaty, the tables repeat WAY too many of the same objectives (hit this thing, kill those guys), and it just doesn't feel great, especially with the poor controller support, which to me would have been essential for this sort of game.I can't recommend Rollers of the Realm even on a sale, if you enjoy pinball you're not going to enjoy this game, it's boring, repetitive, and not challenging in a way that feels rewarding.

												Preface to this game: My experience in pinball is more or less limited to 3D Pinball Space Cadet.This game is a pinball game with RPG elements.  You have a variety of pinballs that represent different characters with different stats and equipment to upgrade them with.  You go through a variety of tables that represent a number of locations such as woods and towns and castles, following a more or less passable story.  It holds the story together well enough and the voice acting is actually quite good, which helps a lot.There are two modes, campaign and arena (a challenge mode).  A full run of the game on Casual difficulty (the other being Hardcore) runs at just about four hours.  The pinball play itself was solid and there was only minor difficult in the switching-pinball mechanic when the ball is held on a flipper, where a multi-ball would block the switch.  Each character you meet and add to your party has their own specialized usages and also serve as extra lives, with the ability to revive your lost characters via mana (gained from hitting most things and more from some placements).   A few characters feel more interesting and unique than others, but I ended up focusing on some a lot more than others as well.I think the main critique to be made of the game is that none of the boards have much individual depth because of the focus on the RPG elements and story progression.  That choice is fine, it just leaves the game feeling a little content bare because none of the maps feel replayable, so I don't have much drive to go back and play any more.  This might be solved in arena mode, but from the two arena mode tables I played it didn't really feel like it.  The variety between the characters feels both not unique enough and too unique at times, with some characters being specifically more important in some areas or not in others.  The last boss zone was especially annoying, but the game was kind enough to checkpoint on phase 3.  I got it in a humble bundle, but I probably wouldn't recommend it for more than $5 or so, and since it retails at $10 it seems likely you could pick it up on sale for that price.   The game's alright, I wouldn't object if someone asked my advice before buying it.			"

												This is certainly a novel concept, pinball mixed with an RPG. If I were to judge, I'd say it's heavier on pinball than RPG, since there's little customization to be done, just upgrading, and there's not much in the way of sidequests. The game is also pretty short, to its detriment - a maaaaybe 3 hour campaign and only a few arena challenges otherwise. I do think this is an enjoyable game though, as someone who isn't very good at pinball. The tables add more complexity as the game goes on and there are a few interesting fights at the end of the game, though the very last table of the game is a bit... ehh, difficulty spike-ish, to say the least. It's not too hard overall though. The plot is alright, not that special and on the short side of things, but alright. The voice acting is hit-or-miss, some of them sound alright and a lot more sound reeeally bad. Graphically it's fine and musically it's fine though nothing to write home about.My interest in this stemmed almost exclusively from the interesting concept, and I think it's well executed, but I feel a longer runtime and a bit more variety would've made this a better game. The extra arena challenges don't appeal much to me - I tried a few and didn't feel like doing any more of them, they're okay, they give the game some replay value I guess. I'd say get this on sale but probably not at full-price unless you're a crazed pinball fan.			"

												Rollers of the Realm is a delightful little game that combines pinball machines with an RPG: the balls represent your characters, each with their own set of abilities and strenghts. Learning when to switch between characters is the key element to success in this game, not just pinball wizardy on it's own.It's not a very long game, but after the campaign there are a number of arenas where you either compete against the clock, or try to score as high as you can until your lives run out. These offer a different kind of challenge to the main game.The boss battles especially are very clever, and while it does feel and handle like a pinball simulator, the tables are clearly fantasy rpg maps, and the bosses require some careful strokes, sometimes with the right character, to be taken down.Fun game for anyone who enjoys pinball, and the story isn't half bad either.

												Simple, short, fun.It's not the ""game changer"" that Puzzle Quest 1 was, but Rollers of the Realm is a fun pinball game that benefits from dabbling with RPG elements. You have a party of pinballs that handle differently and have different abilities. There's some interesting mechanics in there, like archers who will break your flippers and make it harder to play, and the Healer, who can repair them by gaining mana.The rest of the RPG elements are pretty meh. You can buy items, but most are just stat boosts that you won't notice. Story is pretty boilerplate, I don't even think most of the characters even have names, just their class descriptions. But it is fun. If you find it on sale and don't go in expecting Witcher 3 meets Midway's Addams Family Pinball, you'll enjoy it.			"

												A well made game, reminds me of the 3D Ultra Pinball series. Great game for both fans of pinball and casual gamers. And some RPG thrown in to boot. There is never any doubt about your goals and objectives at any given moment. Admittedly, the secondary flippers are often difficult to see, but a quick flip of the buttons reveals them. Sometimes you have to slip under a flipper to reach your goal.Take it from me, if you want a game you're looking forward to playing, this is it.			"

I'm not a big pinball player but this game has me coming back to keep playing it.  The story is fun and engaging for a pinball game and the levels are enjoyble.  The different characters/balls that you get are very cool and add a lot to the replayability of the previous levels (you can replay them for extra challenges and gaining loot).  All-in-all a really fun light hearted game with some interesting challenges.			"

												Thoroughly enjoyed playing this short but well executed game.  Good story, original concept and the visuals fit perfectly.  My only small critism is I found the healer a little to overused as the enemies would constantly damage the flippers causing me to always switch back to the healer.  The healer is also instrumental in the reviving of other characters, so one character dies I felt compelled to jump to the healer to build up enough mana quickly to revive them.  Maybe it  would be nice if a couple of other characters could gain a special heal ability for the flippers.....I haven't unlocked all the power ups, so maybe one of them does already and I don't know about it.A definite recommended game at the price.

												-Recommended if it's on sale-Let's get this out of the way: the game has bugs, is unopitimized regarding the performance and controls are twitchy. Just like in real pinball the game is sometimes unfair and your ball is busted so you will die a lot. You will have to grind for money and xp.When they boasted they're financed with help of a government pool I'd almost closed the game again as such games tend to be bad.No steam cards, only one save slot so it's really kept simple, you can customize controls though.However I still had fun with the game and the concept is quite unique. Your party characters are the balls, you can upgrade them they have different action skills, passives and feel to them. I had to play levels several times to win on ""challenging"" but I like it that way. I guess it's easier on ""casual"" difficulty.If you like RPGs and pinball chances are you can kill a few hours with this.			"

This is a very soft thumbs down. I'd say it deserves, at the very least, a positive or very positive rating. If this was an indie with a lot of negative reviews, I'd have probably left a ""Thumbs up"" do want to provide a less-than-rosy review highlighting the flaws. Personally, I think this is more of a ""casual puzzle"" game than pinball, really. I HIGHLY recommend skipping this one if you are playing with a mouse/keyboard. It works a crapload better with a controller. The most glaring problem I see with Rollers of the Realm are the poor, linear table designs. Most pinball I'm used to have longer-than-wide designs *for a reason.* That vertical progression is a key element of pinball. Finally hitting that ""secret"" and seeing what it does is part of the pinball mystique - Rollers of the Realm is easy for even a novice. Many of the reviews mention the lack of replayability, this is why. Understandably, Rollers of the Realm decided to do wider-than-long tables with transitions to higher part of the table. I'm guessing this is because 16:9 monitors are standard and they wanted full-screen capability. I'd have preferred a narrow, but tall design personally. Really, it just feels like you're playing on a really short table all of the time. The tables feel far more linear and less replayable than the typical ""pinball sandbox"" you're used to. The second problem is that ""death"" is semi-avoidable. You have a cleric class who can revive your party. All you have to do is get enough mana to do-so. I suppose you could create your own ""no reviving challenge"" to combat this mechanic.Mechanically, it works fine. Nothing is wrong about the execution of the game. You collect point and gold from bumping into things. If you hit an enemy enough time, you defeat them. There are a ""obvious"" puzzles to acquire a key which can be used to open treasure. What I don't like is that there are a TON of worthless bumpers that exist just to ""get you down the next corridor."" Basically, you have to follow a linear path to finish a level then have the option to end it or continue playing. I really wish you could toggle ""free play"" so the ""DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE"" was disabled every time you accidentally triggered the end of a level. RPG wise, it's extremely light. There is story and different classes - that's about it. It's really more of a series of medieval themed table than an ""RPG crossover."" You also have ""characters"" or pinballs with different functions. For instance, enemies slowly wear down the health of your bumpers. Solution is to use a cleric to repair them. It does add an element of gameplay, but could have been do much more.			"

												I really cannot get into this. I tried twice now, and I don't think I will be back. Rollers of the Realm is an RPG game that is played out through pinball mechanics. While it is an interesting premise, it suffers from the fact that pinball is a dumbed-down, simple, archaic game requiring little skill. This game also has other issues with a bulky menu system and fairly generic graphics.I got it on sale, but still have buyers remorse.Pros:+Interesting idea+It is polishedCons:-Pinball is too simple to be the fundamental mechanic in a full-blown RPG game-Menu system is a bit bulky and could use some refining-Story is real meh-Music is standard RPGReally, what I am trying to say is that this idea *could* theoretically work, but it would have to be something really fresh. This just doesn't have the magic. "

												I am recommending this game because it really tries to do something interesting as an pinball/RPG hybrid.An experiment in pinball that swings for the fences but doesn't quite hit a home run.  Each of your party members is a ball with different properties such as size, damage, maneuverability, and healing which can be augmented by earned items.  The physics of the boards feel like an old wooden version of pinball, which can take getting used to, especially when your ball gets hit in a way that tosses it over the board's obstacles.Each party member (all very well-voiced!) has a special ability which can be triggered when enough mana is collected from the boards.  Boards often take less than five minutes to beat and range from the interesting to the absurdly simple, with the player having to get their ball into a specific area or defeat a specific enemy to pass.  I think I would have enjoyed a board or two that could be played endlessly like classic pinball after the main quests were beaten.  Story mode will take about 5 hours to complete on a straight plathrough but there is little reason to return to the game afterwards.I love some of the puzzle aspects that shine through the duller filler boards, especially those which encourage (but don't require) the player to switch between different characters to finish a board more easily.  Unfortunately, these are more uncommon than not, but it illustrates the potential of the concept.			"

Now, given the title, brief half glimpses of screenshots and the icon (which is usually all I get with these games, by the way) I had assumed I would play an hour in a typical indie RPG game of some sort.  I was somewhat taken aback by the fact that this game is, indeed, and RPG, but instead of the typical RPG format, it is a digital pinball game.  Now let me give you a few facts first.  One: I am actually rather fond of pinball.  One of my side projects is a decent sized digital pinball machine, flipper buttons and plunger and all, which has gone through at least two full wood revisions.  Two: I am actually rather fond of most RPGs.  I am actually planning to buy a next gen console solely for being able to play Kingdom Hearts 3 (no shame) and if you look at my play history, the amount of time I have spent playing Tales of Maj’Eyal far outstrip most of the other games in my collection.These things being said, I am rather disappointed to admit that I find this game to be, well just kind of blah.  The pinball physics are interesting at times, but mostly are reminiscent of the tiny half size table top pinball machines you see in little kids rooms.  The RPG elements add a bit of a twist, but really just serve to try and keep your attention by choosing a different ball at different times, whereas for the most part you can get away with completely avoiding using any of the rpg elements if you have a decent enough skill with the flippers.  In the end, neither side of the game are attractive enough to me to be worth putting a lot of time into.  I will admit that it at least kept my interest long enough that I didn’t feel I had to slog through the minimum 30 minutes, but beyond that, I just can’t recommend this.Game’s Fate: I like pinball, but nope.  gone.  Its nice, but not worth the HD space right nowBuy/No Buy: If you like pinball, especially digital pinball, maybe.  especially while its on sale, but at the 10 bucks it usually goes for?  nah.Personal note:  also, apologies for my shame.  Not even two weeks in and I missed a review day.  Though admittedly I missed it to go see Metallica in concert, so not too upset about it.			"

DLC would be the next thing they need to add.  :)			"

												The last level of this game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bad, like, holy s**t. I was enjoying the game up until that point, but ending the game with that heap is such a massive f**k you to the player that I can't reccomend it. I seriously had 10 times as many game overs on that one section than I had for the entirety of the game up to that point combined. And then I quit because I had yet to make it even 1/4 of the way through the fight.Buy it if you're a fan of absurd 11th hour difficulty spikes, I guess.Edit: Just saw the developer responded to the complaints by questioning the masculinity of people who valued their time to much too bash their heads against that fight, classy.

												Who the ♥♥♥♥ thought it would be a good idea to hit targets with a pinball who either have perfect blocking skills, and who can just walk straight up to a place you're trying to guard and destroy it because you're a ♥♥♥♥ing pinball and therefore have very limited control over where you are launched to?♥♥♥♥ this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ it. And also, what a ♥♥♥♥ing funny idea - pinball. You know, the game where the ball can come straight down at your flippers and you can't do a damn thing about it. Welp, guess you lose a party member instantly! Nope, you couldn't do anything about it at all, because the ball came at you at just the correct angle to not be hittable by either flipper.-9001/9001. Stupid meme for a stupid game. NO.EDIT: WAIT, I FORGOT! THE VOICE ACTING! SUPERB! Wait until that ranger joins you. The guy who played him must have been stoned, tired, drunk, and also gave no ♥♥♥♥♥, because MY OH ♥♥♥♥ING MY, that monotone.			"

The physics actually works really well, the different characters have a different ball weight, and play quite different... there are quite some mission with secret treasure... and the story is quite entertaining. There is also a challenge mode where you need to get as much points in either 5 lives or be as fast as possible to reach a goal, with 3 achievements each... quite challenging! Was well worth the money.			"

												After recovering from the first ""WTF? I don't even..."" and buying this game just to see what it is like since the screenshots seemed nice, I was pleasantly greeted by some nice voice acting and presentation, and inmediately entertained when I started playing this well-crafted game.I tip my hat to the devs who got the balls (pun intended) to mix two genres as disparate as pinball and RPGs with such taste.It is however beyond me, how the game manages to remove most of the fun in the later stages, when the gameplay forces you into an either boringly defensive gameplay, punishing you with not being able to use the skills you spent the whole game building up if you ever miss a hit. This leads to some frustration as it artificially prevents using certain playstyles which also happen to be where the most fun is.			"

												Being a fan of RPGs and pinball, this combination immediately got my attention when I first saw the game. The idea of a pinball with a storyline is really great. Simple game mechanics with reasonable variance between the levels together with a cute visual style make playing the game a fun experience. The only drawback is that the campaign is very short.			"

												Excellent concept. Excellent physics. Not a bad story either. I find one has a tendency to pick favorite characters and use them the most, but the more challenging tables really force you to think about which characters will be best for the job- just remember to ressurect your healer. If your paddles are dead, no one lives.			"

												This is fun game. I don't really care for pinball games, but this makes them enjoyable. Each ball corresponds to a character you pick up along the way as you progress along the adventure path. I've not had time to finish it yet, but I understand that it was more difficult toward the end before a patch moderated the difficulty. A cute little game all-in-all with some well-crafted story-telling.			"

Every character is a ball, and they have stats such as size, agility, and damage, along with a mana-activated special ability.  This gives you a nice variety of tools to work with on most levels and provides some varying avenues of victory, which is always nice.The look of the game is enjoyable, and it has a decent story without taking itself too seriously.Again, I highly recommend this game, especially if you have even a passing interest in pinball games.

												It's a pinball game with RPG features. You have several characters who are each represented as different balls with unique abilities, as you work your way through a relatively deep story across about two dozen tables. It's fairly forgiving, with the ability to revive characters with enough magic, and there are lots of bonus items to purchase and gold to collect.  The final boss sequence is time consuming if you don't pay attention to the story, and the pinball is fairly loose (you can influence the ball, with different characters being more or less controllable).  There's also an arena mode that I dabbled in but didn't find particularly interesting. Still, there are some unique aspects to the game, and it was rather fun, if brief (I took about 3 hours to play through it), but then it is pinball, so you can always go back and replay it.			"

												The pinball puzzles, and trying to get those hard to reach keys and unlocking treasure chests is by far my favorite part of this game.  The puzzles take some problem solving, and it's satisfying to get the difficult-to-reach treasures in each level.  The only thing bad about this game is the horrible voice acting / dialogue / story.  But if you're only concentrating on game play enjoyment... this is a very fun and unique game!  My only other gripe is that there's not enough content.  There should be a wider variety of treasures, instead of just a couple per world.  The game is way too short, and could definitely use an expansion that continues the adventure and loot that you can get.  Just get better writers and voice actors next time.			"

												Fantastic pinball game that's not always ""pinball"", but that's what sets it apart from other pinball games. From ""stealing"" from townsfolk in a city, to ""escaping"" through sewers, and even ""exploring"" tombs, the game spans a large landscape. With this, you're not getting a ""few"" pinball tables, but rather a grand collection of tables that span an entire adventure. Other pinball devs are asking the same amount for a handful of tables (which are also very good), but for the same amount, these devs are giving you a grand adventure. I miss you NES Pinball Quest.If you love pinball games, just buy it!			"

												With some games, if you are a fan of one genre, you will say the game is like another genre. This game however IS a Pinball game AND an RPG in one. You go on an adventure fighting bad guys, looting gold and gaining XP, using mana, and hire mercenaries to join your party, all in a pinball game that actually has near traditional pinball physics. I mean it can't be all Pinball because it's an RPG. But it doesn't have all the elements of an RPG, because it's a pinball game. It has to be considered both, If you love either genre, you will love this. If you love both genres, you are probably already downloading it and playing it.			"

It could have done with more content though, it feels a bit too short and the story could have been more explained through additional levels. The Arena levels are fine for some replay value but I would rather have had more storyline areas instead. But then again it's a cheap game, budget might have been an issue here. All in all though this game has a good content to value ratio and I would recommend it to any RPG or pinball fan out there.			"

												It's an RPG with Pinball mechanics. It has magic, abilities, equipment, items and classes that instead of being just a gimmick actually have a real gameplay effect.You will be using all of your characters depending on the situation and all of them have their strenghts and weaknesses. Very fun to play but it can also be quite challenging. Personally I never expected the pinball mechanics to work as good, but they just do. And the story is interesting enough that I actually want to see what happens next.It is no wonder Atlus was interested in this game.			"

												What a great idea for a game! The end result is pretty good for a style of game never really seen before. I have to point out I love pinball and RPGs before reading any further. The story mode is pretty good going to different rooms or mini puzzle levels. Some of those levels have interesting objectives that can be a little tough. The items and characters you can collect is pretty fun. The game feels smooth and has good control. Its a little weird being able to have the power to move your ball left or right while its moving. You can switch which character in mid game to better get to your objective. The items aren't too powerful give you something to strive for making it a little easier.  I love the fact your flippers take damage and can break giving just a little more edge. The multi tier levels are a nice change of pace. Overall I think this game was a good idea and designed pretty good.			"

												A surprisingly playable and unique mix of genres, although it mostly boils down to just pinball with some different rule sets and a cleverly integrated story arch. It can get frustrating, but still makes for a fun casual gaming experience, and even better if you're a fan of pinball games in general.			"

												I don't even know where to start with how amazing this game is. I love the mixture of old school pinball and awesome RPG elements. I loved the fact that the different characters had their own traits, voices, and handling. I developed a few that were my favourite but would rely on the whole team to get me through some of the fights. Beautiful art, compelling story, challenging levels, great physic. Overall a really great game!  "

												Let me start by saying on real pinball tables I always prefered the older tables where you could control the launch via how far you pulled back the spring, and the buttons for the flippers you could somewhat control how hard you hit the ball, when tables switched over to the push button to launch and the flippers felt less controllable I didn't care for them. And that is how most all computer pinball games have felt to me, like they have all had the basic concept of pinball but lacking that feel and control of older pinball tables.Does this feel like pinball of old? No, not at all, but it does feel really good. It contols smooth, the tables (or level's have you) all feel interesting, and its all around a good feeling game with some interesting mechanics to help it feel fun to control, unlike most digital tables and newer pinball tables. Giving the game some RPG like mechanics is an interesting twist, and I enjoy the different abaliities the different classes have and how you switch between them. I think the only real negitive thing I have to say about this game is that the buying upgrades to make your classes stronger to ""fight"" harder enemies feels purely like a way to make people go back and play older tables again to grind some gold to add how long it takes to complete all the tables.  While it does give reason to play tables more then once as you go through the story it also makes previous tables more trivial as you get more and more stat upgrades, so it is kind of a double edge sword of forcing replaying slightly old tables while at the same time reducing the reason to play even older tables.Adding RPG elements into a game just to add RPG elements can often end up being bad, but in this case it feels pretty good with how the different classes feel and what they do, its almost as if someone looked at Runespell :Overture and went ""hey turning poker into a RPG when done right can feel really good, lets see if we can turn pinball into a RPG in a similar fation to Runespell Overture"", and it worked out, it doesn't feel like a mechanic tacked on to have a  gimick, it feels like a legitimit mechanic with a purpose in the game to make it feel more enjoyable to play.With that said, if you even slightly liked older pinball tables, or like the concept of digital pinball but don't like how most of them you don't feel like you have any real control, definitly give this one a shot.  At no point have I had a point where my death has felt like a ""quarter eater mechanic"" of having no control of the outcome, every death has felt like I just mis played it... And yes that is how I feel about older pinball machines compaired to newer ones, the older ones gave you better control, but as arcades started going away and as the fewer people playing pinball got better, they changed their controls to be ""quarter eaters"" much like how older video games where designed to have cheap deaths to eat quarters, on older tables I could play a single ball and earn extra balls for longer then all 3 balls of newer tables.

												The pinball puzzles, and trying to get those hard to reach keys and unlocking treasure chests is by far my favorite part of this game.  The puzzles take some problem solving, and it's satisfying to get the difficult-to-reach treasures in each level.  The only thing bad about this game is the horrible voice acting / dialogue / story.  But if you're only concentrating on game play enjoyment... this is a very fun and unique game!  My only other gripe is that there's not enough content.  There should be a wider variety of treasures, instead of just a couple per world.  The game is way too short, and could definitely use an expansion that continues the adventure and loot that you can get.  Just get better writers and voice actors next time.			"

												Excellent game so far after an hour of playtime. This is exactly what I wished it would be and even better.I love classic pinball but it's fun to try something else once in a while and this game delivers. It's family friendly so far, works great with a controller, story is fine, voices are good, good graphics, good music, good gameplay and it works fine even with a regular laptop integrated graphic card. Even if ball physics are not the most realistic, it fits the game very well and everything is well thought out and balanced.Only drawback I can find is that the audio is English only, which is expected.I should get another copy for my nephews to introduce them to pinball in a fun, fantastic way. Recommended. "

Rollers of the Realm is a Winner!I grabbed this on the recent Steam holiday sale and ... what a gem!This is to pinball what Puzzle Quest was to the match-3 genre.  Quite unique and very, very fun.My only knock on the game is that the main game is too short.  I beat it in about four hours.  There are a lot of other things to accomplish in the game (secrets & treasure in levels, also character upgrading, and the arena) but the actual storyline portion of the game was over far too quickly.I'm really hoping for some DLC or a sequel because I'd gladly pay for either/both.BOTTOM LINE:  If you enjoy pinball games, enjoy rpg elements to your games, and are sitting on the fence about the title, buy it.

												A bizarre concept in theory that works spectacularly well in practice.Without a doubt, I recommend this game, likely even at full price.The pinball mechanics are quite responsive, probably about two notches better than the level of frustration you'd experience playing real (or a more realistic digital equivalent of) pinball.The RPG mechanics reveal themselves in the balls.  Every character is a ball, and they have stats such as size, agility, and damage, along with a mana-activated special ability.  This gives you a nice variety of tools to work with on most levels and provides some varying avenues of victory, which is always nice.The look of the game is enjoyable, and it has a decent story without taking itself too seriously.Again, I highly recommend this game, especially if you have even a passing interest in pinball games.

												What a creative game! If you're a fan of pinball games and RPGs, the game is a must buy. The mechanics work, really really well. I'll revise this review once I've finished the entire campaign.I'm more than halfway done with this game and I'm here to say this is terrible and you shouldn't buy it. The game introduces more and more mechanics into the game that promote pretty poor gameplay. Instead of just pinballing and smashing monsters and mages and stuff, you end up having to not do anything until these fireballs disappear after you pinned them to side flippers and basically ruins the fun of the game. I will not be continuing to play this game due to these design decisions (AND THEY CALL IT A MINE... MINE!)			"

												This game is beyond awesome.  Fast paced and brutally difficult in places, but also colorful and light hearted, it reminds me of the fun I had with Tetris and Dr. Mario back when puzzle games tried to kill you just as much as Contra or Super Mario Bros.  That would have been enough, but you can also level up, recruit new characters and outfit your team with weapons and items that subtly change the way you play.  The secrets in every level are generally easy enough to unlock with your own observational powers and they do reward you richly.  And I was delighted to discover that going back to a level that I'd already passed doesn't simply rehash the level as it was, but gives a new and challenging experience on the same map, should you decide to partake in it.The only thing about this game that you will not enjoy is realizing that the hours of your day have completely evaporated.

												It's a pinball game with RPG features. You have several characters who are each represented as different balls with unique abilities, as you work your way through a relatively deep story across about two dozen tables. It's fairly forgiving, with the ability to revive characters with enough magic, and there are lots of bonus items to purchase and gold to collect.  The final boss sequence is time consuming if you don't pay attention to the story, and the pinball is fairly loose (you can influence the ball, with different characters being more or less controllable).  There's also an arena mode that I dabbled in but didn't find particularly interesting. Still, there are some unique aspects to the game, and it was rather fun, if brief (I took about 3 hours to play through it), but then it is pinball, so you can always go back and replay it.			"

												Pretty fun romp playing through this pinball RPG.  It is most certainly an interesting blend of two genres.The main adventure is rather short, coming in at about 3-4 hours.  The levels are varied enough with interesting mechanics that they feel fresh throughout the adventure.  Voice acting are a hit and miss with some characters having fairly good acting while some are just downright bad.  However, it's the kind of bad where it's so bad you just take the cheesy voice acting and enjoy it.Overall, if you enjoy a little story in your pinball and have a couple hours, this game is a great way to spend it.
