Defitely not my rig (it runs crysis on ultra).Tried the GFWL reinstall, crashed.Tried the DX10 trick, crashed still, now investigating ways to get my money back.Its a little amount but its the principle.Great game but doesn't work.

The explanation for the Windows LIVE sign-in not working (despite me having a whole Microsoft/XBL account) is ""something something something install GFWL"" and nothing works. Screw Capcom and screw Steam for selling a game that does not even work on most machines. It's criminal.			"

Unfortunately, the game crashed several times while I tested it, and I could not get the multiplayer to work.

												It's hard to explain why it's so ridiculously fun to hang underneath a high-rise bridge from a grappling hook and blast aliens with a shotgun... but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it is. Even though the singleplayer campaign is pretty fun, the multiplayer in this game is the main attraction. Specifically Akrid Hunter mode. It's essentially a 16 player Monster Hunter quest with guns, mechs, grappling hooks, and giant alien monsters. And you can even PLAY AS the giant alien monsters. Also, as you rank up you unlock tons of cool new character models and skins. All of this though, is from memory alone. Because I haven't actually been able to play online with steam. No, not because GFWL ""doesn't work"", but because NO ONE plays this game online. Why? because no one buys the game due to the awful reviews about GFWL. And a lot of people actually have the misconception that GFWL is now defunct. It's ridiculous. Contrary to what everyone else in the reviews say, GFWL works fine. Yes you might have to download the newer version if yours crashes, and yes it's not as streamlined as Steamworks, but damn it's really not that bad at all. Everyone acts like GFWL is the bubonic plague. People are really missing out on one of the most addictive multiplayer experiences I have ever known all because they are scared of GFWL. It's such a shame really. I mean you can get this game for like $4-$5 when it goes on sale. And even if your install actually does end up entirely broken for whatever reason, you can always get a refund.This game needs a resurgence in a bad way. Don't be afraid of the reviews. Give Lost Planet a chance, because holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's worth it.			"

												GFWL IS NOT SHUT DOWN.  THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO PLAY THIS GAME ONLINE ON PC!  MYSELF INCLUDED!Decent levels with fun bosses at the end of each one.  More content(single player and multiplayer)than the original, minus three playable characters which are replaced with three new ones.  Best multiplayer weapon balance in the series.  Multiplayer is still alive and still supports cross-play, however you can't chat with Xbox 360 players.  Mouse control not as good as the original, probably as a nerf to even the field(poorly) a bit with console players.  If you are on the fence about it, there is a demo available on the original's Steam page.			"

												I've come to the conclusion that this version of LP should actually be called the ""extreme pain in the butt condition edition"" AKA ""colonies"". I'll elaborate on that:It crashes constantly for no apparent reason, uses GFWL and caused my PC to BSOD several times in the process of trying to get it to work. On top of that, it successfully ruined a good portion of my weekend.  The game itself is actually quite decent so do yourself a fovor and grab the extreme condition edition that does not include GFWL painful buttsex and avoid colonies like the plague.0/10: the perfect gift for your worst enemy. Otherwise, should not be on sale.Edit: I digress...tried the DX9 launcher and it worked fine. I won't change the score due to the hassle I had to endure while trying to get DX10 to work.			"

												It took a while, but I beat the final boss, what a mangy coont. The game is actually rather difficult even on normal. When you're under fire from rockets and lasers, and they just keep coming, don't expect to heroically get up and fight the good fight. Expect to die.That's basically what the boss fights are like, or casual fights where there are multiple men in VS suits and people with rockets in your way. It's a real pain the the buttocks. I will say that the combat, while some of it has merit, the VS fighting at least; the on foot third person gun fighting can be annoying as you're basically running and gunning while trying not to get shot from the hundreds of enemies, human and alien, or akrid as they're called in this game. Basically, the combat is not the best aspect. I mean, the VS fighting is cool, you know, when you're not dying.The game's greatest asset are the graphics and, for the most part, the story. While most reviews criticize the story for being generic, because it is (sci-fi shooter set on another planet where evil corporation plans to eradicate all life in order to colonize it), the real story lies in the mystery of who the snow pirates are and what their purpose is. They're unkowingly defending the planet from complete eradication while also causing the genocide of the akrid. The game also has a sense of trust and friendship that probably wasn't mentioned in professional reviews. These character build a sense of trust to Wayne, the protagonist that is mysteriously unearthed and found frozen after the opening mission. You find out your father died and there's this whole conspiracy. It gets interesting while playing it cool and easy. The plot doesn't really get too complex nor does it make you think. You just run and gun and watch the cut scenes in between.The main characters are interesting but also very obviously written by Capcom because of the funny dialog by some side characters that probably wasn't meant to be funny (I'm looking at you Rick and Luka.) And the game also has the Japanese art with the characters except for Joe for some reason who looks like he was modeled by a dude from Burbank. I mean, the character designs weren't that bad, they just could have made them look more human and Luka probably could have used a different voice actress. Whoever voiced her probably usually works on animes as it was that usual soft female voice you hear in animes. I mean, she's supposed to be a bloody snow pirate, not some....I don't know, whatever.The environments are fantastic though. Great design and effects with the snow. The final gets kind of weird though. Suddenly you're thousands of feet in the air fighting some ♥♥♥♥♥♥. God, I hated Isenberg.The rest of the reviews I'm seeing on Steam are mostly negative because of complaints of crashing to desktop and GFWL. Look, the multiplayers dead and I don't think anyone reading this was even going to bother with the multiplayer. GFWL will work fine if you have an account already made, shouldn't be a big deal just to log in and play the singleplayer. I have experience zero crashes to desktop. But that's just me.7.5/10			"

												Once you get past the incredible hurdle, nigh insurmountable as it is, there is something incredibly fun about this game.Edit: passed mission 6This is marvelous fun. no hand-holding, just pure gameplay and a good challenge that is not so unbeatable as to be off-putting. tip of the cap to any who make it through any single mission without dying once, but honestly, the number of resets you might encounter only strengthen your understanding of how to best go about the level - and the pacing and excitement are perfect to make you just have to play until you get that darn level right. end edit. original belowIt took me a few uninstalls and reinstalls, all sorts of changes to graphic/sound settings, trying DX9 and DX10 . . . and so much more. I sincerely put about 8 to 10 hours JUST trying to get to finish the second mission due to sound issues and crashes... and then, somehow, someway, I hit upon the mix that allowed me to actually PLAY the darn game beyond prior crashpoints of mission 2. For me, it seemed to be running it windowed, altering my system's sound settings, and blood sacrifice (sorry poor mosquito) but I finally made it ALL the way through mission 2. Now I am up to mission 4, running in full screen and all bells and whistles on. and I am loving it. These are LONG missions. no save points. Just complete the mission or start the mission again. But damn they are fun. So far, through the 4 missions, the story has been entertaining and the gameplay, past mission 2, is just wonderful.I'm not sure if running windowed would make a difference for others, but if you faced the many hours of agonizing frustration that I endured because I could see that there is a good game buried herein, then I hope you succeed. and hopefully you can be spared the blood sacrifice part.

												I'm writing this review as a PSA - The game still works, as well as games for windows live AND the online modes. If you're running windows 10, set the version you wish to play in compatibility mode for win 7, and google games for windows live to get the latest version from Microsoft. After installing that, launching and signing in, the game launched for me without any issues. The game signed me into games for windows live, and I even checked the online multiplayer. there was at least one active lobby so players DO still play this. Anyone who wants to play this game, I suggest trying to get it working again, because I got it working by doing what I said above. Would be awesome to get more people back into this game!			"

												Works perfectly for me on my laptop. No issues when first installing, no crashes as of writing this review. I did download the game for windows live marketplace client just incase. Loaded up the game it told me to sign into live, i did (but i had to give it access to internet because i have a firewall) said downloading Windows live profile (but the download bar wasnt moving) then i waited a bit. it then said it wanted to install an update for windows live, i did. installed update relogged into live inside the game and it loaded the profile. No crashes happened during the whole first mission, and it even loaded up my achievements from the xbox live account i used.The game overall is fun, interesting story, and it even continues with two more sequels. What more would you want from this snow pirate akrid killing VS driving game?NOTE: i tried multiplayer online and didnt find anyone (its an old game im not putting anything against it) but i did see a few twitch streams that had mulitplayer set up so im sure if you find someone to play with you can do it.TL;DR It works. if you have problems its probably on your end not the game.Game was played on an Intel i3 2310m and Intel HD 3000 graphics chip. Lowered the shader to low and it ran at 30fps :P			"

												Windows 10 64bit user here and the game works for me in both DX9 and DX10 (DX10 has more graphics features).

With the latest driver I even have the option to run the game at a virtual resolution of 3200 x 1800.  The frame rates are very good (60fps with my monitor) at that resolution too but they take some dips during intense moments.  Good news for 4k users.The game itself is a classic and the graphics hold up very well despite it's age.  It has a good mix of old and new school elements, gameplay wise.  I found the game challenging on normal when I first played it on the Xbox 360 but there are various difficulty settings to suit your needs.  If you enjoy challenging intense shooters with aliens, mechs, explosions, and special effects, this is for you.			"

The gameplay is easy to grab quick enough, altough the gameplay either has you feeling invencible in one mission (You know your not going to die anytime soon) and completely helpless in another. Aside from the fact that boss matches leave you knocked down for 4 seconds as you despretley wait for you charcter to get up, it is a good play through. The story is intresting enough, as well to keep you playing through.			"

It demands to survive with low thermal energy in a short time-rate because without the thermal energy the protagonist will freeze to death. The enemy boses are huge and they can challenge your abilities to survive - each enemy has different attack tactics and you have to use different ways to defeat them. There are awsome VS and varied machines which you can use. The story and the main characters are emotional and the purposes are reasonable. This game is a ""must-have-game"" !			"

It has everything you want from a great third person shooter: Great Graphycs, Great Gunplay, Cool Gameplay mechanichs, KINDA great story and great pacing (its hard to get bored). So its a Great Game, thats worth playing.  BUT for THIS PC version there are REALLY big problems. -IF you are a proud user of good old Windows Vista than there are no problems for you - buy the game, it works like a charm.  -IF your OS is Windows 7 or later versions I have bad news for you. The game acts almost as if IT DOES NOT WANT YOU TO PLAY. It crashes unbearably often, it freezes after playing it for a certain amount of time, it does not always start up. And there seems to be a fix to that. It requires you to delete a certain update of your OS; or alternatively rollback your OS to a certain version. In my case it screwd up a whole bunch of software. Ready to take risk and fiddle with your OS to play this game? Go on, buy it. For the rest I tell this: !!!DO NOT REPEAT MY MISTAKE - DO NOT BUY THIS PC VERSION!!!			"

												The world ended and it’s very sad so we all decided to live on planets infested with giant insectoid creatures, freezing tundra’s and bloody ice pirates. Still it could be worse; at least there is no oppressive government regime who wants to crush….. oh wait.So this game is alright, it has not aged all that well, the controls are frustrating and clunky and the graphics are really showing their age but I did enjoy my time with this game, at least in single player, multiplayer was DOA I’m afraid. The enemies were pretty good too, I liked the way you had to go for the glowing weakspots and collect the goo that comes out. Simple pleasures I guess.For new gamers I would probably skip this title but if you have fond memories of the game when it first came out, like anime or love mechs then yeah it might be worth picking up on sale.Have Fun ːMMForFunː			"

												Lost Planet was Capcom's attempt to get in on the sci-fi shooter genre, and it was certainly an interesting attempt. Similarly to what they'd do with Dragon's Dogma years later, it takes the general idea of the genre and combines it with aspects of other games, both by them and other companies, to make a unique and overall fun experience. It feels part Halo, part Gears of War, part Monster Hunter, and part Armored Core all at once.The singleplayer campaign is pretty fun, with interesting enemies and environments to get by as you progress through a pretty decently-written story. The voice acting isn't all that great, but it's certainly not unbearable. The final battle can be a pain in the butt, though, given the altered controls for that sequence.Whilst they've added plenty of cool multiplayer modes to this particular iteration of the game (like Akrid Hunter, which appeals to the side of me that's a sucker for modes that let you play as the big monster enemies), it'll most definitely be tough for you to find a game online now, especially if you're not using an actual Games for Windows Live account.Speaking of, this game won't work if you can't get Games for Windows Live to work. I'd recommend looking into setting up an account, however you can, and if that doesn't work, using the guide on the Community Hub for this game to set up the workaround.Overall, I'd recommend Lost Planet: Colonies, if you can get it to work.

												I actually enjoyed the game.It's  a not very great shooter....but then you got into the VS suits, like mini-mechs and thegame just went up a level. My only bug-bears were:- The energy source effectively acted as a timer on each level.- I found that I would work through a level and suddenly be up against the Boss, with no warning and I was at a low point of energy/time/weaponry leaving me no other option but to replay the whole level and prep myself for when I knew the Boss  fight was. - There was also some weird (console inspired?) auto-aim. Not a major problem unless you are desperately trying to hit a fuel barrel that will take out a whole mob but instead the auto-aim keeps your shots going at a single enemy you are trying not to hit, very frustrating.I only played single player, I hear with GFWL the multi-player is closing down so if that's what you enjoy then maybe give this one a miss.

												Ok game. Its a nice change from all the open world games I play to have a game that is based on levels and no back tracking and limited exploring. The game is straight foward and works well. I did have some issues playing this due to a Microsoft update back in March of 12 but uninstalling it fixed the problem.			"

												Lost Planet proves that Capcom still knows how to make a fun and engaging game. As a single-player game, Lost Planet provides a thrilling action-adventure that really feels like a fun adventure. You go places, and despite the game taking place on a snow-bound E.D.N III, there's a lot of different vistas to visit in the game which host a wide variety of enemies, ranging from armed dudes to giant robots to even larger giant bugs. What's even cooler is that if you can get your hands on a mech, you can ride that mech! A lot of them have unique features making them useful for various situations, on top of that they can be equiped with the various mech weapons you'll no doubt find throughout the levels.When you're not in a mech, you have the same kind of mobility. You can equip two of the various no-frills weapons that are available in the game as well as a single type of grenade. What weapons you decide to take with you make a significant impact on your playstyle. Rockets are handy to keep on you should a giant bug come at you (Which happens often,) but ammunition is few and far between, forcing you to stick with a different weapon until the situation calls for explosives. If you happen to come across any large mech-weapons but there are no mechs to be seen, you can still pick them up and use em, but you can't switch weapons without dropping them. On top of that, you have a grappling hook that you can use to get to higher levels and for (slightly) speedier travel. The only problem that I had is that getting hit can lock you down for a moment longer than you might want to be, Monster Hunter fans will know what I'm talking about. But perhaps the biggest gameplay feature is the thermal energy sysytem. While you do have a typical health bar, your health will regenerate as long as you have energy, which is dropped by enemies and can be found from destroying some of the game's destructable environments. The thing is, that energy drains over time, even moreso when you're doing various activities such as jumping, or being in a mech. This, in my opinion, gives the game a sense of urgency. You'll be making decisions for yourself, ""Should I keep moving forward or take the time to look for spare energy?""The boss fights in the game are big, monstrous and provide a good amount of challenge, a lot of the time I found myself in various do-or-die situations where I was down to my last rocket and was running dangerously low on energy. These are the kinds of bosses that I love to fight, ones with big, high damaging attacks, health bars the length of the screen, and a lot of variety to make them stand out from the other enemies you'll find yourself facing. And defeating them feels oh so satisfying.All in all, Lost Planet feels like a proper game. This game is a textbook example of how a good action-adventure game should play and a reminder that while Capcom tends to make some really dumb decisions, they still know how to create a memorable experience that stands out amongst the crowd.

												Getting the absolute negative out of the way. The boss fights are complete ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, especially as difficulty increases. The game even resorts to cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like having the time between boss defeat and mission end increasing on higher difficulty levels in an effort to ♥♥♥♥ you over by running you out of T-ENG. This is an obnoxious design choice. Not only that, but the vertical pitch is limited to about 75°. Bosses that fly love to hover on top of you and your character doesn't go transparent to allow accurate shooting.Annoying as this ♥♥♥♥ing is, the game is still damn good. Visually astounding, but not cutting edge. It's just a clean and well polished world that looks and plays great. The gameplay is frantic and fun and the story is reminiscent of '80s anime. This is a game that loves to be a game and I ♥♥♥♥ing adore it because of all this. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t boss fighting and limited aim are about the only real downsides, though I anticipate for some it'll get repetitive. Highly recommended despite it's frustration factor. The only way it could've been better is if it had co-op. Well worth the $15 for the standard and $20 for the Colonies edition.			"

												I`d love to review this game properly but as I can`t even get it to run past the cut scenes I can`t. - GFW is nothing but a nuisance, DX9 won`t even load  (just crashes every time) and DX10 crashes after or during the first few minutes.Edit:- 3 years on and I`ve still NEVER been able to play this title, the 79 minutes you see on my profile are 79 minutes of pain with GFWL, altering router settings, executable attributes, hair pulling and cursing. I`d have requested a refund but that didn`t exist at the time of purchase, (thank god it does now). That doesn`t help me unfortunately.Do your self a favor and steer WELL clear of this ""game"". You MAY get it to run but the chances are good that you`ll struggle too. At least you`ll have the option of a refund.			"

												Konami should be ashamed of themselves, and I will think twice about buying anything from them in the future.This game is literally a train wreck port, and they couldn't have put LESS effort into making this if they tried.First of, it wouldn't run at all. Running the app would do nothing. After looking around, apparently that is caused by Konami giving the wrong version of Games For Windows Live (GFWL). Great, after all these years, they didn't update this. That's disgusting, and against the whole idea behind steam, automatic updating and allowing PC gaming to be intuitive without having to trawl the internet for patches and fixes.So I download GFWL and the game loads. YAY!Click start. they screen greys out and reloads the title screen. Click start again, screen greys out and reloads the... yeah you get the picture.So i hunt around for ages finding out what it may be. Find some guides out there, and completely clean out GFWL and everything related to it, and reload the XBOXONE version.I'm sorry, but that is disgusting. Most people on forums seemed like they gave up trying to get this game to run. Steam should take this game OFF the store until it is patched, as it was never fit to run.Ok, but after loading everything is good right? WRONG!!!Everything is mapped to the xbox controller. Press A to continue? Press B to go back? My xbox controller isn't even plugged in. It's a shooter so I want to use keyboard and mouse. But no, Konami litteraly ported this from the xbox and didn't even change to XBOX controller graphics and input. Ok, but you can set your own controls right? Yeah...But then when playing the game it tells you, press RB to do this... ok, what is RB again, or what key have I assigned that to... oh.... that's right... YOU CAN'T CHECK THE CONTROLS WHEN PLAYING THE GAME!!!!so exit game, back to start screen, look at the controls in the options... OMG...When people say Console gaming is better than PC gaming, they are obviously using this complete turd as the example to prove their case. Do not buy this on PC. Do not support Konami. If you absolutely must play this game, get it on the console where it was actually designed for.Shame, as although the game is good enough, it's destroyed by both Konami and the steaming pile that is GFWL.

												One thing about this game that's very upsetting is the fact, that the game frequently crashes under directx 10 on windows 7. So in order to avoid these issues, you'll have to run the game under directx 9 instead, unfortunately.Even though the game controls alright using a gamepad, you can tell that it is a console game. The game's storyline is being presented through cutscenes every once in a while, but even those aren't that well done and fail to draw the player in. Missions are very linear and not too difficult, with the exception of the occasional boss encounter, which can be quite challenging. The final boss encounter was pretty frustrating, because I had to defeat him 10 times in order for him to actually die - just getting his health to zero didn't seem to be enough.If you do not strike him with a fully charged sword attack, he can't be killed.5/10			"

I don't know how to search through my game files to fix problems like this, nor should I have to, but Steam seems to think otherwise.

												+Summary at End+So, the game I never played. Originally my first showing of the original Lost Planet was a demo I'd gotten from a magazine back on consoles. I was impressed by the levels, visuals, and the enemies available to fight but I never did buy the game, not until I saw it for sale on Steam. Before I begin I'd like to mention the order I've played the series, 2 -> 3 -> 1.Note: No multiplayer review.Now, the visuals are still nice to look at and it has this unique visual appearance that I can really only compare to a diorama. It's like playing a game make out of a diorama, not sure how much sense that makes but to put it bluntly they still look good and the style has stood its test of time. The sounds however, are forgettable, I just finished the game yesterday and honestly I can't recall any of the music in the game so audio is forgettable.Combat gets repetitive, by default a aim assist is enabled that makes shooting anything specific a huge pain, in one example I was trying to shoot a bad guy that was standing on a container, aim assist targeted his ally hiding behind the container. Horrible. The mechs you can drive are fun and being able to load out a weapon you want is great however a mechanic of the game keeps you constantly moving through the level, your thermal energy, and using a mech drains it faster, jumping and dashing in the mech drains it even more and eventually you have no choice but to use a mech to make it through a level so there's a lot of moments where you can't stop for long and have to just put your head down and charge through a stage.The boss fights are fun though, barring a couple of them, they all have a trick to them that you'll have to figure out before you can take them out though some of them are just brutally unfair that part of getting past them is based heavily on luck.Now that the gameplay and art is taken care of, lets get to the toted points of the game back in its day, the story:After having played 2 and 3 before it, I can tell you that the story in this game is horrible. The character have absolutely no depth to them at all and seeing what supposedly happens to Gale after playing 3 (a prequel) it's just cringe worthy. It really goes all over the place as well and during some scenes I really had no idea what was going on to be honest. Every one is about as stereotypical as it can get and their actions are just so... stupid that I'm surprised I didn't get nauseated from all the eye rolling I'd done during the cinematics. Speaking of the cinematics, they're everywhere. The levels themselves (only 11) are already long, taking over 20+ minutes to complete if you just run through the level and even longer if you take your time and not counting repeating checkpoints.. So having a 15 minute cinematic at the start then a 5 minute cinematic in the middle of a level then another near the end then one more for good measure... Good god there's just too many interruptions. And its not even INTERESTING!So, summary.Graphics - GoodSound - ForgettableGameplay - FunStory - Is this fanfiction? (Bad)Don't even bother with this one in my opinion, 2 & 3 are much better.			"

												There's a few reasons not to buy this game. First of all, it uses games for windows live.  Second, it's really dumb.  POSSIBLE SPOILERS:   The game is set on a frozen planet that's so cold it can kill you within minutes of exposure (however, it's apparently not too cold for everyone to run around outdoors with their faces and cleavage uncovered).  You are a snow pirate (although you spend at least one level killing other snow pirates for reasons), pitted against a corporation who wants to terraform the planet and get rid of the giant insectoid natives (which you also want to do).   Along the way, you'll meet a boring cast of characters with dumb names and even dumber haircuts (one villain in particular looks so ridiculous that it's impossible to take him seriously).  You'll assemble a team of companions who never really do anything, and yet who you are expected to care about.   They live, they laugh, they cry....often at completely random times.  And that's about it.  You'll fight your way through some hellscape filled with giant monsters only to find them already waiting for you so they can randomly emote and waste time.  They are so inconsequential to the action taking place that it often feels like someone just inserted scenes from some unrelated anime in between levels.   They could have just said ""Go kill the bugs!"" between levels and saved you an hour of your life.  All that being said, I was still pretty close to recommending Lost Planet because it's just so fun.  The level designs and gameplay are great (if a little dated).  Most of the boss battles are epic, pitting you against a number of different gigantic monstrosities.  It was almost enough to offset the dumb story and even the presence of GFWL...right up until the last boss.  Where for some reason, youll end up playing a completely different game altogether.  Literally none of the skills you've just developed over the course of the 10 or so hours you've played will be of any use. The final boss battle is so frustratingly out of place that it's the nail in the coffin for me recommending this game.  It's too bad, really.   There's a great game buried underneath a lot of bizzare design choices.  Even the story may have been alright if it wasn't presented so poorly.			"

Choppy as hell, you get cut out of a lot of details that =could= be well exploited for a better narrative, buuuut...To be perfectly honest, from a game with Keiji Inafune's seal, I expected much more.With that said, you should play it anyways, if anything, as a tutorial for Lost Planet 2, the story-free sequel. Now THAT redeems what this game didn't scored :D			"

												Just one of those games that doesn't supply a great experience.  Not missing a thing by passing it up.  Not a terrible game just not worth your time.The best snow effects I have ever seen but thats allStory was not very good (and i am being nice)3/10 not worth it			"

												This is a decent game for its age, its a good bit of variety on the level style, mix of large and small akred. The bigger weapons feel powerful and do a lot of damage which was lost in the second game likely to balance multiplayer.The game is enjoyable however when you reach the final boss turn it off a throw it in the bin. Final boss is typical grade A japanese bull$#!?. He has shields and weapons which werent in the rest of the game. Only moves that work on him are melee everything else hits his infinite shield. He then spawns turrets which cannot be hit. Very frustrating and for that I would not recommended buying this game instead have a go of a friends.			"

												I got this after hearing about it over and over again on forums etc. with people seeming to have a positive impression of the series. They must have been talking aobut some other ""Lost Planet"" because this game is terrible in more or less every possible way. Terrible animation, voice acting, plot, gameplay, level design... I think it's only redeeming feature is that it has a grappling hook, and even that isn't enough to save it. I REALLY don't reccomend this game, it's so bad that I couldn't even bring myself to beat the last boss, I just said close enough and looked up the ending cinematic on youtube (which as big a waste of bandwidth as I expected it to be).

												Out of respect to how good this game was and still would be if it had an active playerbase (Or went F2P to encourage more players to pick this hidden gem up), gotta recommend it. Played it for hours upon hours back on the Xbox 360, the MP always offered something new and Akird Hunter is easily one of the best gameplay experiences ever to grace my eyes. Asymetrical combat has been tried and tried, with varying levels of success.LP:EC:CE (Woof) got it down to a T, the tension when being hunted by humans and akird alike, the thrill of taking an akrid head on in a Hardballer or the thrill of ambushing a large group of humans with a large swipe, finishing off the remnants that didn't go down with the first swipe...Capcom. Lost Planet 4 needs to do this kind of magic again. If there's ever an organised player event to get the population up...Woof, you'll remember the times.The game also looks pretty, the lighting effects have aged well, the character's look great and the maps look stunning, with a mix of tundra, fortresses, tropical islands, 8-bit arenas, towering urban skyscrapers, deserts and even mountainside mining facilities.To end on a downer note, the population severely restricts the ability to do this, so I can't recommend it at it's full price, but if it's on sale, save it for a rainy day and keep an eye out on the discussions and groups. You never know.			"
