												Great game to waste time on from driving around, blowing ♥♥♥♥ up and collecting things. Though extremely repetitive, this has kept me entertained for 90+ hours. (and over 150+ hours on the free multiplayer mod)PROS+ HUGE world map; we're talking 400 sq. miles (20 miles x 20 miles)


JC2 World Map IRL 
Community Created Artwork for Just Cause 2
By: David Duke Nukem

			This is the exact size of the Just Cause 2 world. 400km sq if I recall (20 km / miles squared)		


+ Great graphics (esp for 2010) that still hold up a half-decade later+ Most PC's can easily handle this; a $100 GPU will max it out at 60 fps+ Lots of mods available + JC2MP, which adds much more things to do (and is free / 30mb)+ Blowing up ♥♥♥♥ is fun+ Lots of vehicles to utilize + Perfect Draw Distance; you will always see the entire world! + Nice weather system+ One of the best Sandbox games out there+ Affordable; 15$ normally; 2~5$ on saleCONS- Extremely repetitive; you're basically just blowing up stuff for most of the game- Dialogue / Missions are cheesy / bad- World is far from ugly / barren, but there's few secrets / interesting points of interest- Driving isn't the best- Combat can get out of hand fast- Little to do outside chaotic actsThis game will run very well on most computers as long as they have some power. If you can play CSGO at all you can play this. I have a lower mid-range PC (GTX 750 Ti / crappy old 3.0 Quad core AMD) and I have this maxed out at 60 fps at 1080pIf you love sandbox games this is a must-have, especially if it goes on sale. Overall, a B+ ~ A- game; it's a must-have for any sandbox fan.			"

												For those looking for a very wide open area to able to wreak havoc via a variety of different weapons and vehicles, this game is great.  It does have some drawbacks, the AI enemies are pretty easy to beat and some of the controls are a little off.  But overall I highly recommend JC2, especially if you can pick it up on a deal!			"

												The very definition of sandbox action. Sure, you can play it for the story, which is as trashy as it is charming, but where this game truly shines is in its free-roam action. There's so much to blow up, so many vehicles to drive and fly and so much crazy fun to be had. Oh, and you have a grappling hook. That thing alone can be used in such ridiculously fun ways, you will ask yourself where the time went!			"

												months of mindless, fast-paced, explosive fun. The map is enormous, beautiful, and diverse. There is a multitude of weapons even without the DLC. The combination of the grappling hook and parachute is the best duo since peanut butter and jelly. If you think it gets gimmicky, it doesn't. It makes you wish more games had such inventive ways to move around. The people who made this game are geniuses from the streets of the cities all the way to the Mile High Club. Seriously get it.

												Open-world action game as it should be. Just Cause 2 has that great feeling of absolute freedom - go anywhere, drive anywhere, fly anywhere! You can get to any place on the huge map in just few seconds, you can be defeated without any penalties - this game is here to entertain you, not to blow your mind or make you angry at your keyboard.Two unique devices underlying the awesomeness of Just Cause 2 are grappling hook and infinitely respawning parachute (infinitely resp...? aw, forget it). Tons of fun guaranteed! Every action game should have it - I really missed them in Far Cry 3. ;-) It brings so much variety and joy in moving and fighting that you'll be travelling for hours here and there just to use them again and again.The world is really good. Yes, most of the cities and villages are copy-pasted, but there are so many different regions on the map with different climate, weather and views that you'll never get bored. Graphics is on the level too, especially fire and explosions - you'll get addicted to blowing things up! Story and quests are not the strongest part of the game, but they do their job. Another feature worth mentioning is the hidden items' search radar - in my opinion, really great idea. It is finally interesting to find stuff by yourself without spending hours in vain or using guide from the Internet.There are some cons, of course. Enemies respawning out of nowhere behind your back can be really annoying sometimes. Weapon arsenal is not so big, besides, the lack of ammunition for some weapons leaves you with even less choices. Main story is very short and optional quest lines are not so long either. But there are many things to do on the map - different challenges, races, liquidation contracts... Finally, there's still (and I guess it will be there forever) a bug that prevents you from getting the cherished 100% completion of the game (by the game's internal statistics, not the Steam's one). Thankfully there's only achievement for 75% completion, so no worries, achievement hunters - you'll get your perfect Steam game. ;-)If you like free roaming in beautiful open-world game, spending time in parachute challenges, races and outpost fightings, searching for hundreds of collectibles and upgrades, spreading chaos by blowing stuff up or just flying around and enjoing you freedom - you'll definitely love Just Cause 2.------------------------------Экшн с открытым миром - такой, каким он должен быть. Just Cause 2 дарит чувство абсолютной свободы - иди куда хочешь, рули куда хочешь, лети куда заблагорассудится. В любую точку огромной карты можно добраться за секунды, никаких штрафов за гибель героя - эта игра призвана развлекать вас, а не взрывать мозг или доводить до бешенства.Два уникальных девайса, делающих игру такой шикарной - гарпун и бесконечно восстанавливающийся парашют (бесконечно восстан...? а, неважно). Веселье гарантировано! Эти штуки должны быть в каждом экшене - как мне не доставало их в Far Cry 3!.. ;-) Простое перемещение по миру и заурядные перестрелки становятся настолько разнообразней и веселей, что вы будете путешествовать туда-сюда только для того, чтобы снова воспользоваться ими.Мир игры по-настоящему хорош. Да, большая часть городков и деревень сделана копи-пастом. Но на карте столько разных мест со своим климатом, погодой, видами вокруг, что скучно не будет. Графика тоже на уровне, особенно огонь и взрывы - вы полюбите разносить всё в щепки! Сюжет и побочные квесты не сильная сторона игры, но своё дело они делают. Отдельного упоминания стоит система поиска скрытых предметов с помощью радара - на мой взгляд, отличное решение! В кои-то веки интересно искать ценные предметы самому, а не бегать часами там, где ничего нет, или сверяться с готовой картой из Инета.Конечно, есть некоторые минусы. Враги, респавнящиеся из ниоткуда прямо за спиной, порой жутко раздражают. Арсенал не так уж велик, а нехватка патронов для некоторых пушек ещё сильнее ограничивает в выборе. Основная сюжетная линия очень коротка, да и дополнительные квесты проходятся быстро. Тем не менее, заняться есть чем - всяких испытаний, гонок и контрактов на устранение на карте хватает. Наконец, достичь заветного 100%-го прохождения игры (игра ведёт свою внутреннюю статистику, не связаную со Steam) не получится из-за бага, который, очевидно, никто уже не исправит. К счастью, Steam-достижение есть только за 75%-ое прохождение, так что будьте спокойны, охотники за ачивами - вы сможете получить в коллекцию ещё одну ""идеальную"" игру. ;-)Если вам нравится рассекать по открытому красивому миру, проводить время за парашютными испытаниями, гонками и сражениями за военные базы, искать сотни спрятанных предметов и апгрейдов, сеять хаос, взрывая всё вокруг, или просто летать, наслаждаясь видом и собственной свободой, вам определённо понравится Just Cause 2.

												Just Cause 2 is ridiculous in the best possible way. In the space of a few moments, you can grapple to a hovering helicopter; beat up the pilot and hijack the chopper; blow up a cluster of fuel tanks; put the chopper on a collision course with an enormous antenna; jump out at the last moment; and watch the resulting explosion as you parachute down to the saddle of a moving motorcycle below. But in the life of Rico Rodriguez, such events are just another day at the office, though in this case, the office is the gigantic island nation of Panau, where three gangs vie to wrest control from a corrupt government. This is a big game that gives you a lot to do and a lot of crazy ways to do it. When Just Cause 2 gives you the freedom to do the things you want in the way you want, it shines in all its preposterousness and good humor. When missions and challenges shoehorn you into specific actions, however, the same loose mechanics that make the open-world exploration such a joy become a frustrating burden.			"

												FREEDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMSizeThis game feels huge in scale! There is tons of cities, factories, bases and even references here and there in the game. Despite the size of the terrain  you can navigate it fairly quickly due to having the awesome grapple hook and parachute mechanics. The movement from how you can move from one vehicles to other vehicles and the way you can use hooks in a variety of ways to mess with your enemies makes the game really fun and dynamic.StoryThough lets be clear the story is not great at all, its just there to justify you exploding everything possible on the island and accumulating as much chaos as possible. The story is so wacky that its fun putting you in crazy situations Black MarketCalling the black market kind of gets annoying however because you constantly have to watch the cinematic for the intro of it and outro depending on what options you picked. So everytime you want weapons,vehicles or just using it for fast travel you will be watching the short clips. Every. Single. Time. (Hey you can skip it at least)MultiplayerMultiplayer is what you think it is, going around and playing with 100’s of people that are blowing up stuff and doing races and other activities together.

IntroductionI am Tigerfrost. I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you.If you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.How I Found Out About ""Just Cause 2""The same way I found out about a lot of games, from YouTube. I randomly came across a video that was showing someone driving a vehicle off of a tall snowy mountain. The crash and destruction effects made me fall in love. See, I've always loved destruction in games/movies/etc. So when I see something like that, I know I must own the game. Unfair First ImpressionsI've seen a lot of different unfair first impressions for this game. The first, and most simple being, the fact that someone may not have liked the original Just Cause game. Therefor it leads to an automatic thought that any sequel will be just as bad, or worse. I can understand this, but believe me, Just Cause 2 makes everything better. Second, I've heard that the game can get low reviews and less players because of it's story. I know some people are looking for games for their story. However, not everyone is. You can have a game like Just Cause 2 where the story is bad but the gameplay is good, very good. Third, because it's a third person shooter style of game. Which can turn some people away. Review Of ""Just Cause 2""Just Cause 2 is a massive open world, sandbox, TPS game, that comes with a full story, side missions, bonus missions, and so many collectables that you'll die before finding all of them. The world of Just Cause 2 is massive (Panau). One of biggest I have ever seen! Stretching across desert terrain and mountains, snowy mountains and terrain, jungle and marsh, ocean, urban areas, and military bases. One downside to the world of Just Cause 2 is that it may be very big, but it's not well populated with stuff. Meaning, all that jungle and desert, 90% of it will not have anything in it besides sand and trees. So you may find the world itself being very boring at times. However, the rest of the game makes up for that. In the world of Just Cause 2, there are urban areas to explore. Villages that may hold resources and ammo to big cities that contain higher costing vehicles & helicopters. Places like airports where you can obtain a passenger jet. There are military bases you can liberate by destroying & collecting all things within it. These bases could consist of ports, vehicle factories, little infantry camps, to big fortress type places. You can get around the world of Just Cause 2 with many things. First of all, you can use your grappling hook to get to higher places, then you can use your parachute to glide down or travel across land faster. Not only is that the most basic of travel, there are vehicles...a lot. There are a little over 100 vehicles in Just Cause 2. Anything from ATV's, motorcycles, cars, trucks, boats, armored cars, planes, helicopters, etc. The list goes on. One thing that I do not care for in the vehicle department is the vehicle physics. The vehicle isn't really that responsive, or reliable. You can hit the movement key lightly and the vehicle will spin out, even at low speeds. You can defend yourself with weapons like SMG's, shotguns, etc. There really aren't many weapons to use in the default game unless you purchase DLC. However, there is still so much content in the game, you don't actually need DLC so the DLC is just there for bonus weapons & vehicles. I would like it if Just Cause 2 had more weapons in the default game. With how big the world is, having more weapons gives you more options to do things with.This isn't really the game that plays like a TPS game. You don't run up to a base and get behind cover then start attacking. The AI is kind of stupid, and the same time, they work well. There really isn't any stealth. The concept behind Just Cause 2 is that you drive in for fly in, kill everything, and walk away from a massive explosion. As for the story and side missions. The story itself is generic and not really exciting, except for the final mission. There are only six missions I believe, maybe more. However, to unlock story missions you must gain chaos which can be obtained by destroying key points in military bases, fighting the military, collecting things, or completing side missions. There are a lot of side missions to choose from three different sub factions who you'll find fighting the military at times. The side missions themselves can actually be unique and fun, however the briefing itself is low. Every mission start, you'll stand there and the leader of the sub faction will drive by, tell you what you need to do, and then drive away. Not a word said. Don't get me wrong, Just Cause 2 is a great game, it just may not be what you are looking for. Content In Just Cause 2 (Bonus Missions & Collectables)In the world of Just Cause 2, you have bonus missions alongside ""side missions"". These mainly consist of races, for all vehicle types. Other then that, you have thousands of collectables. These can be little pickups for the sub factions, or little resource crates that boost your stats, like giving you weapon parts to upgrade your weapons, or armor parts to give you more health, etc. To gain 100% in Just Cause 2 requires you to collect every piece of sub faction items and resources, also, destroying key military structures in an area. Each area you discover will give you a progress bar, when everything has been collected or destroyed, the progress bar will reach 100% and that area is clear. However, the PC version of Just Cause 2 experienced a bug where a few items & structures do not spawn in the game. Therefor it is impossible to beat the game 100% without a mod. The devs apparently do not care to fix this easily fixed problem. Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Just Cause 2 is an open world TPS that provides a wide variety of collectables and fun destruction. You can spend hours on the game before ever reaching 15% for full completion. Despite needing a mod to fully beat the game 100%. There has alos been a community mod released that allows people to play together in the world of Panau. Pro's:+Massive open world.+Loads of collectables for hours of game time.+Fun destruction system.+Addicting ""I must find everything"" style.+DLC is not required to play.+Nice variety of vehicles.Con's:-Mod needed for full completion.-Enemy will spam helicopters.-Mostly boring empty world. -Strange vehicle mechanics.-Low leveled main story & side mission briefing.Overall Rating: About A 12/15 (A Nice Game That's Worth A Pickup)Credits & DisclaimerThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.Remember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Just Cause 2 Original Release: 2010 Genre Tags: Sandbox; Action; RPG; Third-Person; Open World   My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-50 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary (Standalone) Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Sandbox gamersREVIEWBlow up a small fishing village's water tower in order to save their country. Why? Just 'cause.Just Cause 2 is one of the best games around for exciting open-world mayhem. Nice graphics and animations, a diverse gameworld, and an interesting atmosphere establish an enjoyable explorative experience. The world is loaded with collectibles to find, vehicles to commandeer, and things to blow up. And it is headlined with exciting, distinctive gameplay chock-full of mayhem and destruction. If you are into sandbox mayhem, this should be a sure thing for you; and even more casual fans of the genre should easily enjoy this game too, because it is just so outright fun.Now Just Cause 2, as is apparent by the title, is the sequel to the first Just Cause game. The first game was decent, and I had some fun playing it. But to be honest: anything it can do, this can do better. Both games use the same core concepts for gameplay, except the ideas were certainly executed better in Just Cause 2. So you really don’t have to worry too much about missing anything worthwhile if you would prefer skipping over the first game entirely. Even the narrative of Just Cause 2 is almost entirely unconnected to the first game’s story, so reading a brief synopsis should be more than sufficient for you to fully enjoy the experience. Having said all of that, though, if you really enjoy the genre, then you may want to check out the first game too. Anyway, the strongest attribute of Just Cause 2 has to be the riotous gameplay. You move around in an over-the-shoulder view while on foot, with various firearms at your disposal for taking out militants. And the patented grappling-hook mechanic allows some innovative ways to take down foes, bringing a distinctive novelty to the combat. Furthermore, shortly into the campaign, a wide variety of vehicles (cars, boats, helicopters, planes, and more) becomes available. These are great not only for your basic traveling needs, but also to perform ridiculous and hilarious stunts. And of course, the grappling-hook and parachute combination can be used to explore the gameworld in the signature Just Cause fashion that affords the franchise its unique identity. And with the myriad of collectibles to find, structures to destroy, statistics to record, and achievements to unlock: there is no shortage of things to do.And I suppose if the gameplay is the best attribute of the game, then the gameworld presentation is a very close second. The graphics are pristine and the landscape is packed with diverse sceneries and environments. From mountain peaks to desert valleys, it has it all. The animations and effects are also mostly well designed, which enhances the gratification of bringing a wake of destruction through every last place you visit. And the world is humongous. Even with a jet it can take a while to cross the map. Luckily there is a fast travel system that allows you to begin a sky-dive from above any location you have visited. It integrates perfectly with the game, taking what would be tedious and flipping it into one of the most enjoyable things to do. Just Cause 2 easily has one of the most entertaining gameworlds to explore.But even with all of this going on, the game starts off with a very focused and linear mission that allows you to be introduced to the main narrative elements of the campaign. You will come to find, however, that the story aspects of Just Cause 2 are minimal, and mostly mediocre. So you definitely shouldn’t go into it expecting to be told an elaborate story. But despite that, the narrative flows and the various missions are certainly enjoyable. The missions are purposeful and focused, which can be a refreshingly stark contrast to the mindless mayhem side of the game. But while there is a decent amount of total missions including the extras, there are very few main storyline missions, which does hold the overall experience back a bit. So there is some room for improvement.Ultimately, Just Cause 2 is a good example of what can be done in video games when great concepts meet great execution. It is such an all-around fun and distinctive experience that I would recommend everyone give it some consideration; and if you are a fan of the genre, then it should be a no-brainer.And as an addendum: there is now a free multiplayer mod DLC. With the mod, the opportunity for hilarious stunts and mayhem is increased exponentially as numerous players can all play in the same sandbox at once. As a free bonus, it is a pretty sweet addition and can be a lot of fun if you like that kind of thing. Luckily, if it doesn’t sound like your thing, it is also easy to completely ignore since the mod installs as a separate “app” on Steam with separate statistics and achievements tracking.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Do you like making things explode? Yes? Then buy this game.It's the most ridiculous, action-packed, explosion-filled blockbuster of a game I've ever played and since it's several years old at this point you should be able to pick it up for beans. If you're an action game fan at all, there's no reason not to own this.			"

												Just Cause 2 gives you a massive island nation to freely explore, wreaking havok as you slowly discover hundreds of locations and find over a thousand items. JC2 is so insanely fun because it completely indulges the player while minimizing the tedious elements of open world games.Other open world games require slow walking, but JC2 gives you over 50 vehicles (cars, tanks, fighter jets, and more) plus your essential grappling hook and parachute. If you’re hoofing it, you’re doing it wrong. Rather, open up the anywhere-accessible black market and buy a helicopter with dual-machine guns.JC2’s biggest achievement is how it makes you feel totally in control, able to go anywhere and do anything. There are no invisible walls or disconnected “levels”. And visually, JC2 is really, really attractive. The weather and water are standouts still looking good years after release. The artwork is all very well-crafted, with amazing attention to detail.The story is fun, too, with a very B-movie feel, intentionally hokey, but it works very well because of very solid voice work. The game also has a great self-awareness, featuring a hilarious dictator who will make you chuckle as he spouts his pontifications from loud speakers.Are there downsides? A few. You run out of ammo often, but after 5 hours or so you learn to simply order new guns. There’s no stealth elements but that’s ok. Very few buildings have accessible interiors but no biggie. Overall, the large scope, consistent quality, and accessible controls of JC2 make it one of the purest video games ever created. When you’re tired of “serious” games let JC2 cleanse your gaming palette.			"

												Just Cause 2 is a legendary over the shoulder sandbox shooter along the lines of Grand Theft Auto without the charm. The game focuses on destruction, deep controls and doing whatever craziness you'd like to do. You play as Rico Rodriguez and you've been sent in by the government to mess things up like a kitten in tissue paper on an island nation that seems giant by gaming standards. You have the option work for different factions / gangs that have their own agendas. The gangs are a nice touch and you'll see them battle each other on the island while civilians run and hide. Its a nice AI dichotomy.Since the game is set on a bunch of giant islands, the terrain is gorgeous and diverse. You'll see lush green jungles beneath icy mountains, then go into those icy mountains and down into sandy deserts. After that, you can take a boat for a ride across beautiful blue waters, then hijack a jet and surf on top of it into a golden sunset while dodging missiles. Everywhere in this game is a gorgeous place and there are tons of places to visit and blow up. There doesn't seem to be any interiors, but that is fitting for a game so beautiful with good traversal diversity.The controls are deep, but they allow you to do a lot more than your average over the shoulder sandbox shooter. You have your standard, run, jump, gunfire, reload, grenade, toggle guns, toggle grenades buttons, but you also have the infamous grapple hook. This hook is what the Bionic Commando reboot was missing. Double pressing it will send you instantly zipping to wherever it latched onto. Traversal is made super easy, climbing up buildings with the hook, but not just that, but you have a parachute that is used to glide around. Simply hit the jump button while in the air to deploy the chute. Pressing and holding the grappling hook will grapple something, but then when you hold it, aim at something else and release the button, you've now tethered two things together, which results in hilarity. Tether a moving car to the ground, to watch the car flip over. Tether a NPC to a rocketing propane tank and watch them blast off. Not just that, but there is plenty of car combat. Normal games would have you just get in a car, not this game, you can get on top of the car to shoot things, or you can slip down in front or behind the car to shoot things using the car for cover as its moving. You can take over moving vehicles, with easy quick time events that show a struggle instead of just kicking a person out from behind the wheel.Combat is pretty easy, you just aim the cursor and fire. There is no aim button, if your cursor is remotely near anyone or anything, you will see a red highlight around the logical target. So if you the player have terrible aim, Rico Rodriguez will still shoot the target. In terms of holding guns, you can hold one two handed gun and two one handed guns. There are throwable explosives and you can toggle between two types. You can also melee enemies with the grappling hook.With so much control freedom, you can tackle missions any way that you want. Such as a car chase mission where you need to escort the driver, do you grappling hook vehicle to vehicle, taking out enemies and struggling to knock out the driver? Do you tether the other vehicles to the ground and watch them crash, or do you use your parachute to hover over the action and blow up the other vehicles? The choice is yours. It is an excellent game to do what you want.Missions themselves give you easy to follow objectives as if they were steps to follow. Open the gate, take out that rocket launcher, take out those snipers, pick up that item, grapple onto that helicopter, and so on. The objectives are marked with red and easily found with how far away they are. If you try to deviate too far from a mission location, the game will warn you and start a 10 second counter. This keeps the intensity on and prevents people like me from exploiting things.Outside of missions, there are plenty of things to do and they're all marked on your map. Well you need to visit the location marked on your map before you find what it is there to do. Things such as races, time trials, destroy bases and loot villages. Destroying locations and looting villages each has a percentage attached to it. To loot a village, you need to find 100% of things hidden there. Things like vehicle parts, weapon parts, cash boxes and even liberate the village from propaganda buses. Thankfully when you get near something findable, it will show up pointing out where you are, but you need to be very near it. This saves you from detailed searching. It is the same for ammo boxes and health cabinets.As for the bases, you need to find things and blow up things such as towers, generators, gas tanks, communication towers and surface-to-air missile launchers, each will make up 100%. It is fun for explorers to seek out every nook and cranny, but I can understand if getting 100% would feel like a chore.When you create chaos or break any sort of law, the local military will be sent after you. At first it'll be simple things hunting you down, but if you keep creating chaos, your 'heat' level will go up and more soldiers will come after you. How do you reduce your heat level? Hide. Yep hide in the jungle and after time your red heat will go to orange heat and start dropping down. This is good for keeping the focus on what you were doing before you created heat. With plenty of jungle in the game, it is pretty easy to ditch any heat you might have.Sadly the enemies feel pretty dumb. No one takes cover when you're putting bullets into them, even if enemies are next to cover, but I guess people play for the fun of doing what they want, not the challenge. In car chases enemy vehicles will just ram other objects. It leads to some laughable moment. They'll just drive off cliffs when you hit the brakes. I can understand scripted events like running into a gas station, but otherwise it is hilariously bad.The game is pretty easy even on normal with regenerating health. Not just that, but health pickups from cabinets seem well placed. If you die, you go to the last checkpoint. Sometimes the checkpoints are further back than you think, but that's the only thing that really presents a punishment in the game.The real downside to the game is that it seems to crash once every few hours back to the desktop. Luckily the game has an autosave feature.To top all of that off, there is a free Multiplayer MOD that allows every player into one world together for chaos to ensue. Is it worth $15? Sure.... but it has been on sale before at $2.50. Keep that in mind.			"

												Y'know, Just Cause 3 (Yes, I'm talking about 3 really quick, hear me out) had a much more refined game experience: the shooting controls were tighter, the grapple was far more versatile and useful, the parachute was easier to control, and the wingsuit was a blast to use and was a great addition to the game. The explosions were bigger, the voice acting was more tolerable, the weapons were crazier, and so on. I could list many more things that JC3 does better than JC2.But you know what? Despite ALL of that, Just Cause 2 has a certain charm to it that 3 doesn't. JC2 is honestly just...I dunno. It's so much more fun to play. Maybe it's because it feels less generic and AAA-ish. Maybe it's because you didn't have to do little challenges and destroy the same boring props in every town to progress. Maybe it's because the world was more varied and interesting, and towns and bases felt like actual places instead of bullet points on a list of things to blow up. Just Cause 2, as unpolished as it is, ends up being the more enjoyable game in my opinion. And this is just vanilla; JC2 is stupidly easy to mod, and there's tons of crazy mods out there to really crank up the insanity. Naturally, it's also far easier to run than JC3. Even the craptop I keep in my room can handle this game at 30fps on low settings.The current price of $15 is well worth it imo. If that still too much for you, you're in luck because this game goes on sale frequently and it's dirt cheap at that point. You could be standing in line at Target and pick up 3 Snickers bars and Just Cause 2 on sale would be cheaper. And the Snickers would be gone after a minute or two. You get to keep Just Cause 2 forever until Steam explodes.♥♥♥♥ Snickers.Buy Just Cause 2. For seriously.			"

												I skydived from a helicopter into a banana republic to rescue memory cards and blew up 99.99% of a military base before grappling onto a helicopter which took me to a casino where I rescued an alcoholic black market weapon and vehicle dealer from the government, before I pulled his wrecked car out of a junk pile and he drove it while I was on top, shooting soldiers the whole time, before we arrived at his mansion and he gave me a beacon to call a helicopter that would airdrop me weapons and vehicles.THIS ALL HAPPENED WITHIN THE FIRST 15 MINUTES""GTA on enough crack to kill a whale"" 110/10 -IGN			"

												HUGE world with tons to do, some of the missions are annoying, but most are pretty good. The environment is really freeking big and you can spend hours looking for water towers to blow up, or statues to pull down. Maybe you want to blow up a gas station.  Out of ammo, need a bigger better gun? Call the black market dealer and have him drop something off for you.  I've played for 11 hours and only scratched the tip of the surface of the upper crust of how much there is to offer.  One of my go to games when I want to blow stuff up.The game can get a bit repetitive, but come on who doesn't have fun crawling into an attack helicopter and laying waste to the world. Maybe you just want to carry a mounted machine gun around and blow everything up for an hour, go to town.This game is constantly on sale for $2, and DLC is on sale in a bundle. If you hate fun stay away, maybe my little ponies or something is more your speed.			"

												This is an open world game that will make you laugh like a retard at times. This game is just CRAZY!!! It has a huge open world which you can't explore even in a million years (Not really). JC2 doesn't have much of a story or missions. Its just a game where you explore and collect stuff and do all crazy stuff you can think of. Like punching someone in the balls.....NO....nothing like that. Chaos is what this game is about. Go and destroy and blow up anything you see. Do crazy stunts with planes and cars and bikes. Do races and jump off a building and........DIE. A LOT of side missions to do. I have more than 100 hours in this game and I'm not even 50% done in this game. You will never get bored of this game at all. You will keep playing and doing stuff. If you add mods then that will make the game even more fun. Now that its multiplayer mod is coming so you all must have this game so we can do crazy stuff together and punch people in balls together. 9/10. Get it!!			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing insanity. From the ridiculous story, to the mechanics, to the all-out action, to the cheesy characterisations, this game is 100% ludicrous good fun. It's at its best when you're in the middle of the action with explosives and vehicles erupting left right and  centre - there is certainly no shortage or vehicles, weapons, explosive tanks, and enemies to engage with. Do you want to surf a 747? You can. Do you want to fly as high as possible and then just skydive for a nice 5 or 6 minutes? You can. Do you want to hijack a chopper mid-air and use it to destroy an oil refinery just for the thrill of it? You can. This is up there as one of the most fun sandbox games to date. Unfortunately, however, the world is pretty shallow, and for all the locations and collectibles, the breadth of the gameplay is fairly limited. It's not a living, breathing world like the GTA worlds - the environment (which looks wonderful and varied enough in terms of climate and locations) is inhabited by people without personalities, and who exist only to be shot at, blown up, or otherwise maimed. The missions are compelling to a degree, although there is a degree of repetition in the faction missions that would become grating if the action wasn't so fun. However, I didn't at any point on XBOX or PC find myself compelled to 100% the game, as this involves hours of repetition with little tangible reward. This is felt the most when the end-game is at hand, and there's not a lot to motivate you to play beyond the completion of the missions. The story isn't very compelling or coherent, but it is bad to the point of *almost* coming around to good again, of which credit should be given to the writers for just going with it (a climactic battle that happens while clinging to a ballistic missile in flight?!). However, the dialogue itself is pretty bland and boring, and the sense of humour that they're going for doesn't always hit the mark.In summary, the JC2 is huge and stunningly beautiful, and the action is ever-present and very fun, which makes this a vast improvement over its predecessor, and lets it stand apart from the other open-world games of its time. In saying that, it lacks the personality of the world that GTA nailed, and the sense of humour that Saints Row did so well, which leaves it feeling comparatively empty at its core. However, if you're looking for spectacle, the game is well-priced and looks amazing, and there's a lot you can do and see in this game that can't be found elsewhere. For the price, I highly recommend it.			"

												For the longest time Just 'Cause 2 was T.H.E. game on my 'good game' list. It was what I understood as a quality game experience, as early as the first announcements for JC3 were announced I would be scanning Steam store for a possible entry, without success. Now, easily 3 years since those announcements; I receive the SQUARE ENIX e-mail declaring the new Just 'Cause 3 is coming soon.I am excited; Just 'Cause 2 was to me in ""shootemup"" terms what Assassin's Creed is for ""hack'n'slash"". I found it awesome,very playable [in-fact some of the first DLC I ever purchased online was from Just 'Cause 2]. I also recall my reaction seeing this could not be played on XP operating systems. It would be unfair ignoring Just 'Cause 1 , like with Witcher 1, I was largely impressed with Just 'Cause 1; not as much THOUGH. I prefer Just 'Cause 2 more than 1, and I prefer Witcher 1 more than Witcher 2 [Just 'Cause 1 & Witcher 1 feel the same in game-play although the one is medieval and the other more modern-day].  The quality of Just 'Cause 2 was high, or HD [high definition], like AC1 and onward. That's WHAT caught my attention with Just 'Cause 2! The qaulity today of this game is very high. This game got me excited about ALAN WAKE games (they look alike).Then gratefully, square enix integrated our hero [Rico Rodriguez] into other games like Sleeping Dogs, his clothing and handgun, like Adam Jensen of Deus Ex into Hitman Absolution and Tomb Raider.At the time of release, I understand THIS game to be one of the Pioneers of HD 3rd person gaming.Thankfully,these days we are now receiving feeds from XBOX,like Ryse:Son of Rome.So this sort of thing is more common.Highlights-DLC jetpack parachute, (great toy)-Grapple hook abilities,-Open World with lot's to discover-check out the little scorpions running around Panau -in anticipation of Just 'Cause 3Game on  :-)			"

												If you have two dollars and see this game on sale, get it.This is a huge, beautiful open world game with alright driving mechanics. Even if you never touch the story past the opening levels, there are hours upon hours of things to do. The graphics are beautifully and wonderfully optimised that I sometimes forget this was a 2010 title. Flying, driving, just messing around is all great.			"

 BOOM!  PROS + Explosions! + Pretty and immersive graphics. + Chaos! + Gigantic map,  lots of location to explore. + Bombs away! + Warning: grappling hook is stronger than a goddam black holes. You wanna catch an airplane?  Just shoot the damn thing. + Kaboom! +...  You get the idea. All the explosions make the game a lot of fun. CONS - Somewhat decent story,  but it could be better in my opinion. - The Map has too much ""empty""  zones. - The game is kinda repetitive..   because chaos chaos chaos.

												Just another top class game, the graphics are really really nice. This is truly a sandbox openworld game with a gigantic map and over 100 vehicles to fly and drive with awesome scenery at every turn. So much fun is to be had with this game but it can get repetitive if you stick to one thing for too long but make sure you shake it up with the challenges and faction missions. Destruction in this game is brilliant and wont let you down in that department with lots of stuff to blow up. Buy this game when its on offer for even better enjoyment! This game is like mercenaries crossed with GTA crossed with Far cry 2.There are some bugs in this game that comes with the 3rd person view and sometimes you can fall funny and get stuck for a few seconds before your guy will get up but you can overlook these.

												This is THE definitive Just Cause experience. While Just Cause 3 has better textures, explosions, friendly NPCs, and a wingsuit, Just Cause 2 is definitely the better game. The island of Just Cause 2, Panau, is incredibly memorable; grapple around the streets of Panau City, drive a motorbike across the deserts of ""Lautan Lama,"" or do some temple sightseeing in the ""Berawan Besar"" mountains, and then do it all again. This game never gets old. You can ride on top of cars while they fly down the highway, or jump off a casino and plummet down a waterfall into the jungles below. Stop an evil Asian dictator from taking over the world, attach an explosive barrel to a guy on a scooter, race at the race track, or hijack a Colonel's plane in his backyard and fly it into a mountain. You can get crazy in this game! The music is fantastic, the mechanics are good, the graphics still hold up, and there is about 150 hours of content. Play it!			"

												""Just Cause 2"" reminds me a bit of a GTA clone but on tropical island. Personally I didn't really care for the whole storyline, as my main goal in the game was to cause mayhem and destruction to military forces in game. It reminds me a bit of over-the-top Hollywood action film, but that is, without a doubt, the best part of this little wonder. Massive explosions, body count, that would make Arnie and Sly blush, grappling onto buildings, vehicles and even helicopters or air planes will make you love this game. I will recommend this production to everyone, that wants to have a little fun, blow something up or just simply drive around the island in one of many vehicles available in game.			"

												AWESOME! Basically a better looking GTA 4. Oh wait... did I forget to mention? YOU HAVE A GRAPPLING HOOK! Plus, there is now a multiplayer mod officially supported by steam, with a stronger community than Call fo Duty Ghosts (You'll guaranteed find a populated server).Awesome multiplayer, hilarious speed boost. Just plain awesome, especially if you like open world free roaming games of this genre.That not enough for you? Well... there are hundreds of mods such as an infinite amount of money, indestructible or fast vehicles, and the best of them all... the CRAZY CIVILIANS MOD! The crazy civilians mod basically messes with their steering AI or something, making all the citizens drive crazily, and drive (crash) planes. TOTAL MAYHEM!Definitely a good game.			"

												Just Cause 2 is a 2010 open world action-adventure video game developed by Avalanche Studios, published by Eidos Interactive and distributed by Square Enix. It is the sequel to the 2006 video game Just Cause.The player is free to roam the game's open world, not having to focus on the game's storyline. Progress in the game is measured with Chaos, which is earned by completing missions, destroying government property, collecting items for the factions and reaching 100% completion in settlements and military bases. Chaos unlocks new agency missions and stronghold takeovers. Chaos and stronghold takeovers expand the factions' area of influence, which unlocks faction missions and race challenges.Initially, the player must acquire weapons and vehicles in the field. Early in the game, the player encounters a black market supplier, from whom weapons and vehicles can be purchased, with an option to have them delivered to the player's location via helicopter. As more Chaos is gained, additional weapons, vehicles, and the extraction option become available on the black market. All weapons and vehicles on the black market have parameters that can be upgraded in several steps, by building upgrades with weapon and vehicle components found within the game world. There are over 2,000 parts that the player can acquire.Overall by my experience, this Game is a Must-Have so I would Rate it:Rate 11/10			"

												It's a strange game, really. To me, it collides beatifulness of sights, marvels of almost supernatural flights, and uglyness of c.i.a. operative agenda. For sandbox game, it looks almost perfect.But I'll start from bad side.Story are weak, alike with any subsequent missions of ""Just cause"", and it's because of game pattern - CIA operative wreaking havoc and destruction on peaceful countryside for USA profit and domination. That's a little more complicated than muscling drug deals, car thefts and bank robbing, like usual gta-like stuff, don't you think? Ok, there was ""Mercenaries"" and brilliant ""the Saboteur"", and I liked them! But in those games you were aiming primarily to military objects, and were penalized for civilian casulties. Conscience sleeps well on that. But as for ""just case"", you blowing power and water supplies in cities and villages. You are coherently destroing all of life-suppoting communications in country for such irrelevant aim as ""chaos"". Oh, and for drug deals - which CIA operative ever don't get envolved in that? Worse than that is only agenda of ""Prototype"" game, where civilians are just food, and only thing protagonist cares about is himself. But enough of that.Question is - is it playable?No doubt! There are so many strong points by those this game, shipped 5 years ago, are still no.1!Game process itself feels very, very exciting, especially if you like big size deals in sandboxes. Landscapes looks great, greater than in recent Far Cry 3. And you can fly it over and over, by rotary planes, jets, helicopters and on your own by magic ""always ready"" parachute combined with grappling hook (powered with same magic of everediness). Array of climat zones, from tropican seasides to the coldest highs of mountains, jungles, skyscraper cities, farms and villages, monasteries, industrial zones, even ""mile-high"" floating casino. Variety of cars, boats, guns... and plenty of space and challenges to enjoy it.Generally, its a top-high gta-like sandbox game, made for freeriding. And you know many people who likes GTA definetly that way - way of freeride skirmish. Buy it on occasion and have fun with it, when you feel rush for flying or blowing things.Overall 7.5/10 (only for lack of good story and abomination of CIA agenda)Plus 10/10 chaos points for multiplayer! Definitely try it, right on!			"

												Just Cause 2 is a 2010 open world action-adventure video Game developed by Avlanche Studios, published by Eidos Interactiveand distributed by Square Enix. The GameplayIs split up between freeform exploration including cars and bikes, planes, boats, helicopters and skydiving (with unlimited butt parachutes for paragliding purposes, complements of Uncle Sam) and a little bit more structured missions with objectves that need to be checked off before the mission can proceed towards completion. How you go about these objectives (neutralize targets, rescue VIP's, capture locations or vehicles) is often left up to you, provided you don't stray too far from a designated mission area. Weapons are multitudinous and varied; your standard assault rifles, pistols and submachine guns as well as rocket launchers, grenades, triggered explosives, and the more exotic hookshot weapon which allows you to attach opponents to the ceiling, a vehicle, or each other, as well as move around quickly in both horizontal and vertical movement. The Story Revolves around Rico Rodriguez, spy and mercenary hired by the US (off the record, of course). Your job: Cause chaos and destruction across the tiny island nation of Panau, whose new president Baby Panay (Yes, seriously) has started to isolate the nation and build up the Panauan military. This has caused the purposely nebulous Agency to be called in, to destabilize the nation and install a puppet for a head of state. It is all utterly ridiculous, stock Bond novel stuff with lots more explosions and thankfully less Bond-babe-bedding. The fact that all of this terrorism carried out in the name of the US turns out to all be because of the newly discovered and massive Panau oil fields, leaves a bad taste in my mouth. All of that blood on your hands, and it was simply to protect national fuel interests.From me 9/10 Sweep  "

												I feel like it's still one of the best open world action games available on Steam. The map is very close in size to Just Cause 3, however, due to the elevation and more diverse landscape (plus less water), the JC2 map feels MUCH larger.When I play it, I feel like I'm on the set of a Mission Impossible movie. Optimization is great and although it's graphics are a dated, the control feels so  natural that it's easy to lose yourself in the game.Play as the real Rico (before they changed him in Just Cause 3). It makes a huge difference, the mission design seems more dynamic as well.You can get it super cheap on a sale if you wait and it's very much worth it!			"

												Just Cause 2 is no doubt my favorite game of all time, i have 77 hours on pc and most likely more to come just playing around with mods but even without mods it's amazing, I have over 300 hours on PS3 with this game.     The ammount of action in this game is a huge ammount and you can be as creative as possible with however you do things, the way you can kill your foes varies around shooting them in the head or attaching them to a car and driving them off a cliff. If you finished everything, just spend your time driving around the massive map, finding all the eastereggs like Pie Island, The Bubble Gun, or the Hot Air Balloon. The possibilities in this game is damn near endless. The story was great, wasn't too long and wasn't too short, was definitely worth doing regardless of people not even doing the story in the first place.I cannot recommend this game enough and can be toyed with for hours.I am so very hyped about Just Cause 3 which is coming out in 2015. If you do not have this game already, it is usually on sale for less then $6 USD and rarely stays $15.If you want a game to mess around with when you have no internet. This is the one.			"

												Just Cause 2... Chaos, chaos and one more time CHAOS! Playing this game is so much fun...The grappling hook, all the explosions and the car chases. Hooking a police car chasing you to a wall and watching it getting totaly destroyed and killing tons of people is so satisfying. Flying planes is a little cumbersome and voice acting is not that good as i thought, but still this game is EPIC. Missions are quite interesting(but about half of them are the same) and each character has its own role in this game. Fighting is pretty decent in this game.The multiplayer is just boring, unless you have friends to play with.And there's one thing that bothers me, there's no indicator if someone gets killed by you.Overall a great, funny game with some issues but they are meaningless, fantastic usage of the grappling hook and a lot of fun playing it. I highly recommend buying this game if you are looking for some total destruction and well spent hours of playing games.

												This game is---- AWESOMEBefore I start babbling about this awesome ♥♥♥♥, I want to clarify that I've neither played GTA nor have I enjoyed playing Far Cry so far. This is the first ""Open World"" game with guns I've really liked and therefore, I can't understand some of the negative reviews here. However, if you know more about sandbox games than me, you should probably not read on (or leave a negative comment).what's this crap all about?Well, the game doesn't really have much of a story line. You play as Rico Rodriguez and go on an undercover mission to find out the truth about your corrupt island. While you're doing the short 7 missions, you might as well just end up destroying your entire world. ...just 'cause.playingAfter having completed the basics, you can embrace the awesome scenery of the island (my GTX 660 can run it on ultra). Although the game is older than 6 years now, the graphics look great and some of today's games should really be jealous. The screenshots on steam ain't lying! And now, your adventure is only just beginning. While doing the obligatory running job for your mafia bosses, you can wreak havoc in every city and village, destroy statues and blow up gas stations, win car races and do awesome stunts on your bike. You can climb the highest mountain or fly there, because you've got a friend working for the black market who'll supply you with anything your heart desires... if you've got the necessary cash, of course. come on, nothing is free in this world, dude.The map consist of several interlinked locations and you'll need to discover them before you can fast travel. In every city, village, whatever it may be, you can find parts for the market which can then be bought, i.e. you may want to get that fighter jet one day. Keep looking, babe. You just need to open more boxes. If you have a look at the steam achievements, you can already get a good overview over what the game has to offer. Destroying objects with whatever you've got, killing the military in countless ways, and driving your ♥♥♥ sore. Let's get to this new location! Flying? No, I'd rather use my hook like Tarzan and walk on foot. why you should buy this gameif you've ended up here, you probably have your reasons. maybe you've heard about the fps drops with the latest Just Cause (3), or maybe you just want to feel nostalgic (like I did), you're probably right here. if you're looking for a sandbox game with little story and the opportunity to do just whatever the hell you want to do, this is the right thing. it will run smoothly on anything similar to GTX 660, and if you're fan of blowing up stuff, you won't be disappointed. Just keep in mind that the choices lie with you. if you get bored playing this game, you may not be used to the freedom this game provides you with. This is not Skyrim and the game is not about the story. I recommend playing 30min every day and keep enjoying the game, because, certainly, not everybody will enjoy playing this for 10 hours straight. Know what you're getting into, man (girl?). I play it for the sexy butts.			"

IntroductionJust Cause 2 is an amazing, open-world sandbox-esque game with breathtaking visuals and massive explosions to boot. This game takes a lot of what makes a game like Grand Theft Auto good, adds a grappling hook, and puts in much more destruction into the world. If for some reason you're getting this game instead of Just Cause 3, then you're still going to have an awesome time.Please note that I have played this game for quite a long time before I owned it on Steam so my hours do not match up with my actual game time.GameplayStoryYou are Rico Rodriguez, your typical badass gun with a gun (and a grappling hook). Set after the events of the first game, you're essentially trying to overthrow this evil dictator and confront your old mentor. I'll state right off the bat, that the first game sucks, and the story in the first and second games sucks as well. Where the GTA series has had a pretty good storyline, Just Cause didn't get that bit right yet. You are likely not going to be very interested in the story if at all, and it's fairly tedious to do the missions for reasons I'll explain later on. On the off chance you do like the story, there are some interesting missions and places you have to go, which are honestly pretty fun. But just know, the story isn't the selling point of this game.Combat & ExplorationWhat you will most likely play Just Cause 2 for, is the insanely explosive combat, and the highly immersive, open world that it provides. From the open seas, to densely populated towns. From the cold mountain peaks, to the warm valleys below; this game has it all. I've played countless times just simply free-roaming and admiring the beauty of every environment. But what's a beautiful environment without some kick-♥♥♥ explosions am I right? Just Cause 2 features a variety of weapons and vehicles at your disposal. Simply order a drop from your handy black market supplier, or raid a base and steal all their weapons and grab your favourite car from anyone you see. The choice is yours. Combine all this with your multi-use grappling hook, and you can quickly imagine all the possibilities in game. Don't like a soldier looking at you funny? Hook him to your car and take him for a ride. Need a lift? Hook your car to an airplane before it takes off. Two guys, one gun? Hook them together and let the magic happen itself. :^)My only concern with the weapon/vehicle system was that it felt a bit difficult to acquire the exact weapon/vehicle you wanted. The drop system was very expensive and income was very slow. For a sandbox style game, it felt very anti-sandbox to have those limits in the game. Just Cause 3 has fixed this issue. But don't let that deter you, there is a lot of raw fun to be had in this game, and you'll spend hours in it just trying out everything your mind can imagine.MultiplayerMost people play the multiplayer mode, which is a free DLC to obtain on Steam. If you thought single-player was fun, you're definitely going to love multiplayer. It's everything in single-player multiplied by the number of players in the game. VisualsFor a game released in 2010, Just Cause 2 is beautiful. The graphics hold up extremely well and even surpass a lot of games that are out right now. It's very well optimized and will run on almost anything that isn't over 2 years old at this point. Explosions are stunning, while skydiving gives you the sense of speed that it should as you plummet into the earth/sea at super high speeds, only to pull your parachute at the last second and admire the spot where you would have died instead.AudioMusic is okay, sound effects are pretty great, voice-overs suck. Much of the audio isn't really the selling point of Just Cause 2. I feel like there could have been more here, but at least the sound-effects carry it most of the time. You'll be entertained quite a bit, but you may notice that there is definite room for improvement.SummaryJust Cause 2 is one of the best games of its time, and is still insanely fun even now. Its graphics hold up extremely well and has one of the largest game maps in existence. Whenever you tire of playing alone, the free multiplayer dlc will add countless hours of fun once again, and will lead to some of the best moments in gaming. Despite a few sub-par aspects of the game (story, voice-acting, etc), this is a game you will have endless hours of fun in, and you'll barely remember anything negative about the game.If you like a really good open-world game with super-fun gameplay, look no further than Just Cause 2.9/10 - Must buy.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Just Cause 2 takes place in South East Asia on the Panau islands. You play the role of a man named Rico Rodriguez sent to track down a dangerous American. However, in order to get the information you need you work with the 3 rebel/criminal factions, the Reapers, the Roaches and the Ular boys against the country's oppressive government.Just Cause 2 is a beautiful game, sure, but looking back I honestly would want to take the over 100 hours I spent on completing this game to 100% back. It's a grind fest, all Just Cause 2 consists of is collecting weapon parts, vehicle parts and destroying a number of things to reach 100% completion in any given settlement. There isn't very much replayability once you've completed every settlement to 100%.Aspects of Just Cause 2 Worth Praising● Destructive environments. The majority of trees and shacks in the environment will come tumbling down if you use explosives or crash into them with a vehicle.● Creative transportation. The idea of using a parachute while using your grappling hook to slingshot your way across the landscape it quite creative and exclusive to Just Cause 2. I often find this method of transportation superior to using conventional land vehicles.● Plenty of vehicles to drive! Cars, bikes, atvs, boats, helicopters and planes are all in this game.Aspects of Just Cause 2 Worth Criticizing● No licensed music. You often take licensed music in other open world games for granted but after playing through Just Cause 2 for over 105 hours, it makes you realize that it's the only thing keeping you sane. It couldn't have cost that much to license music from obscure artists or at least implement a feature where you can manually install music tracks and listen to them through your PDA while you're zipping around Panau, could it?● Horrid voice acting. It's debatable but it can only be seen clearly if you have experienced a multitude of other products to compare. Personally, I see it better than Ride to Hell Retribution although Bolo Santosi and the npcs you have to escort through stronghold take overs are the cringe worthy.			"

												While the game lacks true depth, it's still incredibly fun to just boot the game up after a long and tiring day, and just make everything explode while you get chased down by half the Panau millitary. The main goal is to destroy everything, and this game does it pretty ♥♥♥♥ing well. If you're into open-world collecting stuff and explosions, this is your game. Definitely worth picking up during the sale!			"

 My Just Cause 2 Review:  Quick Summary You are a Mexican badass blowing stuff up on an island called PanauPanau is governed by a little asshat called Pandak ""baby"" PanayYour goal is to make Panau ascend into chaos by blowing stuff upGame made by Micheal Bay and James BondAfter 200 hours of gameplay I'm still at 35% completion. The storyline is quite bad but you don't buy JC2 for its plot. The explosions are rather good for 2010. The graphics are utterly spectacular for its age. The game runs really well, at 100+ fps at the highest settings with my GTX980ti, and around 40 with my old laptop at medium-low quality. Barely encountered any game breaking bugs, expect for the time I became part of the mile high club by merging into it. Other than that nothing worthwile. I will update this guide when I either get to 300 hours or get to 50% completion.  Is this game new? >No Is the storyline good? >No Is it better than JC3? >No Was it worth 200 hours? >Abso-♥♥♥♥ing-lutelyEnd of Review			"

												You play the role of a terrorist spider-man dictator liberator? whatever.., To help liberate the population you end up destroying their water, fuel and electrical grid (and space program)... When the army tries to defend their little island against you, you simply blow them up too.But seriously..  Its a great game, it plays out like a bad cheap b-movie / Stallone action movie (which is awesome in this game). and the scenery and immersion is amazing (and the ridiculous stunts and crashes too).

At first glance I thought OH MA LAWD DIS GAME RUN SMOOTH. Then I found out about the grapplinghook. I then peed a little and continued playing. After 20 minutes I am now in intesive care.

												---NOTE: I HAVE SEVERAL HUNDRED HOURS ON THE PS3 VERSION OF THIS GAME, AND 60 ON THE MP MOD. I'M NOT REVIEWING IT WITH ONLY 4 HOURS OF PLAYTIME---Just Cause 2... where to start? This is arguably, for me, the ultimate sandbox game. Perhaps trumped only by Just Cause 3, which I am yet to purchase, however, have played. The game sees you attempt to overthrow the corrupt government of Panau. How do you do this, exactly? By blowing stuff up. That is your main objective in this game. Cause chaos. For me, the campaign was not too important. Is it good? Yes. Is it great? Perhaps not. However, the campaign seems to just be a passing fad, and, although the dialog is well written, it is not memorable. Just Cause 2, however, offers an expansive open world, full of immense posibilities, from military bases and airports, from the smallest of villages to the huge capital city, and don\'t even get me started on the graphics. Even now, this game, from 2010, trumps many games released today, and the fact that even fairly low end (by today\'s standards) PCs can run it, makes it a viable alternative to the likes of GTA V, which requires a relatively demanding PC to run. My advice to you: Buy this game, now. At just £9.99, it is an ABSOLUTE STEAL! This game is great for people who don\'t have a great PC, or are just looking to try the series, not wanting to spend large amounts of money on Just Cause 3, or even those of you who just love blowing things up. FAN-♥♥♥♥ING-TASTIC. Oh, and, while you\'re at it, get the multiplayer mod. You can do all the same explosion-y things, but with your friends.			"

												One of the most fun and action-packed games I've ever played!  It feels like GTA in a war environment.  Steal an armored vehicle, chopper, or jet and take over villages and bases while causing endless chaos.  The open-world environment is almost fully destructible, so there's tons of things to do (and blow up).  Highly recommended and cheap to buy through Steam.			"

												One big sandbox of destruction and mayhem. Many many many hours will be required to complete everything. Perhaps to a fault, it does at times feel a little overstuffed with grindy content and gets a bit repetitive endlessly clearing the same clones of bases just to bring the percentages up to clinch an acheivement.However, its cheap, its fun, its  sharp enough looking for its age and if you do stick with it to 100% you will definitely get value for money.

PRESENTATION 7/10-The story isn't to be taken too seriously but it's good enough to move the action along. The cutscenes, however, are very weak in comparison to the game's excellent action.GRAPHICS Rating: 9/10-Rico's character model looks very good, but the absolute best-looking thing in Just Cause 2 is the island of Panau itself.SOUND Rating: 7/10-The voice acting in Just Cause 2 is hit or miss, but the music is always entertainingGAMEPLAY Rating: 9/10-Despite a few problems with checkpoints and on-foot combat, Just Cause 2 is an absolutely thrilling third-person shooter with a massive open world and some amazing action set piecesLASTING APPEAL Rating: 10/10I spent about 7 hours beating Just Cause 2. And that was roughly 30 percent of what the entire game has to offer. This game will keep you busy for a long time.			"

Just (Be)CauseReview after completing all achievementsStoryIf there is one place where this game falls flat on its face, it's the story.  The plot is one we have all seen before.  Government/Dictator/Angry mam gets too much power so we have to take him (and the entirety of his county) down.There are 3 different factions that you'll work for during the plot of JC2, not including your own faction, where they will send you off to do small (5-10 minute) tasks, while sometimes sending you out to help them capture a new stronghold and gain more territory for them.  However there is no choice involved in these missions, for you cannot give the faction that you like the most more territory (they all have preset missions).The main story line is fed through agency missions that pop up occasionally after enough faction missions and/or destruction has been done, these missions are a bit more enjoyable, but drag on a bit to long. Throughout this story the plot takes some turns, but none are too interesting or memorable.  Half the time after viewing a cutscene I was left scratching my head at what just happened.  Even after all this I would say that the story-line is still worth playing through if not just for the ending battle.GameplayJC2 plays like most 3rd person shooters on the market, but with a grappling hook and parachute.  The movement supplied by these two mechanics in sync made the shooting much more enjoyable that what it would be without being able to constantly fling yourself across the map.  The shooting itself is fairly bare-bones, and the aim assist is a bit too kind (even on the hardest difficuly I could just spray and take out a group), but large groups of enemies can still be a problem if you don't stay on the move.There are a few cheap enemies that stack unfairly with the glitches that this game has, such as the rocket launcher soldiers.  These guys are rare, but I found that, once I was shot, I would be flung somewhere and be stuck on the floor untill another rocket arrived to put me out of my misery.  There are quite a few of situations that you can get yourself into where you'll get stuck and soldiers will swarm your defenceless body and proceed to shoot you full of bullets.And that leads me into the glitches... there are a few annoying ones but only a few that are game breaking.  The only game breaking bug I found was, after a finished a side mission, I was without a parachute.  I looked up the problem and it turns out that after this mission a glitch cause the parachute to dissapear unless you do another mission after (without a chute).  Luckily I hadn't done that one yet so I went about doing it without a chute, and that was the most miserable I had been playing this game... but it did fix the issue.  (Just leave that quest to the end if you can)GraphicsIt's an older game at this point, but still looks good.  The water looks especially good, which is a big boon since you'll be seeing alot of it.  The island itself suffers from a bit of texture stretching and tearing at certain points, but you never really notice them as they're in areas that you'd be flying over.MultiplayerThere is a FREE yes FREE mod for this game that adds in multiplayer. Adding greatly to the experience of this game by playing it with friends. You can check that out  Here	Verdict8/10 "

												Just Cause 2Story - Good god, what a rush. Take Grand Theft Auto, take Michael Bay and just. Mash them together. Probably one of the best games I've ever played being completely honest (Then again I say that about every cool game I play) 10/10Storyline Length - A couple days, it won't get boring, trust me.AI - Ice-cold killers. Grenades, snipers, revolvers, they'll use everything. They will find you. And they will kill you. Beware. Many different types of enemies too. Watch for ninjas Cx 10/10Experience - Ok, imagine a game where instead of driving cars, you use a zipline that's attached to your hand and infinite parachutes (not joking) to get around, where you can cause mayhem wherever you go. Tbh the only downside to this is that you run out of ammo way too quickly. 10/10Graphics - It's.... Ok, could be a bit better, but it's still great. 8/10Sounds / Voice Acting - Gun sounds, explosions and all sounds great. But the voice acting is just. Terrible. It doesn't ruin the game though, but it's just... Uncomfortable. 5/10Controls - Just straight-up easiest action game to play with a keyboard, Idk why ""C"" is aim weapon though :/ 9/10Overall - 8.5/10Just. Amazingness. If you haven't played or bought it yet, buy it and play it. Just. Please. This is quite literally Michael Bay's wet dream. ALSO, the Multiplayer Mod is free on Steam, so get that too for additional mayhem >:3THIS IS JUST. AWESOME. BUY IT NOW. YOU KNOW YOU WANNA!!!			"

-Quick Review-Just Cause 2 was my first experience with a  ""third-person action shooter"". I enjoyed the quality, the way I describe the game is with the following formula: Skyrim plus Grand Theft Auto multiplied by Explosions/Torgue minus any type of interesting story whatsoever, and let's throw in terrible airplane controls on a keyboard to boot! -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Welcome to Panau, you are Rico Rodriguez, a spy in the service of the United states. Or as I like to call him ""the stereo typical action hero"". Playing through this game I didn't look at most of the explosions so I did a good job being a badass. As you progress through the story you end up helping three factions lead an uprising in Panau against the current dictator ""Baby"".As far as ""Just Causes"" go, I wouldn't call this game anywhere near a just cause, the only time that I was impressed with the game was at the end of the main story where the hero does something that I could actually respect and gave a pretty good reason for it. Other then that I heard enough ""Merica!"" ""Because Freedom!"" ""Because secret agents!"" ""Rico do this action hero thing"" ""Uncle Sam"" lines to make me want to eat the American Flag. Because Patriotism! If I haven't made it clear, I found the story very dull and boring, I was looking forward to finishing the story because then I can free roam all around this massive map and blow stuff up. More on free roaming in the Game Play section!Game Play: First a few notes about the controls. They are a little tricky to get used to, I found myself struggling to figure out what cover I can hide behind, and I would accidently jump out of vehicles or off objects trying to find the right move. This could be mostly to blame for being a Keyboard and mouse gamer.The strongest controls for the game is the combination of the parachute and grappling hook. There were numerous times that I would shout to my siblings in the other room ""I'm spider man with a hang-glider!"" because that's just how the controls felt, but it was very fun and never gets dull soaring around in the sky with the occasional shot to pull me forward.Please pause for a moment in loving memory of ""Atratzu who tried to fly a plane... and crashed, like several hundred times...""    Mmmmkay, the controls for the planes are terrible, I crash like it's my job too.Okay now for the quality that made this game shine: Free roaming. I have always loved freedom in a game to do pretty much whatever I want, the story doesn't last very long on this game you can wrap stuff up in a day and have the main story done. to get 100% in the world... I cannot imagine doing it, there's just so much to explore and blow up.The OCD 100% completionist part of my brain is exploding while I play this game because there's so much to explore, collect, and blow up. I really do love that type of quality in a game, I loved it in skyrim, I love it in Just Cause 2. Achievements: The achievements in this game often times require you to do things you wouldn't usually think to do. I never tired to drag someone behind my car with my grapple hook...  or string someone up against a wall and then shoot him to death. So the achievements are dynamic and interesting. But of course there are the standard achievements too: beat the game on this difficulty, do all these quests, complete the story, get 75% completion, etc.Price: Just Cause 2 is $14.99, I've played a total of 38 hours (as of 09/05/14) that is a very good price, but as always I recommend waiting for the game to go on sale. I bought this game in a humblebundle, the quality is outstanding for the amount I paid. And there's no way I'm close to finished with this game. I imagine the game will rack up near to 50+ hours. I intend to come back to it to keep playing over time. Conclusion: I felt like I was in a terrible action movie where everything is over the top, which at first I wanted to call out on the game... but it was doing it on purpose. So why insult something that's trying to be over the top? In the end I fell in love with the game.Regardless of the terrible annoying story (in my opinion, it was terrible and annoying, some people probably loved it and thought it was deep with metaphoric meaning.), sometimes clunky keyboard controls... all the terrible fireball-plane crashes I had... I still will keep coming back for more. I think this game is worth a buy and playing at least for a little bit.This game is probably best suited for people who like action games of any kind, the 3rd person perspective might catch you by surprise, so don't expect sniping or any scopes: all you have are cross hairs. If you know you like action games, and like free roaming with a parachute and grappling hook, this game is right up your alleyway.Edit/Update 11/12/14 - All achievements earned after playing for about 90 hours.

*WARNING: The following review contains plot spoilers to a 5-year-old game.*One of the most fun sandbox shooters of our time. Ridiculous action sequences, over-the-top explosions, and lots of angry Pinoy infantry.The Gameplay is split up between freeform exploration including cars and bikes, planes, boats, helicopters and skydiving (with unlimited butt parachutes for paragliding purposes, complements of Uncle Sam) and a little bit more structured missions with objectves that need to be checked off before the mission can proceed towards completion. How you go about these objectives (neutralize targets, rescue VIP's, capture locations or vehicles) is often left up to you, provided you don't stray too far from a designated mission area. Weapons are multitudinous and varied; your standard assault rifles, pistols and submachine guns as well as rocket launchers, grenades, triggered explosives, and the more exotic hookshot weapon which allows you to attach opponents to the ceiling, a vehicle, or each other, as well as move around quickly in both horizontal and vertical movement.The Story revolves around Rico Rodriguez, spy and mercenary hired by the US (off the record, of course). Your job: Cause chaos and destruction across the tiny island nation of Panau, whose new president Baby Panay (Yes, seriously) has started to isolate the nation and build up the Panauan military. This has caused the purposely nebulous Agency to be called in, to destabilize the nation and install a puppet for a head of state. It is all utterly ridiculous, stock Bond novel stuff with lots more explosions and thankfully less Bond-babe-bedding. The fact that all of this terrorism carried out in the name of the US turns out to all be because of the newly discovered and massive Panau oil fields, leaves a bad taste in my mouth. All of that blood on your hands, and it was simply to protect national fuel interests.In ConclusionPlay this game:* If you're looking for a fun, light, free-form experience* For the flying mechanics* Because explosions.* For the graphics. Visually, this game is a marvel. Prettiest environments and ambient effects in any game of its generation!Don't play this game:* For the story. So asinine, so childish, so ripped from better sources* For the voice acting. Egregious examples: Bolo Santosi, Tom Sheldon and military radio ops.* If you like a challenge. As a long-time ""casual"" player, I find most missions a breeze right up until the end* For the missions. Where the game really shines is freeform exploration and combat. Clear out a base, will ya!

												I never got around to play the original Just Cause. Mainly because my computer has always had issues with it, and Just Cause 2 pretty much improves the first game in all levels. Just Cause 2 is a third-person action game, and when I say action game I mean crazy jumping-from-airplanes-and-blowing-up-cities - sort of an action game. Rico, the protagonist, is like James Bond on steroids. You can pretty much do whatever you want, in a world at least twenty times (!) bigger than San Andreas, and five times bigger than World of Warcraft. Pick your vehicle; helicopter, airplane, sports car, moped, tuk tuk etc. and pick a random location; beach, jungle, city, highway, mountain etc. to ram, stunt, blow up, crash, projectile etc. with it. Or just hook yourself to someones boat and enjoy the eyecandies of this tropical paradise. Or hook the same guy's boat into an airplane, and see him take off. Or hook the airplane to a skyscraper and see it torpedo into a ball of flames. Your choice.The grappling hook, amongst other things, is what lift this game up from the pleasant, boring and realistic open-world games. You can use this Godly thing to pretty much survive any situation. Are you falling from insane height? No problem, just hook towards the ground and survive - Or just precipitate your parachute, that works too. It lacks actually physics though, you can't use your hook to decapitate moped drivers for example, a feature that I would want for Just Cause 3!Sure the game is far from being realistic and serious, but with great looks, insanely huge map and more vehicles and weapons than you can count - who cares if it's unrealistic? You can stand on a plane while towing another one mid-air, for God's sake! I completely recommend this title if you are even remotely intersted in action, open-world and/or just plain time-consuming roaming and freedom. There is currently a third-party mod in the works, adding Multiplayer. It adds a whole new meaning to the already balls-chaotic world, and makes it go beyond the edge.Pick this game up, if you have not already! It's been on a billion sales. "

												Just Cause 2 is one of the most enjoyable games I’ve ever played, with nearly every piece of this game resonating with me on some level. From the narmy, b-movie aesthetic with stereotypical characters who love nothing more than to chew the scenery and a plot that seems like it was lifted directly out of a James Bond rip-off; to a stunningly beautiful, gargantuan tropical paradise to explore and destroy at my own pace; and finally to the ludicrous over-the-top action that unfolds at every single skirmish, this game left an indelible mark on me that few games have come close to matching.While the game’s story is about as shallow as it comes and lasts for only a handful of hours if you really wanted to push through the story, that’s not where the game’s fun lies; exploring, experimenting, and eradicating all that stands in your way at your own pace is the true joy. The game is absolutely massive; it will be dozens of hours before you even came close to completing a mere half of the map. Unfortunately, you may find this tedious after a while as many of the bases and villages are duplicates of each other. Thankfully, each quadrant of the island has a different aesthetic to it, from the sweltering, arid deserts to the bustling metropolitan areas to the snow-capped mountains to the tropical shores, the nation of Panau seems to have a little bit of everything. This will help to take the tedium out of the game.You will be wanting to spend time on this island, too. I cannot stress how wonderful and truly massive it feels; clocking it at roughly four hundred square miles, Panau is easily the largest world I’ve ever seen in an action video game. And while the visual style is not photorealistic, it does an absurdly exceptional job at creating a sense of scale. When skydiving for the first time, I was breathtaken at how small I felt in relation to the rest of the world.This feeling will never quite go away, even after hundreds of skydives. You will be doing a lot of skydiving; the parachute and grappling hook was my de-facto method of map traversal. It is a ludicrous way to travel in a ludicrous game; the larger-than-life action will be sure to excite. You can creatively destroy all that stands in your way through a combination of traditional weapons and vehicles to some non-traditional gadgets, such as the aforementioned grappling hook and some special secret agent toys to pilot and shoot. Shooting out tires, tethering enemies to moving cars and rockets, C4 detonations, and high-speed car chases where you rapidly negotiate your way around several still moving cars will become the commonplace.While the paper-thin excuse plot and repetitive nature of the game may leave a bad taste in many players’ mouths, I believe that the gorgeous environment and exciting action as well as the ability to set your own pace means that this game has definitely become one of my favorite games of all time.

YouTube™ Video: Just Cause 2 [Game Review] 

			Views: 108		

			My review of the 2010 action open world game ""Just Cause 2"", published by Square Enix and developed by Avalanche Studios.		

Game: Just Cause 2Genre: Open World Third-person ShooterDeveloper: Avalanche StudiosPublisher: Square EnixCopy supplied by SteamJust Cause 2 is an open world action game developed by Avalanche Studios and published by Square Enix in 2010. This is the first of many reviews to come about the latest installments of franchises that are coming back in the near future.STORYYou play as Rico Rodriguez, one of the Agency's main operatives, as he is sent to the island of Panau to oust Panay from office, as well as track down and assassinate his old mentor, Tom Sheldon, who the Agency fears has gone rogue after disappearing during the regime change. In order to find Sheldon, Rico allies himself with the three dominant criminal gangs on the island: the Roaches, an organized crime syndicate, the Reapers, an insurgent Socialist militia and the Ular Boys, an ultranationalist rebel group that espouses traditionalism and opposes foreign influence.The story is over-the-top and the dialogue is really cheesy. The story serves only to justify you being a terrorist who destroys power plants, ventilation systems, dams, military bases and many more objects. Save for a few moments in the 7 Story Missions, it is not memorable.GRAPHICSEven though it has been 5 years since the game was first released, it still looks damn great on PC: the island is colourful, the explosions are vibrant, the draw distance is long and the water feels realistic. The only things that have always been the problem with the game are the facial textures and animations. Other than that, you will have a gorgeous experience that will run at 60fps even on a toaster.GAMEPLAYThe goal is to cause as much chaos as you can by destroying military facilities and everything related to that. Right from the get-go you can explore the 400 square miles of Panau, discovering the 368 locations, engaging in high-speed chases by water, plane or car, hijacking enemy vehicles to crash into oil rigs... There is a lot of variety in what you can do and how.The big game changer is the grappling hook, which can be used to gain speed while using your unlimited parachutes, to pull enemies from ledges, to attach a speeding vehicle to the ground so that it flies in the air, to attach an enemy to the ceiling and turning him into a human piñata, and so on. You can also carry three weapons (two sidearms, one big gun) and both grenades and sticky bombs.There is the black market, which can be used to order and upgrade weapons and vehicles, or as a way to fast travel. But I strongly recommend that, because each time that you go from one place to the other, you are bound to find an hidden collectible, a new location, or a new badass vehicle that you hadn't tried already. The side activities that you complete for the gangs are very similar to one another, and usually consist of escorting someone, finding an object in a base or destroying a base or two. There are also races that are varied and very fun to play. The game is a ton of fun, and you won't regret the time you'll spend with it.CHALLENGEThe game tends to be very challenging even on the easiest settings, thanks to strong and numerous enemies that will pursue you, as well as an unforgiving checkpoint system in the missions.SOUNDThe soundtrack is hugely underrated, but really strong and energizing, while the voice acting is one of the cheesiest since the original Resident Evil. But since it seems like they made that on purpose, I'll let it slide.The sound effects are great, with clear distinctions from one gun to the other, and with some hugely satisfying explosions.REPLAYABILITYA huge map, tons of collectibles, multiple missions and 50 Steam achievements are bound to make you play this game for a long time to come, especially if you are waiting for Just Cause 3's release.Overall, this is a phenomenal game to play, with an amazing open world, fluid and varied combat, multiple collectibles, strong soundtrack and beautiful vistas. This is a game that I love, and I strongly recommend buying to everyone who loves action games. Glory to Baby Panay!Story: 7

												""It was worth every minute!"" - Rico RodriguezThis open-world game has one simple primary objective: blow ♥♥♥♥ up. No really it's just blowing ♥♥♥♥ up topped with the occasional assassinations and fetch quests while 75% of the game really is just blowing ♥♥♥♥ up in a beautiful coastal environment HOWEWER partially thanks to the unique gameplay gimmick that this game has blowing ♥♥♥♥ up has never been so fun for me before.(And I also like blowing ♥♥♥♥ up by default which makes me a maaaaaniac maaaaaniac I ♥♥♥-ume.)Add this the fact that this game is really well optimized (hence I can play it on mah potato with even 40 fps) and you've got yourself an explosive experience.P.S.: I can safely say that this is my favorite open-world game as of now.

												Just imagine a GTA-style game, with better movement, epic explosions and where the land becomes your playground. It is simply awesome. Kilometers and kilometers of landscape, filled with enemy bases, cities and naval outposts where you can cause chaos. Explosions after explkosions. Get. It. Now. PLUS : A new multiplayer-mod just went out 2 months ago, it is great ! Free updating when you buy the game. And I dare you to try to achieve 100 %. Come on.			"

												The reason why JC2 is the best open world game ever made is because of its endless possibilities and limitless creativity. The iconic grappling hook is the game maker and blending this with the gigantic world of Panau will just fuel your imagination for stunts, destructions and chaos.			"

												Just Cause 2 is probably one of the best games I've played this year. It's got tons of action, tons of content, and an excellent (and huge) map to explore. And there's always something to do, be it completing missions for the different factions, doing some challenges, finding collectibles, or simply blowing ♥♥♥♥ up. Oh, and it's got a storyline too.It improves a lot from the original game; for starters, the grappling hook is now more versatile, not to mention it's no longer counted as an extra weapon (although it's more effective as one than in the first game!). You can also combine it with the parachute, which gives a new way to move across the map; it might be tricky at first, but once you get to know the hook/parachute combo, you'll be using it a lot. The gunplay feels good as well, and while the driving is tricky at first (especially in cars), once you get used to it, it's very good as well.As for the environment, it's gorgeous. The Panau Islands are pretty varied; from dense jungles, to snowy mountains, river deltas, and even a huge desert! And they all look pretty good; the day and night cycle makes them even more beautiful, as it can create some fantastic  sunsets for you to enjoy. One of my favourite parts of the game was simply flying around in a helicopter doing some sightseeing. Another thing, the map itself is huge. Not only is there variety in environments, as I said, but there's many secrets to find as well, from collectibles, to some pretty cool easter eggs.When it comes to story, well, just like the first game, it's something that you'd expect from a cheesy action movie. Nothing bad, mind you, simply lots of action all over the place. And it's great! Explosions everywhere, gunfights on top of moving cars; it's got everything. And the last mission, in particular, is probably the most over the top action sequence I've ever seen, and it's the best part of the game. Really, you must get there and see it, as I don't want to spoil the fun.The game also has a cool soundtrack. Now, it's not like most open world games where you can listen to a radio station while driving; the soundtrack actually shows up during certain portions of the game, for example, when the military is chasing you, there's a pretty tense soundtrack playing. And the faction themes that play out after taking over a stronghold are also very good. The voice acting, well, it's interesting, for lack of a better word. I'm not sure if that's how accents from South East Asia are supposed to sound or not, but they did feel somewhat unique. And the dialogues from the main characters were also filled with cheesy one liners and such.As I already mentioned earlier, it also offers lots of stuff to do. Besides the main storyline (which is actually somewhat short, if you focus entirely on it), there's settlements to complete by finding collectibles and destroying stuff; there's three factions you can help out, doing missions for them and taking over strongholds; there's different challenges to complete; and, as I said, you can simply take your time and fly around creating some chaos, which, by the way, is essential to unlock storyline missions.Well, I don't know what more to write. All I can say is that I really enjoyed this game, and I hope that, if you get it, you enjoy it as much as I did.			"

												Ok I've only played 2 hours of this when writing this review, but played 100+ hours of JC2 on ps3 before. This is by far the BEST of all the Just Cause games. It's miles better than JC3 in terms of gameplay, mainly because, unlike in JC3, there is no compulsion to ""do everything"" to complete the story. Simply blowing stuff up and exploring at your own pace gives you so much more freedom than JC3 where it feels a lot more mechanical, with its ""do mission, liberate settlements, do another mission, rinse and repeat ad nauseum."" Yes, the voice acting and story in JC2 is utter tripe, but you don't get this game for that. You get JC2 because it is, frankly, an absolute joy to play.My only real problem is the confusing layout for controls, especially for flying vehicles like helicopters and planes, but apart from that this game is awesome.It runs on windows 10, and if it crashes at all for you, disable decals on the advanced display settings and that should fix it!

												Just Cause 2 is published in the year 2010 by the Eidos Interactive and it's the direct Sequel to Just Cause.Like it's Prequel,Just Cause 2 is an Open-World 3rd-Person-Shooter/Action Game.This is going to be a List of Pro's and Contra's about the second Game.Before i start,i highly recommend an XBOX-Controller! It fixes all Stearing Issues,even planes are awesome to play with it!!!Pro:-The Game has a HUGE(1000 square kilometres),beautiful and open Map.-The Story isn't innovative,but pretty funny and well made.-The Main Character is a cool,badass Agent who's always up for a Joke(ALWAYS!)!-There are tons of different Vehicles,from boats to cars,from helicopters to airplanes!-The controls are really easy to learn,after 10 minutes everybody should be able to play like an expert!-You can have it for 15€(About 20 Dollars!),and EVERYBODY has do admit that this is a hell of a low price!-You can waste hours just by running over the map and don't even start the Story(except for the first 2 Missions)-The Plane/Helicopter controls are awesome(except for the Si-47 Leopard Fighter Jet!)Contra:-The car/bycicle controls are not really good,only a few vehicles have good controls!-The Missions get boring after a while because they are always the same.So these were all the Points i had to say about the Game,and in my Opinion,it is definitely a Game everybody should own or at least had played it once!It is really fun,and it doesnt gets boring even after reaching 100% because of the huge Mod Community!I hope i could help you Guys with this Review!

												The voice acting is terrible and there is barely any story to it. But that is not why this game got a high rating and why it's highly recommended. The highlight of this game is the gameplay obviously. Your grapple hook and parachute get you anywhere at high speeds; you got an entire island to explore and the main goal of this game is to blow things up and cause chaos. As you progress you earn parts and money which you can use to upgrade weapons and grenades which really help you since they don't do much in the beginning. I haven't finished the story but that's my view so far...they explain...diddly squat. But it's still worth every penny since it really is one of the best games. Buy it!			"

												From the first mission I fell in love with Just Cause 2. I didnt play the first game and did expect a solid GTA clone in a Jungle/Tropical enviroment. The grappling hook however gives this game a rather unique gameplay. You can do a lot of crazy completly unrealistic stunts on land, sea and midair. After a while you realize that the missions are rather generic and one mission plays very much like the previous missions. However there is so much to explore, so many stunts to pull off and so many ways of killing the bad guys that you canget many hours of fun for small money. A definitve must buy if you can forgive the sometimes repetitive gameplay.			"

												The story and voice acting is tripe, but answer me this ... what other free roaming sandbox game allows you to skyjack a military jet and surf on the nose cone?  Just Cause 2 is a beautiful, fun and surprisingly well optimized rampage through a massive world that easily puts even MMORPGs to shame.  You can go anywhere, steal anything and the destruction of both property and watching a car you just tethered to a windmill as it tumbles through the air is beefy and satisfying.  The grappling hook in the game is easily the best tool in gaming since HL2's Gravity Gun, if not better.  It aids in traversing terrain easily, providing a ride when combined with your unlimited stunt parachute, or in combat with clever, hilarious ways using classic grappling, or tethering two things together, including people.  I highly recommend this game for its fun and destructive escapism, but if you're the type of person who can't enjoy a game without realism, you'd better just continue being boring.			"

 IT'S GOOD You, agent Rico Rodriguez, have the task to find and kill your old friend and mentor. He's missing in the island paradise Panau. To find him, destroy as much as you can. (Don't as me why. I understand it neighter)Just Cause 2 you're a nice open world game with awesome action, sounds and visual effects - but you are not a story game!++ BIG OPEN WORLD (more than 300 places to discover)++ fast travel++ nice vehicle variation (cars, trucks, boats, airplanes, jets...)++ very good sound++ the explosions are really breathtaking+ many challenges, group missions or objects to find+ lots of funny moments+ no hard achievements+ MULTIPLAYER - could be funny with friends (didn't played it yet)+ Just Cause+ You are like Spiderman with your hook+ It will take some time to complete all achievements (~ 40-50 hours)- 7 main missions? C'mon! That's nothing!- you don't play this game for the story, don't forget it!- short playtime for the main missions - 8 to 10 hours if you rush- AI enemies are easy to beat- some of the controls are...sh*t- I don't like Spiderman If you look for a very wide open world with a huge variety of weapons and vehicles - This is your game! You don't play Just Cause 2 for the story - you play it for the explosions and the really big world. If you can get it in a sale you can't make something wrong!I like you, Just Cause 2 - 8/10 "

												SO much fun. Just Cause 2 is the definitive throw-things-down-a-mountain simulator.I originally bought JC2 at full retail price on Xbox 360 after playing the demo for around 4 hours. It is one of the few games from recent memory that left me with no regrets of paying full price. The open world sandbox is mind blowingly massive and the amount of things to blow up is just mental. Combine that with the crazy gravity defying grappling hook+parachute traveling mechanics and not only is it a vast world but it’s enjoyable to traverse.I purchased the PC version solely for mods (infinite grappling hooks, multiplayer, etc.) and while I certainly wouldn’t drop another 60 bucks on it, the upgrade in hardware plus the ability to mod the game made the purchase well worth while.

												Just Cause 2 is like an exciting trip to a foreign country. You never know what to expect from the locales , or if the stuff you are currently eating includes 1 or more domestic animals inside it. Story:The Game has you starring as Rico, formerly known as ""Scorpio"", an buff, stereotypical white latino.Your job is being a ♥♥♥♥ to the self aclaimed new president ""Panay"", which is trying to distance panau, the island you play on, from the western world. He's doing that by the obvious way. Establishing his own dominance via painting every single combustable/explosive in his signature colours. Red and white. Why that is important ? You wont ask me again when you have already read this review further. Your Job is trying to ""Liberate"" Panau for 'murica'.Doing that is quite easy. Blowning up gas containers, facilities, military bases, all nice stuff.Gameplay:As you can guess, the game doesnt take itself too serious, however, this might not be as much of an flaw, as you might imagine in the first place. Did I mention that Rico has a Grappling hook ? No ? Well, in the context of the ""serious"" plot, Scorpio has this weird ♥♥♥ thingy, that allows him to do ridiculous stuff, like attaching two enemies onto each other , and giggle at their frustration, as they get smashed against each other, trying to get the hook loose, that is piercing through their flesh. Sounds like fun, now doesnt it, you jerk ? Well, to be honest, it is. It's a blast. Using the grapling hook to pull yourself onto vehicles, get around, or just do the before mentioned with cars, planes, boats..you get the Idea. On top of it all, you get  the most reliable parachute in the world. Using it in combination with your personal zipping device, you can fly through the air to get to new places, extent your life by a few more seconds, or dodge great threats all together.  As for the goal of the game, your job is to cause chaos. You do that via the before mentioned blowing up of important infrastructures, that are all conveniently marked by Panays Signature colours. By doing that, you will unlock more Items for the so called Black market. A mysterious delivery service, that is run by the "" Sloth demon"", and delivers everything you could ask for in a game like this, like cars, weapons,planes  aswell as extracting you too any previously discovered location. With the right amount of chaos, you will constantly unlock new stuff to buy there, and  if you're lucky enough to dfin new vehicle/ weapon parts on your journey, you can even go as far as upgrading the Items you buy from him. Havent I told you, how much this abscense of a real story brightens up the game ? See ? Awesome.I sincerely wish that there were more games like this.Graphics and PC performance, mods, and tweaking:Just cause 2 is an relatively old game, as you might have guessed already.That however doesnt keep it from having a solid technical build quality. The environment look nice, especially in places with a lot of fauna, Ricos clothing is very detailed, and nothing clips through him (*Cough* Assassins Creed*Cough*) , and the draw distance is very nice.Surprisingly enough, the water is looking awesome, if you have an corresponding Nvidia Card. I sugest atleast having an GTX 280, because it´s rendered via cuda cores, but it runs just as well on AMd cards of the same quality. For a DirectX 10 Game, the lighting is very beatiful, and eyecandy such as Godrays enhances the overall experience.Panau is very detailed, and optic fidelity can be found everywhere. from the harsh mountain tops, that are covered in snow, to the green jungle,small villages, and deserts, the game looks absolutely gorgeous.It´s colourful, cramped with detail, and fun to play in.As for the mod side of things, you can find a lot of interesting stuff besides all the cheats, vehicle, and weapon mods. Guessing that your PC is fast enough, I would sugest to Use Sweet FX, if I were you. Sweet Fx is a mod, which allows modern Anti Aliasing technologies, such as FXAA, and SGSSAA, to be forced into a game, which doesnt natively support said options. It also can be tweaked to your liking , and there are many user created presets for it, which enhance saturation, contrast, and overall optical Fidelity a lot.Speaking of optical enhancers, how well does the game actually run ? To be honest, it runs like a charm. my GTX470 always can keep up smooth 60 Frames per second, while having sweet FX, and the ingame MSAA to work with.there is no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t frame cap, no forced Vsync, a nice Field of view, and advanced graphical options, to tweak the game to your liking.Conclusion:Just Cause 2 delivers what it promises. Action without any compromises. It isnt held back by its serious plot, social commentary, or anything similar to those dfancy ♥♥♥ triple A Titles you always hear about. It´s just pure fun with an Story construct build beneath it. Did I even mention the multiplayer mod ? So far, all i can say is that I am really enjoying this game.It was definitely worth every cent I spend on it, and I can only give my recommendation for it to you. If you enjoy mindless action, hilarious situations, and all out rampages, then this game is for you. buy it.9.5/10 for racist Asian accents.			"

												This is probably the best impulse buy I've ever made.  If you like sandbox games at all, buy it!  Seriously, why are you still here??  Go buy it NOW!  You'll love it!  The physics engine is loose enough to let you have ridiculous amounts of fun with the game world and you can spend hours just exploring and wreaking havoc.  I really cannot recommend this game enough.  It's one of my all time favorite ways to relieve stress.			"

												Have played the game for all 4 years of its release across 3 platforms. I've never gotten 100% save. Says pretty much all you need to know. This game is a masterpiece, a masterpiece that takes more time to complete than the Mona Lisa took to paint.

												One of my favourite free roaming sandbox games.If Far Cry 2 and GTA IV had a baby with glorious five-o-clock shadow it would be this game.So much to do, hundereds of locations to discover and conquer, thousands of things to blow up with your extensive arsenal of weapons and vehicles (Land, Water, Air, but no Fire 0/10 would not bend)Multiplayer is pretty fun, but I honestly have put around 45 minutes into it.Controls can be a little wonky if you're used to third-person games on console (like me)Overall I'd give it 9/10 because the voice acting isn't really my cup of tea and some things can get a little repetitive.

												I just finished playing Just Cause 3 and realized that I never wrote a review for this awesome game.Even though this game is 6 years old now, it has held up incredibly well. The graphics, while not anything special by modern standards, are still decent and the draw distances is still much better than 99% of the other games out there. The gameplay is still solid and plenty of fun.What really keeps drawing me back to this game time and again is the world. The map is absolutely gigantic by the standards of any game not using procedural map generation, and because it was hand built it is chock full of interesting content just inviting you to get out and explore (and cause random chaos while you're at it).Sure this game isn't perfect, the vehicle handling is pretty poor, the AI isn't anything special, the black market system has some issues (finite resources in game being the biggest one), chaos objects aren't shown on that map which makes finding the last one or two chaos objects extremely frustrating at times, and the story is barely passable (although it has some pretty epic set pieces), but these issues are forgivable since this game is simply so much fun to play, especially with the free multiplayer mod.Given how cheap this game is now and how much fun it still is (I consider it to be superior to JC3 in that regard), it is extremely easy to recommend.

												I love this game with a passion. Ignore the hours on my record, I played this game for hundreds more on the PS3.Why do I love it you may ask? Let me tell you a story of something that happened completely dynamically, as well as a pros and cons review of Michael Bay's Wet Dream: The Video Game~~~I had just purchased a rocket launcher that could fire four rockets at once from the black market. With this i decided to have a bit of fun. I was parachuting along when i saw a gas station, which i promptly blew up. The military then sent two squad cars and a man on a mortorcylce. I hopped on top of one care where a man was hanging out of the side shooting at me. I shot a grappling hook into his chest and tethered him to the other car where he was dragged along and ran over by a taxi cab. I rode on top of this car, shooting at the other car when i leaped onto the miltary motorcylce that was following us, tossing the soldier onto the ground so he could get run over by one of his fellow soldiers. I rode this away until i reached a four way intersection where i set several cars around, making my base. Everytime a car drove towards me i'd blow it up with the rocket launcher. This went on until I heard a radio signal saying ""We are dropping like flies! Send air support!"",  which is when I knew that the fun was only beginning. I grappled onto the first helicopter i saw, with a man hanging off of the side and shooting at me. I shot him in the face then threw the driver out onto the ground. I then began attacking their other helicopters with my own. This was only the beginning.Another two helicopters showed up, these ones with heat seaking missiles. I was shot down and parachuted into a nearby jungle. A couple men on motorcycles chased me into the forest where i was riding a bike of my own, zig-zagging through the trees. This chase continued until we reached a cliff. I drove off the cliff and gracefully leaped off of the flaming bike and soared through the air. I landed on a nearby highway where some rebels were attacking more miltary. I ran up to join in the fight when i got shot with a shotgun once, killing me and ending my run. tl;dr I was badass.~~~PROS: +Beautiful asthetically speaking.+COLOSSAL map.+Fun, action packed gameplay. +Cheesy and hilarious(ly bad) dialogue (intentionally so as to bring back memories of cheesy 80's action B movies).+Cheesy story (intentionally so as to bring back memories of cheesy 80's action B movies).+Lots of easter eggs.  (Including the entire island from ""LOST"") CONS:-Short Campaign.-""AH HE GOT ME WITH HIS WIRE TING!""			"

What makes it even more fun is when you install mods for the game like the superman mod. The story might not win any awards but the gameplay does. But honestly, I don't play for the story, I play more for the sandbox expirience and multiplayer. I mean come on! Have you ever tried finshing the game?

												In general I can recommend this game. It offers a huge area with different, let's say, ""climatic zones"". You will be able to visit a snowy land, a desert, islands and a temperated climate lands of Panau. What's more, there are a lot of villages and cities to explore, including the capital city. All this covered in well-made graphic going hand in hand with nice optimalization. Breathtaking landscapes were the best in my oppinion.Rico, the protagonist, can use a lot of weapons to spread destruction and fire. Carabines, shotguns, grenade launchers, regular grenades... there are many of them, you will surely find one that's suitable for you.Apart from the main campaign offering spectacular missions that are like from the best action movies, there are a lot of sidequests connected with different factions of Panau. I won't tell you their names as for I don't want to spoil.In the beginning of this review I wrote ""in general I can recommend..."". I wrote it, because it's true, but not only. I'd like to write about some things I didn't like. Firstly, many missions that are repetitive and make you think as if you were doing it for another time. Second thing - from circa middle part from the game it got boring for me. It takes too much time to get destruction points to unlock next main quest and exploring is not as appealing as it was before.I haven't played multiplayer yet, so I won't write about it, although I heard from my friends that it's good.Generally speaking, there are more positives about this game than negatives, that's why I can boldly recommend it as a good, well-made and beautiful looking product.

												I've played Just Cause 2 originally on xbox 360 and put more than 20+ hours into it. Panau is a big beautiful island with lots to see and as Rico AKA The Scorpio as your tour guide. Rico is a mercenary looking for someone on the island and is drafted to help local gangs reign chaos in an attempt to complete his own personal mission.Just Cause 2 follows somewhat of a GTA game play scheme. Notable differences include driving and the obvious attachment of a hook shot / grapple. This grapple is what makes Just Cause, Just Cause. This thing can literally attach to anything within a certain distance. This includes automobiles, helicopters, buildings, boats, trees, mountains and literally anything you can think of. Upon grappling onto a car, Rico can perform ""stunt jumps"" in which he is able to maneuver himself on and around the car. This comes handy in case you are being fired at and need some extra cover. When attaching oneself to a helicopter, Rico can chill underneath or just like a car, attempt to hijack it. There are a few QTE (quick time events) that need to be performed in order to successfully high jack any moving vehicle. You can also grapple enemies if you're really feeling it. Alternatively, Rico can attach his grapple to two objects. Say you want to shoot at an explode-able object but it's not quite close enough to the enemies. Rico can shoot his grapple at the barrel and then attach it nearby or on the enemy. Once the barrel is shot and starts flying, the grapple will pull it towards the enemy. It's an extremely cool feature but with a few flaws. If you're trying to get cars that pass by to run into it, it doesn't really work. For one reason or another the game made it so you cannot simply have people running into the grapple. What you may do though is use it against cars or helicopters. Being chased? Not a problem. Attach to the car then attach to the road or any tree that's nearby and watch them flip. Driving is sort of it's own unique thing in the game. When the car is flipping over multiple times I like how they did that effect, but I do not like how they made the driving scheme. It seems a little stiff and controls sometimes don't react as you want them to. Shooting is quite basic in the game and auto-targeting seems welcomed.You may zoom in while shooting and even dual wield certain weapons. Weapons can be swapped for different weapons and three slots are available to fill up. Smaller automatics and pistols can swapped out for one another (one slot). Bigger shotguns or automatics can be switched (second slot). The third slot consists of grenades or C4 (both which can be carried at the same time). Shooting is decently fun but can get old. You can crouch and roll to evade fire from enemies but there is no real cover system. It would have been nice if they added something like Gears of Wars has in regards to taking cover. What is notable in this game is that lots can be blown up. Sadly, it's not on a Mercenaries 2 : world in flames sort of demolition (which I think to this date is still the best) but JC2 still has it's moments. There is fun in mindless violence of blowing entire enemy bases up (from radio towers, electrical stations, gas tanks, enemy vehicles and towers). What you can do damage to is sort of limited. In Mercenaries 2 you could blow up an entire oil rig. In JC2, that oil rig has only certain aspects you can take out. Whether this is good or bad is determined by you. By pressing down on the D-pad you may call up ""the sloth demon"" aka your personal distributor of weapons, vehicles and extraction if needed. They really gave the player a chance to enjoy a wide variety on their menu but most unlock only after a certain amount of progress has been made (be it collecting crates, completing missions or blowing government equipment up). Anything here also costs a pretty penny!The game is known for it's beautiful graphics especially demonstrating the beauty of being able to encapsulate the entire island in the background. Even though it's not the next gen sort of graphics, it still provides for an enjoyable sight to see. The display for the weapon meters are excellently done. Even though you may run out of ammo a lot, you'll know exactly how much you have left.  Sounds are varied (explosions are finally sounding different) and comments are made by either Rico, enemies and even civilians. They organized the map in a way that is extremely easy to figure out where you are and where you want to go. They were even kind enough to indicate where potential hidden locations could be. Overall, a fantastic game. Even with a few minor flaws the gamer is sure to enjoy Just Cause 2.RATING : 7.9/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BWould have been 8 if they fixed a few grappling issues. Not only that, if you hit a civilian full throttle in a truck they won't fall off their bike. They just bounce away in the air. Kinda weird ain't it?ScreenShots Do you like helicopters Be quick on your toes when the QTE's turn up Do you like fighter planes This is actually a lot funner than it looks Do you like commercial airliners that is on fire "

												This game is best at what it does not point you to, sure there will be some marker to a miscellaneous copy and paste faction mission, promising you black market items and another mission but what makes this game shine is it's ludicrously glorious destruction that it allows you to partake in, this game will leave you to hours of falling, driving and shooting to such a level of freedom and accessability that it is a no brainer to buy this. seriously, buy it you sadist. As mentined before the missions themselves are very rarely enjoyable and fall flat half of the time, however the main storyline agency missions do have their moments.			"

												Just Cause 2 is an incredibly big open world game, where you try to help the American government to change the dictator from having all the power and to stop opressing his people. To do that, you are helped by the ""agency"", the secret service you belong to and three different rebellion factions. They all give you missions that consist most of the times in destroying huge military facilities. You can drive every single vehicle in the game and shoot pretty much every imaginable weapon. You also have a complete freedom on how to do the missions, although I don't think you can do them stealthy, I never tried, but if you buy this game you won't want to sneak around anyways.The huge island the game takes place on is called Panau and you have every imaginable landscape on it. There is a desert, mountains, woods etc... All of these landscapes are accessable with the unique gadjet given to you: the graplehook. It allows you to climb and get wherever you want and is a great solution for such a complete game.The best feature of the game however, is the multiplayer. It is completely free and you can do tons of cool stuff with your friends in there. Did I mention that it is free?So if you like open world games, explosions, great open world multiplayer explosions and tanks and jets and explosions...BUY THE GAME!			"

												Nice alternative to GTA IV and its more realistic approach. This is B-movie over the top action and plot. Story is awful, but the grappling hook is one of the most fun weapons there is in a sandbox game. Highly recommend buying the aerial pack as well with the parachute thrusters. Must have tool for the game IMO. PC version is way better of course due to mods and the ability to use many more grappling lines unlike the consoles which only allow one.This game is a blast and you will be very happy you bought it as a sandbox fan. I have owned this on both PS3 and the PC and love it to death. Anytime you want some mindless destruction, or to fly around without the use of a vehicle, just a parchute and a grappling hook this game will deliver.			"

												Lately I really like open world games, aswell as this one. You're free to do whatever you want, and this is all about causing chaos ! What do you want more ? I'm going for 100 % in this game and maybe all the achievements - but yeah; this game is pure fun, cause chaos, kill those damn cops - seriously, I've never hated cops so much like in this game. Don't forget the grapple is the funniest thing: have a wrecking ball, play piñata, go/fly anywhere you want, attach someone to your car/helicopter and fly/drive around with someone and much, much, much more !Next to that you have unlimited parachutes and last but not least the map is f*cking huge = more fun !The main story is a bit short and if you complete it you have around 25 % game completion but ... enough time to do more stuff and to reach that 100 % game completion !PS: I want a grapple hook in real life.

												A nice little timewaster for a couple of hours and then you'll never pick it up again.I'm not very familiar with this series but as a fan of the sandbox genre I was immediately hooked by the fun gameplay and appealing graphics. It's incredibly appealing to just mess around, cause havoc and experiment with the various gameplay mechanics but the initial enjoyment doesn't last long. As you start to discover the impressively sized island with various vehicles and gadgets it quickly dawns on you that the developers went for quantity over quality here. Every design element and situation is repeated ad nauseam and there is no variety to the environments which is of course due to the nature of the game world being set in a fictional asian setting (that admittedly made me want to go on vacation in thailand and cambodia again) but I have to ask myself the question why the developers didn't choose a more intriguing setting with variety. Perhaps the idea was to get away from the genre-defining GTA series; but nowadays sandbox games have generally gone far beyond GTA clones and are rightfully recognized as a genre of its own, so much so even GTA-clones as the first Saints Row develop a completely unique identity as they progress.The main problem with all the gadgets and functions in Just Cause 2 is that they are all introduced at the beginning of the game and while they are a lot of fun and give the game a unique flavour there isn't anything left to discover after the first hour or two. Surprised enjoyment followed by sobering grinding.The storyline department is also severely lacking, not that these games are usually poetic masterpieces but I can't even remember a single character, as in what is their name and character. I have no investment in short-haired action man with hookshot and thus didn't continue playing once the novelty wore off. The game is too self-aware for its own good ( not self-aware funny like Saints Row alas): nameless person in nameless setting against nameless antagonists. They have names but it never matters for a second; despite the beautiful visuals you never feel like you are traversing a real world, and even a cartoonishly over the top world can feel credible/plausible if it's internally consistent and has proper world building to draw you in. This felt more like a licensed game of one of those god-awful expendables movies.In that sense Just Cause is the epitome of a sandbox, you get nothing out of it that you don't bring yourself and you have to figure out your own way to have fun, namely smashing things together. Which is fine I guess but it comes off more like the developers couldn't be asked to do that themselves. They clearly have the skills to make all the mechanics of a sandbox game work but they don't add anything to it.If you can get this one on sale, you're gonna have fun for a little while but don't expect a memorable experience, Just Cause 2 is a distraction more than an experience.

												Just Cause 2 delivers a significant amount of missions you can explore from. It has an astonising amount of unique weapons and vehicles as well. You can jump, hang and even destroy vehicles! I have a suspicion that the developers was huge fans of spiderman because with this grappling hook installed within Rico's suit, you become the one and only true spiderman. You can skydive, roam, and explore the limitless amount of geographical places for instance, a forest, ocean, plains and more. Don't get me wrong, but for some reason, this game reminded me of GTA. Therefore, this is an astounding game for you to enjoy.			"

												When I first got this game in 2010 when it first came out, I spent 4 months playing it non-stop. It may not be appealing compared to other games these days, but it is surely worth it. It has one of the largest maps I've ever seen. Plenty of vehicles and weapons. There is also endless destruction around the map. The country in the game is ruled with tyranny. Military outposts are scattered and you can destroy them all. The missions are pretty fun, but are not most interesting. This game has one of the best open world experiences ever. With extreme variation in environments, such as snowy alpine mountains to dense rainforests to all-out desert. With the new mod developed by the community that enables multiplayer, you can have a blast with your friends and family. This game is super affordable on Steam and is a definite necessity for your library!			"

												First of all, this game is my favorite of all time and I've played about over 250 hours of it and I still play it. This is a very good game, definitely worth it price. You have complete freedom over what you want to do, when you want to. The story was too short, the plot was terrible, and the voice acting was atrocious. You must also know that THIS IS A SANDBOX GAME. You make your own fun, and if you're creative enough, you'll love this game. Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Fun factor: 10/10 Badassness: 10/10. Overall: 100000/10. I mean 10/10.[UPDATE]Yeah... This was the first review I wrote, and I've noticed how it lacks a few details.So here I go.The story in this game is short, and not too entertaining. Most gamers will tell you that the story is terrible, but it's actually not too bad, even if it IS very repetitive.The thing with this game is the free roam open world gameplay. It has a feel of freedom like no other games ever. The ""grappling hook+parachute"" combo is terrific if you want to move quickly and easily. You can drive cars, boats, planes, helicopter, jets. You can grapple a statue head to an attack chopper, pilot the chopper, blow up a few fuel shafts on the run, drop the statue head on a car, aim the chopper to a tower, eject from the chopper, watch it blow the crap up, parachute down to the ground, pick up a RPG, blow the crap out of every car, plane, chopper, whatever, grapple to a car, go full speed on the highway until you reach a ramp, jump up to the sky, eject from the car, grapple to a plane, get the pilot out of his seat, take over with a grand ending with a beautiful sunset over Panau Island.

												Imagine an open world bigger then Los Santos in GTA V. Then picture a man grappling to every building in sight and swooping along in his parachute, shooting people from above and just generally causing a whole lot of paperwork for the Panau government. That's basically the idea of this game.The goal of Just Cause 2 is to basically cause as much chaos as you can in order to overthrow the government of a small island called Panau. The game does have a main story and a whole lot of side missions, but it takes so long to get from one story mission to the next you basically forget what the story's about. But who cares when you can obliterate everything in sight? Certainly not me.If you like GTA and Michael Bay, this is the game for you.			"

												Great Game filled with action, excitement, and adrenaline. It's easily a temprary replacement for GTA 5 (in the meanwhile for PC Gamers) and is very fun to have overall. The mods for the game add additional excitement to the game, such as The Multiplayer Mod, which brings in 1,200 (more or less) players in one world to play and have fun. The Single-Player mods though are what bring this game to the peak, especially in 2013-2014 year, bringing in chracter models, weapons, and other goofy things that just bring this game to the top of the level. Be warned though, you will NOT care for Single-Player story, due to he fun that's brought from the PC Gamers/Modders and fellow players in the game.Easily a 9.5/10 type of game.			"

												Great Game filled with action, excitement, and adrenaline. It's easily a temprary replacement for GTA 5 (in the meanwhile for PC Gamers) and is very fun to have overall. The mods for the game add additional excitement to the game, such as The Multiplayer Mod, which brings in 1,200 (more or less) players in one world to play and have fun. The Single-Player mods though are what bring this game to the peak, especially in 2013-2014 year, bringing in chracter models, weapons, and other goofy things that just bring this game to the top of the level. Be warned though, you will NOT care for Single-Player story, due to he fun that's brought from the PC Gamers/Modders and fellow players in the game.Easily a 9.5/10 type of game.			"

												Imagine an open world bigger then Los Santos in GTA V. Then picture a man grappling to every building in sight and swooping along in his parachute, shooting people from above and just generally causing a whole lot of paperwork for the Panau government. That's basically the idea of this game.The goal of Just Cause 2 is to basically cause as much chaos as you can in order to overthrow the government of a small island called Panau. The game does have a main story and a whole lot of side missions, but it takes so long to get from one story mission to the next you basically forget what the story's about. But who cares when you can obliterate everything in sight? Certainly not me.If you like GTA and Michael Bay, this is the game for you.			"

												Ever wanted to play a game simulating the day to day life of Michael Bay? You've come to the right place.Positive Explosions. A lot of explosions. Huge open world, filled with stuff to collect and things to do. Perfectionists will have a field day trying to 100% it. There's an officially supported multiplayer mod available for this game, with an ample amount of daily players. Give it a try; it's absolute chaos, especailly in the airports. Satisfying gunplay with a decent selection of weapons and tools at your disposal. The grappling hook is the best thing ever. You'll never want to even drive a car because it's so fun to traverse using it, especially when combined with the parachute. Great graphics, especially for 2010. You get to be a badass action hero, jumping across cars and hanging off the edge of jets a few thousand feet up in the air.Negative Can be buggy and unstable at times. Car handling could be improved. Could experience some mild FPS drops if a lot of stuff is happening.This game is well worth a purchase.			"

												Just Cause 2 is probably one of the most eye catching action sandboxes going; thrust into the large sandbox of Panau by parachute you are the stereotypical CIA one man wonder weapon which will tame the hostile regieme for good old uncle sam. But in honesty you do not buy Just Cause 2 for its depth, but rather for the action, the carnage, the pretty explosions, and the pleasant vistas of Panau itself. In many respects Just Cause 2 builds on the premise of Mercenaries and Mercenaries 2; joinable factions, main story missions, side missions, supply drops, vehicle drops, weapon upgrades and the ever present regieme installations, bases, airfields and towns that can be taken one at a time. Either going in solo or working for the various opposition factions does make you feel like you are toppling the regieme one satisfying step at a time. Also be pleasantly surprised by excellent frames per second on the highest of graphics settings; one of the most visually stunning yet stable platforms made for the PC.			"

												I almost didn't play Just Cause 2. Twice. The first time was before buying it. I hesitated because of how huge everyone made the game world seem. The impression I got was that there was more to do here than every Elder Scrolls combined. And I didn't want to make that kind of a time commitment. But when it went on sale it was too cheap to pass up.After intsalling and trying to start the game is when I almost gave up a second time. I couldn't get the game to run for more than about 5 mintues without crashing. That meant I would race desperately to get to the next checkpoint before the game crashed. I couldn't pause or explore or do anything but rush blindly ahead. Even on normal you can't do that without dying though. So I gave up for a while and played some other games, hoping for a patch or some explanation.Eventually, months later I tried again, but the game hadn't been patched and probably wasn't ever going to be. So I researched some fixes. Nothing seemed to work. The two biggest recommendations were to run in Windows 7 compatability mode and to turn off decals. Neither worked. BUT I got lucky and just decided on a whim to do both at the same time. The first time the game ran for 15 minutes without crashing I almost cried. Then I made it to an hour. More. So luckily, that combination fixed it for me. But the real shame of this game is that I almost missed it entirely because of such a horrible beginning experience and having to manually change things to get it to even run.Once it did run though, it was an awesom experience. In a word: fun. And really just plain, simple, fun. The first two tutorial-heavy story missions are actually a bad opening to the game, even though they introduce all the necessary concepts. They're too linear. Too narrow. The best part about Just Cause is how open and free and spontaneous the world is. The story missions largely lack all of that. The controls also took some getting used to. Having dodge be tab - an awkward button to hit repeatedly - and aim be C - something I've never encountered before - threw me for a while. Eventually I did get used to the controls though and I couldn't find a mapping I liked more than the default one. There's just a learning curve and you have to power through it.In the open world and used to the controls, the game shines. Largely because there is a lot to do, but you don't even have to do any of it. I spent my first 10 hours or so just exploring and causing chaos and searching for items. And it was addictive. And fun!Then I moved on to the races. I didn't expect them to be good, but with only a few exceptions (i.e. plane flights through cities and driving on snow) I found the racing to be insanely well executed. I looked forward to completing all of them and beat all 75 even though I didn't have to.The faction missions are also fun, although I realized that the shorter they were, generally the better. Just Cause seems to be meant for bite-sized play, with a short rise and fall of action. The longer missions, whether story related or not, were where the game suffered.And the story itself is terrible. The writing, voice acting, all horendous. There are as many accents as there are voice actors, and most of them don't sound like any kind of real accent at all. It's quite jarring until you get used to it. But in some ways this actually works in the game's favor, because it reminds you not to take it seriously.So if you want a third person action game akin to GTA but even bigger and less serious (though maybe a bit less absurd than something like Saints Row) Just Cause is the place to get it.

												This game pushes the limits of open world sandbox games. The map is absolutely enormous and beautiful. Each terrain (dense jungle, desert, frozen mountains, ocean, urban) are expansive and fun to explore.The missions in the game are fairly brief, and can be beaten in a day. Despite this, you can still put hours into this game with just exploration. There is also a multiplayer mod in development that adds a whole other level of fun.This game is exceptionally well optimized as well. It runs on almost any machine with a decent frame rate, and adapts to any resolution flawlessly.My only gripes are that the gameplay gets a bit repetitive after finishing the main story, but if you are good at making your own fun and are willing to download a few mods, you can enjoy this game for a long, long time.8/10			"

												There really isn't much I need to say about this game. I've sunk hours in on console and on PC, and it is a fantastic open world game. People are going to compare it to Grand Theft Auto, of course, and while in some areas you can, you really can't in others. The map is unbelievably large, and the storyline itself advances through ♥♥♥♥ing up everything you come across in whatever way you deem necessary for it to come down or explode. You can grapple all over the place and you have unlimited parachutes plus the ability to steal ANY vehicle in this game - if it moves, you can steal it. Anything from little bikes up to massive jet liner airplanes.Do I recommend this game? Hell yes. This is the most fun you will ever have in an open world setting. No restrictions, no linear story crap (unless you REALLY want to, and even then it's pretty damn open), just good old fashioned fun.			"

												A fun game that is worth getting while on-sale. It kinda is like the GTA series, but the world isn't exactly as big as in the Grand Theft Auto games. The car movement can be a bit weird in the beginning, if you are used to games like GTA. The missions are okay, and so is the gameplay. You can get creative and do a lot of fun stuff with the 'wire thing' that you have . Then there comes the multiplayer. You can have a great time if you have some friends to play this with.  The game requirements aren't really that big, but the graphics aren't bad.All in all, this is a game that is totally worth picking up on sale, and if you'll also get some of your friends to get it, you're gonna have some fun!

There is a story / plot line but you have no need to rush into it.

												10/10 - The most content a game could have.I'm a bargain shopper but this is a game I would litterally pay $60 for. So much content. Never ending missions, 360 vehicles to drive and more. After 36 hours I am only 32% to completion! Amazing. Tons of mods to spice up  the game as well. FANTASTIC!  10/10 Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												Oft rumoured but they say that if you look up the dictionary definitions for ""ridiculous"", ""marvellous"", or ""sheer unbridled insanity"", you'll find that Just Cause 2 is a suggested alternative. With a more than generous helping of hopefully intentional B-movie voice acting, JC2 (also know as EXPLOSIONS!: The game) is a vast physics-defying experience with a throwaway plot, fun-for-the-hell-of-it missions (a remarkable finale not to be missed) and a huge open world to satisfy your destructive needs.

""DON'T BLAME ME, IT WAS A DESIGN FLAW""What would you like me to say on this intouchable completition of 100%? Jaws down.If I say it's huge, it actually is. You cannot even imagine how huge it is. I've never ever played at a BIGGER game world than Panau is yet. It's so big that Panau contains desert, jungle and snowy mountains. It'll take you at least 10 minutes to jet it over and over 5 hours to walk across the map. While GTA takes you like 2 mins to jet it through, and 2,5 hours to walk it across. Both is confirmed guys, not just random number.Complexity of things you can do here? GTA Series are nothing in comparision with this. There is over 350 towns and villages to explore and liberate, more than 120 military bases to liberate, explore and destroy, those contains big airports, harbors, radar stations and so on. More than 100 cars and planes to drive. More than 2000 items to collect. If you want to reach 100% completition it is almost impossible. You gotta work your ♥♥♥ off and you still won't reach that without modding the game because 6 items out of 2000 are missing. I am not blaming devs. You cannot blame them for it.Yes, there is only 7 main missions without relevant story, but 49 faction missions, 50 challenges, 30 bridge limbing and another stuff that will do it. I said that there is no relevant story, because I really feel like it is not. This game is more about destruction of the Panau that those 7 story missions. If you like cruising around with jet, I recommend you to buy Black Aerial DLC for that certain jet, otherwise rest is garbage for me. Multiplayer element has been added recently, I just tried it briefly, but will put out standalone review on it sooner or later.To make it shorter than the game is, you will definitely not make any mistake buying this and certainly not spending week or more inside the game.Bonus Point: Country TransitionRating: 9/10 "

												I've got to say I fell in love with this game from the very start. The storyline is gripping and addictive. I’ve never got board of this game since I got it and I’ve been loving it ever since. Even though it is not the newest game on the market, it is still one of the best. Just Cause 2 is up there in my Top 3 favourite games ever, yeah, it means that much to me! From stealing fighter jets to driving a fire engine, you can literally do anything. One of my favourite things to do is massive road trips across the map, I know, it might be a bit sad but I find it fun! It works so well because the map is that big. I only realised that the PC map is a lot bigger that the console map a couple of months ago! At least I think it is. In conclusion, it is amazing game and I recommend to everyone to buy it because it is one of the best games I have ever played. Period.			"

												Just from playing 2hrs of this game i can say it is enjoyable, the physics can be funny when shooting enemies and see them flying or when jumping out of a moving car only to see the enemy vechile crashing into it and exsploding. Although the keyboard controls can be diffuclt it is still fun to play. The grappling is fun but was annoying at first when shooting to get to places. What is annoying is running out of ammo like in seconds. WTF, kill 4 guys, oh gun runs out of ammo. Still this is the beginning and will ungrade in the future playthroughs.

												★ ★ ★ ★Making trouble in Paradise.With the original Just Cause being nothing but a failed GTA clone, most would expecting that and nothing but on the sequel, right? Wrong. This game is the embodiment of chaos and fun.Let's just get this out of the way: the story mode is ♥♥♥. It doesn't get to be the fun B-Movie it tries to be, it feels like a chore. The missions are tremendously repetitive with some of the worst voice acting in gaming. It amazes me how a game with such a crappy story can feel so great! Perhaps it's because it isn't stuck to the story, this is sandbox at it's best. Who cares about some random island going through dictatorship? You want to blow stuff up! Hook up a car to an airplane and drive it to the edge of earth's atmosphere!This is one of the best time sinks on Steam right now, just don't go expecting Shakespare.			"

But he dies soon into the game because of racism. And racism towards blacks is wrong.10/10, would shoot Hispanics again			"

												Just Cause 2 brings much needed improvement upon the first game's format. Improving in almost every conceivable way, it turned a game which was riddled with problems and a repetitive nature into an enjoyable experience. It's far from perfect, story falling into the stupid and cliche once more, but at least somewhat satirical this time, if it was meant to be taken seriously then the voice acting certainly didn't help. Just Cause 2 can also crash on systems well above recommended requirements albeit rare. Besides those points, there's a lot to like. The soundtrack is better than ever and perfect for the game. Graphics are great and polished, assuming you can overlook the forced depth of field (developers please stop this.) The world is expansive yet detailed with various areas like mountain regions, cities and deserts to explore and complete. Quality of gameplay as a whole has improved drastically with better controls, intuitive combat including use of grapple, better side activates, missions and creative bosses. Avalanche studios put real effort in between JC1 and 2 and it shows. It's a much more enjoyable game, sure it can be repetitive going for 100%, but I still got a solid 18 hours out of the game without completing it fully. So I recommend picking it up for anyone interested in an open world sandbox all about causing chaos then go for it.			"

												+ With Grappling Hook you can reach everything, if there's Choper firing missiles and machine gun at you? No problem! just grappling hook and hijack that Choper+ Huge Island, you can take long time to explore an entire section of the map+ For the game who released on 2010, the Graphic is Awesome+ The feel when you riding vehicle is so realistic, the handling of every vehicle is different, the environment take a big part, try to ride a limo in offroad environment, and you'll see what i'am talking about+ Explosion and Gun Firing everywhere, not sure this is another usual open world game or Michael Bay Simulator.8.5 / 10			"

												Just Cause 2 is all about running around and having fun with loads of toys and things that go boom. If you go into this game thinking you're going to get some seminal epic, you're in for a surprise. Just Cause 2 is a tongue-in-cheek look at espionage video games. This guerilla simulator lets players raise hell in an immense open-world practically any way they want, and the results are sure to bring a smile to your face.Wherever you go, you'll find all sorts of things and people to destroy. Whether spitting death by launching rockets from a helicopter or grapple hooking a hapless enemy to a moving vehicle, you'll want to get creative in the ways you dispatch your foes. As such, this game is filled with hilarious combat most action gamers will really enjoy. Unfortunately, it also comes with its fair share of unpolished bits that the abundant humor simply can't cover up completely.The first 15-30 minutes of Just Cause 2 is a clear example of how not to make a video game. The introduction is filled with lots of things that plague the title throughout. For starters, this is where you'll be introduced to the cliché characters and lowbrow plot; I don't think I've ever cared less about a game's story - something about 'The Agency' hunting down a dangerous American in a nationalistic tropical island rife with pretenders to the throne. Making matters worse, the poor narrative is exacerbated by the loathsome dialogue and painful delivery. Some may argue that the developers tried to make the game cheesy in these regards in order to accentuate the humoristic approach the gameplay takes, but I'm here to squash those claims - the story, characters, and voice acting utterly fail.Thankfully, the run-and-gun action is often exceptionally fun. There are lots of different weapons to use, and delivering death in cruel and unusual ways soon becomes second nature. Perhaps the biggest reason for the off-the-wall combat is the dual grapple hook in Just Cause 2. Imagine romping through 3-D environments with Bionic Commando-like abilities. Now imagine pulling off grapple swings, hitching to vehicles, and zipping to locations that are over a hundred yards away! Moreover, pulling enemies out from behind turrets and immediately riddling them with bullets will not only net you special kills, but is ever so satisfying.The dual grapple hook is also an excellent way to get around combat zones. Rather than simply running from place to place, you'll be better served by zipping from building to building like some kind of mutant monkey. You'll be able to get in and out of combat in a flash, and get yourself into advantageous positions simply by aiming for the building tops. Of course, the grapple hook is only one way to get around. You'll also have access to a parachute that can be engaged on the fly at almost any moment.As good and as game-changing as these gameplay workings are, combat is held back significantly by the poor shooting and cover mechanics. This game essentially does away with any of the technical shooting skills gamers have developed in FPS and TPS titles over the years in favor of a user-friendly, cinematic approach. As long as your gun is pointed in the vicinity of an enemy, you'll turn him into Swiss cheese. While this forgiving tact makes pulling off aerial kills and other stunts a breeze, it also dumbs down the encounters.Another of the game's foibles is the difficulty in getting around the expansive world. As good as zipping around the combat zones can be, getting from one point of an island to another is extremely slow. This is due to a number of factors. First, the vehicles are cumbersome. Driving, flying, and boating around the hilly, overgrown, and obstacle-laden land, seas, and skies of Panau is painful. Second, the world is so big, you'll sometimes go nearly 10 kilometers (6 miles) to get to your next objective. Even in a chopper, this can take upwards of five minutes - in a quad, car, or rickshaw/golf cart you're looking at 20 minutes, minimum!In an attempt to ameliorate this, you can call up a black market dealer and get extracted from your current position to your desired location. While they let you call upon this glorified shuttle service as much as you want (and for free), it only really works if you've already been to the location.Despite the inefficiencies inherent to negotiating a massive open-world, Panau is a great place to get your guerilla on. I liked the varied terrain : encompassing beaches, urban zones, factories, villages, refineries, fortresses, jungles, air strips, mountains, etc. Panau is essentially a warrior's playground. There are literally thousands of nooks and crannies to discover. By exploring the world in detail, you'll get access to weapon and vehicle parts as well as get nifty health boosts.In addition to upgrade chests, you'll also find cash stashes that can be used to purchase new equipment. Cold, hard cash isn't the only form of currency in the game, however; Chaos is every bit as valuable. By taking out government vehicles and emplacements (radio towers, gas tanks, satellite arrays, holding tanks, transformers, etc.) you'll be awarded with ever-increasing Chaos totals. The more Chaos you unleash on Panau, the more faction and agency missions as well as back market items become available.Whether you're playing the game on PC, Xbox 360, or PS3, you'll be treated to a beautiful, if somewhat unrealistic, time. The Southeast Asian archipelago of Panau isn't exactly as lived in or as sensible as I would have liked, but it is a great place to play, nonetheless. If there was one word I had to use to describe Just Cause 2, it would be 'ridiculous'. The game never takes itself seriously, which, for the most part, is a good thing. However, sometimes this lackadaisical approach extends into areas where it shouldn't, resulting in an often unpolished, even amateurish experience. Still, the game has fun in spades, so all who pick it up are likely to have a total blast!			"

												I've got to say I fell in love with this game from the very start. The storyline is gripping and addictive. I’ve never got board of this game since I got it and I’ve been loving it ever since. Even though it is not the newest game on the market, it is still one of the best. Just Cause 2 is up there in my Top 3 favourite games ever, yeah, it means that much to me! From stealing fighter jets to driving a fire engine, you can literally do anything. One of my favourite things to do is massive road trips across the map, I know, it might be a bit sad but I find it fun! It works so well because the map is that big. I only realised that the PC map is a lot bigger that the console map a couple of months ago! At least I think it is. In conclusion, it is amazing game and I recommend to everyone to buy it because it is one of the best games I have ever played. Period.			"

												★ ★ ★ ★Making trouble in Paradise.With the original Just Cause being nothing but a failed GTA clone, most would expecting that and nothing but on the sequel, right? Wrong. This game is the embodiment of chaos and fun.Let's just get this out of the way: the story mode is ♥♥♥. It doesn't get to be the fun B-Movie it tries to be, it feels like a chore. The missions are tremendously repetitive with some of the worst voice acting in gaming. It amazes me how a game with such a crappy story can feel so great! Perhaps it's because it isn't stuck to the story, this is sandbox at it's best. Who cares about some random island going through dictatorship? You want to blow stuff up! Hook up a car to an airplane and drive it to the edge of earth's atmosphere!This is one of the best time sinks on Steam right now, just don't go expecting Shakespare.			"

												Just Cause 2 was one of the first games I got on Steam and it was a game I could sit down and play for hours on end. What I love most about this game is the fact of showing both how corrupt some goverments are and the great storyline and the games large arsenal of weapons. What I think should be improved however is the prices of weapons, that is should be harder to find collectibles and maybe a few more secret weapons and Easter Eggs. All in all I rate Just Cause 2 a 9/10. I would highly recommend anybody who loves a free roam, third person shooter and loves to blow things up to play this game.			"

The playable area in JC2 is seriously astounding, and yet you can cover it in no time at all. Grappling hooks are honestly one of the best things to ever be added to video games, and JC2 executes it perfectly. I once heard this game described in 3 words: Grand Theft Spiderman. There's so much to do; the quest for 100% can keep the game going for 10x the duration of a typical playthrough. (Good luck getting it though; apparently like 3 collectibles spawn outside the map and are unobtainable. Sigh.)Overall, the movement in this game is extremely tight and powerful. The combination of grappling hook, parachute and dodge roll gives many options in combat or transport. In fact, I often find myself eschewing a vehicle in favor of the good old parachute slingshot. If you like GTA, but wish it had more of America ♥♥♥♥ing with third world countries, this game is for you.			"

												Let me think about how to put how awesome and fun this game is. You can drive any vehicle you see, pilot any ship, fly any plane (civilian or military), and steer any helicopter you can grapple onto. Guns range from simple pistos you can dual wield to sawed off shotguns and rocket launchers, machine guns and sniper rifles. The fighting is fun enough, i can spend tons of hours just killing off the military bases and achieving 100% of government property destroyed and upgrades collected. There are thousands of collectables than can improve your character, vehicles and weapons. What makes the game unbelievable is how beautiful the scenery is while youre zipping along with your unlimited parachutes as you grapple onto the ground or a passing car or a tree with your grappling hook (that has some serious range on it) to maintain your velocity. The map is huge, seriously huge, and it covers everything you would find on a modern island with resources and tourists. Deserts, mountains, swamps, villages, city capitals with lots of skyscrapers, plains, jungles, resorts, refineries, even a frozen lake at the top of a volcano's caldera. There is always something to find and each location is unique. I love this game so much that I purchase multiple copies to give away so that other people that have no idea what Just Cause 2 is like, can experience for themselves. Once you beat the game, get some of the DLC for even more fun. The DLC i use the most is the rockets that strap onto your parachute to help get you where you're going even faster, or to jet out of the line of fire and then climb a skycraper with ease.			"

A complaint I have is that there is not alot of weapons, just generic guns like sniper rifle and assault rifle.  There is plenty of vehicals in the game, also plenty of stuff to blow up and mess around with. Another problem is that the campain missions are all the same, but the side missions are all differenet and they help show you around the map.

												Now that I've finally gotten around to finishing the main quest of this game, I feel I have enough information to write a review. It is a phenomenal game.While the story is nothing to write home about and the controls can feel a bit wonky at times, the gratification that comes from grappling a jeep to the road and causing it to flip into the air or decimating harbors and army bases with a minigun are simply unmatched among games I've played. This game's main ""gimmick"" is your grappling hook that spits in the face of physics and basic logic. This 1 inch cord has enough power to hold a car to a helicopter without breaking and defies the concept of momentum, letting you jump off a skyscraper and grapple onto the road below without being harmed. The game also features a respectable arsenal of upgradable weapons and vehicles to terrorize the island nation of Panau with.There are few negatives that I can come up with for this game, but there are some minor issues:When you fall from a tall place, you transition into ""falling mode"" and controls shift accordingly. The distance it takes to transition seems inconsistent and can result in cheap damage.The DLC seems a bit overdone. I'm not a huge fan of DLC in the first place, and I bought the full version that includes the DLC, but I didn't feel like it added much to the game.The game is actually incomplete. The developers accidentally left out a few of the collectables, making it impossible to 100% the game ingame, you can still get all the Steam achievements though. I'm honestly puzzled as to why the devs haven't fixed this issue, since it should be a really easy fix.Lastly, and this may not be a bad thing for some people, Panau is big. Too big. Allow me to elaborate, I have played this game for 131 hours and I'm only about 75% of the way done. The conquering of towns and military bases is a blast at first and retains its enjoyability well, but I don't see myself 100%ing the game any time soon.Despite these complaints, I've gotten 131 hours of solid enjoyment out of this title and will definitely be playing it more. If this game looks like fun to you and you won't be too bothered by its problems, then this is easily worth its asking price.			"

												Just Cause 2 pumps you into action the moment the game starts and barely is there time to catch your breath as you go from one area to the next, one plane to the other, one seaboat to another and one parachute to the other. With new enemies, weapons, and vehicles, the game gives you an array of items at your disposal... yeah, well, good or no?The guns are pretty weak as the realism doesn't set in in this game at all, which is expected considering that's just how the game is meant to be, which is pretty great at times. The game does get repetitive somewhat quickly after about a day's worth of gaming. Only 'specialty' areas are unique, though not in large numbers. Enemies remain the same, without much difference in them and aren't memorable. Same characters as in Just Cause but with, of course, Baby Panay and his men and a few others. Vehicles are nice, nothing special (probably intentional), and easter eggs are plenty, though a rather obvious one is one a lot of people know about whether they've played the game or not or have seen what the egg is referencing.So, yeah, weapons are meh-y, vehicles uneventful, enemies boring, and locations repetitive.But does that make it a bad game? NOPE. It's fun, yes, but as the review states here and there, it does get repetitive, but the non-stop action and hilarious ways to kill enemies makes the game quite addictive. Overall, gameplay to 100% completion takes about... well, maybe 80 hours if you play it casually but non-stop probably less. Is it worth doing new games on it? Maybe more-so after a long time of not playing just to be nostalgic.What this game offers over other games of similar style is... well, the style. Infinite parachutes, grappling hook for every occasion, and a kickass Rico makes the game all the more fun. So go ahead and get it, it's fun and addictive but you shouldn't be expecting to want to play it every waking moment after the first few hours.7.5/10			"

												Just Cause 2 is awesome. It's chock-full of explosions, and its giant, open world is great for exploring or just screwing around. There are lots of vehicles you can hijack, missions you can complete, weapons you can acquire and upgrade, and stuff you can blow up. Plus, there is a free mod you can download so that you can play with friends. Overall, I highly recommend this game.			"

												Players have to complete a few short missions before accessing the entire open world.* Game is full of visual eye candy.

If you're an older hardcore gamer, remember KQP mod for Quake 1?* Dual wield weapons.* Excellent NPC interactions* Stunningly beautiful world with a lot of area to explore by foot, boot, car, truck, jetplane, helicopter.* MMO feature!

												1st...I cannot believe this game has been made in 2010-11, and why i never tried it since now...Welcome to Panau! One of the biggest south asian map, ever created for a game of this genre. You are Rico, i like to think he's a Saboteur, as you'll get contracts and missions of all kind to destabilized a whole system of corrupted government by undertaking tons of main and side missions.Guerillas, warfares, infiltration, extraction, black market weapons, vehicules, sabotage, and blowing up everything to gain alliances, or make new enemies will be your everyday life in Just Cause 2!Exploring this vast and huge world the way you want, gives this game a very deep immersion feeling.This is how you'll find new villages, cities and even military bases you'll have to control.To do so, you have a gazillion different horde of weapons, gadgets, and vehicules of all kinds.From sea gliders, to apache style helicopters, tanks and armored vehicules, you want it? you got it! How about modifiying your vehicules? you can! how about a flak gun on a Tuk Tuk? you can!How about controlling your own airport, having your very own private jet? YOU CAN!It's a 100% open sandbox world where you can do almost everything you want, the way you want, when you want.Think of it like if GTA would have been having babies with Battlefied.The vast majority of everything you'll see in this game is 100% destructible, so you can create havoc in villages, destabilize entire supplies of gas and water, expend your territories, you decide who you are working for, and keep what you've earned by helping guerillas groups, rebellions, or even the corrupted gorvernment itself in a ""Che Guevara"" mood-style storyline.The optimisation for most gaming rigs is also amazing, right now i'm running mostly everything on ultra, and on the benchmark, i get an amazing 120 FPS all the time. No matter what i do in game and the graphics are beautiful, and breathtaking, good job to Avalanche studios!This game has been made for players to enjoy themselves, and have fun!When you can jump from your helicopter, open your chute, casual fly to a nuclear plant, use C4, blow it up, then run away with one of their tank, fight your way through, then call your black market dealer on the spot, to order a boat to get away?....What more do you need?...This is honestly an amazing game in its genre!10 out of 10 for Just Cause 2!

												Average story, decent voice acting, repetitive and uninteresting missions and yet I can't not recommend this game.Why? Two words: Grappling hook.The fun in this game, primarily, comes from the grappling hook. The grappling hook allows you to quickly traverse terrain, hook on to a vehicle to then hijack it or even use it to tow a vehicle around. You can even jump from vehicle to vehicle and add parachutes to the combo so that you can either hook on to another vehicle or use the momentum from your grappling to parachute higher and further.The open world of this game is set in the fictional island paradise of Panau and a very large paradise at that. The graphics are quite impressive, particularly in the large mountainous areas or high above the world in an aircraft the view really is great. The range of vehicles is large from cars, motorcycles to various aircraft and boats; using these vehicles to explore the world and wreak havoc is incredibly satisfying.That brings me to my next point. The destruction. The explosions. The weaponry. Whether it be a handheld gun or one attached to a vehicle, you're going to be causing a lot of damage to Panau. Causing a lot of explosions is satisfying and (other than grappling hooks) is what this game is all about.I am yet to play the multiplayer mod that was recently released on Steam but multiplayer in a game such as this will only add to the fun and chaos.Just Cause 2 is a game that frequently goes on sale so it wont be hard to find it for a very reasonable price and it's a small fee for hours and hours of fun. Buy now and never regret it.			"

												Yes, the story is overly stupid. Yes, it can become repetive after some time. But oh god, it is so much fun. It is one of those games that you can just pop in for a few hours and kill some time and have fun - there is always another settlement to ""clear"" (meaning - collect all the collectibles and blow everything up), another race to win, another vehicle to drive.

Good fun.The gameplay becomes the same after a few hours and a little boring, and someone has actually made a Multiplayer mod, allowing 5000 players online all to run around and explore together and that for me kick starts the game back in.Graphics are decent and the gameplay is top fun for a few hours.

												Where should i start ? Hm, right - how could i miss on this title so long ...Can be compared to Mercenaries 2 World in Flames, GTA and other open world games.Controls are ok you want however adjust key settings, You will be able to hijack everything moving. The grapple is your signature tool of choice and you can do funny stuff with it. AI is a no brainer but clever enough to try to flank, at times very erratic, especially when you draw a lot ""Heat"". It does not dampen the fun.Just Cause 2 could be Skyrim for action fans. IF the community gets more tools for this game running including modelling, animation, campaign creation, character customization etc ( stores like in Saints Row would be great to change your outfit ) Has already community made multiplayer.However, crazy game to waste time in. Just enjoy the ride.Belongs into every game collection.You like open world games ? - well, what you waiting - get it. That simple.Rico is cool. Nothing can go wrong.			"

												Really good fun open world exploring game.The Sandbox type moments are top fun, using your crappling hook to attack to an explosive barrel, then attach to enemy and shoot barrel and watch it take off dragging the man.. Good fun.The gameplay becomes the same after a few hours and a little boring, and someone has actually made a Multiplayer mod, allowing 5000 players online all to run around and explore together and that for me kick starts the game back in.Graphics are decent and the gameplay is top fun for a few hours.  Currently on sale for £3 and worth every penny, (While writing this short review)Gameplay lasts a decent while before coming the same and booring.Worth a buy and play, top fun.			"

												This game is by far the most fun I have ever experienced with any game, ever. It's ostentatious and over-the-top story always gives you something interesting to do during main missions whilst side missions give you objectives to complete in any way you want with any equipment you want. Can't be bothered driving this car through enemy defenders, fine, just tether it to a heli and drop it at its check point. Honestly the times it gets boring are the ones that it tries to be a normal game. No matter what price I'll always suggest this game, but it gets really cheap on sale			"

												Just Cause 2 is a 3rd person shooter that looks and feels a lot like GTA and Saints Row. It's main trademark is the grappling hook, that can be used to pull yourself to objects far away or pull objects towards you.Pros:+ Vast environment with distances that feel realistic. Driving 10 kilometers feels like driving 10 kilometers in real life. Downside of this is that the world feels a little empty and repetative at times.+ All the major weapon classes are represented and you can upgrade your gear.+ Pretty good story. + Memorable character build and rich dialogues.+ The local propaganda radio reflects on your latest actions, trying to cover everything up.+ Playing a villain was served in a satisfactory, humorous manner, that suited the whole story.Cons:- Missions start to feel repetative very quickly, falling roughly into 3 categories:	1. Go kill everyone and blow everything up in a particular place.	2. Help some gangsters get to a fortified camp and protect them until they take it over.	3. Destroy something/someone in a limited timeframe.- A few bugs like falling through a bridge or not being able to get out of a turned over car.VerdictIt's not amongst my favorite games, far from it. Travelling the distances was a pain and the repetative missions got tiresome quickly. On the other hand, unleashing havok has a quality of it's own and the game surely has a ton of content to keep your hands tied for some 20+ hours.			"

												The Just Cause franchise was the reason for my entrance into the gaming world. When I first bought my Xbox 360, I saw that Just Cause 2 came with it; I was intrigued. So, little AraChN1DZzz Unsp0K3N decided to get that, and boy, did he love it to death! He spent over 2 years completing that game on every difficutly. Once he was done, he thought, ""Wow, I should get JC1!""But we will talk about JC1 in another review,  thank you summer sale. The actual game Just Cause 2 was a follow-up from the initial development of the character ""Rico Rodriguez"" from Just Cause 1, voice acting by  Robin Atkin Downes .  In fact, the two games have very similar endings. Baby Panay is supposed to be portrayed as some grotesque man who would kill his own father just to get the ""Presidential"" role of Panau (This isn't a spoiler, you are told this during the opening scene of JC2).  The graphics/physics In JC2, the graphics are a really big letdown. The scenery of the game is heavily painted, but that may be because of the huge map size, but if you are to compare the graphics to Battlefield, you will see that JC2 didn't really try hard enough in terms of the Graphical side of the battle. Also, you see that the creators basically copied and pasted the ""spinny trees"" and even buildings just to make the game look big, which really shouldn't be an option. However, I must say that looking out into the distance at some opposite islands really calms the feeling of the game. The physics of JC2 always keep you on the edge of your seat. The unrealistic yet amusing stunt jump always adds the feeling to the game that you are, in fact, playing a destructive game rather than one where you ""look...out into the distance"" and enjoy the view, you can do that when you complete the game, [reach 100% completion, impossible, right?] The grapple hook in JC2 was majorly upgraded from the usless grapple gun given to you in JC1, which is what the game is all about, the evolution of the grapple hook, as we see in JC3,  with the infinite tethering and the wingsuit.  The AI Being a very experienced player, I know what it is like to have  ♥♥♥♥♥♥  AI in a game, especially in JC2. At times, the AI is completely messed up - if you were to drive on the road in Panau City, the civillian AI would run away screaming ""Hey, he got a gun!"", which really doesn't make sense. Also, when I decide to inspect a Wilforce Trekstar [Panau Police] I see the passenger soldier standing up, waving his damn hands in the air like his favourite song has come on, on the propaganda news channel! One more criticism is that the usage of the military plane was never really implemented. I get Level 6 Heats, but only UH-33 Chippewas come, rather than a SI-47 Lepoard, which would really spice things up.To summarise, I would say that this game has its ups and downs. To be honest though, the map size was waaay out of its time, but that is what you can expect from pure perfection, except the copying and pasting. But really, this game is magnificent and if you can look past the Graphical exterior, then I know that you will have fun with this game.			"

												Outstanding game with decent graphics (for its age) and a stunning open world.The story is acceptable for a game focused on free roam gameplay, but not bothering to complete it won't really affect the rest of the game.The side missions' objectives can get quite repetitive but because of the nature of Just Cause 2, you can complete these missions with whichever vehicle or weapon you want.The game isn't too taxing on most systems of the last 7/8 years, a more recent machine should be able to max out all graphic settings.Highly recommended if you're into open world shooters or if your system isn't capable of playing Just Cause 3.

Перестрелки, погони, прыжки с парашютом, угон автомобилей и военной техники. Можно выполнить самые разные трюки, вплоть до захвата летящего вертолета. Мир в Just Cause 2 — просто огромен, достаточно густо усыпан разными деревеньками, городами, военными базами, а так же просто красивыми и интересными местами. Динамика игры напоминает чем-то стелс игру, очень хорошо сбалансированную с экшеном. Оценка: Отлично 9/10			"

This is one of the only games which you are completely free in. You can suicide bomb, grapplehook cars to roads and, of course, blow stuff up. The multiplayer mod which comes with the game, Is also amazing. I am glad that the guys who made the mod, made it. There is a wide range of guns featuring from pistols to crazy rocket launchers. There is also a wide range of vehicles, featuring from motorbikes to military rocket-launching bullet-shooting helicopters. Although there isn't quite alot of replayability, You cannot tell anyone it isn't fun grappling on to helicopters and blowing s#*t up. You'd be lying. This game also features a pretty awesome black market system where you get your guns, vehicles and you can catch a ride on a helicopter there too.			"

												A game that almost allows you to do whatever you want. It's got outlandish action sequences that you fully control, nothing scripted. You drive/hijack anything that moves and anything you see you can go there. The graphics are amazing for such a large seemless world. The story isn't the best at all, neither are the missions, but this sets a new precedence for sandbox games.

												Hands down the best open world game I've ever played. There's also a 3rd party multiplayer mod in development www.jc-mp.com......I'm a huge fan of open world games, from the original GTA way back in the 90's right up to it's latest incarnation GTAIV. I've also enjoyed Shenmue, Dragon Quest, Bully, Fallout, Farcry, Spiderman, Burnout, Arkham City..... any genre, any platform- it's easily my favourite type of gameworld. But the mechanics make a game and Just Cause 2 has the most fun mechanics I've ever played with. The possibilities are only limited to your imagination....... and skill.......Wanna steal a fighterjet? Cool, Rico can do that. Wanna fly that plane toward a bridge, jump on top and surf the jet under the bridge? Fine, Rico can do that. Wanna jump from a building flying through death defying gaps and before hitting the ground, release your parachute and walk away unharmed? Rico can do that one too. Really, once you get the hang of the controls the game comes to life in a way I've experienced in no other.......That would be my recommendation over if it wasn't for one final thing. Just Cause 2 Multiplayer. It's exactly what it sounds like and so much more. This is a mod that allows over 2000 players to join a single server, playing together on the same map. Nobody should allow themselves to ignore the fact that this really is a landmark in gaming. Never has a game of action orientated 3rd person shooting/jumping/driving been played on this scale. The closest would be something like GTAIV multiplayer on PC with up to 32 players. 2000+ Players is a whole new league above and beyond what I ever thought possible.

												A brilliant version of GTA, huge variaty of vehicles, ranging from air to sea to land. Really good and realistic graphics, best particle system I ever saw. Physics are appaling. Ragdolls are stiff, flop around when dead and fly back when shot by a machine gun. Vehicle wreckage is alright, but dissapears very quickly making it unrealistic. The police AI are more dumb than in GTA. They give up easily and send helicopters even to attack you when you hijack a jet fighter. The map is big, full of secret bases.Unlike other games, you have a parachute and grappling hook feature. If you're in a plane and you're high up you can jump out and skydive. And using the hook you can grapple onto different surfaces, enemies and vehicles.Brilliant game, good graphics, bad physics and a unique grappling hook feature9/10			"

												Just Cause 2 is a fun game to mess around in.JC2 was meant to be cheesy, with one-liners and plenty of explosions. Explosions, cars, guns, more explosions, cars, and guns. There are alot of explosions in this game. Another thing which makes this game is a multiplayer mod avaliable on Steam, for free. If you ever get bored of regular JC2 you could always go there. JC2 also has a good modding community, with a good number of mods to choose from and play around with. The game is in Third Person, although there are First Person mods out there.In general, I would recommend JC2 to anyone who likes to have fun in their games and not take anything too seriously. And also to anyone who likes guns, cars, and/or explosions. Because there are alot of explosions.			"

The way this game allows you to travel around it's giant map, makes you feel truly free. It also offers TONS of replayability.

If you are deciding to buy this game or GTA5, I will 100% reccomend you this game its cheaper and if you are looking to have a hallarious and fun time, pick this game up NOW! Its only 15 bucks(instead of 60 for GTA5) and it goes on sale all the time from 9.99 to 2.99.			"

The game is better than what the trailer looks like and if the discription gives you a serious thought for the game, it actually rediculusly hallarious. I have truley had more fun with this game than any of the Grand Theft Auto games and i deffinatly recomend this game to anyone as there is not any very violent scenes or anything that would put the game of anyhigher than PG-13. If you are deciding to buy this game or GTA5, I will 100% reccomend you this game its cheaper and if you are looking to have a hallarious and fun time, pick this game up NOW! Its only 15 bucks(instead of 60 for GTA5) and it goes on sale all the time from 9.99 to 2.99.			"

												Just Cause 2, from what I've played, is one of the best takes on the one-vs-many concept - put an entire island country in front of a near demigod of a man, and put the results into code. In essence, it is an action movie turned into a game, and in the best way I've seen in my years. Irreprievably overpowered gadgets, an open world large enough to keep you constantly on the run, driving vehicles, flying vehicles, standing on top of vehicles, standing on top of flying vehicles, and a goal at hand: to free the oppressed people of a small, fictional island from the tyranny of their dictator.Thinking about buying this game? Keep this in mind: You will never feel much satisfaction quite like leaping from an exploding building into a full-on skydive.Good luck, soldier.			"

												Awesome game, everything just seems spot on. I do hope JC3 can live up to JC2. The DLC doesn't do much to enhance your adventure but the vehicles may be fun for you, the cheap helicopter certainly was a 'go to' for me for a while when funds were low. I don't recall any flaws or bugs but the game has been out for a few years! I'd say it's definately worth picking up If you like the 3rd person perspective game genre, the gameplay is fun, the graphics still look good and the recent-ish multi player mod should add even more value.I think I paid €5 for it in a sale, in retrospect i'd be happy paying €15 (I am hard to please though).....go get it !

												Imagine if Michael Bay made a video game. That would be this game.To elaborate, this game tries way too hard to make you care about the story, but you really just want to watch the havoc evolve around you. This game is over the top. There's a tornado gun, a hovercraft, and did I mention that there are ♥♥♥♥ING EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE?!?! Does that make this game unplayable? No, not at all. Unlike a Michael Bay film, this game is very fun. The open world will consume hours of your life, the grappling hook is insanley fun to use, and the fact that just about everyone wants to kill you and/or can be killed makes this great for any lover of the GTA-style-kill-any-man-woman-or-creature-that-looks-at-you-funny method of gameplay style. So if you like over the top, open world, psychopath simulators; why are you still reading this? Go buy this game!			"

												Most of the time that I spent playing this game I was flying around with my parachute and driving cars of the bridge. The things that makes this game so awesome are the gigantic sandbox and the open world. Nothing is more relaxing then to hang and/or drive around in the map and blowing stuff up. You can just pull someone out of a car while you are going 120 km/h on the freeway, then fly away with your parachute and watch the car explode below you. I can't say much about the story because I only did about three missions. Don't regret a minute I played. EDIT: Now i successfully finished the story and multiple side missions, I can say that there actually is a pretty good story, what I did not expect. The main story is perfectly balanced with the time you spend creating chaos in throughout the map. This is due to the fact that you must create a certain amount of chaos before you can start playing the next mission. This way you will never start a mission when your weapons are not yet upgraded to the level that is required.8,5/10			"

												The game is short if you make it short. Sadly, I did this, but I still love it to death.Throughout the game, you're pretty freaking overpowered, but you're still weak enough at the beginning for you to feel that growing power as you progress. You cause chaos in Panau Just Cause you can. The government is a corrupt totalitarian superpower that needs to be stopped, and you do that in the most fun way possible. You assassinate colonels, blow ♥♥♥♥ up, and in general cause total societal collapse.The fun is just so much more with the number of vehicles you can drive, including many different airplanes and helicopters. The Black Market is your way of buying weapons and vehicles or hitching a ride across the MASSIVE game-world you're playing in. You can explore this freaking huge world if you'd like, but not all of it is all that interesting, even if it's all beautiful.This game is definitely worth the money.			"

												Just Cause 2, from what I've played, is one of the best takes on the one-vs-many concept - put an entire island country in front of a near demigod of a man, and put the results into code. In essence, it is an action movie turned into a game, and in the best way I've seen in my years. Irreprievably overpowered gadgets, an open world large enough to keep you constantly on the run, driving vehicles, flying vehicles, standing on top of vehicles, standing on top of flying vehicles, and a goal at hand: to free the oppressed people of a small, fictional island from the tyranny of their dictator.Thinking about buying this game? Keep this in mind: You will never feel much satisfaction quite like leaping from an exploding building into a full-on skydive.Good luck, soldier.			"

												So I bought this game not really knowing what to expect. When it just came out, someone said it was awesome. And I gotta say, I am not dissapointed.The game lacks realism on certain parts of the game, for example the grappling and the infinite parachutes. It is those things that makes the game awesome. It is a bit hard to get used to in the beginning of the game, but once you are used to it, you are glad you have it.This game as a third person shooter is also a succes. Again, a bit difficult to get used to the dualwielding/single wielding hotkeys. The dual wielding is awesome in the middle of fights, because if you use it correctly, you don't run out of ammo most of the time. No game is perfect, neither is this game. The stronghold takeovers are pretty repetitive, there aren't many of them, but all of them are the same: same goals, same order of objectives. The only difference is the difficulty.The missions are mostly unique. I really enjoyed most of them. Some of them take a long time because it is a long mission or because some of them are kinda difficult. The shorter ones are usually pretty easy: Go there, do this and you are done. But there is a nice variety of missions.Overall, if you like third person shooters and or weird games, then I strongly recommend this game. I haven't play multiplayer yet, so I don't know how good that is.			"

												Well, at first, I didn't want to get it because I use a lap-top. But I still wanted it. So, as it was on sale the other day (75% off), I got it, and it runs fine (maybe a bit of lag here and there). :D So I think you should go and get when ever you can. One of the best sandbox games ever! xD			"

												Drove off a mountain to get to a high value target in a motorcycle. Jumped off used my parachute grapled onto the limmo he was in. Was at highspeeds while doing this. Then i try to aim at the motorcycle raming the front of my car. Press the worng button and i get into the motorcycle. Turn exactly 2 degress to the left and get my whole body parts splattered infront of a limo in slow-mo.....10/10			"

												JUST CAUSE 2Pembenahan grafik dari versi just cause sebelumnya, dmn di just cause 2 ini tekstur betul"" diutamakan,, awan di langit pun tampak mengagumkan,, dengan konsep sama yang bergenre free room ,, just cause 2 mampu menarik lebih banyak peminat dari versi sebelumnya,GameplayTidak jauh berbeda, tapi di jc 2 ini ditambah sedikit gerakan"" yang mungkin tidak ada di jc yang pertamaSound Boleh dibilang bagus,, karna dari semua suara , baik itu suara kendaraan , langkah kaki , ataupun senjata sangat terdengar jelasGrafik :Seperti yang saya bilang,di Just Cause 2 ini tekstur sangat diutamakan,, bahkan sangat terlihat tajam			"

												Be honest here, have you ever wanted to shoot an asian person? What about shooting an asian person while riding a motorcycle? What about shooting an asian person while jumping off that motorcycle and then shooting a grappling hook onto an in-motion helicopter and then ziplining into that helicopter where you can shoot missiles at asian people? If you answered yes to any of these questions, 'nam is over, you can come home now, grandpa.			"
