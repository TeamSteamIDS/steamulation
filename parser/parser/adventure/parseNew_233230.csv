												There are many, many able reviews of this game so I'll just add some short remarks. I find Kairo haunting and beautiful. Every time I reach the final goal, and the credits roll, and the music plays I think of creator Richard Perrin and his father — and the loss of my own — but it’s hopeful and optimistic. Still the entire experience exhibits a sense of loss and recapitulates same. For me the game is an expression that I enjoy somewhat plaintively in its context. I play it often enough at my three-year-old's insistent request. He has none of this context! But he still wants to come back again and again. He finds it mesmerizing as he instructs me where to go and what to inspect next — the first time, his eyes wide in amazement. I think at his age he's captivated by the geometry and the color (children's entertainment is generally far from this). “Go see where the blocks are painted!”, “Go to the black moon!”, “Go in the elevator!”, “Show me the dinosaur!”, “Fly into the sky!” He’s still surprised when the environment springs to life. I’m surprised to see we’ve wandered around Kairo for over 150 hours in the last year or so. In short, a moving experience for a parent, and a curious adventure for a child. Play it together. Appreciate the time you have together.So really, this is a thank you note. Thank you, Richard Perrin and the rest that made Kairo possible.			"

												I'm not a huge fan of Kairo. It's a puzzle game, but you never get those satisfying ""ah-ha!""moments from a puzzle successfully solved. The puzzles are often frustrating, esoteric and are rarely particularly logical. There's thankfully a built-in hint system, but that doesn't really make it any more satisfying. You end up with a more ""Oh, that's what they wanted me to do? Huh, okay."" than anything. The (very) minimal graphics, sound and story don't do much to entice you to slog through the rest of the game.If you want a surreal, minimalist walking simulator, NaissencE is a much better game. If you want surreal first-person puzzling in a clean white-washed environment, go for Antichamber or even something like QUBE. I enjoy surreal/minimalist walking simulators and first-person puzzlers, but this game just doesn't do it for me.			"

												Kairo is a game of exploration in a strange and unsettling world, one built of geometric structures in a stark monochromatic setting. Alien-looking monoliths loom out of the colour haze, blocks shift as you move, it's unnerving and there's an overwhelming feeling of being watched and isolated at the same time. The soundscape is dominated by an unearthly ambient score, with various musical notes and effects cues when appropriate; it generates a lonely atmosphere, and Kairo never forgets that you're there to experience its world. There are three main hub areas, each containing a handful of modest puzzles, and there are several secrets and hidden glyphs to find. It shouldn't take you longer than 5 hours to finish the three main hubs, but it's worth every minute that you spend in its unique world.			"

												I am alone.As with most places in this desolate world I find myself in, the room is almost entirely monochromatic. Green, but not a green like living plants, but a green like something sickly and dying. Rotten. Slimy. It is a long corridor, and unlike the other places I have visited, it is somewhat claustrophobic. Large caskets line the sides of the corridor, and as I walk slowly along, looking for something I am expected to do, I stop and investigate one.There is a monitor on each casket. Some are broken, some flicker with static, but this one shows an image, though of what, I cannot see. I stand there for awhile, longer maybe than I should, waiting for something to appear on that monitor, but if the image changes, it is perhaps only my imagination. Or my reflection.Kairo is a strange, ominous world. There are great monoliths to explore, machines that reach up to the heavens, and cramped corridors to wander through. Some rooms have puzzles, some are just desolate walkways, hanging out over an abyss.I feel I am in purgatory. The very first action this game asks you to take is a leap of faith. This is what the game expects of you- perhaps not to understand, but to experience.Visually, this game is a treat of abstract, bold art. Simple, yes, but the limited pallette serves to build the abandoned atmosphere of the game, and Kairo is more than capable of providing small details mixed in amongst the enormous structures. The appearance of the game almost looks somewhat grainy, like an old photograph. The sound is just the howl of empty wind in enormous rooms. Rocks grind and scrape over surfaces as you move puzzles into place. There is some music, but it did not stand out to me in comparison to the rooms that whistle with loneliness. Kairo is, for the most part, a puzzle game. You manipulate these great structures, these old, broken runes, to find your way through. Some of the puzzles are simple, some of them seem to make little sense, requiring simple trial and error. Kairo does provide 'hints' for each level, but they are otiose at best, perhaps deliberately. Still, there is a sense of accomplishment at defeating these particular puzzles, and a continual drive to see what might be next keeps you going.Do I understand what is going on? I feel I do. But at the same time, I feel that there are many right answers.So, come. Walk with me for awhile.			"

												Kairo is a first-person puzzle game set in a minimalistic universe. The player journeys through the ruins of a civilization long departed, discovering artifacts and clues about the disappearance of its inhabitants along the way.The puzzles in the game are not groundbreaking, but they are still enjoyable and somewhat challenging.

The 3D world of Kairo is made up of very basic geometrical shapes, usually being combined to almost give the appearance of a more complex structure.The grittiness, sparseness and colors pervading each room is part of what I think, creates the game's strongest characteristic: its ambiance.

The soundtrack can be eerie, futuristic, ethereal and unnerving and serves to both enhance the impact of the visuals as well as shape the emotional experience of the player.I found myself enjoying the atmosphere more and caring less about the former inhabitants of the world and the overall message the game conveys. In overall, for a small, adventurous indie title like this, Kairo is still an experience worth having for fans of this sort of game. 7/10			"

												Well this definitely is a strange one.To those that message me every time I write a recommendation saying “you write long recommendations” … THIS is going to be a long one.I have a thing for first person puzzle games at the moment, and I was rather intrigued by this games trailer and description. I think what interested me most, was the sense of ‘mystery’ that I got from the trailer. It doesn’t tell you what it is about, or why you are there or what’s going on… and to be honest this game has a real mysterious feel to it throughout the whole thing, you’re asking yourself questions on the who, what and whys but in fairness they aren’t answered all that clearly. And that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I think games that are open to interpretation are great in their own way. The whole mystery and wonder to this game is great and all, but the structure and direction can sometimes make you just feel lost. At least for me anyways, that’s just my opinion of course, but there was a few times during the play through that I just asked, what the hell am I supposed to be doing here…The puzzles themselves are very interesting, they are creative, they really make you think and make you put things together in ways that I’m not really used to. They are unique kinds of puzzles and there is a lot of symbols and shapes and colours that you have to try and think about what they might mean and what the logic behind the puzzle might be.The music in the game is very moody, it really brings out that feel of the game. Which for me was quite cold, and dull. There isn’t really a whole lot of “bright” warm colours in the game, there is still colour, but it feels dulled down. There’s also a lot of white in the game, which some people may think ‘pfft well that’s “bright”’ but to me it’s an empty kind of white. The whole game is set in ancient looking dull buildings with strange structures and dull empty colours. You’re on your own with no one around and no one to comfort you but these strange surroundings and sounds and noises that give it a little bit of a creepy twitch to it.Personally, I liked this game. It definitely wasn't one of those games that I couldn't put down until I had finished it 100% full on in one sitting, but it was something I kept coming back to every now and then, taking breaks, until I finally completed it. It took me 15 or so hours to complete it spread over the course of two weeks or so, at times I just wanted it done because getting stuck is a real pain in this game and I felt pretty clueless. I even admit that at a few points I needed help to get past certain obstacles, but all in all I think this was a good game. I enjoyed it, it’s unique and interesting and you can tell the creator is really quite creative.If you enjoy first person puzzle games, I would say it is something that should at least be tried. I can see how it might not be some people’s cup of tea, but I think it’s worth the experience.TL;DR : It's weird, buy it. Creative puzzles, eerie music and generally unique.			"

												Kairo is one of thise gems amongst the steam garbage I seem to keep running into. After playing antichamber, I absoultely had to play Kairo.Kairo is a game in which you appear to be embarking into the depths of an ancient egypt-like machine that either uses magic or technology too far beyond you to understand. Either way, Kairo is one of those games that doesn't explain anything to you (though you have the option of hints, which don't help much) so it requires a lot of problem solving and logistics on your part. Most of the puzzles are self-explanitory, and the ones that aren't normally are supplied with a stone or wall you have to look at. Once you find those, you then proceed to facepalm realizing how simple the complex-looking puzzle really is.  Even so, the puzzles really are challanging, to the point where I actually had to look up a walkthrough for one of them because it didn't seem to be based on any rhyme or reason (and that I couldn't find any stones or walls to explain it) I'm sure you'll identify the one I'm talking about if you play this game.The story is widely open to interpretation though. There were points in the story that sent a legit chill down my spine. Other moments had me scratching my head wondering what just happened. In order to understand it, you're required to fill in a lot of blanks.Overall, despite it's cheap graphics and oddly slippery controls, Kairo is a game that you'll enjoy figuring out for yourself, and then be proud to finish.

												Kairo is a first-person 3D exploration and puzzle game—something I’ve been wanting more of since beating Antichamber.  It drew my interest because people have been mentioning it in the same breath as Myst; unfortunately, it doesn't hold a candle to any entry in the Myst series.  The game feels like a 15-year-old tech demo meant to show off early 3D environments more than anything.  Movement is floaty and inaccurate, story is subtle and there is no meaningful interaction with puzzles or objects: only walk, run and jump.  It's really a shame because the atmosphere is appropriately dark and mysterious.  I finished Kairo in one sitting and it is completely forgettable.			"

												I wouldn't call it exactly a game. Yet it's not just a 3d-puzzle. It's more like a piece of meditative experience offered to a player. Strongly reminds me of some other studios' works which seem to be half-games and half-art objects: Tale of Tales and their Fatale, Ice-Pick Lodge and their Tension, and so on. Some could find Kairo's atmosphere uncomfortable or even creepy, but for me it worked quite alright. The sound suits really well to grim and lonely landscapes. The puzzles aren't too... puzzling, but are sometimes really fun to solve. Secret rooms and hidden bonuses included.			"

												Kairo is a damn fun game. I kind of want to put it somewhere between Gone Home and Myst, except it straight up has no narration (or even WORDS) in it at any point, leaving you to interpret what you find for yourself. The puzzles are never ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the world is the most alien thing you'll find this side of Second Life (minus the ♥♥♥♥♥♥), and the sound design's fantastic. I loved this game. Highly recommend, especially because $5. Seriously. Buy this.			"

												Kairo is an abstract first person puzzle/exploration game where you work your way through a geometric world to complete what are initially seemingly arbitrary tasks to accomplish a goal which is not immediately apparent. It is obtuse, but stylistically so, and easy to get lost in. I recommend walking around and exploring before diving in too deep, but when stuck in any given room, you can go into the menu and choose up to three Hints to help point you in the right direction - this is the saving grace of the game, as they progressively give more direction without telling you what exactly to do, so you're never actually LOST, it can just feel like it at times.The controls are a little ""floaty"" - they don't feel as tight as most other first person games, but due to a lack of combat that's not necessarily a problem, just takes some getting used to. The graphics are simple, but very effective - the spectacle is quite impressive. In addition to the normal gameplay goals, there are a series of 18 runes to find hidden about the game, one ""go back and find later"" puzzle where, after you exit an area, something secret opens up which you can find, and three exceptionally hard ""did you notice that one little thing elsewhere? Interpret it in this abstract way here!"" puzzles which you might need to look for external guides for.The game doesn't take too long (aside from those harder puzzles) - 3-4 hours should probably be enough to get through it.I had a good time with it. It's probably not up everyone's alley, but if the above sounds interesting, check it out.			"

												Kairo is an experience game, likely to be lumbered in the Dear Esther, Gone Home, etc crowd, but despite this it's a really unique experience, and one definitely not to pass up. It's ethereal, ambient, and deserted, yet unnerving and alien. A good late night game lasting a few hours. There are puzzles each step of the exploration, and you can just do these and get the impression you're contributing to a much larger puzzle you eventually solve, or you can read into things much further. You're not given too much to go on, but you can surmise a few things. I completed it and then read a guide that showed how to solve the three non-essential puzzles which give strong indications of a deeper underlying narrative. These puzzles are a huge qualitative step up in difficulty. The main puzzles are fairly straightforward enough to not even need the hint system, but these are fiendish and involve getting hints from places well outside of the puzzle rooms and even needing the assistance of other Kairo players. I wasn't prepared to spend the time I'd spent doing the main game just hunting for ways to get these last bits, so I used a guide. If you don't have time either, I really recommend doing the same to get these last titbits as they firmly solidify hints you may have picked up throughout the main journey as to the meaning and purpose of Kairo, which is a really excellent thing. A good interpretation is here, which the creator has said is 'about 80% correct', but beware huge spoilers! Come back to this when you're done! http://www.electrondance.com/the-secret-of-kairo/ "

												You have to go into this with a certain mindset. This is more Tarkovsky's Solaris than Soderbergh's. Put aside an evening, make a hot cup of tea, put on some headphones, sit back and relax. Enter this experience not expecting a narrative to hold your hand through it; like a comfy blanket, take your time, squirm into it. Don't feel bad about looking up the answers to the puzzles, if you need to; they're not the point. Appreciate the scale and breadth of the architecture, that's the point.As the experience progresses, let the sense of dread settle in, as the isolation and starkness wash over you. If you take it that way, you will love it.			"

												This is one of those puzzle games that is very difficult. It's llike taking a pretzel, placing it in a room with two torches and asking someone to figure out the puzzle. The puzzles in this game tend to range from ""Oh wow, the answer is simple"" to ""how does this even result in THAT kind of answer?!""The graphics remind me a lot of older Playstation games which is alright in this case. This isn't meant to be a masterpiece, it's more of an art style game, it takes a good eye to enjoy this and the puzzles that lie inside. As for those little out of spot marks you see here and there in each part of the game, let's just say it results in getting the best ending ever (coffee is great indeed).The sounds are something else and just sound so lively in a place that is almost entirely desolate. Find a certain thing or two in the game can be equally heartbreaking and allows you to come to your own conclusion on what you think led to the events in this game.9.5/10 Would recommend to friends. The achievments are a bit difficult but fun to get. :)			"

												The anatomy of a good puzzle can be a difficult thing to understand, and an even harder thing to manufacture. It can't be so easy that it feels like a pointless exercise used to fill otherwise empty space, but not so hard that it feels like it's actively fighting against you to get in your way and prevent you from moving forward. It should give you all the pieces of information you need in such a way that will allow you to naturally make the connection and reach its conclusion under your own enterprise. Ideally it will also have a specific purpose and serve a function within the game's world, if not its story. But most importantly, it has to be fun, to reward the player with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment once they do put all the pieces together in their head and turn a creative thought into glorious action. Sadly, Kairo fails on most of these counts, and by some margin.I'm a big fan of the first-person, puzzle exploration genre, so when I saw this being mentioned in the same breathe as games like Antichamber and The Stanley Parable, and especially seeing the art style in pictures and videos, I couldn't get my hands on it fast enough. Unfortunately, it probably has about as much in common with those games as Gran Turismo has with Mario Kart. Initial impressions were really good. You start off at the foot of a throne on a small slab of land seemingly floating in an endless, white void, the only other feature being a large, blocky structure floating a brief distance ahead of you. Some steps invite you down into the white where you find you can freely walk among the nothingness and make your way over to the other structure. So far, so good. It's set the tone with something unique and mind-bending. Everyone loves a good mystery, so already you're compelled to venture further and find out what this strange place is and discover your role among it all... Several hours later, after having unlocked and completed everything, I still feel none-the-wiser about any of it.Having tried to read up on it on discussion boards and such, the prevailing theory seems to be something about mass  interstellar relocation and your janitor-like role of reawakening a ship on its approach to its new home and the hope of a new chance and fresh start for a dying species - possibly ancient aliens, possibly future humanity... the jury's still out on that one. But to be completely honest, the whole thing feels like pretentious art w*nk of the highest order either way. It smacks of The Emperor's New Clothes to some degree and like there's so much vagueness to everything that anyone can project their own meaning to whatever they like and make it infinitely more profound than it would be were it merely explained to us in any degree of detail. If you have a worthy story then tell it! Let it be known and understood so people can enjoy it and share it. Don't hide it behind walls of damn near impenetrable symbolism and open-ended hints. Rather than coming across as mysterious it just ends up feeling like it lacks any real substance, and were it not for reading all the wild conspiracies, any faint trace of a story would have been completely lost on me as a result.What I did get was a series of unengaging puzzles in an array of strange environments where nothing seemed to make sense or have any reason. Some are simple switch-based affairs, others are more demanding and require some considered observation and noting, and none of them hit that sweet Goldilocks spot of being not too easy or not too hard. In fact, despite the generous, optional hint system, as time went on I found myself increasingly resenting their very existence in the game as they only seemed to hinder any sense of enjoyment or wonder at the spectacle of my surroundings. That's probably the one thing this does get right, as the stark, minimalist use of bold colour mixed with the challenging geometry of the architecture makes for a real marvel of design. But when that's the only real strength, it ultimately makes this feel like an interactive art installation more than a bona fide game.So that's all you're really left with. When all you can do is walk, run and jump, with no actual option to manually interact with anything or make use of an inventory or even pick up any items, you just end up roaming around stepping on pressure pads or passing through beams of light until you're told you've completed the puzzle them move on to the next one. The game makes for some pretty pictures, but beyond that there's really nothing else I can recommend about it. In fact, while Steam tells me I spent 5 hours with this, it honestly felt like more than twice that, and I'm pretty sure that even counts all the Alt Tabbing I did as I needed to get away from the game's puzzles for a while. Whenever I was playing it I was thinking about other games I'd rather be experiencing instead, and when I wasn't playing it I dreaded the prospect of booting it up, eventually completing it only to get it over with so I'd never have to touch it or think about it again.The only reason to have any interest in this game would be to go to its Store page, to scroll down, then to click on the list of similar (and no doubt far better) games in its genre then investigate those instead. Otherwise everything feels too much like art for art's sake and lacking in every other area. In short, avoid.			"

												I have enjoyed every moment with this game. I haven't quite finished it yet, but I'm confident in recommending it. To be clear, if you're looking for a fast-paced game with all the latest bells and whistles, this is not the one for you. The graphics and music are quite simple, and gameplay is as slow-paced as you'd like it to be. However, I disagree with those who call this a ""walking simulator."" It is very much a game. There are puzzles to solve as well as a story to uncover.The puzzles are very well-designed. There is no dialogue and no text, yet somehow it's always clear what you're expected to do. Some of the puzzles are quite simple, while others are much more complex, but I haven't found a single one I couldn't solve with a little patience and logical thought. It's not too easy, but it's not too difficult, either. There was only one puzzle I needed hints for - and those hints are provided in the game menu. There are three hints for each puzzle, starting out vague and growing more specific, so you can get exactly the amount of help you need if you ever get stuck.The story is revealed entirely through gameplay. When I first started playing, I didn't expect there to be much of a story. I was satisfied with the beautiful abandoned abstract architecture and puzzles. The first time I uncovered an unexpected plot twist, my heart skipped a beat, and every one I've found after that has led to even more amazed moments. I'm very picky about storytelling, and this is one game that does it perfectly without ever resorting to dialogue or verbal exposition.Overall, it's a well-crafted game. Everything in it functions well and it all comes together to form a beautiful whole. It's not for everyone, but I think most people will find it enjoyable and well worth buying.			"

												I picked up this game on a whim when it went on sale some time ago, and while it's not very long (I completed it in three hours) it's unique enough to where I consider it merits a review of its own. First off, let me nerd out at how good the ambiance is for a couple of paragraphs. The visuals are given sense by an excellent sound design, which kept me on edge for the duration of my playthrough; an achievement, considering the fundamentally abstract and calming nature of the setting. I didn't ever not feel like I was in an old, abandoned, alien place which might fall apart at any second, except when I finished the puzzle in the area and the whole place lighted up and started functioning again, but even then, the sense of foreboding was ever-present. Wide open areas get floaty synths that lurk just outside your hearing, punctuated by the slight  pat pat pat  of the character's walking, and inside areas each have a soundtrack that fits in well with what's around you. Going in blind, I half-expected the game to throw in some jumpscares at me at some point or another, but the actual gameplay was very deliberate and focused around the ""narrative"". The game also shines in its visuals. You might be thinking, ""Well, yeah, the game markets itself as a puzzle/exploration game, it's bound to have some nice environments"", but some areas are unique enough to actually merit a ""Holly♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is amazing"". This makes the actual gameplay suffer at times, though, as you're made to slowly walk up and down a ramp to press at buttons to try to figure the room's huge puzzle in an epic journey that was evidently designed to show off every possible angle of the room with no regards to how long it might take to get from one place to another.The actual puzzles themselves, the main focus of the game, is where it's a bit lacking. For all the praise I might sing of its visuals and environments, it's a bit hard to justify some of the choices regarding their design. I found myself having to constantly check at the in-game hints and a guide I kept handy to figure out the worst of them. There's a special variety that I particularly loathed, which are the kind of puzzle that required you to move against a timer over pressure pads on the floor in a particular pattern, which was made very infuriating with the character's tendency to slide around as if the floor was iced over. I'd say this is the area of the game where it's at its weakest.I mentioned the game's narrative with quotation marks earlier on in this review, and that is because it's entirely possible to ignore it and never know anything about it, as it's never actually presented to you. It's just ""there"", and it doesn't care if you pick up on it or not. It's perfectly fine with sitting alone above the dusty door-frame of the room you just dismissed as pure eye candy and never having anything to do with you. It's not terribly complicated or unique, but it gives a sense to your running around, so I do recommend you take the time to trying to figure it out. Should you buy this game? If you can overlook that it's quite average as puzzle games go, and instead want to be awed by the amazing environments and architecture that it provides, sure, go for it. If not, you'll probably be wasting your money. I should also mention that it runs excellently in lower-end computers. So there's that.			"

												Kairo is... odd. Everything about this game seems like it's working towards something genuinely fun and interesting but it never came together for me.  The puzzles are a little too abstract (any puzzle where figuring out the goal of the puzzle is the actual puzzle isn't a great puzzle, and there are plenty of those), the graphics are almost cool but are a little too simple to hold my attention, and while the minimalistic soundtrack works for the game, it's by no means a draw to it.  Maybe if you have an Oculus or something this game is for you, but on just a plain old 2D monitor, I'm not really feeling it.			"

												What is Kairo? A mystery? A haven? A weapon? Drawn to a truly awing series of subdimensional rooms set throughout different sacred ruined structures and glimpsing dozens of different ages and stages of Earthen architecture, you must discover the truth that lies within. Only by reactivating each mechanism and bringing life back to these ruins will you find the answers you seek. What is Kairo? Is it a beginning? Is it an end? Each room is its own purpose, its own meaning, its own separate, desperate secret. The shattered memories of a whole culture, a vast race locked with each carved rock and echoed through each signal that reaches up from the deepest void. Kairo has a calling, Kairo has a need. Bring Kairo back to the light, clear the dust off this great ancient machine, and resuscitate this sleeping monolith. What is Kairo? The past? The present? The future? Kairo is life. Kairo is death. Kairo is rebirth. Yet, most of all, Kairo...is waiting.			"

												Okay, normally I'm a fan of these games that lean more towards ""art"" than ""entertainment"". However, if you take away some neat film grain, you don't have much left. The world was constructed sloppily, and although the lack of engineering *sometimes* gives a sort of eerie feeling, it wasn't up to par. The puzzles lacked interesting mechanics and were not at all fun to solve, and the story (from what I played) was also pretty weak and virtually nonexistent.I feel like not a lot of work was put into this game, and do not recommend that you buy it.

												This was an interesting game. I got this one in a bundle at some point and decided to play it today. I will say this...the game is incredibly difficult. There is a good chance you will wander without any idea what the hell you are doing and may quit as a result. That is actually a knock on this game. There is no such thing as obvious, with a couple exceptions. The game doesn't teach you anything really, and you are left to your own devices to sort out what you are supposed to do and the proper order in which to do so.So....use a guide. This is one game where a guide is almost a necessity. You may be the sort of person who can figure out a game like this, but most people who play this wont finish it without the help of a guide. However, if you do, it doesn't detract from the experience at all, and the experience is really what this game is all about. For all that puzzles are the biggest challenge in this game, the sense of exploration and the different scenery is what makes this game stand out. I didnt get the sense of an overall story except:SPOILERSThat this is maybe a galactic museum of sorts, or a museum at the end of the world, or something like that, and the last curator died, after which it fell into disrepair. You are basically fixing it and getting it up and running again.SPOILER ENDSo, points off for not being very accessible at all, but points in its favor for being pretty unique and uniquely challenging. Pus, that secret ending was pretty funny when taking the rest of the game into consideration.All in all, a 3 out of 10 for lack of accessibility and the (IMO) necessity of using a guide, but 8 out of 10 for everything else. Try it out. See what you think of it. I think it is a relevant game that will capture your imagination.			"

												I have played this game twice now and I can safely say that I have absolutely no idea what happens in it or what it all means. I recommend it, but cannot point to any good reason why I should. It's strange, it's bizarre, and the entire experience is essentially ""what kind of video game would I make if I were only allowed to code while blazed?"" I'm relatively certain that the game is an exploration of the remains of a community on another world, but it definitely plays a lot better as an exercise in navigating someone's LSD-riddled subconscious. Because, as far as I can tell half of the time you stare at the screen going ""What."", there is actually no right answer. You progress by completing a number of puzzles and some of those can be tricky because there are times that it isn't immediately obvious that what you are looking at even is a puzzle, let alone what it expects you to do. You can ask the computer to give you up to three hints with various degrees of obviousness in order to solve the puzzles; however, in a number of rooms after spending ten minutes going ""what in the world am I doing"" or ""this is impossible"", you can press the hint buttons which will tell you ""actually, this room does nothing at all and you're just wasting your time"".So, after a while, I don't know, you can just relax and slip into ""ah, yes, another screwy thing in this dude's crumbling mind, of course it doesn't make sense, of course I have no idea what's going on"". This game is a mental prison and you have to escape the prison. If you want 2-4 hours of going ""wtf is this - wtf is that"" then it's for you, but don't expect much.			"

												If you have any kind of appreciation for grand, surrealist landscapes, Kairo will hit the right notes for you. Cubist swamps, gravity-defying mechanisms, distant stone cities, and forests of infinite pillars await. Fog and limited draw distance are used to great effect here, shrouding impossibly huge structures from you until you move close enough for them to emerge from the murk. The environments are colorful and unique and seem to tell a story by their very nature. There's no text or dialogue in Kairo, but it has hints of the Dark Souls storytelling-without-telling motif.Gameplay is about as simple as it gets. You walk, you run, you jump. There's no key for using, holding, or interacting here. Everything you need to fiddle with is done by proximity. This often manifests as pressure plates or stones to push, but there are more creative applications like devices that only activate when you stand in a certain orientation with them. The puzzles get hard too, so be prepared for some serious experimenting and creativity to work out how some of them function. There are some secrets to find as well, which require combing every nook and cranny of the dreamlike architecture... which is something you'll want to do anyway.The big knock I have against Kairo is that, as well-done as the atmosphere and design is, it still looks like a Half-Life 1 mod. All the shapes lack detail and there are only a few basic textures used throughout. However, the game makes the most of its minimalist presentation, and in the end it could be seen as more of an asset than a drawback if you can immerse yourself in it. Overall, this is a great game for the look and feel it conveys, and it's usually so cheap that there's no reason not to pick it up.			"

												For a game that tosses you into a world without an instruction manual, I found it pleasant to play. I feared I would be frustrated beyond hope since I'm pretty poor at puzzle games, but the atmosphere I saw in video reviews convinced me to try it anyways. Answers to the puzzles just come to you as you take in the scenery. A lot of other puzzle games would be easier if I had a decent memory and some conventional wisdom. I just fumble through most of it, therefore this game doesn't have this requirement to enjoy.			"

												Kairo is a game that, in my opinion, does everything it sets out to do right. It begins with some incredible ambient and atmospheric music which suggests a vast expanse of void filled with unidentifiable abstract buildings, shapes, devices, and questions. Kairo then fills that space with those exact objects and questions and asks the player to proceed with very little guidance or suggestion. I truly love when a designer gives their players an open world to explore with a suggested, yet vague, goal and then allows the player to explore that world in their own way in order to pursue that goal. Kairo, in its most simple description, is a first-person, exploration, puzzle-platformer. Kairo, in a bit more detailed examination, is an ambient exploration of an alien landscape, filled with color and sound in which the player can lose themselves within the interaction, and wonder that the game offers. It's hard to detail exactly why I appreciate Kairo so much; it may be the unreal atmosphere and beautiful soundtrack, the open world exploration, the lack of handrails and guidance, the somewhat creepy atmosphere, the lush color and abstract landscapes, but I suspect that it's all of those things working in unison to create a wonderful and unique experience. Highest recommendations for those who enjoy first-person exploration games and puzzles.			"

												I played lots of puzzles and walking simulators, and this one differs from the others for having a good variety of simple challenges in an atmospheric desert world mostly made of stone with some hidden and strange stuff along the way.the idea is good and the visual is pretty well done. The only flaw of Kairo's devs is the lack meaning in the game progress. There's no concrete story (at least untill the part of the game i'm in), only randon pictures in some places and visions that only appear if you solve optional puzzles that won't explain much. But I recommend this game if you like the genre and if it's on sale, of course.PS: This game is definitely an Illuminati admission test, I can feel it!			"

												Warning: Can cause motion sickness.  Can not even imagine playing this with Oculus Rift, considering how motion sick I got playing on a console in ten to fifteen minutes segments.Interesting concept.  Abandoned? quantum distorted world of unknown purpose and design.  As the player traverses through this alien world? they complete tasks to restart machinations in three locations: the ""lighthouse/power"" room, the ""engine"" room, and the ""control"" room.  Why? and for what purpose? is left for the player to decide but the end shows the revilitalization of the planet Earth.  Many questions are left open, most starting with W, as in What happened? Why? When? Where is kairo? What is kairo? But the most intriguing question I find is Who is the player really?  An unknown entity? A survivor? An explorer? A tasked performer of intergalaxic goodwill?  Gameplay: Walking simulator with point and click elements, no inventory, just ""touch"" to perform certain tasks.  A puzzle game that focuses on solving how to restart the massive machinations of world building proportions.  There are extra ""finds"" to be looked for in each area: 6 runes and 1 ""vision"" puzzle to find and solve.  Once all of these are found in every location a ""secret"" ending is revealed.  A very unique game with a very unique perspective, and more questions then answers.			"

But compared to the elegant beauty of that game, Kairo seems crude, and in some areas not even properly finished. Kairo is kinder to your wallet, but Naissance is a much more worthy investment of time.			"

												Kairo is a rather atmospheric abstract exploration/puzzle game.  I think a game like this could work well if there were interesting things to find, but Kairo doesn't have any.  The game just ends up being boring from start to finish with a pretty poor and confusing ending to top it off.  There are a few pretty creative puzzles throughout but many of the others make no sense and even seem like they deliberately try to confuse you.  That's not good puzzle design if you ask me.  Replay value seems to rely on annoyingly-hidden secrets, some of which require a lot of slow backtracking.So if you feel like walking around slowly, staring at confusing puzzles in differently colored rooms with nothing remarkable in them, this is the game for you.

												I thoroughly enjoyed this more than I anticipated.Kairo needs you figure out the mechanic for each puzzle, unlike many other puzzle platformers, where a mechanic is introduced in the beginning and the game revolves around that mechanic (like Portal and the portal gun, Antichamber and the cube gun, etc). Here you don't need to learn anything, there's no tutorial section or equipment to obtain. Every puzzle is solved by moving about and going to the right place, sometimes at the right time.Visually, the graphics are simple, Very simple. The grain filter (optional) makes them look even grittier. This felt fitting to the scenery and theme of the game, especially when coupled with the soundtrack. However, keep in mind that when you set the FOV higher than default, the camera will clip through walls.The game is short. You can 100% it in a couple of hours if you don't loiter around and are fast at the puzzles. There's no actual story told to you, but you do see some things that give you substance for speculation on what is going on in this world.Oh and Kairo has number stations scattered around! Transmitting!			"

												Exploring the giant empty rooms is not hugely fun or engaging in the end. Is there a story? Is there any reason for me to care about it? After finishing the game, I don't really know. There are plenty of puzzles, most of them very very straightforward, where the harder ones are usually hard due to jankiness, such as aligning something based on your X/Y axis movements. The puzzle solving elements are OK, mediocre at best. One of the puzzles was, not even lying, 'press this button repeatedly until RNG decides you can solve the puzzle.' That's a bit lazy.The environments are interestingly designed and laid out, but usually very empty, and monochromatic. It's a stretch to call ""make some shapes in unity and instead of designing interesting textures just make everything monochrome and overlay a grain effect"" stylish. If you set your field of view higher than 60 degrees (the default), you can see through walls. It seems like this game just barely functions as intended. The graphical complexity is very very low as well.It's around 2-3 hours long, depending on whether you get stuck on puzzles. The soundtrack repeats often, changing between tracks in most rooms. Approximately 30% of the game is spent walking across large expanses that do not stay interesting to look at for that entire time spent walking.If you're the artsy type, it's possible that you'll enjoy this game. If you are into puzzle solvers, there are many better options. This game approaches being a walking simulator due to the large amount of walking to the next area in comparison with puzzle solving.

			Views: 275		

			Kairo: Quick Look Kairo is a crazy first person puzzle platformer, with an unique and wonderfully crafted atmosphere. Oh yeah, I'm also totally pronouncing the name wrong in the video :P It's...		

Kairo is one of the most uniquely atmospheric game I've played. It's visuals are simple, but expertly crafted, both eerie and gorgeous at the same time. To say the least, the game is surreal in it's aesthetics. While the environment is some thing to take in, it's not just about looking at pretty set pieces, the game features mind bending puzzles as it's main motivator.Though the game is incredibly enjoyable, and wonderfully put together, it does have some minor flaws. The movements feel rather sluggish, and at best, floaty, and there isn't much incentive to replay the game once completed. Not to sound cliche, but Kairo really is about the journey and not the destination.For $5.00 at it's full price, you are getting a quality product. I can not recommend this game enough, especially at it's low price point. Pros:- Excellent aesthetics- Surreal and eerie atmosphere- Interesting puzzles- A very unique game overall- $5.00 is unreasonably cheap. This is a good thing for the consumer (I personally think it's worth more than just $5.00)Cons:- Floaty controls- Not a lot of replay incentives			"

												First off: huge problem with Kairo is that all the architecture is basically straight lines, sharp corners, everything looked the same, really boring for a game that kinda relies on its aesthetics.I got this in a bundle, and that's how much I think it's really worth. It's a pretty game, but not pretty enough for a game whose merit at first glance is just that - being pretty. Numerous graphical glitches, the far-from-smooth movement and controls made for a miserable experience for me. It is very atmospheric I'll give it that, but apart from that the clunky movement, okay-ish design and graphics, and inconsistent puzzles really killed this game for me.Added: Followed a guide to get the final achievements, now I realize why I found it not pretty at all for this kind of slow paced atmospheric game! The architecture is all really blocky, sharp edges throughout the whole game. Realized after completing the game why I got tired of it so fast.			"

												I'm nothing if not a fan of ambiguity to such an extreme that I can interpret something as a commentary on whatever I dern well please, and Kairo is an experience that excels in creating a blank slate open to any and pretty much all interpretations. This game is simplicity in action, and as I delved deeply into the carved blocks of granite/obsidian/stone/randomness to discern some hidden meaning behind it all, I found myself continually following my own line of thought, like a dog trailing after the scent of a long lost bone he buried somewhere deep in the earth.I honestly attempted to like this game, but sometimes a little concrete meaning is required after a jumble of meaningless gravel. What I mean is that Kairo is far too ambiguous; I can wander aimlessly through this game and decide what it means for myself until, quite literally, the very end, at which point Kairo finally decides to give me something solid - not okay, guys, not okay.Kairo is a game that lets you wander through a child's block fort, occasionally posing *cough cough* ""puzzles"" that briefly halt your progress through the maze of nothingness. I felt as though the developers had a clear idea as to what they wanted to say, sat down in a conference room and said ""Hey guys, woudn't it be really cool if we..."" and then glued together a jumbled mess of a game.... Sorry, 'experience'. I received conflicting feelings of paranoia and comfort throughout the game, feeling at one time as though I were being watched and at another time as though I were revolting against an omnitient, though not omnipotent, regime, slowly tearing it down brick by ambiguous brick. I think each *cough cough* ""puzzle"" in this 'experience' was arbitrarily assigned some deeper 'meaning' after the story-board team smoked an acre of some illegal substance. That doesn't fly with me. I am certainly not saying I don't LOVE pushing my smug nose up and saying ""Oh yesh, I am a very smart man and love interpreting games and books and movies because I am so deep and insightful"" because I do love to say that. I am a smarmy head-up-my-ahem turd; Kairo is a jumbled mess of obfuscated meaning with an alternate ending (oh joy) to encourage further 'experiencing'. That's cheap, guys.IN BRIEF (he said ironically): Kairo is a block fort, glued together by a toddler hyped up on three gallons of coffee. Then a guy walked by and glued a tagline onto it that belongs at the bottom of an inspirational cat poster. If you have something to say, then say it. If you believe in what you're saying, then you want people to agree with you: make sure they know what you believe.10/10			"

												Excellent puzzle/exploration experience... atmosphere is a bit raw, reminds me of PSX era stuff in a good way, nice drone soundscapes. One puzzle in particular is really awkward to solve involving 2 spinning things and there are a couple puzzles that you may solve by accident, but aside from that it is pretty solid. A lot of further secrets to figure out once completing the game too.			"

												I buyed this game as an terror game due to my (I think is called) kenophobia. And you can bet it did work. Some particular places and those TV Screens with random-yet-creepy-whatever it was totally making me nervous.Anyway, this is my very particular case apparently.Pros: The atmosphere.Puzzles not that easy, but not that hard.Unless you're using a Pentium or a fossil, this game will run in your system.Cons: Some collisions need to be fixed.In my case, there is zones which makes you need to restart the entire game if you didn't played in a while and don't remember where did you had to go to restart your journey.If you're scared about open spaces or the essence and context of the ""void""/""nothing"", keep that in mind before you play this.P.S. For some reason the time played showed is way lesser than the actual :\			"

												A real brain teaser this one. Does not tell you anything - you are not even sure who you are and if it's all just some weird dream. No dialogue anywhere in the game and the first character you encounter is not in the shape to tell much stories.  'Minimalistic explorer' is what i have heard this being called and it's pretty accurate. Games like this dont really exist and nobody makes them yet i think this one was fun right of the bat and it was able to steer clear of the X-files/lost type of cliffhanger and then nothing -type of clichees that i was expecting to pop-up at some point. so i'll give this one 9/10 - As a minimalistic explorer w/puzzles to solve.

												Kairo is an amazing trip through the inner workings of a developer's mind. I bought this game on a whim, knowing it was VERY cheap at the time and rated positively. I was not disappointed. I was greeted with an interesting, explorable environment and I found myself wasting time running around in some of the 'filler' areas, simply having fun with the terrain. It is a beautiful game, and has very fitting, calm music. I would say this game is worth buying for anyone looking for a beautiful game that will take you on an adventure like that of a book.			"

												I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, some secret to uncover, some story to unfold – but it is just a long sequence of pretty, mostly empty, monochrome halls and spaces with more-or-less intriguing puzzles. The few ""story-related"" hints every now and then do not match the basic design, they feel like foreign objects artificially inserted and in no way constitute storytelling. Apart from that: both visual and sound design are adequate, sometimes even fascinating, but of course not on the same level as the ""big"" titles.			"

												Very original and challenging puzzle game. As you start exploring the world you're in and start solving puzzles you will start gathering pieces of information on WHAT on earth you're actually doing all this for. VERY atmospheric game with some serious creepyness at times. Some puzzles rely on speed, many rely on observational skills and hardly any of them are easily solved. The game also has a secret bonus ending that requires the collection of 18 hidden runes and the destruction of 3 very well hidden monoliths. I had 8/18 and 0/3 after finishing the game, so I wasn't even close to getting it.Highly recommended if you like games that focus on puzzles, atmosphere, mystery, exploration and a little creepyness.

												Kairo is as simple as it gets. It is an artsy, abstract and super minimalist walking simulator. And, as such, I think it excel, as it is always throwing at you new kind of imagery, puzzle and scenery. At no point I found Kairo to be lazy, reusing too often room design. I recommend using a guide though. Due to the minimalistic approch of the game, some puzzle are very cryptic.If the idea of walking through monochrome rooms of block, sphere and triangle while engulfing deeply into your own though and emotion is appeling to you, you will like this game. My advice is to surrender yourself to Kairo and let every bit of creativity sink in without looking for a finite explanation of what is happening around you.			"

												I think I've finally achieved Nirvana...either that or my mind has just been completely blown. Kairo is jaw dropping immense game of abstract exploration. It's easy to just stop and gaze upon the minimalistic visuals and animations because they are so moving and powerful. As you solve puzzles the world around you changes to reveal things that are impossible to describe in words. The sounds and music are ominous and dramatic, yet they do not frighten and somehow even offer comfort. The puzzles provide a perfect equilibrium of not being overly complicated without solving themselves. Kairo is truly a work of art on so many levels.			"

												I really do enjoy my first person puzzle games, and that is exactly what Kairo is. Though Kairo is missing a neat mechanic that other more famous first person puzzle games have, it does have very clever puzzles in a fantastic geometric environment. Though some may argue that Kairo is a walking simulator, I would say that it is more than that.Now, as with many puzzle games, the difficulty curve is very important. Kairo does not hold your hand through play, but it does give you some idea on what to do. The curve is very good, as the difficulty does ramp up slightly while the puzzles become more interesting. However, there is one puzzle that is based around your position on a platform which, personally, I had to look up a solution as it was very difficult to understand. Other than that, the game succeeds in having very good puzzles in a gorgeous environment.The soundtrack in nothing spectacular as it is just ambience, but there is no loop which is great. Story is non-existent, which is fine as you do not need a story for this type of game. There are easter eggs and other things to do after completion, which slightly increases the length of the game. In fact, there is really no major issue with the game, and I would suggest picking it up if you enjoy obscure puzzle games.			"

												I think the game developer (Richard Perrin) is the descendant of a mathematican.  See this page on the Perrin sequence[mathworld.wolfram.com], for example.  This definitely explains the mathematical feel to everything in this game (including the ending song!).  But this game can be enjoyed even if you don't like math.Yes, it's a short and sweet game, yes it doesn't really have a story, but  like The Beginner's Guide, this game plays more like an interactive work of modern/minimalist art than a game.

												The prime description of this game says it’s a minimalistic puzzle game yet I find the so called minimalistic environments rich. The spaces between rooms and puzzles are huge as if done with a XYZ co-ordinate modeller on steroids, the actual puzzles themselves more artifact than steam punk but richer in detail than the beautiful rooms travelled to get to them. Great art and even better music are at play in this game as well as symbols and language. Portal players used to traversing a room by entering one portal and exiting another already across the room may at find the game at time a bit walk intensive but the journey is the thing. Has some non-Euclidean feel as in Antechamber and a discovery feel as in Riven. For the current price of just ~$5 get and play this game.			"

												Kairo isn't a game for everybody.  In fact, I wouldn't even say it was a game for most people.  It's the type of game that takes a lot of patience to enjoy.  You've got to really put yourself into the game, imagine that you're really in this place, seeing these things.  The atmosphere and mystery are everything, and if that isn't your bag then you won't find enough to enjoy here when it comes to pure gameplay.There are indeed puzzles to be solved, but most of them are quite simple.  There are no controls beyond moving around and jumping, and there's no text or story to speak of beyond what you're observing of your environment.  As is to be expected with these types of games, a lot of it is open for interpretation, including the ending.  The graphics are solid, but quite simple and low-budget; most of the architecture is made up of blocks and flat planes.If any of those things are deal-breakers, then don't even bother.  But if you're into the pure sense of discovery that games can offer then I can't possibly recommend it enough.  The term gets tossed around a lot, but it truly is more of an experience than a game.  You've got to like abstraction, simplicity, and rich atmosphere (thanks in large part to the excellent sound design).  You've got to be the type of person who gets a thrill from the simple act of booting up a game and not knowing exactly what to expect--of heading through a door and not having the foggiest idea of what you'll see.There isn't much more to say about the game.  If it's not your cup of tea, nothing else here will be relevant to you.  If it is, then there's no need for me to explain what was great about it with more detail, because it's already obvious that you should play it.  I mean hey, it's five bucks, and as I type this it's on sale for one whole dollar.  Even if the story only lasts a few hours, that's a stupidly good deal for such an experience.			"

												This is a small, excelent exploration game. The art is very minimalist and surreal, very blocky in a braod sense, on purpose, and each screen or level is dominated by a color, which permeates everything in said level.The puzzles are mostly ""positioning"" puzzles, in which you solve them by standing in a specific position or having to take certain path (but they are very logic and easy to understand), by having to push here and there some objects, just moving against them (there is no ""action/manipulate"" button), or by pressing some buttons in certain order. The atmosphere is mostly relaxing, but there are a few spooky or strange moments as well.There is no rush, no sense of urgency, so you can stroll at your leisure through the many blocky landscapes. If you try to solve all puzzles by yourself, it could take about 6+ hours of game. If you follow a walkthrough, you could rush through it in a couple hours, but it would be a shame. There is also no manual save, but the game saves often as you reach a new area or solve some puzzle or find something noteworthy.This game is ideal to relax or slow down a bit. Higly recommended			"

												Explore a desolate world with empty & strange architecture & machinery, bring them back to life and solve it's mysteries.This is my first escape in a ""walking simulator"" but I would call it more of an exploration game where you encounter puzzles to progress further. I enjoyed it immensly. I felt like some Indiana Jones exploring some eerie alien site.What I liked:- The simple but effective graphics and the architecture it's made of- The ""grain"" effect (especially near some radioactive obelisks)- The atmospheric music & sound effects- As you progress, some past locations with no apparent purpose got a meaning and how to solve them- Most puzzles are interesting, some fairly easy but most have a logical solutionWhat I didn't like:- getting all those (some hard to find) achievements to get in the secret ending- some puzzles with no (apparent) logic at all.As I said, I enjoyed it immensly. It's like urban exploring (checking out abandoned buildings) Recommended for those who like to explore strange environments & solve some interesting puzzles along the way to activate mysterious machinery			"

												Amazingly minimalist puzzle game that looks like it was pulled out of cubist art? Yes please! Bonus points for having been made by the same man who did ""The Binding of Isaac"".Kairo is what happens when Myst meets Mincraft and sprinkled with Shadow of the Colossus. The atmosphere is spooky, complemented by dissonant and etherial soundtrack, and punctuated by the sheer sense of scale and isolation. The machine, tower, and everything else is abandonned, and needs to be restarted. This requires you to solve a series of inventive, if no-nonsense puzzles in order to proceed.The puzzles are somewhat challenging. I say this because the musical score alerts you when you're on the right track, or are doing something incorrectly. This can lead to simply listening to cues in order to proceed with the game.All in all, it's a fun game that hooks you for a bit and doesn't let go. Also: if anyone dares go near the stele at the apex of that exterior spiral staircase, let me know what happens. The screen statics up and I've played enough ""Slender"" to have the ""Ohhellnaw"" muscle reaction to it.			"

An ominous, eerie atmosphere enters your lungs and suffocates you.You find yourself on a stone throne, or is it? Structures begin to emanate on the horizon as soon as you take your first step; but the path in front of you doesn't exist...yet. Why are you here? Is this limbo? Why am I solving paradoxically complex, yet simple puzzles? What is the goal of Kairo? Is there one?Maybe. Maybe not. As the adage goes, it isn't about the destination, it's about the journey that guides you there.Let the void consume you...			"

One SentenceAtmospherically interesting and surreal puzzle game with some glaring flaws.A Bit MoreLet me first say I got this game for the fair price of 0.74$ and I think paying full price may also be a fair deal, depending on where your video game preferences lie.Kairo sets the mood pretty early with it's ominous soundtrack and stark visuals. I found the grain effect and mouse smoothing (default settings) annoying so I had to turn them off straight away. I had extremely choppy/laggy mouse and keyboard movement which might be due to my weak computer but this game should not as demanding on the cpu as it is. Despite all that Kairo's atmosphere is enjoyable and the much needed hint system helps in teaching you what the level design won't. Towards the later segments of the game the puzzles lose some of their quality and the map design will leave most players wondering around without much enjoyment.  Bottom LineIf you enjoy difficult puzzles and open ended mysteries Kairo will give you your money's worthFollow http://steamcommunity.com/groups/West7 for more game reviews			"

												More of an ""ehhh..."" than a strict Thumbs Up Thumbs Down Yes No proposition, Kairo offers a sort of first person Myst-lite linked-chamber exploration game with simple puzzles unlocking further exploration. Lacking mechanical depth or logical difficulty (there's a lot of obvious ""stand here, then touch there"" stuff), the puzzles generally feel like a bit of vestigial interactivty left there to regulate progression through Kairo's strengths of envrionment and atmosphere. Each area proffers a unique bit of architecture, either a room or a monument, suspended in the void; In tandem with the monochromatic color scheme and sound design, the effect is rather evocative. Evocative of what, other than the tingly excitement of meandering through an abandoned alien kinetic sculpture garden, is a bit difficult to discern.Kairo exhausted my patience due to the tedium of its puzzling elements, but it could be worth exploring if you dont mind and find the screenshots compelling (if you do mind, I suggest Kairo's obverse, Antichamber- its world isn't exactly poetic, but does have a practical charm in service of the brain-bending environmental puzzling Kairo lacks.)

												This game is enjoyable. It also fells unfinished.When you fall out of the world, it spawns you where you where last touching the ground. That means ramps that push you right back to falling.  Also, when I was exploring I noticed some untouched places. Like being able to see behind the teleporter pad or what ever it is that gets you place to place, and easely getting places you where never attended to go.Conclusion: Fun, but needs improvments.			"

												Kairo tries so hard to be a sureal experience about exploration and puzzle solving but it just isn't. They have a grain filter in an attempt to make it atmospheric but that's the most atmosphere the game has. Each puzzle/room is simple a linear path with a 2-3 step puzzle, if there is one at all. The game doesn't lead you to anything, it just sets you free and hopes you'll stumble across something. Also, the walking. So much walking.			"

												Kairo is an obtuse little puzzle game. It looks and feels like someone was playing around with 3D modeling for the first time and then threw some puzzles in at the end.The hardest step with most of the puzzles was just determining what they were asking me to do to begin with. Once I figured that out, solving them was relatively simple.It's not that long, but it does drag. There is a lot of forced walking, and much of it repeated through paths you've traveled before.I was hoping that there would be some amazing story behind it all, but there's not. It's a simple world with simple explanations. If there had been more it might've helped elevate this game, but sadly as is it wasn't worth the time.			"

Honiric 3D Puzzle Adventure! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]I must say I am torn in calling it a ""game"": it is more like a tech demo for Oculus Rift rather than a full fledged game. Or maybe you can consider it a piece of art thanks to his honiric atmosphere made of abstract buildings, strange obelisks, floating stairways and often one-colour tinted rooms. I am also torn in recommending it.Aim of the game? You start outside a strange building and you have to find the secrets it hides inside... There is no inventory, no weapons, no HUD, no text, no help, only you. Music is relaxing and puzzles do not require a lot of thinking, letting you progress nicely in the game (unfortunately not very long: about 4 hours).I think it is an awesome experience with Oculus Rift, but on PC it didn't catch me at all.

												Interesting little game. It walks a bit of a line between games like Antichamber, Myst and Fez, where the environment is all you have to direct you through the puzzles and the world. While the visuals and puzzles are interesting, I don't think they match up to the standard of those three titles. There are a few great ones scattered and some secret content hidden throughout, bringing a game that is overall pretty fulfilling for a puzzle gamer. The later optional puzzles in particular are really quite difficult and I was unable to complete most of them without external help, speaking as somebody who completed Antichamber and all but two puzzles in Fez without needing to do so.The sound and visuals work well together to build a nice atmosphere; the screenshots on the steam store speak for themselves. The mystery in the game starts to build up quite nicely as the game goes on, although I felt left wanting more of a final payoff. A decent title for 4 hours or so, but only worth getting if you have already played and enjoyed both Antichamber and Fez, as I would say they are better games with similar audiences. It is not easy to find competent examples of freeform world puzzlers like this.			"

												This first person puzzle game is an outstanding work of art. It gives you no sense of direction, but you sort of adjust an understanding of what you have to do overtime from repeating puzzles. I really love the creepy feeling you get of being alone, yet you feel like someone is watching. The scenery is great for being so plain and the music is creepy as well. Don't worry, in my opinion the puzzle's are farilly easy and if you get stuck certain rooms give you very kind hints. This game is just very enjoyable and you will get sucked into it.			"

												I love this game so much you have no idea. This game, to me, perfects the feeling of loneliness (related spoilers in brackets below)This feeling of loneliness was so present and so overwhelming to me, and I kept moving on wondering what was next. As time went on and things started being revealed to me, the things which were revealed only made that feeling of loneliness grow. There were some points at which I also felt fear, the sort of fear you feel when you want to get out of a room and you don't know quite why, so you run out and slam the door behind you.The game itself is pretty solid. You have no inventory and no buttons with which you can use to interact with things. You walk jump and look around and those are the only controls. The variety of puzzles despite this is amazing, and most of them make perfect sense (there was one where you rotate two gears to match symbols in some weird arbitrary manner and I never actually figured out what the connection was. Had to use a guide for that part)If I didn't have the emotional capacity of a potato I would have cried at the end, I swear to god, it just HIT ME RIGHT THERE, RIGHT IN THE WEAK POINT. So please please PLEASE BUY THIS GAME.[there's a moment in the game where you walk into a room and press a button. TV screens turn on around you, showing a humanlike figure behind static. As you solve the puzzles around this point in the game, this figure pops up on more TV screens as you complete puzzles. As I played through I thought to myself, ""Is that another human? If I meet them what will happen? Who are they?"" At some point you find yourself in a green tinted room with another TV, only larger and in front of a table. When you walk around the table, you find a skeleton on a chair with monitors examining puzzles you've completed in front of it. There is a message scratched onto the arm of the chair. ""I AM ALONE HERE.""]			"

												This game makes me feel like I was inside the dreams of a weird engineer/architect. It is great how it can give you so much with so bare materials. You walk around huge constructions, trying to make sense of it. And then you realize you are the life inside these dead empty endless halls.Kairo begins with a throne in the middle of nowhere. You're alone, there's nothing. But ""nothing"" becomes something tangible, you begin to think about nothingness. You enter this nothingness, this void, and find many things there. Things buried, forgotten. Other thrones, kings, or perhaps other times of the same reign. But you are the king of a dead and empty realm. Are you alone. There is a world out there and you do not have access to it. There is life, and all you see are images, codes, machines, mementos.Could the machines drive you back to life? Where does this light leads? Where does this flow leads? Where will you go? Who built it? For what purpose? Where are you really? Maybe in a hospital bed, waiting to wake up. I enjoyed every minute of this trip. I did not understand almost anything, but what I did was enough to make the trip worthwhile.This game is about second chances. You move from a lifeless place to a garden with flowing life. It is really about coming back to life, so it is another game that helped me recover. It is amazing how this message is there without the need of any word. It is a memorable experience.Positive points* A very trippy and weird experience.* Logical puzzles that you solve without any instruction.Negative points* Very easy to get lost.* Looks empty and random.* The above are all part of the experience...

												This game is like Myst, but more straightforward. It's Diet Myst.In some ways it feels more like a game demo rather than a completed game. The entire time I played I kept feeling like there was an important element that hadn't been implemented into the game files yet. So maybe it's Caffeine-Free Diet Myst.Despite feeling incomplete it was still enjoyable to play. The puzzles are challenging (and none of them stood out to me as being terribly unfair) and it doesn't take too long to get through the game. I think you get your money's worth with Kairo; there are definitely worse games you could spend $5 on.			"

												Kairo is a game for people who like museums and art galleries.  It is a game with vast, intriguing areas and intermediate-level puzzle solving.  The game is very simple in its design and concept, yet it is very beautiful and fun if you add your imagination to it.  The different rooms and areas are wonderfully designed and conceived, and are interesting to explore.  That is why I say this is a game for people who enjoy exploring the rooms and art in museums and galleries.  On top of that, there are elements of mystery and creepiness at times during the game that make you think.This is definitely a style of indie game that I would like to see more of in mainstream production.

												Imagine a walking simulator, except with all the interesting aspects of walking simulators (narrative, interesting environmental storytelling, etc.) removed, and replaced with some puzzles and nothing else. That's Kairo.It's not a bad game; if all you're looking for is a slow paced, bare-bones puzzle game then you'll enjoy it. The puzzles can be a little on the punishing side, but in general they're reasonably well executed and somewhat engaging. In short, if you want a first-person puzzle game which includes puzzles, a first-person perspective, and absolutely nothinng else, then Kairo is for you. A good game is any game that hits the target it's aiming at, even if it's not necessarily the most interesting target in the world. Kairo is far from the most engaging game ever made, but it achieves what it set out to do competently, so it gets a recommendation.			"

You walk among those structures, which are very minimalistic, mostly flat and suddenly see that one of the cubes is damaged, cracked. This place is silent, but you can hear that it is not dead. At all.Playing this game was like visiting a good exhibition of modern art. Both great visual, musical and conceptually.			"

												Just a simple review for this game.Kairo is a very good example of a game that is about puzzles, and about logical thinking.   This game does not beat around the bush in trying to add other things alongside the puzzles.   It is very much focused on puzzles that force a person to really think, or to be patient and wait til an answer appears.    The game can be frustrating because often times, you will come across a puzzle in which doing things in the wrong order, will lead to various issues, or puzzles where an answer is not possible to find until a later time.    I knw that it was annoying trying to figure out a few of the puzzles, and eventually used a hint guide to figure it out.Graphics:   Very basic graphics, low res textures and stuff.   But like I said before, this game focuses on the puzzle aspect, not the pretty visuals.   Also, there are a nice color theme that can be seen so that is enjoyable.Audio:   Very minimal muisc because it focuses on the puzzle, not the other things.Game Mechnics:    The controls are very simple.  You move, you jump, you run.   Nothing more, nothing less.   You solve puzzles by moving in certain areas, moving objects to certain areas, and standing in certain places.Story:   None that I could see, but thats possibly due to it focusing on the puzzles, rather than the story.Overall, this is a very enjoyable  game that can be frustrating at times, due to the challenging aspect of it, but since there is a 100% guide on Steam, you will always have a way to make it through IF, key word is if, you need it.   If you are not that good with puzzles or logical thinking, then I would not recommend this because it will easily frustate you.			"

												Kairo is worth your time and money, but only because it requires minute amounts of both. I recommend it in all its lukewarm glory.It's a puzzle-game with platforming elements - unlike its contemporaries Kairo gives you a full range of movement that helps avoid the monotony of more ""walking simulator""-esque games, though it rarely expects you to actually platform. There's something to be said for bunnyhopping your way through the environment, and there's even some collectables that take advantage of the movement system. Kairo ran well enough, though I did have some minor troubles getting stuck on the geometry and consistently had clipping issues with the camera edges while running it at a 1920x1080 resolution, which I don't particularly hold against the game. It bills itself as an exploration game, but the progression is still largely straightforward - you travel from hub to hub solving puzzles in siderooms accessible via portals. Your exploration is largely limited to the next area the game wants you to go. I didn't think this was a negative aspect in the slightest, as I've personally no interest in wandering around some landscape with no idea where to go, but unless you figure exploration to mean ""looking at the game as you progress through it"" then it does stand out.The puzzles are simple and easy to figure out, rarely requiring more than a few minutes of experimentation to figure out each ones internal logic structure (outside of one frustratingly weird gear puzzle that I'm still not sure how I managed to solve). You're never outright told what to do, but given your simple moveset and means of interaction - mostly pushing blocks or activating buttons - it's not hard to figure out, though there's a hint system anyway. If you've ever played a puzzle game before, you'll just be going through the motions.Throughout the game, there's a consistent rate of highly unique rooms to traverse as you solve the puzzles presented. These rooms are sadly marred by their low budget - the massive structures are simplistic, and empty, mostly relying on the novelty of the colour schemes and their sheer vastness to hold your attention. Given the short amount of time you spend in each area, it works, though if/when you backtrack to pick up collectables you've missed and solve optional puzzles you'll the novelty wears off. Story is there, but it's completely ambiguous, mostly symbolic and only really lends itself to the game through some notable imagery. It's not really worth ""figuring out"", I didn't bother with it and I doubt it's meant to be a part of the ""experience"", but the flavour it lends to the puzzles is appreciated nonetheless.The advantages of Kairo lie in how casual a game it is. It's a game to wind down with, cool off and a have a cup of joe while adjusting to the game's own wavelength. It was obviously a labour of love, but there's not much more to the game than that. There's nothing wrong with that. There's just nothing memorable about it either.			"

												If the words minimalistic abstraction ever had to be used to describe a game, then Kairo, developed by British Richard Perrin, would be the most appropriate game. I originally purchased and installed the game without quite knowing what to expect – or what not to expect for that matter. Kairo starts in  medias res; something which naturally leaves the player with a fair amount of uncertainty and second-guesses as to what they are meant to do. Unlike most other games however, the uncertainty gradually increases as you progress through the first few stages of the game – a very unusual, yet intriguing, experience. Unfortunately this also represents the barrier where players either decide to delve into this unique and captivating piece of content, or quit. It is important to stress that Kairo is not like any other game – and it may even be discussed whether labelling as it as puzzle exploration rather than game is more appropriate.The fact that Kairo manages to distance itself from most other games within the first few minutes of gameplay is an accomplishment alone though, and perhaps the word distinct is a keyword when it comes to describing the game as a whole. There is no tutorial, no introduction to the story and no explanation to why you find yourself on top of an ancient stone construction. Alone.The exploration begins psychedelically as you wander into thin air in an adventurous attempt to make it to the next construction. It is evident that exploration indeed is a big part of Kairo – both to complete the individual rooms, but also to locate the correct path(s). It moreover turns out that mastering scrutinizing for close to every sub-dimensional room is crucial and highly rewarding as players will find hidden runes and unlock achievements for collecting these.As more rooms are unlocked and more puzzles are solved, the player starts to wonder what the purpose of Kairo is, not to mention what Kairo itself is –  if anything at all. It is evident that the player is reactivating – and sometimes literally fixing – ancient mechanisms within the ruins. At times short glimpses of modern- and present-times are shown, which yet again questions the story. Is Kairo a new beginning, or is it a desperate attempt to fix what has been lost and destroyed – or something completely else?Kairo is not a game for everyone, and it is a game which requires determination and a genuine interest in solving brainteasing puzzles. The environment and story (or, rather, lack of story given your point of view) can be very appealing, but that alone is not a reason to purchase and enjoy the game. A strong interest in puzzles is essential, but if a genuine interest is present then Kairo does offer some extremely complex, unique and intriguing puzzles which, without a guide, easily can take longer than eight hours to complete. Kairo is thus strongly recommendable for those seeking a unique and brainteasing puzzler with an interesting plot, but should be avoided by those who prefer more traditional puzzle-games.			"

												The game has no story at all, but the landscape and tranquil music make this a very mysterious and compelling world to be in. Was very difficult in the beginning to understand what I was doing. Mostly walked around and some things happened and I was in a new room or location. Later locations at least gave you an idea of what was needed to be done, though there are a few areas that were like where the hell am I going? I accidentally walked through some pillars into a wall and was transported somewhere else.Puzzles were pretty difficult, mainly because of very little direction. I beat this mostly on luck. Still, pretty interesting little game.			"

												I haven't seen much about these points yet, I'm just adding to others' reviews.This one's about solving some puzzles  in a hyper dimensional alien space to turn some machines on after the apocalypse.Graphical design is going for minimalistic abstract representation of stone buildings, so I'm certain there's less than 100 textures in the entire game. Explorable empty space is used to show importance of an object in the room, and over-saturated lighting is used almost randomly, but consistently through a room.Sound design follows graphical design, and follows a theme of emptiness and alienation in an abstract world.The physics and control are poor, but only because they are unnecessary for the gameplay.Gameplay itself is puzzle solving in isolation, but the main story puzzles are simple. It's a small game that takes time to explore for 100% completion. The 100% content beyond the main story puzzles just involves finding hidden things and backtracking after hitting an obvious switch to find a matching shape somewhere.After breaking it down like that, I think it'd make for a really nice modern art machinima.As far as being a game, it can be depressing for a few reasons. That's why I recommend it.			"

												Wow! This game has me enthralled. Eerie, beautiful, mysterious, atmospheric; these are all words I would use to describe this game. I can't tell you how many times I had tingles go up and down my spine while playing. The sense of awe, dread, mystery, and alienation are all invoked and maintained by the environments and the soundtrack. This game is very heavy on the exploration and the puzzles are just about right in terms of difficulty. This game reminds me of the final sequence of 2001:A Space Odyssey when astronaut Dave Bowman went Beyond the Infinite. The landscapes you explore in this game seem like the sorts of experiences Dave might have had before becoming the Star Child. If you like exploring and figuring out puzzles based on strange alien technology, getting disoriented and unnerved by the overwhelming sense that perhaps you are not meant to be in the vast, stark spaces you find yourself in, then you should definitely get this game.

												There's no story to speak of, and the puzzles are mostly just pattern-matching, but that being said, this game was still a really cool experience. Like a strange four-hour dream. Get this game, put on your headphones, and use the hint system when you need to -- the puzzles, while simple, can sometimes be obtuse.			"

												The game itself was a nice puzzler, kept me thinking for a long time. I enjoyed the atmosphere and how separated from reality it felt. Never quite felt like a walking sim, and I liked the visuals.What really got me was the ending, I really needed what it said.			"

												kairo is probably the most immersive gaming experience Ive ever had. It gives the player a feeling of lonliness, but not in a bad sense. More of the sense of an independent challenge. And when you complete a puzzle after working it out for over an hour, the feeling of accomplishment is absolutely amazing. This game is FULLY worth the 5$ you could spend on it, I highly reccomend it. Its challenging enough it might take you 5-6 hours to finish it, and is worthwhile to play multiple times to find all the runes.			"

NOTE: Somehow, the most recent updates to the game have made it incredibly buggy. In the stable release the main menu stays onscreen the entire time and I can't look left or right. In the DK2 Beta things are much more polished, but there are some sequencing glitches where I can reach the Garden without having completed a single puzzle. It's still worth a try if you can get it to work.Kairo is not exactly the most complex game, but it gives you enough mental stimulation. Since it's only $6 right now, either go ahead and get it or wait for a sale. If you're on the fence about this one, I encourage you to read on fully.FIRST OFFKairo is made in Unity, and if you've experienced a game in Unity you know that slowdowns are extremely common. Prepare to wade through the settings several times deciding what slows you down and what doesn't, maximizing appearance with playability, especially when most defaults are selected with high-speed computers in mind.GAMEPLAYThe puzzles in Kairo are particularly easy by minimalistic adventure standards, but the developers have definitely squared down exactly what kind of puzzles they need. Rather than blatantly giving you instructions or commentary to push you in the right direction, they require you to work out exactly what's going on to figure out the solution, very similar to Myst. Puzzles are isolated to their own special room, but sadly this means most of the time you'll be walking through a room that's more for sightseeing than for puzzlesolving. For the casual gamer, Kairo features a hint system that can assist in solving puzzles. There's no penalty, and it doesn't resolve if they're used or not. All in all, Kairo is a solid puzzle game.VISUALSThe minimalistic visuals of Kairo are absolutely breathtaking. The wonderfully crafted levels are absolutely gorgeous to look at, and unlike many games, the additions of things like film grain only serve to add to the visuals, rather than give a false impression of visuals. Of particular note are areas of the game where the film grain is programmatically increased to add effect as you look around and wander. There is (as it first seems) only one texture that Kairo has: a concrete/stone texture kind of thing. This sort of forces you to look at the architecture as the art. And boy, is the architecture ever art. Stunning and functional, the deliberate monochrome of Kairo's architecture make it one of the most gorgeous games I have ever played.STORY...Well, here's where the negatives come up. Kairo's story is one that you have to infer, but the structure of the gameplay kind of causes whatever the story would possibly be to get... jumbled. I'm not sure how to describe this without giving much away, but Andrew Plotkin has a wonderful quote that hits this nail right on the head.""If I were to level a charge, it would be that the game world never really coheres, beyond the visual level. An adventure can set up its narrative drive through discovered texts and journals (old gag though that is). Or it can build a narrative out of its artistic details, the discovered connections and implications hidden in the visual world. Or this structure can come from the gameplay itself -- the connections you discover between the puzzles and mechanisms that make up the game. By solving, you learn what it's for.Kairo disavows each of these strategies: it chooses minimalist artwork, (nearly) textless presentation, and modular puzzles. They're separate design decisions, but together they more or less rule out the sense of a coherent narrative world. It's not a flaw in the game, but a missed opportunity, I guess.""~Andrew Plotkin[gameshelf.jmac.org]THE SECRETThere are a set number of secrets to the game, but Jesus Christ do NOT even try going for that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just look up a walkthrough. Kairo's secret ending (yes, it does exist) is a joke. I have to give that away. It's not really funny, and the solution to get to it is completely obscure to get to. It was painful to read how people figured out how to get to the secret rooms, they reminded me of classic Sierra game solutions, it was that bad. Not to mention the secret ending in the dev room (after I even managed to get to it) made me question the validity of all the other secret rooms regarding any sort of story Kairo has. My verdict? Kairo has no story, and that's the worst thing I could possibly say for this genre of games. I'm all for a game with no story (DOOM is one of my favorite games, for God's sake!) but that's a philosophy that needs to be considered on a game-per-game basis, and Kairo's the kind of game that can't handle that♥♥♥♥♥♥OVERALLKairo's a game that promises too much at the start of the game and delivers too little at BOTH of it's endings. However, if you're more here to solve some puzzles and get beautiful visuals, then by all means, $6 isn't all that much. Go ahead and grab it if you're into art games, or if it's on sale. You'll get more out of this than Dear Esther in terms of fun. (imo)Oh, also check out Antichamber if you're all for atmospheric avant-garde first-person puzzle games with no true plot! THAT'S how to do that♥♥♥♥♥♥right.			"

												It's an interesting and artfully composed game that will wow you from time to time with its visuals. Unfortunately, it's also pretty plodding and slow.

PresentationKairo is a game of exploration and mystery, putting a whole world of differently coloured rooms ahead of you, each with its own intrigues and puzzles; the design of those rooms is simplistic, each following a precise theme and colour, without adding too much detail on the ambient, but that's part of what makes Kairo's mystery so great, leaving you with questions about a certain object that you encountered and what useful information that object might have for you. While some of those questions will be answered by the end of the game, most of them won't, leaving you more confused than you were when you first started the game, and as great as that is from the mysterious perspective of the game, it somehow feels disappointing at the same time, as you probably were expecting at least some of the bigger mysteries to be answered in a way or another, but on the bright side that leaves a lot of room for interpretation, allowing each one of us to have our own verdict on what Kairo wanted to tell us. The greatest part about this game however, is the way it manages to shape its universe around you, constantly surprising you with what lies ahead in the next room and leaving you in doubt on how you should react to what you see before your eyes, but at the same time giving you complete freedom to move around and see what you can discover to help you solve that room's puzzle and move forward just to have the same thing happen to you all over again. In the end, judging by the amount of hours you've spent in Kairo it won't add up to more than a few hours, but really digging into the experience and enjoying the mysteries it has to tell, it will seem a lot longer while you're inside and exploring at will, even though for most times, the more you explore, the more unanswered questions you'll have at the end.Rating: 7.5GameplayEvery once in a while, you run into those type of games that offer a unique and thrilling experience without focusing too much on the gameplay, but rather on the experience you have by simply being a part of that game and uncovering its mysteries; Kairo is exactly that type of game, delivering a simplistic mechanic of navigating through its universe and clever ways to solve its puzzles by using nothing else besides the basic movements and the environment around you. This game is all about exploration and uncovering the numerous mysteries that lie ahead, using the things you've seen before and the things you see in that very moment to help you solve different puzzles that stand in the way of your progression, something that works wonderful in Kairo, following a logical way of seeing things and even though the solution might not be that obvious at first, exploring the environment around you will eventually give you the information you need. Most areas follow the same pattern, requiring you to enter all the side rooms, observe what you can do in there and get things moving again until each and every one of the required steps has been completed and the core of that area is up and running, allowing you to move forward on to the next one. By putting some of the information you need to unlock various secrets in the rooms ahead of you, Kairo requires you to return to previously visited areas without feeling repetitive or boring, as there will always be something new to uncover that you might have missed on your first visit, and with the information from the rooms ahead of you in mind, you will for most of the times, know what you're looking for already. Even with the usage of the movements keys only, some of the mechanics such as pushing objects around feel like they haven't reached their full potential, as such simple things could've expanded the way in which puzzles are treated in various ways, making the game longer and adding that extra gameplay portion that's missing.GraphicsIt's hard not to appreciate the unique art style of Kairo and the wonderful and sometimes spooky environments it delivers, but even in all the simplicity of shapes and precise objects you can clearly see the outdated engine on which the game was built. There are an almost infinite number of ways in which this game could have been improved by using the latest game engines, especially in the lighting area, where the latest engines would've made a huge difference on how that room is viewed and the exact experience the game wanted to deliver.Rating: 5.5AudioThere's always a great tune playing in the background to add to the feel of a certain room, sometimes adding to the feeling of joy and liberty, while other times cornering you in a small room with little light and a spooky theme to add to the mystery effect. The sound effects as low quality as they are do their job well enough, but there was room for a little more variety and a few more touches here and there to make you hear the world moving around you when it does visually happen on the screen.Rating: 7ExtrasIt takes around four hours to complete Kairo, add an extra hour or two if you're looking to get the most out of it and collect all the glyphs, monoliths and solve all the secret puzzles, but also note that this is a game priced at 3.99€, so for that amount of money, it does more than enough to please. With the amount of mystery and out of place objects you can find in this game there was room for a lot more, as some of the areas are not used to their fullest and areas that seem to have some sort of puzzle attached to them at first, are just there to give the impression of having more to see.Rating: 9VerdictKairo isn't much of a game, but it's one great experience, especially if you're into the abstract puzzle genre, as its unique design and way of saying things make it a must play for any enthusiast of the genre. As in most cases, there was room for more in some areas and modern graphics would've made a huge difference in the way the game unveils to you, but considering the fact that this is an indie game, it did a great job delivering a worthy experience from a low budget production.Rating Overall: 7.4Check out the full review and a lot more about Kairo at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=279[/h1] "

												It's very easy to walk away from Kairo feeling as though it was just a light puzzle game with a bunch of stuff happening for no discernable reason. Unless you are willing to make a degree of meaning for the game for yourself, interpret some of it as art, or spend some time unraveling the abstract references and hidden meaning, you'll probably have a boring time with an average 3D exploration puzzle game. But for those who spend some time unraveling those clues, thinking about those references, and connecting the abstract together, there are interesting layers of story and meaning.HighlightsAs stated above, the main problems people have with Kairo, and the thing most people praise about Kairo stem from the same issue; the lack of direct or game-fed meaning, story and explanation. If you invest the time, Kairo becomes something much more, but it's always going to be subtle. For some, spending the time soaking in environment simply isn't worth the mild reward, and there are other games which do a much better job, and for others it will act as casual slow-paced art. In short, it's probably a game you'll either love or hate.* Extremely subtle designs in everything from lighting, shapes, distances and more add to the concept or image being conveyed in each section* Particularly good on VR platforms, mainly the Oculus Rift, though there are problems hereMistakesMany people have a problem with Kairo, or don't see any value in it against other games in its genre. In the end, it comes down to whether traditional gameplay elements and story are required to make this game fun for you or whether light and often frustrating-to-figure-out puzzles are enough reason for you to explore a strange environment.* The first sections have clearly been structured to convey tutorial elements while remaining non-obvious and ambiguous, but the problem many people have with this game is its lack of story, explanation or meaning and while that's not necessarily a mistake, it's subjective, and worth bearing in mind* The difficulty and nature of puzzles is erratic, which is understandable, but it would've benefited the game to make, at least some puzzle elementst more fluid and understandable* The bobby weaving motions when moving help add a subtle dreamlike feel, but may induce motion sickness or mild nausea and should've at least been given adjustable optionsRecommendationsAt just £3.99/4.99€/$4.99, Kairo is fairly priced and clocks in at 3-4 hours play time. Due to the mysterious or ambiguous nature of Kairo, some may find themselves spending much, much longer on this title, exploring the secrets or potential elements of meaning, whereas others will move on after an hour or less. Either way, it's definitely worth a buy for anyone looking for something with a different approach, and shouldn't be missed when on sale.* There are some fantastic player interpretations of the story elements and reading them in itself is fun The Secret of Kairo[www.electrondance.com]* A headset is recommended as it make the experience stronger, a VR headset is even better* Kairo (回路) is the Japanese word for ""circuit"" which lends to elements of the story "

												Kairo is a thing that will catch you up and won't let you go because of its atmospheric repletion. It seems that the game always wants to say you something special.

												Kairo is a deeply atmospheric puzzle/exploration game which tells its story only through clues. Thought provoking and simple with some really challenging puzzles. Definitely recommended if that sounds appealing to you.One minor criticism: The work associated with the achievement 'A Problem Shared' is probably a bit too much to ask of players buying a single player offline game. It requires you to look outside the game for assistance, yet the game never flags this internally or sets a precedent of this occuring in any other puzzle. I genuinely don't understand how players are epxected to know this and I think it makes for a weak puzzle in the end.

												As much as I wanted to enjoy Kairo, I simply could not. There is nothing redeeming about it, in my opinion. The puzzles require extreme moon logic to figure out, and I managed to get through the game with no real understanding of what I was doing. I blindly stumbled through, hoping against hope that at some point, the confusion would clear up. It did not. I ended the game more confused than I started it, with a healthy helping of disappointment and bitterness to boot. Some may call the graphics abstract, unique, or elegantly minimalist; I call them lazy. They look unfinished and bland, as if the developers simply couldn't be bothered to polish them, and tried to pass this off as artistic choice. There are tantalizing hints of a story that never emerges, only a few little morsels here and there which, like a can containing only three potato chips, provides just enough taste to make you want more, only to be disappointed that you can't have any more. And no, the ending doesn't make anything clearer, or anything of that nature. If anything it'll just confuse you more. I sincerely regret spending my time and money on this game.			"

												While Kario has some interesting puzzles, visuals, and architecture, it failed to keep me as an ""explorer"". After several minutes of ""where do I go next"" frustration while rerunning through bland empty corridors, I turned to a guide.The pacing feels awkward/slow (even with Shift/Sprint held down), the scattered collectables are unnecessary, and puzzle satisfaction is quickly tarnished as you trudge forward (or even worse - backtrack) down long corridors to the next puzzle.  Kario could still be complex and grand without the stairs, paths, and extra large rooms. The only thing which drove me to continue was my stubbornness to complete the game. "

Posted: January 27, 2015
												I just finished the game Kairo and I must say that I am disappointed. Let me tell you why:(Caution: minor spoilers ahead)First of all I expected a little more story. Sadly there is absolutely none. Before playing it I also thought that there's maybe a connection to the city Cairo in Egypt, but there is no connection at all (as far as I experienced it). The only ""clues"" you get in the game are some blurry pictures and unrecognizable audio tunes which serves no purpose. A deeper meaning? I doubt it. And for an art-project this seems all too random and poorly conceived. When I finished the game I was as smart as before. Mostly I didn't even know, what I was doing and for what purpose. Who build these puzzles and why? And why do I have to solve them? But that's my second point of criticism: the riddles.The riddles are sometimes too simple, and sometimes you don't have a clue what you should be doing and the game doesn't give you any hints regarding the puzzle. Some of these riddles I solved by pure luck, bashing buttons and trying it over and over again. Even after I finished some of these, I couldn't tell you how I solved it. But most of the riddles based just on pushing the right button at the right time. Not much fun and also not very clever for a puzzle game...And there are also rooms without any importance to the main riddle, but you can't recognize, which rooms are important and which are just ""corridors"" to other rooms. There is no clear path in this game. Some may call this ""concept"" or ""open world"", but I think the developers just had not enough time (or talent) to generate a clear guideline for the player. And that is my third point of criticism: the level design.All you do in this game is walk. And walk. And walk. After playing it a few hours, I constatly use the ""sprint""-key, just to get where I want to, faster. Because every room is enormous and vast. At first this is actually cool, but after a few riddles it is just annoying. Yeah, I understand - big landscapes: cool! But the levels don't include too many details and it's getting boring. concrete wall on concrete wall. So here's my final point of criticism: the look of the game.Sure, this is not a AAA-game by some major game developer, but the game looks like it's from 1995. The rooms and places look too clean and dull, there's no life or fun in these corridors and halls. So the walking gets very frustrating, because you walk through dull rooms all the time, solving very easy (or ""what-the-hell-do-I-have-to-do"") puzzles without even knowing what purpose for... And the end screen (which appears very soon) gives you no solution what you just accomplished.One good thing in Kairo is the soundtrack. It is deep and athmospheric and it prevents the game to get even more boring.So all in all I was disappointed. The game was indeed too short (6 hours), but because I got sick of running around in circles I was happy when the end screen appeared. The game would surely be better, if there actually was a story or maybe even a connection to the city of Cairo. I could even imagine a game about the political / social struggle in Egypt and the history and the culture of Cairo. Unfortunate, Kairo had potental, but the poor game design and the absence of story just killed the whole game.			"

												Typically I don't mind the so-called ""Walking Simulators"". In fact I enjoy the genre quite a great bit. Unfortunately, Kairo is too cryptic for its own sake. There is no clue of any potential mystery to unravel, no bread-crumbs. I guess one may argue that a simple ""WTF?"" can be considered a call to explore, but with barren art direction, simplistic level design, boring textures and lighting, an hour was about as much as I had patience for before uninstalling.

												I have to write a review for this game while it's fresh in my mind.  Kairo is every bit as fun and eerie as you would want a 3D puzzle game to be.  Do yourself a favor and play this game alone and uninterrupted for a full immersive feel.  There are no verbal cues - as in you will never have another character speak to you, and you will never hear your own character talk.  There aren't any written cues or instructions beyond symbols you find (and of course the gentle hints in your menu screen, should you need them).  It's all about using the landscape and the machines and puzzles to your advantage - to a visual person like me, this was a wonderful experience.  Each different area in the game has its own color scheme and chosen background music and sounds from one of the game's tracks (the music is great for the game and ranges from ""Fairly soothing and enlightening"", to ""I feel like someone just shoved ice down the back of my shirt"").  In terms of graphics, it's not exactly, say, ""Skyrim"" in terms of detail or texture - but that honestly works well for the game.  The maker of this game knew what he was doing and while it's a little rough around the edges in some regards (I guess) the game is -solid- in the graphics department to me.  It feels like the great machines are actually working next to you.  That you're standing next to sources of great power, or that you're standing next to a row of...  Well you'll see (I really do love the architecture in some parts).  I completed the main storyline and some of the extra content without any help, but admit that I did need some help from the Steam Community to unlock the rest (there is one particular ""bonus"" puzzle that actually demands that you seek outside help in order to solve it).  Lastly I want to talk about the storyline - There is a lump that forms in the pit of your stomach once you start realizing where this game is going and the gravity of what has already happened and the gravity of what you might actually be doing.  It was mentioned already, but once you're done with the game (as it contains heavy spoilers), check out ""The Secret of Kairo"" on Electron Dance's blog if you want to read into some good theories behind the game.

												Playing the game actually reminds me of ""Excerpts from Expert Judgement on Markers to Deter Inadvertent Human Intrusion into the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant"", which you can google and peruse at your leisure. What they talk about on the site is: after we dump a bunch of nuclear waste somewhere and seal it off, how do we signal to future generations that they should stay away? Given that the half-life of the waste in question is 10,000 years, about as long as recorded history, this poses a significant problem: how do we communicate with people who will likely be nothing like us, and have a very limited understanding of our language, society and history; how do we tell them that they should not hang out in or excavate this nuclear waste dump? The expert judgers come up with a series of sculptural and architectural edifices, things that imply danger and will last millennia, and each one is more bizarre, desolate and brutal than the last. A lot of what I see and do in Kairo feels like I'm interacting with someone's answer to that kind of question (although not about nuclear waste, specifically), which is extremely cool. It doesn't hurt that the puzzles are very good. Gameplay is mostly about observation, testing interactions and figuring out how things work. It's kind of like Riven in that regard, and so far I haven't run up against any versions of classically lazy puzzles. Which is to say: no sliding tile puzzles, no finding the bauble and sticking it into the mcdooly, no one-on/one-off puzzles where you try to get everything to sync up as on or off. The first step of every puzzle is figuring out its rules and its pieces, and then trying to understand what the end goal is. It's all very seamless, very understated, and very rewarding.Highest recommendation.			"

												I was honestly surprised by this game. I tend to have a love for indie exploration games, but this turned out to be so much better than that. You know that feeling, when you just want to keep playing to see what's next? Well I haven't felt this in a long time, but I certainly did with Kairo. What is it? It's a first person puzzle game, with an amazing narrative, that is told without a single word spoken. I don't want to spoil it, but the game really turns out to be much, much more than you expected. The mechanics work pretty well, some puzzles are easy, some are hard as hell (the ones you need for a secret ending for example). Kudos to the developer, this is truly an amazing work of art. Would I recommend it? Definitely. I really didn't expect myself to love this game so much. But I did. And so should you.			"

												It's hard to decide whether to give this game a recommendation or not. I liked it, but this game is absolutely not for everyone. Its very artsy, which will be a turnoff for some. There are environmental type puzzles to solve -- and sometimes it is not at all clear what to do. The graphics don't get any better than the screenshots.  The game has a science fiction vibe, but it's more of an atmospheric game; not a lot of plot as such.If you like exploring, and like a sci-fi type atomosphere, and don't mind a game that is artistic rather than traditionally fun, you might enjoy the game. I did. But that was a long list of qualifiers.			"

In BriefKairo is a narrative without words painting a picture of aloneness on a canvas made of staggeringly large geometry.Most valuable resource: The art.Of interest to: people who appreciate geometric abstraction, and like deeply mysterious Myst-style puzzlers.I have never before played a game with such an incredible feeling of scale.  The place is enigmatic, it is stunning but, more than anything else, it is *overpoweringly huge*.  Figuring out what you are supposed to be doing is part of the experience of this game, so don't be put off by what appears at the outset to be random acts of geometry.  There is meaning and purpose to this place; it just takes some time to start to piece it together.  This is a different kind of narrative.For me the strangest part of the experience of Kairo is that at the outset you are in a place of geometry and void, with no personality or sense of place; you are cast adrift with no instructions whatsoever, completely alone in a place which amplifies aloneness.  You aren't even sure what the game is, let alone what the game world is all about.  But by the end you feel like you know this place, you understand it, it is familiar and you are at home here - which, given the way the game ends, is the ultimate irony.There is a story here, but one told without words, and it is a magnificent story of great scale and great aloneness, and it is masterfully told.

The player instantly understands what a puzzle is about when they start trying to solve it. The game has a certain charm about it that I love.Also the default controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥ make sure the sensitivity is waaaaay down. Even if it is, expect major frame rate drops during puzzle rooms and ESSPECIALLY in the Lighthouse Hub (the 2nd picture), It wasn't even over 30 fps at times in that room.Great game, 8.5/10, needs better controls and better performance.

												The approach to wether to buy this game is fairly simple: Look at the screenshots. State how they breathe with atmosphere and probably form something like a desolate first person puzzle exploration game filled with mysteries. Play the video and confirm that assumption. Well, I was sold and Kairo didn't disappoint at all. It's not a long game but then again it's not an expensive game either. If you enjoy the kind of mystical immersement games like Myst or Antichamber convey you will enjoy Kairo as much as I do. You get dropped in the game world with not a single clue whatsoever on where you are, why you're there or what you should do. It's up to your creativity and will to explore to find every secret this place has got to offer. Great music, great graphics and logical puzzlesolving.A mild spoiler but also a fair warning: There's just that one puzzle that's really annoying and obtuse compared to the rest of the game (almost at Fez-proportions) and you'll probably just have to google that one or try to solve it at random. So if you stumble upon a yellow chamber with clocks, don't despair. Things will become better afterwards. "

												NaissanceE and Kairo share many stylistic and gameplay similarities.  Both prominently feature first-person exploration of vast, compelling brutalist architecture, monochromatic visuals (frequently, but not always greyscale), a profound sense of isolation, a deliberately ambiguous plot and practically-undefined protagonist, as well as an overarching dreamlike quality to the entire experience.Where NaissanceE is primarily exploration and platforming with some occasional light puzzle-solving, Kairo is primarily exploration and puzzle-solving with some occasional light platforming.Most of Kairo's puzzles are thoughtful and reveal their answers with observation and consideration.  There were certainly a few that were much less complicated than I made them out to be, some that felt like simple trial and error, but a couple were obscure enough that I eventually resorted to searching out the answer.  (Ugh, the wheels of shapes!)  Fortunately, you're usually given a few puzzles at a time to work on in whatever order you choose.  There are also some extra-credit puzzles that unlock the super-secret ending that lays bare the true meaning of the bizarre mechanisms you set in motion throughout the game.While NaissanceE has a handful of video-game and pop-culture references, Kairo isn't afraid to give a nod and a wink to other games.Steam says I've got about 5 hours into Kairo, and I feel like I was able to explore the gameworld pretty thorougly in that time.  Since I got it on sale for less than $1.50, I'd say that was easily worth the price of admission.			"

But by the end you feel like you know this place, you understand it, it is familiar and you are at home here - which, given the way the game ends, is the ultimate irony.There is a story here, but one told without words, and it is a magnificent story of great scale and great aloneness, and it is masterfully told.

												Very fun atmospheric puzzle game, in the same vein as Myst.  Puzzles are abstract and often require a flash of insight, but never feel nonsensical.  Environments are monochromatic and bleak, but in a way that comes off as ominous instead of bland.  The backstory is told in only a few scattered pieces of scenery, and left to interpretation.The main game can be reasonably completed without ever looking at a guide, but you'll have to in order to 100% (one of the puzzles gives each player only one part of the solution and is literally impossible to figure out alone).

Combined with the magic of Tele-I mean PC gaming, the intimate experience of touching ancient, gothic structures will be combined with a tiny bit of animated magic.I can only imagine how it would feel with an Oculus.

												Kairo is so awesome it's... well, awesome. It's immersive, enjoyable, and has a lot of meaning.A lot of the fun of Kairo actually comes from after you put the game down and spend time away from the computer, turning what you've learned over and over in your head. An unequivocable 10 out of 10 experience.			"

												I liked it, it had a weird metaphoric feel to it. I have no real idea what it's a metaphor for though. I read the name has to do with the oldest city in Egypt and the Planet Mar. It seemed like there was some Gnoesis imagery and allegories in it. 6.5/10 didn't understand still enjoyed the journey. I may edit this after I get the ""true ending"".			"

												Possibly the weirdest thing I've come across. That's no bad thing. The level design is stunning and often makes you feel insignificant, the puzzles are challenging and require a decent amount of thought, but also aren't impossibly hard. But above all, the mystery in this game is it's strong point. It leaves you to think about what it could possibly be trying to show you, and never explains anything. That's why it's so interesting. For the price, this game is definitely worth your attention.			"

It looks awesome, plays awesome, sounds awesome, and really makes you think and search and solve all through the game.The puzzles this game throws at you aren't for the people who just want to rush through a game, they're to be figured out. Analysed. Understood. I won't lie, I used the community tab guides for help on some, especially the serets, but I enjoyed it so much still.Games like this are the pinnacle of a good indie game. It shows that you don't need lots of money, or voice actors, or big development teams to make a great game. I strongly recommend this			"

												This is about as simple as a puzzle game gets. There are no instructions or notes to read - only those you make yourself.However, I figured out everything except for the secret ending without any outside help. First, note that it is practically impossible to get truly stuck. Yes, you may be unable to solve a puzzle, but you cannot break anything so that it is unsolvable, and you cannot get trapped anywhere. I encountered no glitches at all, which is definitely a plus.There is an in-game hints system, which I do recommend using. Be prepared for some backtracking (the game makes this easier later on), and to write down everything. Some things look like puzzles but aren't. Some puzzles can be solved through a simple trial-and-error approach, others require finding the clue or simple logic.I say ""simple"", though there are a couple of rather fiendish puzzles in here. Investigate everything. Try everything. Like I said, this game is impossible to break.There is no save button, the game simply saves when you quit - which made me a little nervous but always worked as intended. There is no way to return to an earlier save, but there is also no reason to want to; unless you want to solve the puzzles again, in which case you should start a new game.If you like puzzles, don't want your hand held, and find the screenshots intruging, you will likely enjoy Kairo.

												Firstly, I had my eye on this game, I usually like puzzle games. So I bought it during a sale, for less than one euro. I've played it for a little more than an hour, I don't think I'll be coming back to it. I don't really know how to review this game. It's... a game, I guess. You walk around in large chambers, sometimes in the void. You solve puzzles that are not at all clear, and if you haven't played it for a while and try to pick it up again, you can easily start to backtrack without even realizing it. There is no story, no clear objective, and not anything that really should attract you to keep playing it. But it still has something that draws me too it. Something that makes me want to keep trying, something that wants me to spend a couple of more hours in its foggy empty void. The feeling is not enought to make me actually keep playing it, the environments are not captivating enough and the non-existant story/objective is certanily not enough. So I will uninstall it. But this game had some potential, and considering I spent next to nothing on it, got a few cents back from card drops and it has steam achievements I will still recommend it. Perhaps you will too feel this strange urge to keep playing, and just perhaps you will actually like it enough to keep on playing.			"

												A decent lengthed puzzle game, not much else to say. The puzzles aren't easy but aren't difficult, and can usually be figured out without the hints in the pause menu. The soundtrack and atmosphere was eerie and the look of the game fit with it, regardless of being extremely undetailed. The simplicity isn't really that big of a deal, you can look past it and it's a good look for the game. The exploring was sort of linear, as I found every place I went to had a purpose and it wasn't so much of a ""return here later because you didn't do something yet"" which I personally like, as aimless wandering especially in puzzle games can be annoying. For an extremely indie game and for a very low price (I got it for like under a dollar), it's definitely worth your time. Achievements are fun to go back and get as well. For me personally optimization isn't all too good, I kept the detailing stuff off to make it run smooth (My setup can run GTA at Ultra, so take that how you will), but I can't complain as the dev is obviously not that experienced. I felt like the puzzles could've been a little more challenging and maybe the story actually developed into something (I felt like there was a story as to what the places you were at are, but nothing was ever explained), but regardless it was a good game and was definitely fun to play through.Give it a try, it's worth it.7.5/10 "

												This is a somewhat hesitating recommendation.  This is very much the kind of thing that I like, exploring old ruins and solving puzzles.  It's very beautiful, and has a nice aural landscape too, I suppose the aspect I don't like is that you have to explore every inch of the thing.  There are tiny runes etched into the rock in hidden areas that you must find, and it gets boring before then end.But it is good, just maybe don't try to play it all at once or everything will start blending together.

												A wonderfully cryptic game. Kairo's world is a foreboding, mysterious and somewhat creepy place, yet one that will reside in your memory for a long time.The gameplay is largely based on exploration and relatively straightforward puzzle-solving, and the game does not take a whole lot of time to finish.Despite the apparently 'cold' exterior, Kairo actually builds to a poignant ending - if you have the time to explore all of the secrets and secret rooms, and can put the pieces together, you will be rewarded with an interesting implied narrative. Note that the game has no exposition at all, so it's all very subtle.The answer does not lie within the secret ending - it lies in all of the game. Kairo is worth the time and the little money it asks, especially if you're into adventure and first-person puzzlers.			"

												I unfortunately got this game just days before it went on sale, but at full price it still felt like an amazing deal.  Imagine LSD: Dream Emulator but texturally subdued and transformed into a relatively linear puzzle game, with just a dash of the Assassin's Creed 2 glyph sequences for flavor.The graphics and designs of the game are unimpressive, but not uninentionally so.  The minimalism of both the visuals and the music create a complexly desolate atmosphere, and, like LSD, the emptiness of the world never comes off as a result of laziness but of tasteful restraint.  It's easy to fill a puzzle game with distracting elements that intrude on the experience as a whole, but it's refreshing to see one that makes an enjoyable experience using only movement controls and basic graphics.In the vein of games like Fract OSC, Antichamber, The Devil's Tuning Fork, and Against the Wall, this is a game that does not hold the player's hand at any point and does not even provide any form of communication or instruction to the player until the ending, allowing for total uninterrupted exploration, and the game is intuitive enough to keep going at a steady pace regardless.  This makes sense in an internal way, as well, as the game is set in a long abandoned universe in which the player is a complete stranger.The ending is a bit cheesy and the sequences that reveal the world's story are unoriginal at best.  I was also unimpressed by the various photographs and videos that attempted to connect Kairo to Earth, which appear incessantly throughout the game just incase the message wasn't received the first few times.  In a puzzle game that involves some amount of thought in order to progress, this felt patronizing and undermined the feeling that the game developer trusts the player to make the connections themselves.  The alien and deserted tone of the game was also diminished by this forced message, which left me wishing that the game had remained mysterious and totally detached from the real world like it initially appeared.  It seems as if the game was created first, but in the later stages of development the developer decided to tack a deeper story onto the game, conflicting with the original vision for the project.Bland connotations aside, I didn't expect to spend nine hours in this game, and it says something about Kairo that I can spend a day backtracking through every area multiple times in order to unlock the achievements and the secret ending and still have fond memories of the experience (even if the secret ending was a massive disappointment).Ultimately, I would recommend this game if you want something that has a poweful and moving atmosphere, but if you're just looking for a puzzle game then look elsewhere, as the puzzles here aren't as memorable as the overarching experience.

												Ever since I started playing this game, I have been plagued by unspeakable nightmares. Such horrific phantasms that cannot be adequately described by human beings have ravished my every sleeping moment. I can't fully describe the horror, but I will do my best.My dreams all start with me standing on a throne pedestal, overseeing nothing but a building off to the left and a tall tower to the right. As i enter the building, it plays the beginning of the game through my head, sometimes doing puzzles out of order, finding odd things wrong with them, like looking behind a pillar for the symbols and finding Trollfaces there instead. But all my dreams end the same way. Everything starts turning all grainy and fuzzy, and suddenly I can't move, and a giant red rhombus starts licking the right side of my nose and I can't get away.Damn that red rhombus.Then I'm being chased  through something like a chinese restaurant except everything is blue and on the ceiling, and nothing's chasing me, but a waterfall of chicken noodle soup keeps raining down from the sky, except its not chicken noodle soop. I don't know. And then, God starts slapping me back and forth across the face, yelling some bizarre phrase over and over that seems to make a lot of sense but i can never remember what he said.Then I fall back into the game, and the red rhombus (damn that red rhombus), starts chasing me while punching a pair of my old tennis shoes, or some other object from my house. Sometimes i wake up at that point, but other times I end up in what could only be described as cowboy hell where I'm tormented by something like Johnny Cash and yodelling cacti for a while, and then right before the earth-sized cake from Portal is about to crush me, I wake up.The full horror of these dreams cannot be expressed fully through these feeble attempts.∞/√-3 would walk lonely and blindly through an abandoned ghost world again			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I absolutely love ""artsy"" games like this. However, there were several problems that tainted the experience for me.Puzzles - They are counter-intuitive. While some puzzles make sense and are easy to figure out, others don't. For example, the puzzle at the back of the light house where you step on certain blocks seemed entirely random.Movement, view, and mouse control - The extremely smooth movement in combination with narrow point of view made me feel sick to my stomach within 10 minutes. The lag between when I moved my mouse in comparison to when the character moved certainly didn't help, but that may have just been caused by my machine.Broken pause menu - Again, this may have just been my machine, but during the pause menu, there was no way to select any options. I could only exit the pause menu by hitting escape. When I wanted to quit the game, I had to alt-tab and force close it. Being able to access the options may have been able to fix my previous complaint.Empty textures - Textures and objects seemed empty and incomplete. I know that is the art style this game is going for, but it still seems very unpolished.Sound - In games like this, sound effects and music need to take advantage of the atmosphere. I found most of the sound effects were cheesy and took away from the experience. For example, the cheap MIDI gong sound whenever you made progress in a puzzle is just awful. A lot of the time, there was too much silence, or just unvarying static, that could have benefited greatly with ambient music. During the few moments that ambient music was present, it seemed immaturely written and distracting.I think that covers about everything I found poorly done in this game. Luckily, I bought it on sale and obtained a foil card so I have already made my money back. I really do want to enjoy this game and am disappointed that I didn't, since it seems like an interesting idea and I liked the lonely atmosphere. I will try it again if/when there is ever an update to see if any of these issues were fixed.			"

												Amazing atmosphere. This game is great and well worth its low price. It is eery and creepy, but in a very subtly and artful way. I cannot recommend this game enough. It's like walking through modern art.TL;DR: Imagine if the TATE Museum and Portal had a child.			"

												The concept is interesting, but the graphics are crude. The atmosphere is immersing, but the controls are not. The architecture makes you wonder, but the puzzles and scenery progression tell no story whatsoever.There is no coherence or flow; some puzzles are BAD (looking at you, Pi), the hints are abrupt and without any subtlety. The interaction is poor. Walking up stairways gives headaches from the camera motion; too close to walls and you see through them. Strange things in the scenery prompt questions, but nothing around intends to answer them.There is a mystery surrounding Kairo, and it is: ""why am I still playing?""			"

												Really beautiful to look at and walk through, and the weird creepy-pasta headache inducing effects are interesting (and optional!), but the puzzles frankly just got more and more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t until I gave up on the entire enterprise. The first few seem clever but at one point the game (which is first-person with bad swimmy camera effects) adds in a jumping puzzle and a timed running section that just have no place in a game like this and I lost patience with it. Not as clever as it initially comes off to be and not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. If you beat Myst this will only be a challenge because some of the puzzle solutions are absolutely ridiculous.			"

												Kairo game has really poor level design. It's not minimalism or something. It's just ugly. Levels have all common mapper's mistakes like bad lights and incorrectly aligned textures. Although I saw it from video and screenshots, I still hoped that Kairo has interesting puzzles and enthralling atmosphere, but it does not. Puzzles are just random or inane and your character's physics make their solving even worse. Player movements are slow and clunky. It looks like first project of author and the main problem is that the game is sold for money. Seriously, I would forgive the most flaws if game was free. Most, but still not all. I played many free games/mods/mappacks created by enthusiasts that have much better level design, atmosphere, storyline, puzzles, etc. And all they look like authors actually endeavored to make their creations better. I can't say same about Kairo. If you still bought this game, don't forget to change settings: remove this waste ""grained effect"" and unacceptable ""look smoothing"". Also don't forget to increase FOV (Field Of View), it seems like author does not know that many players feel sickness and headache because of small FOV.			"

												The ambiance is pretty impressive and everything looks good, but for a puzzle game, I feel it falls short. 50% to 80% of the puzzle’s I’ve come across have turned out to be completely illogical and merely require brute force… Not exactly the point of a puzzle. The objectives as you play are completely unstated, so I’ve resorted to using a game walkthrough I don’t feel that it has improved or harmed the quality of gameplay. Meh. Not really worth the money.			"

												So, yeah, how do I describe Kairo?First, the puzzles. While they start out easy, later in the game, they are really counter intuitive(At least the devs had the idea of including hints).I was stuck on the last ""world"", not even because I was stuck on a puzzle, but I simply didn't knew what puzzle was left to do.Not to mention the optional puzzles that lead to the secret ending(which is just stupid and feel more like a filler than rewarding) are even harder and are simply undo-able without a guide. Also, they require backtracking.The graphics are both basic and good, and the game run very well on low end computers(Even with shaders on). Though the environments are sometimes too lazy and blocky. The ambient music is also great, and give a mood to each ""room"".The ""story""... Okay, I just don't get it. Kairo use a lot of morbid symbols, post-apocalyptic pictures, etc, but it never feel more than an assemblage of tropes(""Oh, look how creepy is this place! So creppy, huh???"") rather than a mysterious story. So don't buy this game for the story.In short, if you are okay with using a guide/the hints for the puzzles, then you could buy it.			"

The chambers are HUGE (in a bad way) and that makes you just walking around. There are literally chambers where you have to go simply on the other side. Thats it.

The way Kario creates puzzle solving completely through player movement is pure genius, and the odd machines and structures of this world are awe-inspiring.  The world of Kario will be in my mind forever, even if I don't know it.  I haven't have any dreams about it yet, but I'm sure there there will be remanants of it, deliberate and accidental, in everything I do from now on.Purely moving, disturbing, and amazing.			"

												Astonishingly aesthetic. I can't say 'beautiful', but aesthetic it is. Grotesque and gigantic scale, rough surfaces and brilliant presentation of empty space. This is pure art - you getting concrete feeling of empty space (pun intended), visualization of nothingness and monolithness.Sound environment and indirect interactions make it bewitching and slightly frightening, like you suddenly got eye-to-eye with something which is too big to grasp.Puzzles are not 'puzzles' in terms of 'solving', but in terms of 'finding the puzzle'. Understand the rules of interaction, find patterns in that interaction, and only after that solve it. Solving is not main part, recognition is.The best game without human narrative I ever saw.			"

												Well, that was probably the most engrossed I've been in a game for a while.  It takes me right back to ""Driller"" or its sequel ""Far Side"" which, used ""Freescape"", an early 3D, to evoke alien and unusual environments.   Unlike those two early games, Kairo gives no backstory, and lets you attempt to figure it out for yourself. I love it...The whole game is extremely minimalist in its level design, but extremely evocative of space and alienness.  The aesthetics are a mix of old and new:  blocky, simplistic but with texture mapping, reflections, fog, flames and more.  The overly simplistic design may deter some who would dismiss the game as dated, but anything more complex would start to get in the way of the narrative.It may not have been the designer's ""point"", but the simplicity of the environment allows you to completely ignore it, and focus more on playing the game.  And playing may not be the best definition either:  experience, discover, enjoy are also great definitions for this.The beginning makes it look like you'll be exploring ancient egyptian ruins (albeit in a dreamy world of whiteness), before  abruptly turning grey and industrial-feeling.  The game continues to take turns and each area feels and plays a lot different.The only time that the simplicity works against the game is when an area is more complex than it looks. After traversing a dozen empty corridors, and passing stray cubes, you may not realise that another grey unmarked stray cube is, in fact, a trigger for some action, and be left puzzling for a while.  Such ""difficulty through obscurity"" is a hard one to balance right, to be honest, so I'll let it off, mostly.I think the thing I enjoy most about Kairo is that it really plays with our preconceptions of what a 3d puzzle game is.  They jokingly call one of their achievements ""Locked Door Puzzle"" as a nod to other more mainstream games.I really enjoyed playing Kairo, and then with the help of a cheat to find all the secrets.. A great minimal game.  If you do decide to play it, don't try and speed-run it.  although it looks shallow and simplistic, there are a lot of hidden (or just obscure) tidbits for the explorer. "

												I was completely blown away by this game given it's price and the fact that it appears, from the screenshots, to be something created in a few hours, but don't let that fool you, this game is one of the best examples of game design I've ever seen.Atmosphere/Story/Game World I can honestly say I don't think I've ever played a game with half as much atmosphere as Kairo, and the fact that it does it with the most basic of graphics, no voice acting, no back story, no cinematics, and no supporting characters is astounding. Everything, the soundtrack, the mysterious, blocky architecture, the vast empty spaces, the grain filter over everything, even the floaty controls, all of it feels deliberate and just drips with atmosphere and conveys the story in a way that is far more compelling than any amount exposition ever could be. It is so immersive, if you allow it to be, that it will actually make the hair on your neck and arms stand on end and your skin crawl, in a good way, even for someone who dislikes the entire horror genera. You know you're alone but you just can't shake the feeling that something is off, that you're being watched. I imagine this is exactly how you'd feel if you were exploring an empty, foreign world in real life. It taps straight into your human nature, you have this creepy feeling but you have to keep going, you have to learn more about this world and what happened. Truly amazing.There are some bugs or places where it isn't as polished as some titles. The biggest issue is that can see through geometry when you stand right next to it. There were also some places that I wasn't sure if there was a graphical error or just a design choice. Mainly places that seemed like there was a floor, I could walk and jump, but I appeared to be walking in space. Overall pretty polished.Puzzles/Exploration Yet another place where Kairo shines. None of the main puzzles are that hard, you may need the hints in the menu for one or two, but the way that they are presented is the epitome of good puzzle design. The full extent of each puzzle is usually not fully apparent when you enter a room but the game does a brilliant job of ""teaching"" you the rules as you try and solve it. You probably won't solve it the first time but the penalty for failing is very small, basically just starting over, a few seconds lost at most, but you should have learned something new about the puzzle and will do better the next time. Sometimes you need to explore to find a hint in the environment, other times you just have to start interacting and see what happens. Besides the puzzles used to advance through the world there are a number of optional puzzles and objectives that you can choose to complete. There are 18 hidden glyphs, your basic exploration collectables, 4 seals in hidden rooms, and 3 extra puzzles, much harder, with clues scattered across the world but aren't explained. From what I've heard these puzzles were designed as sort of community puzzles, where players collaborated and shared findings to discover the answers together. It was probably pretty fun after launch but at this point you may need to look up the old threads to solve them, or at least get some hints. Theses extras aren't needed to complete the game but some of them can add a little (vague) context to the story.Summery Kairo is a buy, no questions asked. It's the perfect length, the puzzles are intuitive and fun to solve, and the world and atmosphere are something every gamer should experience, doubly so if you are, or are interested in becoming, a game developer.

												The world of Kairo may be unsettling for some. I found a sort of, unclear affection to it. Not quite a ""game"" in the traditional sense, not quite an art experiment. Kairo falls deep within harmony of those two descriptions, offering a very reflective, interactive experience that very rarely seen in this age. Despite the frequent use of a single color palette per area, each environment is unique and will stay in your mind hours after leaving them. The simple yet gratifying gameplay will leave a lasting impression even after you finish this interactive poem.But for me personally, the pure yet intricate sound design and tranquil soundtrack still peer into my thoughts daily. This piece of art will always stand out for me as one of the most surreal and hypnagogic experiences I encountered in any medium. I cannot recommend Kairo enough.			"

												A very dry game. The puzzles aren't very rewarding, they leave you with a feeling 'of oh thank god thats over' when you complete them which only leads you into a new 'oh ♥♥♥♥ this thing' situation.The atmosphere is . . . geometrical. I think they were trying for a mysterious egypt alien feel or something with the constant boxes etherial sounds though it overstays it's welcome very quickly and you are then left with a textureless environment with backround noise switching from ambient to blairing speaker feedback depending on where you are. There is no story and I couldn't force myself to finish the game after the first hour and a half so I will never know if there is a reason I was even doing these almost mindless tasks. But as far as I played there wasn't a single semblence of dialouge or story.Overall, for a game produced by one man it isn't the worst thing to ever come out, but the fact that it WAS entirely coded by one person should key you in on the quality of the product. Compare it to any other game and it is terrible.You will not be happy if you spend money on this game, don't buy . . . seriously, just don't.			"

												Let me first say that if you are expecting Kairo to be something along the lines of Myst, Riven or, for that matter, any challenging puzzler, do not buy. The puzzles lack depth, complexity, and do not require deep thinking in order to discover the solution. They feel like an afterthought and I think the developer intentionally designed them so to make the experience in Kairo more fluid. As you may have read, Kairo is a minimalist exploration game (though it's more of an abstract art gallery simulator). Meaning you can only walk, run, and jump. Your interaction with machines is restricted thus partially explaining the lack of depth in some of the puzzles. No in game button prompts. Nothing out of the Kairo's context distracts you, save the notification that informs you've solved a puzzle. It's all for the purpose of pulling you deep into Kairo's world full of abstract architecture and objects with strange behavior that apparently defies physics. The fine grain filter and errie soundtrack assist in attempting to build an absorbing atmosphere.Except I felt a disconnect for some reason. None of the abstract architectures (nor the atmosphere) evoked any feelings. No texts located anywhere to provide some backstory. Perhaps (and I'm not sure) some story could be deciphered (or interpreted) but the game gave me no reason or motivation to invest the effort into it. Even during the conclusion when Kairo's purpose was hinted at, no tingle of emotion. In my opinion, you can approach this game like you approach a strange dream right after waking up, either invest the energy to interpret it and derive personal meaning or instantly forget about all the vague disjointed images. If you're the former or if the idea of an abstract art gallery simulator sounds appealing, then maybe Kairo might be for you. However, if you are looking for something with cohesion and a game that gradually unfolds a story with clarity (or a challenging puzzler as talked about in first paragraph) then I would defintely pass this one up.

												Graphics:I could not shake off the feeling that all those duplicated cubes with the exact same texture were not a bold artistic design, but rather a result of laziness. Overall it felt extremely cheap --- You could say that it's fitting since the game is really cheap. That last remark aside, I would have preferred a smaller, but more polished world.Puzzles:The puzzles are never really satisfying to solve. There are mostly button-pressing chores, that you find yourself solving for not particular reasons. After playing for a while, I just wanted to get done with them as quickly as possible, which I guess defeats the purpose of the game...			"

												Great game overall, but I didnt like the atomsphere the game was trying to accomplish. Sure its wierd, lonely, myserious and all that. I just wasnt a fan of the 1/6 of scary atmosphere. The graphics dont really tie together for me. Maybe I just dont like the graphics idk. The puzzles were pretty neat. And one last note, this may not be for other people but this game is very graphic intensive. i tried running 1920 x 1080 on a $1200 computer. Decked out with a gtx 760. it ran really choppy. In the end i had to lower my resolution. Keep in mind I can run very graphic intensive games and they look alot better than this game. i just dont understand why these graphics arent even that complex yet it takes so much to run it decently.

												A very dry game. The puzzles aren't very rewarding, they leave you with a feeling 'of oh thank god thats over' when you complete them which only leads you into a new 'oh ♥♥♥♥ this thing' situation.The atmosphere is . . . geometrical. I think they were trying for a mysterious egypt alien feel or something with the constant boxes etherial sounds though it overstays it's welcome very quickly and you are then left with a textureless environment with backround noise switching from ambient to blairing speaker feedback depending on where you are. There is no story and I couldn't force myself to finish the game after the first hour and a half so I will never know if there is a reason I was even doing these almost mindless tasks. But as far as I played there wasn't a single semblence of dialouge or story.Overall, for a game produced by one man it isn't the worst thing to ever come out, but the fact that it WAS entirely coded by one person should key you in on the quality of the product. Compare it to any other game and it is terrible.You will not be happy if you spend money on this game, don't buy . . . seriously, just don't.			"

												This is a ""boring"" game, and I liked it. It is essentially a puzzle/exploration game where you have the most minimalistic controls. The puzzles are challenging, but more than that this game is more of an ""experience"" than a challenge. The ominous and almost spiritual music gives this game a kind of mesmerizing, depressing, uplifting, and unsettling feeling. A very surreal game to be sure, and one that I keep thinking about from time to time. Since the game is running so cheap as of the writing of this review I encourage anyone who says to themselves now and then ""I wanna play a game where I don't kill something"", just go ahead and give this a shot, even for an hour. Monument Valley meets Yume Nikki, this is one boring game I recommend, yes yes.			"

												Let me first say that if you are expecting Kairo to be something along the lines of Myst, Riven or, for that matter, any challenging puzzler, do not buy. The puzzles lack depth, complexity, and do not require deep thinking in order to discover the solution. They feel like an afterthought and I think the developer intentionally designed them so to make the experience in Kairo more fluid. As you may have read, Kairo is a minimalist exploration game (though it's more of an abstract art gallery simulator). Meaning you can only walk, run, and jump. Your interaction with machines is restricted thus partially explaining the lack of depth in some of the puzzles. No in game button prompts. Nothing out of the Kairo's context distracts you, save the notification that informs you've solved a puzzle. It's all for the purpose of pulling you deep into Kairo's world full of abstract architecture and objects with strange behavior that apparently defies physics. The fine grain filter and errie soundtrack assist in attempting to build an absorbing atmosphere.Except I felt a disconnect for some reason. None of the abstract architectures (nor the atmosphere) evoked any feelings. No texts located anywhere to provide some backstory. Perhaps (and I'm not sure) some story could be deciphered (or interpreted) but the game gave me no reason or motivation to invest the effort into it. Even during the conclusion when Kairo's purpose was hinted at, no tingle of emotion. In my opinion, you can approach this game like you approach a strange dream right after waking up, either invest the energy to interpret it and derive personal meaning or instantly forget about all the vague disjointed images. If you're the former or if the idea of an abstract art gallery simulator sounds appealing, then maybe Kairo might be for you. However, if you are looking for something with cohesion and a game that gradually unfolds a story with clarity (or a challenging puzzler as talked about in first paragraph) then I would defintely pass this one up.

												I was recommended this as a puzzle platformer on the same basis as the Talos Principle and Antichamber (both brilliant). This game does not live up to those expectations. This game lives up to an alpha-test of a 'possible' puzzle game, due for release in 12 months. Yet here it is...The overly simplistic architecture I can deal with, but the use of a single texture for the ENTIRE game belies an absence of effort, instead of a deliberate intent for purpose or artwork. Being dumped into the first level with nary an instruction or purpose left me wondering why I was even participating - after all, the art style doesn't convey any purpose to your wanderings. Progressing through the levels, pushing all the buttons didn't help either; I got the to rolling credits but still had no purpose for what I had just completed.Would not recommend. "

												As a puzzle-lover, I was really looking forward to this game since so many reviews compare it to other games I rather enjoyed, such as Anti-Chamber. However, I only got an hour into this game and was completely bored by it.The graphics look like they were made in the mid-90s; things like the original Unreal had higher poly counts than this does, and more graphical cohesion. Just about everything is done with blocks and the textures, in-as-much as they are even used, seem to be just tossed on to objects as almost an after-thought. Even ""water"" is just a bunch of disconnected rectangles. Rooms have seemingly random color selections, with almost everything being very monotone (a violet room, a red room, a grey room, etc.) There is no way to know if the fog means you'll fall, or you can walk on it (like the intro area). In fact, there's no way to know if a block is meant to be walked on or not except to try and see if you go through it or not.Gameplay is very simplistic. You can move, move faster (run) and jump and that is all of the controls. They have the option to do this all with the mouse, but since the game doesn't bind the mouse cursor, this doesn't work well with my 3 monitor set up since I jump out of the game the next time I click to start walking after turning around.Like everything else, the puzzles are very minimalistic. The ones I could find were very easy to solve. However, several of them you cannot even tell if they are puzzles or not... or even what you should be doing.


Red pedestal ""room"" 
A Screenshot of Kairo
By: Zolaerla




For example, in one (red) room in the second area, there are a bunch of pedestals that make sounds. If you look up, you see stars above them that have lines drawn on them from the last 4 pedestals... and no indication of what you should do. It has a triangle in the middle that is aligned and shaped without matching the stars, so there is no indication which of the many triangle shapes you should be making, or if that is even the correct thing to do. I spent probably 20 minutes making various triangles in that room, to no avail.In another area, there were what looked like a lot of pods that had screens on them. Most of the screens had static, but one showed a low-res version of what you were seeing, and a couple others showed something else. The significance of this place was totally lost on me.Also hidden in the game are tiny symbol things you can collect for... no known reason at all. They seem to largely be hidden in various rooms, so trying to collect those turns into the ""look very closely at every wall from every angle"" sort of thing... it was getting tedious.The ""world"" is also very minimal. It is just a bunch of separate ""rooms"" with portals connecting them. There is no real plot to be found, no idea why any of this exists, who you are supposed to be, or what the point is to ""solving"" the puzzles. It felt pointless, and not really rewarding for solving anything.			"

												Enigmatic and atmospheric. I really found myself enjoying this game. What Kairo lacks in graphical fidelity it makes up in sound design. The soundtrack meshes with the stark and rigidly geometric envirnment to convey a sense of place and meaning. The ""story"" of the game is very much open to interpretation but I thought it was poignant and dramatic. Pushing through the games puzzles - which, admittedly, at times were a little needlessly opaque - nevertheless gave me a real sense of purpose. It's wonderful that a game like this can be created through crowdfunding, and deliver such a hefty emotional punch despite such a small budget.			"

												I hate to give a negative review, mainly because I tried really hard to keep a positive view of Kairo, but eeehhhhhh.... no, sorry.  I will say, The environments you explore were pretty surreal (keep in mind it is minimalist on purpose), the atmosphere set thoughout the game is decent, and the music sets a good tone thoughout the game as well (minus it being looped quite often), but there isn't to much beef to the story (if you'd call it a story).First, for a developer to make a game based on the theme of ""leaving you in the dark,"" it must at least provide a basic foundation/world where you can glean some information to build lore and hypothesize; this of which Kairo provides barely any. This in turn nulls the whole mission to ""Slowly uncover the true purpose of Kairo and fulfil a great destiny."" Second, I encountered a lot of backtracking and ""nose-to-wall"" gameplay to get the achievements, which I figure isn't ideal for most people.Lastly, the main 'secret' achievement you strive for in the end totally destroyed the emmersion you've been plugged into throughout the game.If the game is on sale and you'd say that you're more artisticly thoughtful than the average person, by all means; but of your not, I'd save your dollars.

												There are lots of puzzles and it's a cool to see how some of these things can be implemented in vr as well. My problem lies in this statement, ""Why?"". I went in and went from one room to the next. I knew it was a puzzle game so I tried to ask myself what am I doing here. Where does this fit in. Why am I here? I think it needs to be said that if you don't have a purpose, there is no reason to do unnessary things. This game really lacks any kind of a draw to bother solving any of the puzzles. For these reasons I can't recommend it.For improvements I would recommend the following. A signal that let's you know you are done in an area. Some type of end goal, a map showing somewhere you want to go, a chest holding a key, something. Here's a puzzle for you. ""It is a lot like going to a museum that may have interesting things, but you don't know why any of the items are important and whenever you ask, your mom or dad just tells you to be quiet and don't touch anything.""

												I have only played the game for about an hour, and given that, I found it to be a very interesting game in that of its unique art style and its puzzles. The only thing that i can even come close to nitpicking (excuse me if I mispelled that), was a bit (and I mean VERY minor) amount of input lag. May have been the game, may not, who knows? Anyway, if you want something different from (Insert Action Game Title Here), this will definitely give you a new experience.			"

												This game is not primarily a puzzle game. There is so little to interact with on the map. The graphics are so simple and washed out.

												Just completed the game on 100% but only with DaAwesomeNerd's incredibly helpful walkthrough (some puzzles are just too abstract!). I absolutely loved the minimalist look, but with so much imagination and surrealism, I was hooked from the start. No two environments, rooms, or puzzles are the same. Combined with the eerie soundtrack from Wounds, I was lost in this universe. Highly recommended!			"

												This is a good game. But it had FAR MORE potential. It all felt like it was leading up to something really spectacular and then.. the end. That being said, I really, REALLY like what the end is all about, it just caught me off guard, that's all.I did really enjoy my time playing Kairo ^.^ It's all very smooth and I hardly found any of the puzzles too difficult. Perhaps the best thing about this game is the atmosphere it creates. I often didn't realize how much time was passing in the real world as I played it.There are some hidden bonuses to find after completing the game and those were fun to search for as well.			"

The soundtrack is amazing, the atmosphere is at times dark, at others mysterious and sometimes even wondrous, but always, always alien and strange.If I would critisise one thing it would be that I don't like the mouse acceleration, if there's an option to turn it off that I missed, I apologise for that.Also really easy to get 100% achievements if you care about that, though there's some backtracking to do it, not too bad however.There's also a secret ending ;)			"

												Honestly this game had potential, but it really feels like the developer said ""let's try making something deep because why not.""  I'd recommend it, except there are only a few actual puzzles.  Most of the time you walk back and forth and stare at objects in the game until something happens, or run through trial and error.  There were two areas that looked like really creative and challenging puzzles which was great, and I was stumped for a while and had to check the in game hints, only to be told the rooms didn't do anything and you should move on to the next one.  But wait, there's a secret ending gotten by collecting 18 glyphs throughout the game!  Maybe there is something more to this, maybe a better ending than floating into the sky with no resolution! Nope, don't waste your time, it's just a troll room.			"

												Kairo tries very hard in its presentation of abstract, atmospheric puzzles, but simply couldn't keep me invested in the world. Although I understand it is possible to ""make a point"" by crafting a game without a clear goal or narrative, the value of this was lost on me as I became more and more lost in the puzzles. I failed to glean any sense of satisfaction from this game, and instead walked away feeling frustrated. I did not enjoy the experience and would not reccommend it to others.			"

I can see how its abstract minimalism would be dream-like with oculus rift, however I'm still not compelled to explore such a low-quality ""mysterious"" world. There's no ""words"" and that's okay, but maybe if the narrative was less vague or if solving any of the ""puzzles"" in the game actually mattered, maybe then I would be interested in finding my way out of a maze or two.

Summary:  Interesting indie first-person puzzle game with terrible mechanics, its only redeeming quality is its unique atmosphere that is breathtaking modern art at times, but can be grating at others.Pros:Unique and thought provoking styling and ambianceUnique puzzles (some hard, others stupid easy)MinimalistGrand and wide open environmentsNostalgic 90s feel (at least to me)Cons:The intense color palette, sharp and grating sound effects, and an overall feeling of confusion makes the game interesting at first and then unpleasant Many of the puzzles are either confusing, super easy, or boringTerrible game engine (slow, buggy, see though walls and objects)Because the game is so grand and wide open you zoom around at 100mph across vast areas which is annoying at timesVery unpolishedFairly short Detailed review:  I played this game almost back-to-back with Qbeh-1, a first-person puzzle game in the same vein. It was a funny coincidence because, in juxtaposition, these games couldn’t be further opposites. Qbeh-1 fosters a zen relaxed feeling with blue skies, cool water, open spaces, majestic buildings, relaxing ambient music, and a feeling of smooth progression using hands-on puzzles with standard building blocks. Kairo on the other hand is a strange game with a surreal, Stonehenge, modern abstract,  David Smith Cubi [www.guggenheim.org] feeling with graphics reminiscent of the 90s era (reminded me of an old dos game called S.C.A.R.A.B.). It has an environment that is discomforting and disconcerting, trapping the player in dark psychedelic tombs and inorganic voids. The game uses harsh grating sound effects and music and surrounds the player with static filled screens, sharp abstract constructions, and bizarre features. There are no controls beyond the basic movement controls; every “action” is performed by stepping on tiles or otherwise bumping into the various features found within the giant rooms. Perfecting the feeling of being lost in an abstract void is a complete lack of storyline or instruction beyond a list of puzzle hints that can be found in the menu. In short, the game makes you feel like you’re traveling through the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey. It’s not bad, but I wouldn’t recommend it to just anyone as it would offend all but those who can appreciate a game that is little more than a virtual modern art gallery with simple puzzles separating each exhibit.

												In my opinoin, Kairo is an okay game. It tries to blend confusion and beauty, but ends up being a mess. Some puzzles are easy to solve, but others have no direction and are almost unsolvable if it weren't for google and the fourms.First, I'll start off with the puzzles. As I said, some are good brainteasers or just require good reflexes, but some made absolutely no sense. Sometimes I find myself scrambling around the current area looking for clues and hidden messages when the only task I have is to walk forward. Often, I find hidden messages that have no meaning, and I end up trying to figure out the purpose. Some harder puzzles had me pulling my hair out in frustration, which, in my opinion is okay. The problem is that I end up resorting to Google or the fourms for answers.Often, puzzles only reward you with more puzzles, sometimes harder, and sometimes easier. The difficulty in this game seems to be spontaneous, which is a mystery on its own. A lot of rooms have you walking for what seems like an eternity before giving you a clue, forcing you to glide back to the beginning and solve it.There are games that pull off this ""weird"" type of mystery, but Kairo doesn't have that sort of feel. It throws strangeness and puzzles together, and those usually don't mix well. I couldn't tell what could be part of the current puzzle, and what's part of the scenery. For example: Near the beginning of the game, I found a large obelisk in what seemed to be a desert themed room. When I got close to it, I could hear a male voice saying random numbers in French. What does that mean?! I had set my language setting to English (Yes, there is a language setting, even though there is BARELY any words spoken throughout the entire game), but the game insisted to speak French.Honestly, besides the few good puzzles this game has and the atmosphere it provides, I can't think of anything more that would make this game okay.Overall, Kairo's bad elements outweigh it's good ones. I have not completed this game, and I have no desire to, as I feel like it will be like the rest of the game: Quirky, weird, dark, and cryptic. Not worth the $5 I paid. 4/10			"

												First things first KAIRO is a straight up Puzzler.It isn't really anything else, especially barely a game of exploration.What i think is really good in that regard is that it doesn't seem to lock you into a puzzle.There is somewhat of an part exploration in the gameplay but it doesn't really reward you for it.Yes, i know you can find some kind of runes, however that isn't really what i want to be rewarded with when it comes to exploration.What i want from exploring a world is interesting and inspiring sites and views and in that regard Kairo is rather weak.One reason why i feel that way is simply taste. :-PThe overall world design is far to abstrcat for my taste, The structures in Kairo simply feel to artificial wich leads to me thinking ""well, yes, intersting design dear gamedesigner"" instead of loosing myself in the world and inspiring thougths like ""what may have happened here"" or ""i wonder what this once was"". On top of that many elements of the world look really rather unfitting in their surroundings instead of giving me the feeling that they are a naturall part of this structures., The design simply lacks a conclusive and whole overall direction.The second reason is that Kairo is really rather crude and unpolished. Don't get too close to the walls becasue the camera will clip trough the walls.Strange lighting effects that most likely weren't suppossed to be there or even look like the textures have been placed wrong are visible in the VERY FIRST rooms you will explore in the game.But the worst are the textures overall. They look really, really HORRIBBLE!It really pulls you out of the experience if you can count the pixels of what is suppossed to be cracks and holes in walls.The second weakness is Kairos Sonddesign or rather the lack thereoff. There are sounds and noises but they are more annoying then enriching and in many places sounds simply a re missing where there should have been some noice.If giant structures in the world are moving i shouldn't feel like they are made of Styrophor and have no weight to them. Wich is exactly what happens in Kairo.Kairo wants to be a minimalist thing but minimalistic doesn't mean low quality of assets and i feel that is what has been confused here when Kairo was designed.Would i recommend it?Nah, not really.There are several games on Steam right now that do what Kairo wants to achieve in a far better and much more polished way.There are Portal and Portal 2 (of course), Mind - Path to Talamus (wich i have only watched and not played yet) and more.And if you specifically look for a minimalist style there are NaissanceE, Antichamber and The Stanley Parabel.

												This is a game I desperately wanted to like.  At first I did, it was surreal and interesting to explore and wander.  Then the puzzles came.  Dear god, the puzzles.  Everything outside of the game made it seem as though the puzzles would be short and scarce throughout the game...  That is a lie!  The puzzles make about as much sense as something from a point-and-click adventure game.  The puzzle is nearly always figuring out the mechanics of the puzzle, rather than what to do, which is horribly frustrating.  I never thought it possible to rage quit a first person exploration game.  Then I did the impossible, and did just that.The enviroments themselves are nice, usually only using one or two colors per room.  The only problem I really have with the world is that it's incredibly inconsistant.  The world is obviously not made to feel like it has rules, which I normally wouldn't have a problem with.  It's just some sort of strange, lawless purgatory type setting, right?  I wish.  It's actually supposed to be an alien planet.  It just doesn't work at all.TL;DR:  I desperately wanted to like this game a lot, but it left a lot to be desired with terrible puzzles EVERYWHERE and and inconsistant world.4/10  Don't buy this game.  Just don't.			"

The soundtrack is amazing, the atmosphere is at times dark, at others mysterious and sometimes even wondrous, but always, always alien and strange.If I would critisise one thing it would be that I don't like the mouse acceleration, if there's an option to turn it off that I missed, I apologise for that.Also really easy to get 100% achievements if you care about that, though there's some backtracking to do it, not too bad however.There's also a secret ending ;)			"

												while fundementally 'fine' if you want a game that is well built with care in both enviroment and sound design don't pick up this game. a lot of people tend to hand wave these things saying the 'experience' is worth it, but honestly I couldn't even sit through ten minutes of the game with how choppy the controls, enviroments and the sound was. one particuler grating thing was no matter if you were walking, running, or crawling along, the same pace of steps would constantly sound out, and there isn't much in the way of audio options to help eliviate that. if you really want to experience the game but that sound awful to you, just mute the game and put on some music, or rainymood cause honestly the music wasn't anything special.

												it's a good concept, of finding patterns in abstract mechanics. the problem is that most of the rooms don't have clear goals nor strategisable progression, and hardly qualify as puzzles. real puzzle games won't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you about what you're working with.if I presented you with a four-digit keypad lock and this information:12 26 3 19there's an infinite number of algorithms that produce four-digit sequences from that information. although those algorithms can be listed and ordered in applicability using a set of criteria, that's still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t lack of strategisability despite the amount of work required to begin to guess at it. it would more likely be faster to bruteforce the 10^4 combinations.

												This is a pretty tough one to judge. Let me first say that I usually tend to like abstract games, as well as had a few good ""walking simulators"". However, I don't find Kairo to be one of them.On the question of whether games can be art, Kairo certainly makes a solid case for a 'yes'. Within the individual levels, there is certainly a sort of surrealistic atmosphere that remains intact despite the used engine (I think unrealED 2.0) itself being pretty outdated at this time.However, my gripe is mostly that this theme isn't consistent between levels. There is no natural progression or any overarching sentiment that ties the levels together. Each and every one could have been the first, somewhere in the middle or the last one.And while the atmosphere is okay (even good), the puzzle aspects feel tacked on and added ""because it's expected"". They are rudimentary dabblings that IMHO doesn't add much. I had no fun in solving them (or attempting to), and frankly found myself bored more than intrigued.So...end result: perhaps get this if you just want to watch some interesting minimalistic design. But to be honest, that's exactly what the trailers already provide. :\			"

												I don't normally play exploration games.  Kairo is probably the closest thing to immersion that I wanted from a puzzle/exploration game besides the Myst series.  The music is the most immersive aspect of Kairo. It will bring you into this world.  It should be noted that there is no spoken dialogue or text to read. You start off in this world and have to figure out where to go and what to do. The puzzles aren't terribly difficult. The hardest one for me so far only took 20 minutes to solve.  I'm still playing this pretty awesome game for 5 bucks but I can already say it's worth a buy!			"

												When I saw the screenshots and such for Kairo I presumed that Kairo may not be the most visually appealing game but sometimes, while such games may not always put their best screenshots on display, they do usually have some redeeming charm. The various positive reviews and an endorsement from RPS also seemed to indicate that this was a diamond in the rough. However as it turned out, it is actually a mouldy chunk of food in the dust. How on earth this game achieved anywhere near a positive status on Steam I have no idea, but I suspect foul play. Allow me to explain why you need to avoid Kairo like the plague.Plain textures can sometimes be compensated for by some impressively detailed architecture or environments which hold intrigue. Kairo simply does not have any of that. The environments look like they were made by someone experimenting with mapping and decided to package everything together to make it seem like a game. The designer has some strange idea that throwing tons of fog into every section of the game is a substitute for creating atmospheric lighting or using the environment itself to influence the players' state of mind. As such every part of the game I saw felt lifeless, unfinished and bland. I have honestly seen maps from the original Quake with more atmosphere, style and imagination.The 'puzzles' are so dull that I literally gave up after playing the game for half an hour. They consist of running into invisible triggers or standing on trigger brushes to cause something to happen. One of the things the designer forgot to actually do is clearly indicate when a puzzle is solved and what the point of solving it was. In one area I found 4 platforms which turned on a bunch of particle effects on a rotating central disc. Visually quite interesting and clearly the puzzle was solved because all of the triggers stopped working, but it did not appear to have any effect upon the game. The lack of direction here is astounding as the designer chooses to leave you completely in the dark as to what you should be doing and gives no context or sense of progress to what you manage to figure out on your own. Someone needs to sit this person down with games like Myst, the Longest Journey, Master Reboot or even The Room so they can understand the difference between an enjoyable mystery and aimless activity.Kairo is unpleasant to look at, boring to explore, devoid of any sense of achievement or purpose and ultimately one of the worst games I have had the misfortune to mistake for a worthwhile investment of money or time.

												First room teaches you that you can fly (or rather, walk) over bottomless pits.  Then you get hit with invisible walls so you can't fall.  Then you fall.  Lesson learned: mechanics are meant to confuse you.Level design looks like someone found the ""cube"" tool and said ""this is everything I need"".   Most rooms use symmetric architecture to disorient you.  Room are connected by portal-doors with unmemorable splashes of color to distinguish them (e.g. red portal vs. blue portal).  Lesson learned: basic navigation is meant to confuse you.Puzzles are trivially easy, when they work at all.  There is no ""use"" button and so everything is activated by stepping on a specific piece of floor or pushing against a particular wall.  Anything more complex, such as pushing a handle on a rotating cylinder, is just as likely to not work as it is to work slowly.  Some rooms have no puzzle at all but things that you interact with like other puzzles.  Lesson learned: puzzle elements are meant to confuse you.Normally I'd think such a consistent design of confusion was serving a larger theme.  It's not.  It's just a bad game.			"

The puzzles that I had to solve during my short 30 minutes of playtime were not enjoyable in the slightest. Most of them were completely mundane. I didn't feel like I accomplished anything when I solved the puzzles. The ""exploration"" aspect is also done poorly. With poor platforming controls and the ability to see through walls at 90 FOV, the game is already to a poor start. Add on to this a bleak world with no interesting things to interact with or even LOOK at, and I found myself just going from corridor to corridor so I could finish this damn game as quick as possible.Pros:-Runs smoothlyCons:-Boring puzzles-Bad graphics-Poor platforming controls			"

The game has really simple concept which im gonna call relics. There are a few areas that have diffrent puzzles to solve so you get a piece of the relic get all of them and it opens a portal which leads to a diffrent area. The game in itself looks pretty and has amazing music to accompany it which awesome. The game has simple controlls which do really keep the gameplay smooth. The game has no bugs what so ever  which is awesome. Overall you have a cheap game with awesome gameplay well thought out puzzles amazing atmosphere and the only flaw is some puzzles are a bit difficult and i highly reccomend you check it out i give this game a perfect 10/10			"

												It tries to be Myst.and it isn't; the premise of this game is to open possible and ambiguity of story for intrepretation by the players, narration is being pushed to extreme minimum and almost non-existence, relying in ""dumb dog puzzles"" as the core mechanic of this game. the devs tries to be as minimalist as possible and resulting in being incredibly slow and boring, even when you do (and could) running in-game. the art design seems to unsure whether it want's to be in voxel or high res textured, even though there's almost nothing to show due to heavy emphasis on surreal atmospheric term (in this case, its kinda work... sort of).It could be great, short game but somehow ended up being stretch beyond what is necessary. what could be 30 minutes game with more replayability and more variety of ending turns up as overly long walking simulator with very little redeeming value of gameplay and non-rewarding short ending (and that ""ending"") gets a barely thumbs down. good discount will help decided people to buy this game though.(5.4/10) could be better.

That genre of game isn't really quite for me, but I can enjoy the really good ones like Antichamber and Portal.  This one, just not enough for me.On the plus side you can / will probably find this game for cheap.  I think I paid a dollar for it.			"

												It tries to be Myst.and it isn't; the premise of this game is to open possible and ambiguity of story for intrepretation by the players, narration is being pushed to extreme minimum and almost non-existence, relying in ""dumb dog puzzles"" as the core mechanic of this game. the devs tries to be as minimalist as possible and resulting in being incredibly slow and boring, even when you do (and could) running in-game. the art design seems to unsure whether it want's to be in voxel or high res textured, even though there's almost nothing to show due to heavy emphasis on surreal atmospheric term (in this case, its kinda work... sort of).It could be great, short game but somehow ended up being stretch beyond what is necessary. what could be 30 minutes game with more replayability and more variety of ending turns up as overly long walking simulator with very little redeeming value of gameplay and non-rewarding short ending (and that ""ending"") gets a barely thumbs down. good discount will help decided people to buy this game though.(5.4/10) could be better.

												Alltogether Kairo isn't seriously a real game. It's more like a playable art project. And it supports as one of the first demos OR, but what doesn't count anymore (FB ♥♥♥♥ed that up). Even without OR you become sick of this weird spinning graphics in fisheye optic. It seems they used somekind of Doom1 engine to render all the pseudo 3D objects. Minecraft has more details than this. The psychadelic colors in each room doesn't make it better. You begin this game and have no plan what to do. No instructions, no hints. Just get lost in the labrinth of colored rooms and corridors. The hidden multimedia clips are creepy also the threaten atmosphere. But why asking of any sense? Art is as better as more senseless it is. Don't buy it directly. If it's in a bundle added, it's OK.			"

												If you have ever went on a walk, in an empty gymnasium with your eyes closed, you probably would find Kairo boring in comparison. In Kairo you get to do a lot of walking. I think. Actually I have no idea what this game actually IS.... When I am playing it, I feel as though I'm stuck in Half Life's tram car, able to look around, move a little, but nothing actually happens.Actually that's a bit generous. It's more like waiting for your girlfriend to come downstairs for your date - you can walk around, check out the books on her book shelf, look at the dirt on the floor... all with an anticipation that she would be coming down stairs ANY minute,., She never does - and THAT's Kairo's entire gameplay model.Did I like it? I can't say, I never actually DID anything. Oh sure, doors opened, things clicked, but unless I'm missing the point, the entire purpose of this game is to show how nicely you can make big ugly square blocks look sometimes.I'd like to see what the developer actually intended, some day.

												What am I even doing?Kairo is a very beautiful and ambient puzzle game with zero help and is the complete opposite of linear. It had puzzles and walking parts that have no connection and will leave you completely lost 95% of the way, some people may like that but it was a massive turn off for me. I used a guide for most of the game just so I could get it finished and write this review. My girlfriend tried it so I could make sure it wasent just me not knowing what I was doing, shes very puzzle smart and gets these kinda things really easily, but she became frustrated at the lack of help you are given. Most of the puzzles have no logical conclusion and will just make you guess forever until you figure it with just blind luck and perserverence.What it does right is make a story and really get the feeling of mystery and uncertainty embeded into the entire experience.With a guide it took me 3.5 hours to complete, without I would say if you didn't go insane already and forgot what time even is it will take 10+I really wanted to recommend this game, I bought it on sale thinking it was going to be this amazing ambient adventure with clear colours and pretty shapes but I really can't, it just makes no sense.It had promise and if it had just a little help to give you it would of been three times the game it is, but all I experienced was a mess of beautiful art.Personal Rating: 2/5			"

												I didn't like Kairo. It feels unfinished. And the blinding white sky and strange visual appearance kind of give me a headache. The game doesn't teach well at all, so you feel unsure of what you should be doing. It is not nearly linear enough, and has no sense of accomplishment. I purchased it because it looked so promising, but the game fails to deliver. I hate to write a negative review, but this game is just not well put together or polished. The levels don't have a consistent feel or visual style, the architecture is not believable, navigation is difficult and the player just needs a LOT more direction.If the game was linear, taught skills incrementally, was more intuitive, rewarded the player, had save points, and was easier to navigate it could be a really fun game. But it doesn't quite do what a game should. It has a lot of potential, though, and it is too bad that it isn't more finished.			"

I dont think this qualifies as a game.It is more like tech demo for an old and bad engine.When you boot the game up,you are greeted with SPECTACULAR controls.Whoever made this game thought it was a good idea to apply smoothing to CONTROLS.And thank god i realized that you can turn it off at least for mouse.You had one job as a walking simulator:BEING ABLE TO WALK.This must be someones first game or something,and it is good AS SOMEONE'S FIRST GAME,but its pretty sh*t as a real game.Then we got the textures and oh boy,arent they sh*t.Textures 101:DO NOT CREATE A WALL WİTH ONLY THE SAME TEXTURE.HAVE VARIATION.Also polygons.You need 'em.And we get to the ""story"":This is why i called this game a tech demo rather than a game.If you remove every text from a game,there will be NO ROOM FOR STORY.Oh and puzzles arent great.And you are trying to be ""atmospheric"" ,huh?-No graphics-No controls-No story.How were you planning to be atmospheric again?At least have one of them.P.S. Remove the cheap grain effect before saying i was wrong about the graphics.That effect is the cheapest trick i have ever seen so far.And there it is,after being thru at least 50 of this type,the first time i actually used ""I Do not recommend ""button.TL;DR :-Worst controls.-Motion sickness.-GldSrc engine level graphics.-♥♥♥♥♥ier textures.+Decent music.Down it with beer.3/10 : A badly made half-life mod.(With fitting music tho.)

												Kairo is a very peculiar indie game with interesting puzzles that focus on visual cues (next to nothing audibly). If you have a decent computer and own FRAPS, then you should have no problem (REQUIRES FRAMELOCK), but for those of you who do not, I would be weary. My setup was running Kairo at 300+ FPS and quickly became dizzy and nauseated which lasted longer than it should have. Requiring a framelocking software in order to experience the game as it was meant to be is a turn off. Not to mention most won't know what framelocking is or how to do it.			"

Walking controls are really slippery, too. It doesn't look very good and yet manages to run poorly anyway. If you stray from the expected path, the game may not understand and may just throw you into a death loop. (Try jumping on the radio obelisk. You'll see.)I only managed to get through a few areas.

												Quit on I don't even know which puzzle.  The ""puzzles"" aren't well designed; much of the time you stumble around till you happen to find something that goes *ding*.They aren't really original either; press these things in the right order (not even halfway through the game, I ran into a few of those), push this thing around, move to some particular, non-indicated location (that showed up about 5 times so far in the second ""world"")They're also slow.  Like, press a certain 2 buttons in a giant room.  Or push 4 boxes around a huge room while you wait for  a ball to bounce around like a snail.  Or wait on a button while a slow cube spins 360.  Or walk 3 flights of stairs in a room without any puzzle at all.  Or just walk on *nothing* to some non-descript platform in the distance.They're also poorly constructed.  Don't make the geometry such that I can get caught in a place I'm only supposed to push a ball.  Don't throw random barriers and little pathways that look traversible but lead to nothing (or maybe lead to a tiny rune thing which disappears before you even know what you did)ugh.  Other reviews are praising this for its ambience, for its minimalist ""elegance"", whatever.  And that's what convinced me to buy this.  But I got little to no enjoyment from what I played; I was expecting a much more fleshed-out game (which doesn't contradict minimalism; take Anti-chamber, for example) "

Exploration is not the focus of the game, as there's not much to explore except for single-textured basic geometry stacked to form non-atmospheric environments (just tinted lights, some ok-ish fullscreen effects to force some atmosphere and random symbols to fake depth). it even prevents you from exploring outside main areas via invisble reset-triggers. I walked through some puzzles that solved themselves, but it felt meaningless very fast.			"

												Great atmosphere, made me want to explore and see what's next. But I can't recomend this game, as a puzzle game is terrible. The puzzle designs are even insulting at some times. Believe me, if you want to play this game you will have to use a walktrough guide because there will be puzzles that are literally impossible, and not because you are not smart enough, but because they are designed to actually be impossible. Yes, it is stupid to make a game that way, and yes, Kairo is uber stupid game design.Just to give you an example (one of many situations like this in the game, and there are a lot, believe me): There is a room where you see this kind of hexagonal button, you get close to it, you touch it and a it glows and what appears to be some tv screens arround the room are now turned on with some noisy image. You think to your self ""that's it?, that's what this button did?"" There seems to be that nothing else have changed in that room after all. Well, guess what? There is a f*cking door that was hidden in some other room that you already been through about one hour ago, and that door is now open, and you have to go back to that random place, with out any clue whatsoever so you enter this new room to do something else, that is actually required for some other sh*t further in the game! How am I supposed to know that I have to go to that f*cking place? And that's why you must use a f*cking walkthrough! But a game that requires that in the first place so that you are able to play it is a bloody f*cking stupid game!!!			"

												If you are going to get this then do so at the absolute lowest price. It's amateur hour for the most part. Does that offend anyone? I guess people are too involved in the creator's personal life or something. I have no idea. I'm not rating personal drama here. I'm rating the game. And there isn't much here beyond a bare bones approach to the puzzle genre. I still recommend it for super cheap, but just barely compared to the rest of the puzzle genre.Some of the puzzles are fun, some of the music has a nice ambient tone, and I guess the graphics are okay. But there isn't much here. This is archaic modeling, basic sound loops, and not much else to be quite honest. I mean, I can see why people appreciate indies, I'm just not sure why this game is worth my time. I come back to it and do a bit of a puzzle I guess because the game is in my library. But I'm not sure I will ever complete this game, and I don't really care.I find the the extras to be tepid, and some of the puzzles are illogical or just downright irritating. This is not Myst, Obduction, Antichamber, or Talos, so don't even start to compare it to those masterpieces. It has nothing on them. This game is like a game some programmer set up in 1999 as a project to test out a graphic engine. It's okay.But I really cannot 100% recommend stuff like this when there is so much more out there. It's one of those games, because it has a decent tone to it, that I will give a 5.5/10. The reviews are so overwhelmingly positive that Kairo needs a couple more negative interpretations because it doesn't really do anything special to earn those positive reviews. So yes play it and try the game out. But I am giving a thumbs down because this is clearly just a shell of a real, immersive experience.			"

												I wanted to like Kairo. I really tried.But i can't. It really just comes down to the fact that even as an ""explore and wonderment"" game, it's very...dull. The atmosphere is great and a lot of the areas (Especially the famous ""red pylon"" room) are fantastic looking, but...The puzzles feel bland and useless, like they were taked on to give the game uneeded ""difficulty"" (of which there is none even with puzzles), the music can be grating at times, and some of the stuff, like the static, screens, or door effects, feel a bit out of place.I can definitely respect what the game was trying to do, and in terms of being a ""wow look at this giant otherworldly thing"" game it succeeds, but i think that adding ridiculously easy puzzles and the sort actually took away from the game rather than added to it. If the whole game was just walking through progressively grander rooms (with the occasional ACTUAL jumping puzzle, the only puzzle that i think could fit in this game), i'd like it a lot more, but it just was a bit too tedious for me.

												I'm all for ""Walking Simulators"" but there really was nothing interesting to this. I just walked around for 20 minutes going room to room without finding/seeing anything interesting. There wasnt anything to indicate why I was there or where I was going until I just got bored and closed the game.			"

												I don't think I've ever regretted spending $5.I put a little under an hour and a half into this game before I made the decision to uninstall it.Here is my reasoning.I bought the game because some reviewers touted its similarity to Antichamber, a game that is very near and dear to my heart. The trailer for the game made it appear tantalizing and intriguing and, most of all, fun. Unfortunately, it didn't take me twenty minutes to regret this small purchase.Kairo has, I've found, missed the mark on one of the most fundamental gaming concepts; not just in video games, but in the entire realm of playing a game for fun. I call this ""carrot-and-stick"". Other people call this other things. But essentially, in nearly every game you can think of, there's the metaphorical carrot, your objective, and the metaphorical stick, what keeps you from your objective. I could cite endless games, card games, board games, arcade games, games of make-believe played in the backyard of my friends' houses when we were five, and, yes, video games that keep/kept me latched onto the idea, entertained, and engaged in the gameplay.One thing I quickly learned in Kairo is that there's not much of a carrot.I'm going to take this discussion back to Antichamber, for those who have played it. I'd hypothesize that the two are compared often for the similar concept of working through puzzles in complete solitude. But in the Hub of Antichamber, you can see a door marked Exit, though you cannot reach it. In one of the first spawn points, you can see a door behind a barrier marked ""The End"". There's even the Black Ghost, dancing just out of your reach on certain puzzles. These are all suitable carrots. Kairo is designed in such a way that I have yet to see the carrot; there's not much more than an endless stick. And after almost an hour and a half of playing for no apparent reason, I tired of the game.On one last note, for all the endless puzzles in Kairo, there are worlds you walk through that have no puzzles at all. The game has a hint feature, but if you are not so inclined to use it, it's incredibly difficult to discern a puzzle world from a world that's apparently there for your exhaustive visual pleasure.

												The game itself is fine, but at this point in trying to get the last two achievements, I have played it for 10 hours. One play through maybe takes 2 hours if you don't know what you're doing (at this point I can finish the ENTIRE game in, like, 45 minutes because I've done it so many FREAKING TIMES).I've gone through several times completeing every vision/art puzzle, finding every rune, and shattering all the glass obelisk things, and I still can't get to the last glass obelisk and the secret ending.Except for this INFURIATING FACT it was a fine game. It's slow to get through mostly because of all the walking, and the puzzles are weird, but I still enjoyed it (until I knew about this pain that I'm currently writhing in). I'd say only get it if you don't want to 100% it, because it's freaking impossible. I'm going to go insane.			"

												Before I begin, I have played for more than 0.3 hours, but I played in offline mod. Not very much though, this game made me bored faster than a math lesson can do.Positives:- Decent scripting I guessNegatives:- Pretty much everything- Boring gameplay- No storylineYou spawn in a world with absoutely no clue how you got there. You don't have a name, you don't have a goal, you don't have anything to find. The story is non existing.Some games can be good even without a clear goal or a background story, but not in this case.Not only do you have no goal, enemies or purpose in Kairo whatsoever, the puzzles are also simple but yet confusing. You can not interact with anything and you don't have an inventory, meaning that all you can do is move objects by walking towards them, or jump on random platforms in hope that something will happen. Really, really simple puzzles. And when I say it's also confusing, what I mean is, you don't really know why you are doing what you are doing due to the non existing story and the few hints you get doesn't really help that much at all.Do I recommend this game? No. I don't recommend it to anyone.People that love adventures, no. The game is as simple as it can be (including the soundtracks and gameplay in general) with nothing to explore or discover at all. You don't even have a purpose or anything to lose. Not even health (no, you can't even die in this game).People that like puzzle games, no. Again, the puzzles are basic, yet confusing, and you don't really know why you are doing them.People that love a good storyline, no. There is no story in this game at all.-------------------Why people like this is beyond me. I have played many bad games, but this without doubt in my top 5 most boring games ever.2/10 - Really bad			"

												As someone who used to work with mapping for garry's mod I can clearly see that the mapping in this game is terrible. Another problem is that the controls are inexplicably sluggish and you feel as if you're on ice skates while you walk. I thought it might be because of my computer but the framerate is very good and there is no mouse lag so the problem has to be related to the game. Now, I understand that this game is inspired by yume nikki, but that is no excuse to make the puzzles so obscure without a hint on how to solve them. yume nikki itself was not a finished game you know. All in all, I want to get immersed into the game but the lack of polish and sluggish controls make it impossible to do so.Until this game is properly polished I can't recommend it.If the dev wants help with mapping, I would be willing to help if I can, for a small fee of course.

Kairo has managed to annoy me, that is why the negative vote. Apart from that, the game possesses couple of merits worth to be pointed out. Despite being designed in a simplistic manner, it offers beautiful vistas. The music accompanying the course of play is remarkable on its own, creating a decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, when it comes to contents, the puzzles are either straightforward or frustratingly hard, including some obsolete-minded solutions, such as dragging the face along the walls throughout several impressively large areas, just to find that little secret. To summarise, if you seek loose Portal-meets-Tomb-Raider-type atmospheric exploration available at low cost, get Kairo. If you want intellectually challenging journey in the vein of Antichamber, move on.			"

												This game is pretty crazy. Somewhere between fascinating and terrifying, wondrous and foreboding. There are no monsters or even imminent threats really, but still your entire surroundings feel so ancient and so much grander than you that it creates an incredibly ominous feeling that never quite goes away.As you interact with the world, huge abandoned structures come to life, and though the scenery changes and the paths are made clear, you never really know what’s going on under the surface. What do these huge contraptions actually do? Where is it leading? And how did all of it (and you for that matter) end up here? You get the sense that you’ll never really know, because it’s all just too ancient, too alien for your understanding.The entire experience is rather chilling, and if you let yourself really become immersed in this world, you’ll probably find yourself making some pretty strange sounds, like I was, and laughing at points about just how uncomfortable it actually makes you.The game isn’t perfect. There are bugs, but those tend to add to the strangeness of the environment in a way. One noticeable fault I had was that the footstep sounds are the exact same no matter what your pace is. This may sound minor, but it is rather noticeable at times when you are really taking it slow to take in your surroundings, which you will probably do quite a lot. Still a minor complaint in face of everything that’s really on display in this one.I bought it during a Summer Sale at $1.50, and I would probably recommend it at a fairly higher price-tag even still.MY SCORE - 8/10			"

												Kairo is a great little game with really nice logic puzzles that aren't too difficult but requires some thinking. The game hints at a story but it's very vague and it could just as well have no story. The thing I really loved about Kairo was the atmosphere it created, it made me feel very isolated and small because the levels were usually very big and empty and it had a very minimalist environment. The atmosphere got creepy at times as things such as static on the screen would flare up and number station recordings would play as you got closer to certain areas. The game always had me questioning things, because sometimes strange objects or symbols would be around and it would make me want to know why they were there or what they meant. I also liked the ambient music as that too helped with the atmosphere and it fits right into the game.			"

												An extremely underrated game -- period. This game boasts a power to enthrall and captivate you, without needing an actual story the game almost speaks to you on a mystical level. The puzzles aren't easy but not too difficult, and there are very creative ideas put into it. The game also has intresting architecture and mysterious entities. It is a game that pulls you out of reality and puts you into this weird, but neat sublime world. I would say that this game is kinda like a more linear based LSD: Dream Simulator for the PS1 with puzzles. They both provoke unique mystery in an intresting and meaningful way. An excellent game for the price, I highly recommend it!			"

												     From the moment the game begins to the ending sequence, Kairo's atmosphere remains powerful and unique. The world feels vast and lonely, but far from empty. The world is strange and yet eerily familiar, and the puzzles keep you involved in the goal. You can spend hours exploring the numerous rooms, each with its own atmosphere and function.     Very simple controls stop you from playing the guessing game on how to interact with things, so that the focus can be on the environment and puzzles that surround you. The music and atmospheric sounds add to the vast and lonely feeling of the world, and some elements you come across can send shivers down your spine.     If you're one for getting lost in an atmosphere, this is a game for you.			"

												Brilliant. Completely dedicated to abstraction from beginning to end. No text, no tutorial, no explanations, no HUD. No traditional narrative or plot, only dream logic, mood and an amazingly realized sense of scale and place. The puzzles are often simple and follow an intuitive sort of logic (with a few unfortunate exceptions). Kairo is eerie, beautiful, mysterious, always unpredictable and intriguing. It's very much what I had hoped Antichamber would be.			"

												Need a break?Welcome to the strange, yet simple and relaxing world of Kairo. It's a world filled with many ambiances, many puzzles, and many secrets.The gameplay is that simple, reduced to only movements, triggers activating by just pushing or walking passed them. Most of the puzzles also aren't difficult, with hints provided in the menu if you need some help. Though, some secrets are pretty hard to find or solve, and you might want to pass them if you don't want to spend a lot of time on them.But what makes Kairo different is the collection of ambiances and places, some people might see them like poetry, despite the lack of plot. Of course you will have a hard time enjoying this if you seek action.Overall, its a nice, short, but most importantly relaxing game.Be careful though, despite the quite simple graphics, it seems the game needs quite the resource, and you don't have many graphic options to help it.

												Kairo just seems like it was made for VR. The best way to describe is it is a Myst like experience where you travel through enormous rooms and areas that are large puzzles to figure out. There's no weaponry, no enemies unless you count the puzzles and you pretty much cannot die (falling off ledges just puts you back on the ledge). Each room is dominated by a simple color scheme and the architecture is large and blocky as giving the environment an ancient feel.When played on a normal monitor, the simple graphics and plain architecture might seem like a negative. However, you activate VR, put on the Rift and you realize these graphics are now a strength. Just as Valve Steam Dev Days demo showed, so long as you keep latency low and frame rate high even a simple environment will seem real. Kairo delivers on this concept in spades. The large throne rooms, invisible maze arena, hollow pyramids, giant light orb and many other breathtaking sites fill this game. The slow pace and not too mind bending puzzles mean you're seeing new areas yet have plenty of time to appreciate each one. The sounds are different for each location and all are relaxing and never seem to be over bearing or painfully loud. There are a few cases where the sudden movement of the environment surprised me, but never did I feel the need to pull out of the game. The presence is strong and even with lengthy gameplay I did not notice much if any in the way of nausea. The frame rate seems great throughout with only one room (the one with four treadmills) showing lag.Like Dear Esther, I play this game standing up and do the fake foot walk to aid in my immersion. The look is not tied to the control movement so it's easy to look around and enjoy the environment as you travel through. Its very easy to get drawn into the game and forget that you're in your room playing a game.People probably have missed that this is a VR game as it does not seem to have the ""VR Support"" tag in the Steam search function. I've written the author and asked if he can get that added. As I said, for only $5 you're getting several hours of a great VR experience. A perfect game for those that prefer relaxed gameplay over the horror or shooter style games currently listed with VR support.			"

Everything (including the interface) is elegant and stripped-down.  I was surprised at how many distinct, memorable places could be made from such simple building blocks.

There diffenetly is gameplay though. Some of the puzzles are frustrating and running between map to map is sometimes tedius, but I would not hesitate to reccomend this.			"

												I got this game for $1. And I'm glad I scooped it up! A great puzzle/exploration game with enigmas abound.GAMEPLAY: Consists of walking, jumping, and looking around. It's straightforward exploration with minor platforming. Puzzles round out the play, which you complete by stepping on platforms and bumping into objects to trigger them.PUZZLES: They're pretty intuitive for the most part, but there were a few I had to consult the helpfully provided ""hints"" option for (one in particular was hair rippingly frustrating because I'm terrible at math). Be prepared to comb areas carefully for clues, and draw out some diagrams here and there. It's quite satisfying to solve these puzzles, as they're fairly challenging, and it's made clear when you have activated a piece of machinery or opened a pathway by way of flashing lights, thunderous tumults, or loud gong strikes. It all amounts to a feeling of progress and getting one step closer to solving the mystery.VISUALS: Very minimalistic. Oftentimes, you wander through barren corridors or empty voids, with sparsely a decoration to look at. What there is to look at, though, serves to deepen the mystery. It feels like everything being presented - from images of Earth to the DNA double helix - has some type of underlying meaning. Otherwise, lighting and colouring is used to differentiate rooms, creating a very surreal effect. There's also some use of moving objects - floating, spinning globes, for example - that add some variance. In all, it's simplistic, but only where it needs to be.AUDIO: The highlight of the game for me. Again, simplicity is the standard here - a haunting, ambient soundtrack makes the place feel mysterious, dangerous, and cozy all at once. It's a strange effect, but it keeps the player guessing as to what, exactly, these structures are. As mentioned before, loud, sudden bells and gongs are used to indicate that the player has completed a puzzle, which is pretty satisfying. Radio static in certain locations and chimes during object interaction round out the auditory experience. Like the graphics, it feels like the sounds of the game highlight what's important.STORY: Ostensibly, there isn't much of one. There is virtually no dialogue or cutscenes, and there are no NPCs present. Only environmental clues, mainly through recurring motifs, give rise to some semblance of a plot. I enjoyed wondering what Kairo could be about, and reading theories about it afterward.Overall, a great experience, which is even nicer considering I got this game for $1. It reminded me a lot of Myst (and Penumbra, somehow). There are mysteries to be unravelled for those willing to search for them.			"

												I quite enjoyed this game. The atmosphere was great, and it looked really cool. However, some of the puzzles were a bit -too- abstract, and for some reason touching a wall caused my framerate to drop dramatically. This got annoying in some areas, espeically being that the controls in this game aren't very tight, even with the settings tweaked. Some areas a a bit bigger than they need to be, so there's a lot of walking to do. Thank goodness there's a sprint button, but it doesn't change your speed that much. This game has very little replay value, unless you're one of those people who want to painstakingly go through every nook and cranny to find these tiny symbols tucked in corners of the levels.I think the game was trying to tell me a story, but I didn't get any sort of feeling of resolution at the end, unless I am supposed to find all those little symbols. That sounds absolutely miserable though. That would be like playing a 3d eye spy game. I have better things to do with my life.Overall, I enjoyed the game. Puzzles were nice, except for a few, which were really stupidly hard. The game is not that long at all, so these few dark spots really put a dent in the overall experience.I almost gave this a thumbs down, but at the end of the day, it did hold my attention, and I did say twice in this review that I enjoyed it, so it gets a thumbs up from me. But just barely.			"

												Okay, let's get one thing out of the way first: this game does not look good. The trailer above kinda oversells the graphics — they're not minimalistic, they're cheap.That being said, everything else about Kairo is great.Distant cousin of Myst, this game is comprised mostly of puzzles. And there is a compelling diversity in these: some are very easy, some are very difficult; some totally straightforward, some mind-bendingly abstract; and of course everything in between. This makes the progression always enticing and never boring. The level design is very cool despite the poor graphics and each level has its own unique feel, the whole game being very ""atmospheric"". This is brilliantly reinforced by the marvelous sound design, with a really, really awesome music that transported me from puzzle to puzzle in a dream-like state.Thanks to all these strenghts, Kairo manages to be at the same time fun and relaxing. It is a journey, really, in a land full of mysteries and secrets, where lots of questions are raised and no explanations given — you make your own conclusions from the scarce clues given along the path.I have no idea how to grade it out of ten, but I am positive that I'd recommend it in a heartbeat to pretty much anyone. The only major flaw that I would point out is the absence of V-Sync which allows some MASSIVE tearing to occur. And the Field of View is rendered in layers, which looks kinda awful. But other than that, well... What's not to like? You like puzzles? Get it. Like ""moody"" games? It's a good one. Like quality OSTs? This one's perfect. You like Myst? Don't hesitate! There even is a skeleton hidden somewhere. Spooky!			"

												A short but interesting puzzle and exploration game. The puzzles are mostly intuitive, and there's a hint series for each room if you get stuck, which I greatly appreciated. The graphics are simple blocky 3D, but the art style is fascinating, with huge elaborate temple complexes and imposing architecture. There isn't any real story (until you start looking into the secret ending), which just helps the overall dreamlike feeling of the game. If you like exploration and puzzles, this game should be worth your time.			"

												Kairo is a slow-paced puzzle game in a similar vein to Myst, if Myst didn't have all the annoying pixel-hunting and weren't a point and click game. Its atmosphere is surreal, strange, and overwhelmingly lonesome. That's the big word I think I'd use to describe this game - lonesome, and that lonesomeness becomes more and more eerie the further you go into the game. You are the only living thing in Kairo - everything else is a hollow, dead fascimile, with archetecture eerily reminiscent of human construction and yet alien enough you might think you woke up in R'lyeh. The world of Kairo is a small world that feels massive, alien, and completely dead... and I love it to pieces and back.Wandering through the surreal and beautifully eerie world of Kairo is very relaxing, the puzzles are very intuitive and can easily be solved with a little thought, and the simple design really makes it feel like you're stranded. And yet, solving the puzzles is so satisfying, satisfying in that ""I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed genius!"" sort of way. The range of feelings you get from Kairo goes from triumph, curiosity, and awe to fright, paranoia, and hopelessness - and what is art if not something that makes you feel deeply? Anyone who claims video games aren't art has never played this, and that's a damn shame. Did I mention that the music and the game's design is just so surrealistically gorgeous?Seriously, BUY THIS GAME. It's maybe $5 for a wonderful little piece of surrealistic artwork that recaptures the eerie loneliness and thirst for adventure that Myst did so many years ago in 1992. Kairo is a gem of an indie puzzle game, and anyone who is a fan of surreal artwork, puzzle games, and games where you chill and wander for a bit will love this. You really do owe it to yourself to play it at least once. Who knows? It may become one of your favorite games, just like it has for me.			"

												This game was very very short, but it was beautiful and haunting, and that's more what the game is about than anything else. As with many atmospheric games, you're thrown in with no instructions and no idea what's going on, and you spend a good amount of time in the game continuing on in that state, slowly putting everything together.The puzzles are fun, with at least one being fairly devious and not particularly straight forward, but figuring them out is quite satisfying, and learning the rules of the puzzles as you go keeps them feeling fairly fresh. If only it was about twice as long...			"

												This is not Myst..... I've been looking for first-person immersive puzzle games (and I'm desperately waiting for Obduction to come out) but... Kairo did not turn out to be a true puzzle game, nor is it immersive. I thought it would great to have a block puzzle environment, without any living elements in it (like silly waivy grass and purposely quaint creatures), and to just be left with puzzles. But this game doesn't have actual *puzzling* puzzles. You can 'solve' almost everything by accidentally bumping into walls. The odd thing is: I LOVE minimalism, futurism, ambient music and... Tetris. But Kairo did not captivate me at all. I'm going back to playing Myst and Rhem on my nearly dead old Macs now...			"

												Kairo is a game of many feelings and has a fantastic atmosphere.The puzzles were occasionally frustruating, but not unreasonably difficult. The environments are simple yet so elegant in their design. There were parts that unnerved me, and parts that made me happy. There is definitely some scary parts. I still get chills whenever I approach a statue that puts out the sound of static, and this effect has carried in to other games.  The soundtrack is awesome, the gameplay is solid, certainly worth 5.50 if you're in to atmospheric puzzle games.			"

												Kairo is seriously a fantastic experience. It seems people are complaining about the following:""kept waiting for something interesting to happen, some secret to uncover, some story to unfold""Kairo is something of an atmopsheric puzzle game. That being said, it's really full of ""AHA"" moments. In every area, there's something interesting and beautiful.""The puzzles are a little too abstract""I don't know about this. Yeah, the puzzles are quite difficult, but isn't that, you know, the point?""First of all I expected a little more story. Sadly there is absolutely none.""I played through the entire game, and never once expected a story. Do not go in expecting one. This is not a bad thing. This is a game where you need to appreciate the world at face value.""Graphics: 5.7/10""People seem to be hating on the graphics. I think they really add to the atmosphere, which is, to be honest, what Kairo is half about.Overall, I'd say this game is a 7.5/10, it's almost there, but is too abstract for many. The price is fair for a game like this. I'd say overall, a reccomend.			"

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2015/06/14/kairo/Kairo is a puzzle exploration game. You travel the world of Kairo, trying to move forward and get to the next door… and the next… and the next.The graphics are simple – smooth and coloured walls will keep you company. It gives the game a cold and sinister feel. I felt small and lost, running around in large buildings, trying to get out.You have no inventory, no set of tools to help you out. Instead you unlock your surroundings by how and where you move and what you do. It’s a very unnerving and immersive experience.It is difficult to explain this game without saying too much. But playing Kairo, I felt like I was the last person in the world, trying desperately to find my way out of a complex I was not meant to be in. If you like first-person explorations games, you should play this one.7/10 "

												IMPORTANT: When you hit the normal ending, wait for the credits to play out. They're not long.Pros:- Puzzles become interesting when you have no ""hand"" or ""activate"" controls. By limiting the player to mere movement controls, old puzzles feel fresh, and there's an extra sense of accomplishment with even fairly simple puzzles.- The environment's minimalist polygon theme manages, surprisingly, to stay varied, interesting, and even evokative throughout the game, contributing to the theme of ""strange and yet familiar"" that pervades.- Difficulty to normal end is low, difficulty to secret end is high.- No penalty for exploration, experimentation, or taking your time.- Overall, definitely enjoyable.Cons:- The ""story"" aspect is a little too vague. You paid $5, folks, this ain't Myst or Portal. While there are enough ""clues"" that a player can vaguely put together a plot (and considerably more blatant clues as rewards for solving secret puzzles), there's plenty that's just left to imagination.- The mechanic that resets you to a safe ledge can glitch considerably, leaving you in a fall-to-your-death loop, though this can be solved by exiting the game and reloading.- One of the final secret puzzles is actually impossible to solve on your own. Your game will have 1/5 of the solution, and which fifth is chosen at random. So you're either going to need lots of friends, or cheat and look at a walkthrough.Final Note: Don't take my playtime as a good guide to the runthrough time of this game. I got irritated and consulted a walkthrough for two of the secret puzzles and half the rune locations.			"

												Kairo is a slightly flawed gem of a first-person walking and exploration game. It requires a bit of investment to stay interested in the beginning, but if you're into discovery and piecing together parts of a mystery, it eventually rewards that patience.In the beginning, you appear in Kairo with no explanation of who you are, where you are, what its or your purpose is, and no apparent indication of what you should do next, other than possibly head towards the one visible structure in the distance. Hints as to possible answers to all of those questions gradually unfold as you proceed through the three main levels of the game. Ultimately, the game never concretely answers any of those questions, but gives you enough (especially if you're determined to hunt down and unlock all of its sometimes-obscure riddles) to put together your guess, your interpretation of what you've just been through. For some this may be frustrating, not to know the absolute official canon truth of the matter, but I see it as one of the game's strengths in creating a real sense of mystery. This is not your typical berk-without-a-past-uncovers-his-past story—however much you discover, you remain without a past.The game suffers from some minor flaws in execution—the occasional video clipping problem in tight spaces, oddly getting stuck on stairs and needing to jump to continue, footstep sounds that are weirdly unsynchronized to your movement—that reflect a slight lack of polish. For me, these minor issues pale in comparison to what the game achieves artistically. It manages to create, through the grand scale of its environments, the use of colour, and its moody, atmospheric soundtrack, a feeling of being very small and alone in an intimidating, unknown world which is somehow broken and needs fixing. The puzzles involved in the fixing range from trivial to frustratingly obscure, but for the impatient there are guides and walkthroughs, and for the determined, there's a great sense of accomplishment in untangling the secret.

												Kairo is an interesting sort of first-person adventure game. It's rather minimalist in that 99% of the time there is zero HUD, and there are no ""use"" keys. The only way to interact with the world is, much like Proteus, by just being. Standing on switches and pads, moving against things, and walking around so that objects react to your very position relative to them will solve most of the puzzles in this game.Kairo's puzzles are mostly (if not all) logical. They are, however, of the type where you will often walk into a room, have literally no idea of how the room works, leave, come back later, and solve it immediately upon walking back in. So goes Kairo. If you're ever completely and absolutely stumped, there are hints provided by the in-game menu (which unfold in a UHS-style increasingly-specific manner), though it should rarely come to that.There is a story to Kairo. I am no fan of the obtuse ""insert your own ending/meaning/plot here"" plots that have become so commonplace in indie games these days, and I was initially under the impression that Kairo had followed suit. But I was embarrassingly wrong. There is, underneath it all, a highly interesting story that Kairo tells. It is told over the course of the game, and the elements which make it up stare you in the face wherever you go - though you do have to put the puzzle pieces together, yourself. While I myself had noticed all of these elements and even picked up on a hint or two of where they were leading me, I completely glazed over most of it and didn't connect anything that cried out for connection.Do try not to make my mistake.There are many interesting elements at work, here. It is in the interest of receiving the best experience that you can, for you to not only solve the puzzles, but to also pay attention to the world around you, and draw as many conclusions as possible along the way.

												     From the moment the game begins to the ending sequence, Kairo's atmosphere remains powerful and unique. The world feels vast and lonely, but far from empty. The world is strange and yet eerily familiar, and the puzzles keep you involved in the goal. You can spend hours exploring the numerous rooms, each with its own atmosphere and function.     Very simple controls stop you from playing the guessing game on how to interact with things, so that the focus can be on the environment and puzzles that surround you. The music and atmospheric sounds add to the vast and lonely feeling of the world, and some elements you come across can send shivers down your spine.     If you're one for getting lost in an atmosphere, this is a game for you.			"

												Need a break?Welcome to the strange, yet simple and relaxing world of Kairo. It's a world filled with many ambiances, many puzzles, and many secrets.The gameplay is that simple, reduced to only movements, triggers activating by just pushing or walking passed them. Most of the puzzles also aren't difficult, with hints provided in the menu if you need some help. Though, some secrets are pretty hard to find or solve, and you might want to pass them if you don't want to spend a lot of time on them.But what makes Kairo different is the collection of ambiances and places, some people might see them like poetry, despite the lack of plot. Of course you will have a hard time enjoying this if you seek action.Overall, its a nice, short, but most importantly relaxing game.Be careful though, despite the quite simple graphics, it seems the game needs quite the resource, and you don't have many graphic options to help it.

												Kairo just seems like it was made for VR. The best way to describe is it is a Myst like experience where you travel through enormous rooms and areas that are large puzzles to figure out. There's no weaponry, no enemies unless you count the puzzles and you pretty much cannot die (falling off ledges just puts you back on the ledge). Each room is dominated by a simple color scheme and the architecture is large and blocky as giving the environment an ancient feel.When played on a normal monitor, the simple graphics and plain architecture might seem like a negative. However, you activate VR, put on the Rift and you realize these graphics are now a strength. Just as Valve Steam Dev Days demo showed, so long as you keep latency low and frame rate high even a simple environment will seem real. Kairo delivers on this concept in spades. The large throne rooms, invisible maze arena, hollow pyramids, giant light orb and many other breathtaking sites fill this game. The slow pace and not too mind bending puzzles mean you're seeing new areas yet have plenty of time to appreciate each one. The sounds are different for each location and all are relaxing and never seem to be over bearing or painfully loud. There are a few cases where the sudden movement of the environment surprised me, but never did I feel the need to pull out of the game. The presence is strong and even with lengthy gameplay I did not notice much if any in the way of nausea. The frame rate seems great throughout with only one room (the one with four treadmills) showing lag.Like Dear Esther, I play this game standing up and do the fake foot walk to aid in my immersion. The look is not tied to the control movement so it's easy to look around and enjoy the environment as you travel through. Its very easy to get drawn into the game and forget that you're in your room playing a game.People probably have missed that this is a VR game as it does not seem to have the ""VR Support"" tag in the Steam search function. I've written the author and asked if he can get that added. As I said, for only $5 you're getting several hours of a great VR experience. A perfect game for those that prefer relaxed gameplay over the horror or shooter style games currently listed with VR support.			"

												This game made me feel like I was in an Arthur C. Clarke novel, exploring weird, alien archetecture.  The atmosphere is fantastic and the design is excellent.  Everything (including the interface) is elegant and stripped-down.  I was surprised at how many distinct, memorable places could be made from such simple building blocks.  The puzzles are engaging, but not very difficult; for me, the game was paced exactly right, with no area wearing out its welcome before I was able to move on and see something new.			"

												If exploration and atmosphere dont matter to you much you can stop reading here and ignore the game completely. If you are like me and appreciate that kind of game Kairo is certainly worth buying. Atmosphere is superb, with every location being unique in its own right yet fitting overall alien feel of this world. Exploration is rewarded with lots of easy to miss details hidden around most locations. To me weakest part of the game were puzzles, while most of them fit perfectly into the theme of each room they were too easy. All in all if you like exploration based games it is great game if you dont like this kind of thing avoid it like plague.			"

												Kairo is a first person puzzle-game that made me go ""Where the heck am I supposed to go?""It's a cryptic game, really is. There are secrets runes hidden all over the game along the road of its many puzzles.There is no way to die in the game besides falling off, but you don't really die - it just sends you back from where you fell.It's a lonely experience with its ambience and ..if you can even call it music.There are weird things happening here and there......but the game has the best coffee ad you'll ever see.

												Monoliths, glyphs, runes, buttons to step on... Kairo.For every step you take in this lonely world, you find yourself seemingly stuck and lost within yourself as well. Film grain covers your field of vision as you navigate the towers, solving a wide plethora of puzzles, from simple navigation of a simple maze to interpreting a star map just to open a door to running on treadmills, Kairo does the puzzle genre justice by infusing complex and mind-boggling puzzles towards a simplistic, minimalist world. The colours are beautiful, the gameplay is relatively solid (although I personally find the movement a little too sensitive) and this is really immersive by itself (if you play in a dark room with headphones).A drawback for me personally was that I found myself getting lost most of the time, that I was unable to have a good view of the puzzle I'm trying to solve. Like a rat in a maze, I could not see the big picture of the puzzle and I had to keep walking in circles trying to figure out what I've done, even resorting to sketching out some rooms on a piece of paper and drawing the various interactive elements on the paper so I can figure out what in the world is going on. It does interrupt the flow of the game for me sometimes and it was a little distracting to the overall feel of the game.In short, despite the few rough edges of this work of art, Kairo is really a beautiful gameset (with its fair share of really, really creepy elements and depictions here and there), really meant for the casual player to play and enjoy this surreal world, while unraveling a terrible tale that led to this place. If you're a puzzle nut and you enjoy creepy, lonely worlds, Kairo really is the place for you to be.Eurogamer has succiently highlighted the deep spine of Kairo. ""Kairo is mysterious and elegant and powerfully distinct. Like Fez and Minecraft, it will work your way into your dreams if you're not careful.""Play at your own risk, because Kairo does leave impressions in your mind as you play it, with the wide rooms and chilling images (when you stumble upon some seemingly ""dead ends"") and huge, huge glyphs.To this casual gamer's opinion:Kairo: 7.5/10			"

												As an abstract puzzle game, Kairo is great.  The gameplay is simple yet challenging, and the built-in hint system is helpful enough to point you in the right direction when you're stuck without outright spoiling the puzzle.  However, I think the abstract design makes the story hard to follow (and leaves the player to guess); after finishing the game, I wasn't really sure what it was all about.  Still, that doesn't detract from the gameplay.  If you enjoy puzzle games and want something a little different, I would definitely recommend Kairo.Pros:- Otherworldly/alien environment.- Engaging, abstract, and unique puzzles.- Good music, which helps set a somewhat ominous and somber tone.Cons:- The story was a little *too* abstract.- Keyboard controls are not remappable, or even listed in full.  For example, the ""R"" key resets you to the room entrance, but I found that completely by accident.- There is no way to see your progress on collecting the hidden glyphs, except by collecting more of the glyphs.  I would like to have seen my current progress when the game is paused (such as how the map is displayed).			"

												It's a neat little game for what it is.  Some of the puzzles are really difficult and non-intuitive.  We're all used to games holding our hands in the beginning, training us for a little while until things progress in difficulty, but this game doesn't do that.  The puzzles aren't connected in any kind of order.  The level design is minimalistic, serving only to host the puzzles for the most part, more like a tech demo you'd see for a kickstarter project to entice fans.  The ""story"" is purposefully left widely open to player interpretation but it won't blow your mind in any real way.  You can tell the concept that inspired the designer to create the game is there but probably fell short of what he really wanted to do in the final product we're getting.  I could see him making a sequel and really fleshing out something from this game.The game is more artsy and vague than a flowing linear story.  It reminded me of playing Myst back in the day.  You'll find puzzles with solutions located in completely different unrelated areas.  Everything you need to solve the puzzles are located in the game for the most part, but for those of us going into this as a casual time sink just wanting to blast through it will need to look up some solutions to get all the achievements for sure.  If you get it on sale for a couple of dollars it's worth it.  It took longer than I thought it would to complete the game in its entirety, but not in an overly frustrating way.  It was a pleasant surprise.			"

												Kairo is a beautifully eerie shapescape that combines original style with familiar puzzle questing.  It is a simple yet aw- filled atmospheric journey that takes place in this supernatural-like world you've stumbled upon. Pros: + Increadible atmosphere.  Sometimes even daunting to look at with the great depth of field use by the dev.   + Music is more like a drone in various keys and melodies.  It's unique and quite pleasing to listen to.+ There is no linearity to it, well there is but you're free to tackle various areas at your leisure.+ Puzzles are both easy and incredibly challenging.  + Sandbox style freedom to explore the world.  It's not very large but the amount of rooms can make you forget where to go or where you've been.Cons:- There is very little if any backstory but some may say none is needed with just how odd and abstract the setting is.- Some puzzles are a little too tough because they go completely unexplained or not elluded to.Overall I would rate this game a solid 8/10.  If you're into puzzles and don't mind exploring abstract scenery with no AI interaction then this game is 100% worth it at it's price.  On sale even better.  I highly recommend it.			"

												I bought this on sale for less than 1€, but I'd happily have paid the full price for it. it's an extremely minimalistic game, don't buy it if you absolutely need captivating plots, high-end graphics and complex gameplay or you'd be disappointed. the game is a fascinating journey through a beautifully designed surrealistic world. a really fitting ambient soundtrack adds a lot to the experience. if you've ever played Hiversaires and enjoyed it you'll really like this game as well (if you haven't go and play it). despite the 90s-like 3d graphics I was more than once amazed by the haunting and eerie scenarios and architecture of the game. along the journey you have to solve puzzles to proceed, which are decent, full of satisfying eureka-moments and quite never frustrating. it's a pretty short game tho, it took me less than 3 hours to get to the final credits, but still there were a couple of optional puzzles I didn't solve and some secrets I discovered that suggest there is something more if you find them all, so I might get back to it one day. one last note: most of the negative reviews complain about the lack of a plot and clear instructions. well I liked that instead, it's a plot device itself that adds to the unsettling feel of the game. you're thrown in without any explanation and are left with more questions than answers. picture it as a dream, no one is there to tell you where you are, what is happening and what you have to do, you just accept it and go on, and it's beautiful that way.overall solid 7.5/10, would play again.

												A very atmospheric game both visually and audibly, making for a pleasurable journey to the end. Although puzzle based the puzzles are not so hard (or just guesswork based) as to be annoying. With a little thought all but a couple of the puzzles can be solved in reasonable amount of time (and those that can't belong to the 'achievements' section, so they do not hinder you from completing the game).   I loved the pace of this game, the feeling of being somewhere that matters, perhaps because the game hints through its imagery that the place is somehow significant and that you aren't just wandering around without meaning. There was no rush, no one chasing and it was easy to get from point to point without a lot of walking.  Kairo is a relaxing game to play. Enjoyable too.			"

												This has been quite an experience.  I wasn't expecting nearly so much out of a little game I picked up on a whim.  According to walkthroughs, Kairo can be finished in just a half an hour if you know what you're doing, but I spent hours going through it.  The puzzles are indeed difficult at times, but what slowed me down the most was just stopping to gawk at the architecture.  It's just simple geometry and the textures are concrete, concrete and more concrete, yet somehow it's really amazing to look at.  The intense colored lighting and sheer emptiness of the massive, enigmatic spaces you get to wander through really hit with impact.  What really makes the environment pull you in though is the music.  Kairo has by far some of the best ambient background music I've ever heard.  Definitely play with good headphones if you've get 'em.  I'm officially starting my Steam category of games to go back and play again when the Oculus Rift comes out.  It's really difficult to describe the unique feeling and atmosphere of Kairo's world, but here's the best I can do:  Does anyone remember the bizarre, abstract and often borderline incoherent art-house style computer animation that occasionally showed up on TV in the late 80s and early 90s?  It's like that, but with more thinking.Gameplay consists mostly of puzzles and exploration, and both are quite rewarding.  A lot of the puzzle give that sort of Myst vibe at first glance (ie. ""here are some random shapes and levers, have fun and see you in a couple hours"")  but I found all of them to be fair and some were even a bit intuitive.  There were several that seemed totally abstract like they should have been frustrating to figure out, and I'm not sure if I just got lucky but the answers always clicked in my head after a bit of twiddling.  With so many puzzle types being redone to death in adventure games, it's good to see some totally new concepts that work.  My only real gripe with the puzzles are the fake ones.  Or at least apparently fake ones; I'm really not sure.  There were several rooms I faffed about in for ages before pulling up the in-game hint system to find out the room was just ""here to play around with, mostly.""  Mostly?  That's just lovely.  There were two places I recall getting this ""hint"", and they were the only two places I had to resort to using the hint system.  And then the hint is basically ""this room is just here to waste your time. OR IS IT?""  Oh just♥♥♥♥♥♥off and tell me, is it or is it not a room with no purpose?  Again, just a minor gripe since I moved on when I got the aforementioned hint.There were a few other minor nitpicks I had after finishing the game, but nothing major.  There were some pretty glaring geometry glitches like hairline cracks, overlapping brushwork, misaligned textures, missing faces, and gaps that looked like they weren't supposed to be there.  Higher resolution textures could have really improved the look of a few areas too in my opinion.  Finally, while I loved the music throughout the game itself, the ending theme just didn't fit.  It's not bad or anything, but it was jarringly different from everything heard up to that point which I think detracted a bit from the final sequence.  Just my opinion.  Again, all minor things not worth too much thought.All in all, Kairo is a unique concept with some changelling puzzles and a fun bit of easter egg hunting, but it was also an unforgettable and immersive experience I won't soon forget.  It might be a bit obtuse at times for some, but if you're up for some creative problem solving in a fascinating setting, you can't do much better than this.  Hope there's more like it someday soon.

												Very enjoyable, atmospheric and impressive environments.  Interesting puzzles, only one of which I had to look up.  Nice spooky atmosphere and music.  Great experience for a low price (especially as I got it for 80% off).  The screenshots say it all really.  The puzzles were not too difficult but certainly felt quite different to the usual ones I find in games, and fit in nicely with the atmosphere.Does not work well with 3D Vision unfortunately, which would have been great for immersion into this sort of game.  Still looks very nice in 2D, I took at least 200 screenshots.Definitely recommend this game if the look of the images on the store page, and the prospect of puzzles in this sort of environment inspire any interest.Have found what seems to be one of the endings, but looks like there may yet be several puzzles to find and complete.

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2015/06/14/kairo/Kairo is a puzzle exploration game. You travel the world of Kairo, trying to move forward and get to the next door… and the next… and the next.The graphics are simple – smooth and coloured walls will keep you company. It gives the game a cold and sinister feel. I felt small and lost, running around in large buildings, trying to get out.You have no inventory, no set of tools to help you out. Instead you unlock your surroundings by how and where you move and what you do. It’s a very unnerving and immersive experience.It is difficult to explain this game without saying too much. But playing Kairo, I felt like I was the last person in the world, trying desperately to find my way out of a complex I was not meant to be in. If you like first-person explorations games, you should play this one.7/10 "

												I actually had no idea what I was getting into when I got this game, but I am so glad I did. From the very moment I set foot in its loenly and yawning halls I knew it would be an interesting experience. The aesthetic nature of the game is so beautifully executed, it gives you this perfect mix of uneasy tension and soothing zen-like atmosphere. You get the feeling you arent the only person to have wandered these lonely halls, and that the place you find your self in has been waiting for you all along. I loved pondering the nature of the structures you find in this game as much as I did solving the puzzles all the way through. It was definitely worth the time and money, a contained experience that leaves you with an unexpected feeling of wonder. Just get this game to see what Im talking about. Truly a hidden gem on Steam.			"

												Kairo is actually one of the better puzzle games that I've played, blending atmosphere with mystery and tossing a few challenging puzzles in between. Many of the early puzzles are not particularly challenging, mostly consisting of pushing a chair or something, but they do gradually get more challenging. The atmosphere is great, always slightly creepy but not scary. the graphics aren't exactly next gen, but in a manner similar to minecraft, the game itself makes the grainy, blocky, dream world all the more special. Overall, I enjoyed Kairo immensely. I would recommend this to anybody who likes a good puzzle and a good atmosphere (basically, if you liked Portal, you will probably like this too). Totally worth it for the 2 bucks I paid for it.			"

There are some pretty obvious visual errors, but they're all very minor. Nothing gamebreaking, but obvious, such as a few lighting errors and occasional clipping. Those aside, its very visually pleasing. From what I've played, the puzzles are very straight forward, but they aren't mindnumbingly simple or boring. I actually like it from the short amount that I've played it, but I hope that something else happens as the game goes on.			"

												It's a neat little game for what it is.  Some of the puzzles are really difficult and non-intuitive.  We're all used to games holding our hands in the beginning, training us for a little while until things progress in difficulty, but this game doesn't do that.  The puzzles aren't connected in any kind of order.  The level design is minimalistic, serving only to host the puzzles for the most part, more like a tech demo you'd see for a kickstarter project to entice fans.  The ""story"" is purposefully left widely open to player interpretation but it won't blow your mind in any real way.  You can tell the concept that inspired the designer to create the game is there but probably fell short of what he really wanted to do in the final product we're getting.  I could see him making a sequel and really fleshing out something from this game.The game is more artsy and vague than a flowing linear story.  It reminded me of playing Myst back in the day.  You'll find puzzles with solutions located in completely different unrelated areas.  Everything you need to solve the puzzles are located in the game for the most part, but for those of us going into this as a casual time sink just wanting to blast through it will need to look up some solutions to get all the achievements for sure.  If you get it on sale for a couple of dollars it's worth it.  It took longer than I thought it would to complete the game in its entirety, but not in an overly frustrating way.  It was a pleasant surprise.			"

												If you're a myst fan then this will be right up your alley. Stepping out into to the monolithic environments of Kairo is akin to stepping out onto that dock in myst for the first time. Kairo is able to conjur up an atmosphere of loneliness and mystery that really sticks with you the whole game. While basically a walking simulator, there where times that I was simply awestruck by the towering structures and deep shadows the dominate its barren landscape. Aparrently it has oculus support as well, which put this first on the list of things i'm going to play when I finally have the funds to join the VR club. Kairo is also a very decent puzzler, requiring you to pay close attencion to your surroundings in order to peice everything together. While a few of the puzzles can get rather abstract, I never found myself stuck becuase of a handy hint system you can use to cheat if ever need be. For the price you can get it at, this game delivers a unique experience that you won't find anywhere else. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys atmosphere and immersion, and doesn't mind being stumped by a puzzle from time to time.			"

There needs to be a middle ground where you neither recommend for or against. It depends what sort of games you like and what mood you're in.

												Kairo is a beautiful and at times, mildly unnerving experience.  Exploring unnaturally simplistic, geometric landscapes that feel eerie and somewhat alien seems to make the skin crawl a little.  There are times while wandering, I'm made to feel the same way I felt while reading passages of House of Leaves where the author described rooms and corridors larger than the house that contained them.  There's a sense of unease from the environments and sound design that make for an entertaining experience.  May not be the right cup of tea for the metrics obsessed, goal collecting gamers out there, but was well worth it for me, especially at the sale price.			"

												This first-person puzzle game relies on a minimalist, surreal environment to pull you in...but boy does it deliver.  I think if you liked Myst, you'll like this game...wandering around a vast, abandoned landscape fiddling with technology you don't understand.  But the game's not about the fiddling...it's about the wandering and the discovery (you'll know what to fiddle when the time comes).  If you like exploring and the visual style appeals to you (watch the video) then definitely pick this up.I'm going to come back and flesh out this review more, but for now, I want to make a note of the fact that the coolest thing about Kairo, for me, was the ambience of the environments.  It was quite Myst-like in that it created this constant sense of wonder at the surreal landscapes.			"

												I love love love this game. Although this game has a vague story as well as (mostly) strictly geometrical graphics, Kairo use both to its advantage. If you gather the little symbols around the game, it rewards you with a hidden scene. They help answer some questions while also possibly leaving you with more, yet you also get a lot of room to interpret what's happened to the world you come from and the purpose of the world you currently inhabit. The story /is/ quite minimalistic however.I'm a fan of very abstract trippy scenes, and Kairo has a lot of them. Despite the simple shapes that Kairo is constructed of, the creator really did a good job with making the environments interesting. A really strong point in Kairo is the environment coupled with the use of sound. I really love the strangeness that the sound adds to the atmosphere. There are several structures in Kairo that emit static, random arrays of numbers, and other strange noises. Anyway. Yes, I recomend the game. if you like casual exploration and trippy areas to explore, you'll like it.			"

												Kairo is a slow-paced puzzle game in a similar vein to Myst, if Myst didn't have all the annoying pixel-hunting and weren't a point and click game. Its atmosphere is surreal, strange, and overwhelmingly lonesome. That's the big word I think I'd use to describe this game - lonesome, and that lonesomeness becomes more and more eerie the further you go into the game. You are the only living thing in Kairo - everything else is a hollow, dead fascimile, with archetecture eerily reminiscent of human construction and yet alien enough you might think you woke up in R'lyeh. The world of Kairo is a small world that feels massive, alien, and completely dead... and I love it to pieces and back.Wandering through the surreal and beautifully eerie world of Kairo is very relaxing, the puzzles are very intuitive and can easily be solved with a little thought, and the simple design really makes it feel like you're stranded. And yet, solving the puzzles is so satisfying, satisfying in that ""I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed genius!"" sort of way. The range of feelings you get from Kairo goes from triumph, curiosity, and awe to fright, paranoia, and hopelessness - and what is art if not something that makes you feel deeply? Anyone who claims video games aren't art has never played this, and that's a damn shame. Did I mention that the music and the game's design is just so surrealistically gorgeous?Seriously, BUY THIS GAME. It's maybe $5 for a wonderful little piece of surrealistic artwork that recaptures the eerie loneliness and thirst for adventure that Myst did so many years ago in 1992. Kairo is a gem of an indie puzzle game, and anyone who is a fan of surreal artwork, puzzle games, and games where you chill and wander for a bit will love this. You really do owe it to yourself to play it at least once. Who knows? It may become one of your favorite games, just like it has for me.			"

												If you're looking for a deep, challenging puzzle game with an ambiguous and surreal atmosphere, then have another go at using that search box because you seem to have mispelled Antichamber. I wouldn't mention it, except you can't seem to go 5 minutes of reading about this game without it being compared to Antichamber (indeed, this comparison is what brought me to the game in the first place), and I simply can't see why. Kairo is nothing like Antichamber, and if you're expecting it to be then you're about to be sorely disappointed. This is not to say that I didn't like Kairo, as you can presumably tell from the fact that this review is a recommendation. It's just that my initial view of it was tainted because I was constantly trying to compare it to Antichamber, and in that comparison it, like most games, falls very far short.First, the bad. The ""puzzles""  are probably the main thing here. Barring a few rather interesting ones, they can be solved with minimal effort as soon as you work out what each element of the environment actually is. The main problem, I feel is the lack of a central mechanic. With no way to interract with the environment besides standing on things, puzzle design is extremely limited. In the game's defense, it uses this limited capacity well and rarely repeates itself, but nonetheless you will likely find much of the game unchallenging. Furthermore, the much-touted atmosphere is... eh. It's not bad, but it tries too hard to be creepy, which simply doesn't work with the gameplay. There are a few very effective moments, but overall you'll probably find you just don't notice it.However, the game just about makes up for these shortcomings with its stronger points. The environment design is excellent, using a rather minimalist block-based design for buildings which contrasts effectively with the more detailed decoration and interactable objects. Along with providing some spectacular views, this helps greatly with distinguishing puzzle piece from environment and the intuitive level design means you'll have little difficulty with finding your way around. Finally, the ending. Oh the ending. I strongly recommend playing through once to get the normal ending, then finding a guide online and playing through again for the hidden one. It won't have as much of an impact if you didn't play through once blind, but I honestly can't think of a way it could have ended better. Utterly unexpected yet actually carefully foreshadowed, it ties the game together and makes you look at the product as a whole from a completely different angle. Overall, I recommend Kairo, but only just. It makes up for its shortcomings in a number of ways, and it's certainly fairly unique. If you're looking for a challenge (or, like me, something Antichamber-esque), you won't find it. However, if you're looking for an unusual experience that effectively kills a few hours, you could do a lot worse. For only £4, I'd say it's worth the money.			"

												I very much enjoyed this game.  There is not enough like this out there.  The game felt very personal, and there was something about the world that kept you exploring.  The atmosphere was wonderful, and it transports you away to this strange and bizarre world.  The conclusion of the game kept me thinking for a while as to the meaning of the game, and I came to a few conclusions.  That is what makes this a good game, it can be interpreted in many different ways.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys more atmospheric games with mild puzzle solving elements.  Some of the puzzles are very difficult, there is still one that I cannot solve.  The most difficult puzzles are the ones that really demand you to pay attention to your environment.			"

												I quite enjoyed this game. The atmosphere was great, and it looked really cool. However, some of the puzzles were a bit -too- abstract, and for some reason touching a wall caused my framerate to drop dramatically. This got annoying in some areas, espeically being that the controls in this game aren't very tight, even with the settings tweaked. Some areas a a bit bigger than they need to be, so there's a lot of walking to do. Thank goodness there's a sprint button, but it doesn't change your speed that much. This game has very little replay value, unless you're one of those people who want to painstakingly go through every nook and cranny to find these tiny symbols tucked in corners of the levels.I think the game was trying to tell me a story, but I didn't get any sort of feeling of resolution at the end, unless I am supposed to find all those little symbols. That sounds absolutely miserable though. That would be like playing a 3d eye spy game. I have better things to do with my life.Overall, I enjoyed the game. Puzzles were nice, except for a few, which were really stupidly hard. The game is not that long at all, so these few dark spots really put a dent in the overall experience.I almost gave this a thumbs down, but at the end of the day, it did hold my attention, and I did say twice in this review that I enjoyed it, so it gets a thumbs up from me. But just barely.			"

												Okay, let's get one thing out of the way first: this game does not look good. The trailer above kinda oversells the graphics — they're not minimalistic, they're cheap.That being said, everything else about Kairo is great.Distant cousin of Myst, this game is comprised mostly of puzzles. And there is a compelling diversity in these: some are very easy, some are very difficult; some totally straightforward, some mind-bendingly abstract; and of course everything in between. This makes the progression always enticing and never boring. The level design is very cool despite the poor graphics and each level has its own unique feel, the whole game being very ""atmospheric"". This is brilliantly reinforced by the marvelous sound design, with a really, really awesome music that transported me from puzzle to puzzle in a dream-like state.Thanks to all these strenghts, Kairo manages to be at the same time fun and relaxing. It is a journey, really, in a land full of mysteries and secrets, where lots of questions are raised and no explanations given — you make your own conclusions from the scarce clues given along the path.I have no idea how to grade it out of ten, but I am positive that I'd recommend it in a heartbeat to pretty much anyone. The only major flaw that I would point out is the absence of V-Sync which allows some MASSIVE tearing to occur. And the Field of View is rendered in layers, which looks kinda awful. But other than that, well... What's not to like? You like puzzles? Get it. Like ""moody"" games? It's a good one. Like quality OSTs? This one's perfect. You like Myst? Don't hesitate! There even is a skeleton hidden somewhere. Spooky!			"

												IMPORTANT: When you hit the normal ending, wait for the credits to play out. They're not long.Pros:- Puzzles become interesting when you have no ""hand"" or ""activate"" controls. By limiting the player to mere movement controls, old puzzles feel fresh, and there's an extra sense of accomplishment with even fairly simple puzzles.- The environment's minimalist polygon theme manages, surprisingly, to stay varied, interesting, and even evokative throughout the game, contributing to the theme of ""strange and yet familiar"" that pervades.- Difficulty to normal end is low, difficulty to secret end is high.- No penalty for exploration, experimentation, or taking your time.- Overall, definitely enjoyable.Cons:- The ""story"" aspect is a little too vague. You paid $5, folks, this ain't Myst or Portal. While there are enough ""clues"" that a player can vaguely put together a plot (and considerably more blatant clues as rewards for solving secret puzzles), there's plenty that's just left to imagination.- The mechanic that resets you to a safe ledge can glitch considerably, leaving you in a fall-to-your-death loop, though this can be solved by exiting the game and reloading.- One of the final secret puzzles is actually impossible to solve on your own. Your game will have 1/5 of the solution, and which fifth is chosen at random. So you're either going to need lots of friends, or cheat and look at a walkthrough.Final Note: Don't take my playtime as a good guide to the runthrough time of this game. I got irritated and consulted a walkthrough for two of the secret puzzles and half the rune locations.			"

												I got this game for $1. And I'm glad I scooped it up! A great puzzle/exploration game with enigmas abound.GAMEPLAY: Consists of walking, jumping, and looking around. It's straightforward exploration with minor platforming. Puzzles round out the play, which you complete by stepping on platforms and bumping into objects to trigger them.PUZZLES: They're pretty intuitive for the most part, but there were a few I had to consult the helpfully provided ""hints"" option for (one in particular was hair rippingly frustrating because I'm terrible at math). Be prepared to comb areas carefully for clues, and draw out some diagrams here and there. It's quite satisfying to solve these puzzles, as they're fairly challenging, and it's made clear when you have activated a piece of machinery or opened a pathway by way of flashing lights, thunderous tumults, or loud gong strikes. It all amounts to a feeling of progress and getting one step closer to solving the mystery.VISUALS: Very minimalistic. Oftentimes, you wander through barren corridors or empty voids, with sparsely a decoration to look at. What there is to look at, though, serves to deepen the mystery. It feels like everything being presented - from images of Earth to the DNA double helix - has some type of underlying meaning. Otherwise, lighting and colouring is used to differentiate rooms, creating a very surreal effect. There's also some use of moving objects - floating, spinning globes, for example - that add some variance. In all, it's simplistic, but only where it needs to be.AUDIO: The highlight of the game for me. Again, simplicity is the standard here - a haunting, ambient soundtrack makes the place feel mysterious, dangerous, and cozy all at once. It's a strange effect, but it keeps the player guessing as to what, exactly, these structures are. As mentioned before, loud, sudden bells and gongs are used to indicate that the player has completed a puzzle, which is pretty satisfying. Radio static in certain locations and chimes during object interaction round out the auditory experience. Like the graphics, it feels like the sounds of the game highlight what's important.STORY: Ostensibly, there isn't much of one. There is virtually no dialogue or cutscenes, and there are no NPCs present. Only environmental clues, mainly through recurring motifs, give rise to some semblance of a plot. I enjoyed wondering what Kairo could be about, and reading theories about it afterward.Overall, a great experience, which is even nicer considering I got this game for $1. It reminded me a lot of Myst (and Penumbra, somehow). There are mysteries to be unravelled for those willing to search for them.			"

												Minimalist, abstract, and esoteric. I picked up a copy of Kairo because it was on sale and it looked interesting and played it through to completion (with the help of a guide to point me in the direction of my objectives, I admit. They're not that obvious some of the time).Kairo manages to combine my two least favorite things in a game: slippery controls and almost required sprinting. In-game you can hear your footsteps so I know my feet weren't covered in oil... but it certainly felt like it. Many of the areas are expansive, which is cool, but if you want to try to complete the game the way I did you will need to backtrack through areas you've already visited. At times like these I found myself holding down the sprint key just to get through these areas as fast as possible. After about an hour of this, my left hand is pretty sore.On the positive side the environments were cool and my favorite puzzle mechanic- the block puzzles where you have to stand in a certain position in the room to solve them- didn't feel like it was used often enough. I think there's enough in that idea alone to make an entire game out of, should the developer give it a try.That said I cannot, in good faith, recommend Kairo. Not at full price, anyway. Five bucks for a ~3 hour game that's uncomfortable to play during the second half isn't a great deal by any stretch of the imagination.			"

												Kairo is really one of a kind game. It takes a little time to absorb you into its world, but once it does it never lets you leave it. It's an adventure/puzzle game which is kind of easy to finish but extremely hard to master. There is so much hidden stuff in this game that you'll want to play it again and again. Yet, none of its puzzles is obvious or easy to be seen. Kairo's alien world is extrordinary unique and beautiful on its own and feels like it came out from 2001's monolith. "

												As an abstract puzzle game, Kairo is great.  The gameplay is simple yet challenging, and the built-in hint system is helpful enough to point you in the right direction when you're stuck without outright spoiling the puzzle.  However, I think the abstract design makes the story hard to follow (and leaves the player to guess); after finishing the game, I wasn't really sure what it was all about.  Still, that doesn't detract from the gameplay.  If you enjoy puzzle games and want something a little different, I would definitely recommend Kairo.Pros:- Otherworldly/alien environment.- Engaging, abstract, and unique puzzles.- Good music, which helps set a somewhat ominous and somber tone.Cons:- The story was a little *too* abstract.- Keyboard controls are not remappable, or even listed in full.  For example, the ""R"" key resets you to the room entrance, but I found that completely by accident.- There is no way to see your progress on collecting the hidden glyphs, except by collecting more of the glyphs.  I would like to have seen my current progress when the game is paused (such as how the map is displayed).			"

												If you're a myst fan then this will be right up your alley. Stepping out into to the monolithic environments of Kairo is akin to stepping out onto that dock in myst for the first time. Kairo is able to conjur up an atmosphere of loneliness and mystery that really sticks with you the whole game. While basically a walking simulator, there where times that I was simply awestruck by the towering structures and deep shadows the dominate its barren landscape. Aparrently it has oculus support as well, which put this first on the list of things i'm going to play when I finally have the funds to join the VR club. Kairo is also a very decent puzzler, requiring you to pay close attencion to your surroundings in order to peice everything together. While a few of the puzzles can get rather abstract, I never found myself stuck becuase of a handy hint system you can use to cheat if ever need be. For the price you can get it at, this game delivers a unique experience that you won't find anywhere else. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys atmosphere and immersion, and doesn't mind being stumped by a puzzle from time to time.			"

												Well, that was dissapointing.To summarize: The game is too much walking, and too little to do. The graphic style becomes boring too soon. That would not matter if you had plenty of things to do on every level, but you don't. It's as simple as that: you'll spend too much time walking and too little time doing real stuff.Besides that, the game shows poor coding. The mouse and keyboard movement don't feel smooth, and such minimalistic graphics should be piece of cake for my computer, but no matter how much I lower the resolution, the framerate is never as high as the one I get on Mass Effect of FEAR 2. There's clearly something wrong in a game with such simple graphics if Mass Effect runs better.			"

												Kairo is a beautiful and at times, mildly unnerving experience.  Exploring unnaturally simplistic, geometric landscapes that feel eerie and somewhat alien seems to make the skin crawl a little.  There are times while wandering, I'm made to feel the same way I felt while reading passages of House of Leaves where the author described rooms and corridors larger than the house that contained them.  There's a sense of unease from the environments and sound design that make for an entertaining experience.  May not be the right cup of tea for the metrics obsessed, goal collecting gamers out there, but was well worth it for me, especially at the sale price.			"

												Kairo is an interesting, if ultimately slight, atmospheric puzzle game.  The artwork is all rectangles and circles and simple geometric shapes.  The music exists simply to generate atmosphere.  There is no ""plot,"" but rather a series of puzzles that are to be completed simply because they exist.  The puzzles are generally fairly easy, although there are no real instructions and most of the puzzles require you to use your surroundings to figure out what to do.  In addition the ""secret"" puzzles are a pretty big step up in difficulty and will likely resort to the user having to consult a guide.All of that said, the game succeeds with what it's trying to do.  The atmosphere is engrossing and engaging and the game is neither too easy or too difficult.  It's really a shame it was only 3-4 hours long, 'cause I think it could have been twice as long and not worn out its welcome.Rating: 8/10			"

												This game didn't take too long to finish, but somehow I managed to wait for months in between sessions and forget what was going on.  So I would NOT do that, were I to live life a second time.This game has a few REALLY killer puzzles, and I am a snob about puzzles, so that is saying something.  I think the number one thing that made this game work is it's utter abstractness.  Many of the best puzzles were fairly simple tasks, but understanding how the mechanisms worked was a challending and engaging task, simply because of the lack of context.One of the most interesting and unique things about this game is the cool control scheme in which the position where you are standing affects the state of the world.  This is used in a variety of ways, and it somehow manages to make very simple puzzles a lot more engaging.On the down side, this game was definitely lacking in polish.  Movement was slightly glitchy - especially going up stairs and jumping off walls (which I'm not sure you were supposed to be able to do at all).  There were often cheap looking cracks between blocks that didn't quite touch.  Some icons looked like poorly clipped .pngs.  Just a little rough around the edges.Also the ""story"" kept getting devastatingly interesting, and then leaving you hanging.  Ending was super weird (secret ending was even weirder.  But no, I didn't get it, I watched it on youtube :P)			"

												There are two ways to approach Kairo. The first is to view it as a meditative experience in an open world with many soothing  environments and lots of exploration. The second view is to see it as a string of puzzles that need to be solved to complete and beat the game.You'll enjoy it either way you view it. If you decide to explore, you will see many different areas, and come to love the fact that you can hide away in the world of Kairo and relax after a long day. Walk around in the Park, look at the alien structures, and relax to the calm sounds of water rushing, or birds chirping.And if you take it as a string of puzzles, you will be challenged with a system with no interaction button, with clues to guide you when you are lost. You will push things, pull things, and eventually get the machines that govern the world of Kairo running.And be treated to a delightful and uplifting ending.			"

												Kairo is a beautifully eerie shapescape that combines original style with familiar puzzle questing.  It is a simple yet aw- filled atmospheric journey that takes place in this supernatural-like world you've stumbled upon. Pros: + Increadible atmosphere.  Sometimes even daunting to look at with the great depth of field use by the dev.   + Music is more like a drone in various keys and melodies.  It's unique and quite pleasing to listen to.+ There is no linearity to it, well there is but you're free to tackle various areas at your leisure.+ Puzzles are both easy and incredibly challenging.  + Sandbox style freedom to explore the world.  It's not very large but the amount of rooms can make you forget where to go or where you've been.Cons:- There is very little if any backstory but some may say none is needed with just how odd and abstract the setting is.- Some puzzles are a little too tough because they go completely unexplained or not elluded to.Overall I would rate this game a solid 8/10.  If you're into puzzles and don't mind exploring abstract scenery with no AI interaction then this game is 100% worth it at it's price.  On sale even better.  I highly recommend it.			"

												An experience I'd recommend everyone trying.Put aside thoughts of '2deep4me' when looking at this game because the challenging puzzles and the game's many secrets are the main attraction.Kairo's atmosphere is perfectly crafted. Despite not being a horror game, you can expect to get shivers down your spine when coming across new areas and interacting with the many objects within the game's world.Speaking of Kairo's world, as you solve more puzzles and discover hidden secrets the world around you evolves to further signify what you've achieved. This is truely a wonderful puzzle game.Many thanks to Sorun for sharing the steam key to this game. I probably would have never came across Kairo otherwise.			"

												An extremely underrated game -- period. This game boasts a power to enthrall and captivate you, without needing an actual story the game almost speaks to you on a mystical level. The puzzles aren't easy but not too difficult, and there are very creative ideas put into it. The game also has intresting architecture and mysterious entities. It is a game that pulls you out of reality and puts you into this weird, but neat sublime world. I would say that this game is kinda like a more linear based LSD: Dream Simulator for the PS1 with puzzles. They both provoke unique mystery in an intresting and meaningful way. An excellent game for the price, I highly recommend it!			"

												Kairo is a great little game with really nice logic puzzles that aren't too difficult but requires some thinking. The game hints at a story but it's very vague and it could just as well have no story. The thing I really loved about Kairo was the atmosphere it created, it made me feel very isolated and small because the levels were usually very big and empty and it had a very minimalist environment. The atmosphere got creepy at times as things such as static on the screen would flare up and number station recordings would play as you got closer to certain areas. The game always had me questioning things, because sometimes strange objects or symbols would be around and it would make me want to know why they were there or what they meant. I also liked the ambient music as that too helped with the atmosphere and it fits right into the game.			"

It has this Myst esc quality of loneliness that adds an faint errie feel as you explore this giant place alone. It's really not a puzzle game in my book but just an interactive experience. There diffenetly is gameplay though. Some of the puzzles are frustrating and running between map to map is sometimes tedius, but I would not hesitate to reccomend this.			"

												It's a neat little game for what it is.  Some of the puzzles are really difficult and non-intuitive.  We're all used to games holding our hands in the beginning, training us for a little while until things progress in difficulty, but this game doesn't do that.  The puzzles aren't connected in any kind of order.  The level design is minimalistic, serving only to host the puzzles for the most part, more like a tech demo you'd see for a kickstarter project to entice fans.  The ""story"" is purposefully left widely open to player interpretation but it won't blow your mind in any real way.  You can tell the concept that inspired the designer to create the game is there but probably fell short of what he really wanted to do in the final product we're getting.  I could see him making a sequel and really fleshing out something from this game.The game is more artsy and vague than a flowing linear story.  It reminded me of playing Myst back in the day.  You'll find puzzles with solutions located in completely different unrelated areas.  Everything you need to solve the puzzles are located in the game for the most part, but for those of us going into this as a casual time sink just wanting to blast through it will need to look up some solutions to get all the achievements for sure.  If you get it on sale for a couple of dollars it's worth it.  It took longer than I thought it would to complete the game in its entirety, but not in an overly frustrating way.  It was a pleasant surprise.			"

It's a semi-complex first person puzzle game that boasts a stylish yet minimalistic design that keeps you intrigued. Albeit, at times, the graphics can look a bit bland or bad, I overlook the aforementioned flaws because of how interesting the game is. A few of the puzzles actually require a bit of thinking as opposed to just flat out putting pieces wherever you feel they go. Luckily, there is a hint option in the pause screen. I had been eyeing this game for a while and saw it go on sale a couple of days ago. I highly recommend this game if you are intrigued by visual puzzles.			"

												I got about 7 hours out of this game, and for the price I got it at ($0.99 while on sale), I would have to say that it is definitely one of the more enjoyable puzzle games I've played recently. It manages to do a lot of things without using too much, and it does it quite well. I can definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to pick it up.That being said, be warned in advance, this game is not easy. Some of the puzzles are rather difficult to figure out, and a few even require back tracking at a much later date. You will also probably need a guide if you intend to 100% this game. My advice, is try to do your first run as bare bones as possible, consulting the guide as little as possible, just to experience the game. Then, you can speed run through it the second time grabbing all the things you missed your first run through.			"

												Kairo is beautiful, plain and simple. It is an adventure from the begining. Not because of the adrenaline injections most games rely on and many gamers are addicted to. Everything is so carefully placed as to invoke a sense of haunting and ancient beauty. The game reminds me of a ghost story. Your character is in search of a ghost (let's say the ghost of his wife.) His search has led him to the ancient temple where all spirits reside. He must return life to all of the spirits in the temple to find his wife. Bad fanfiction aside, this game is pure genius and I want all of my friends to play it.			"

Yes game, when walk through your rooms I appreciate your post-modernist, minimalist design that recalls Egyptian, Chinese and Classical art. But when you place these puzzle-less rooms in between the puzzles, you're really hurting the pacing. Though for $0.74 (as of this writing) , I definitely recommend picking it up. The puzzles are just challenging enough and if you have trouble the game has a pretty generous hint system.			"

												A very atmospheric game both visually and audibly, making for a pleasurable journey to the end. Although puzzle based the puzzles are not so hard (or just guesswork based) as to be annoying. With a little thought all but a couple of the puzzles can be solved in reasonable amount of time (and those that can't belong to the 'achievements' section, so they do not hinder you from completing the game).   I loved the pace of this game, the feeling of being somewhere that matters, perhaps because the game hints through its imagery that the place is somehow significant and that you aren't just wandering around without meaning. There was no rush, no one chasing and it was easy to get from point to point without a lot of walking.  Kairo is a relaxing game to play. Enjoyable too.			"

												If you want a tl;dr of my review, it's basically just ""If you like atmospheric exploration games, buy it"".My ACTUAL review is:Kairo is an interesting game to say the least, I feel like there was an actual vision behind the developer and for the most part I think his vision came through, however the limited resources he had are fatally apparent. The film grain effect is just a static overlay that feels more distracting than stylistic, and while early areas of the game are very visually engaging and seem like they have a plan and purpose behind their layout, later areas just feel slapped together, using almost random geometric shapes and often just feel like the design had little to no thought at all. A fair amount of rooms have a purposefully grand scale, which is usually unnessicary considering you have to run back and forth in them to solve a puzzle. Of course this might be a purposeful choice to evoke a specific emotion from that level, I just felt pulled out of the experience. Now obviously I can't review a game without discussing how it plays and the mechanics, which also sadly fall flat. The game only gives you three commands, the ability to look, jump, and sprint. Nothing else. This is sometimes problematic to solving puzzles as you need to physically touch certain objects in order to ""activate"" them. While feeling awkward by itself, the player has a sort of floaty momentum to them that is accentuated by the fact you need to ram into objects to solve puzzles, which are also obtuse. There are different symbols used to differentiate switches, but the logic behind them often changes. Sometimes they're supposed to be literal, as in you have to activate the exact sime switch, but sometimes they're representations of numbers, which is confusing when the rest of the game had been using a literal interpretation. Luckily there is a hint system built in, which solves most of my gripes with the presentation not being very clear.All in all, I feel like this game needs a lot of polish, but is still worth the price, especially if it's on sale.

												Kairo is a game of many feelings and has a fantastic atmosphere.The puzzles were occasionally frustruating, but not unreasonably difficult. The environments are simple yet so elegant in their design. There were parts that unnerved me, and parts that made me happy. There is definitely some scary parts. I still get chills whenever I approach a statue that puts out the sound of static, and this effect has carried in to other games.  The soundtrack is awesome, the gameplay is solid, certainly worth 5.50 if you're in to atmospheric puzzle games.			"

												Not for fans of the normal, A must play for fans of the sureal.much like a Painting does not tell you a naritive as much as set a tone, Kiro works in the same way.Imagine strolling through a Impressionist painting like Dega or Monet or Manate or a more modern peice like Salvador Dali.The ""Levels"" are like cubist paintings pulled into 3 dimentions. There is no solid naritive but their are objectives a clues.If you ""dont see the point in modern art"" and prefer complex gameplay this might seem to drag on . But any art student, design student, or artist in any form Should apreceate art removed to it's basic but a complex use of shapes. and gameplay stripped down to simple interation with complex puzzles.A visual Poem set in a tomb			"

												I liked it. The game has a nice surreal ambiance and sorta eerie music. You walk through majestic and mysterious places solving puzzles, some simple, some that might need a google search. Only once did I actually need a google search to help me solve a puzzle (turns out i was right about how to solve it, was just applying it incorrectly). Solving every secret and puzzle, especially those not required to beat the game, will definitely take an internet search to finish.Gameplay only requires moving and the rare jump and nothing else. There are no other requirements, all puzzles are solved with simply walking, and buttons/interactive objects are used simply by walking up to/on them. The simplicity of both gameplay and the story telling is not for everyone, but I personally loved the game.I would recommend this game for people who enjoying exploring and doing unrequired things in games and also enjoy puzzles and deep thinking. If you prefer very linear and directed gameplay or don't enjoy going outside of the main story to explore, you probably will dislike the game.			"

												A great game. It feels like it is a spiritual successor to the original Myst in the way it make you feel isolated and small in a mysterious world. The puzzles are sufficiently difficult as to be rewarding to solve, but they are not as frustratingly vague as they can initially appear. All in all, it is a short but enjoyable game to play.			"

												An unique exploration game. There are no tutorials. Just explore. Find things. Solve puzzles. And gradually, you will start to understand the beautiful world of Kairo. But the game is kinda hardcore, and maybe you will need a guide in order to discover everything. But if you're struck, don't give up! Because this world is so rewarding. But to new players, it's sink or swim. Let's hope it's the latter.			"

												Kairo is a slightly flawed gem of a first-person walking and exploration game. It requires a bit of investment to stay interested in the beginning, but if you're into discovery and piecing together parts of a mystery, it eventually rewards that patience.In the beginning, you appear in Kairo with no explanation of who you are, where you are, what its or your purpose is, and no apparent indication of what you should do next, other than possibly head towards the one visible structure in the distance. Hints as to possible answers to all of those questions gradually unfold as you proceed through the three main levels of the game. Ultimately, the game never concretely answers any of those questions, but gives you enough (especially if you're determined to hunt down and unlock all of its sometimes-obscure riddles) to put together your guess, your interpretation of what you've just been through. For some this may be frustrating, not to know the absolute official canon truth of the matter, but I see it as one of the game's strengths in creating a real sense of mystery. This is not your typical berk-without-a-past-uncovers-his-past story—however much you discover, you remain without a past.The game suffers from some minor flaws in execution—the occasional video clipping problem in tight spaces, oddly getting stuck on stairs and needing to jump to continue, footstep sounds that are weirdly unsynchronized to your movement—that reflect a slight lack of polish. For me, these minor issues pale in comparison to what the game achieves artistically. It manages to create, through the grand scale of its environments, the use of colour, and its moody, atmospheric soundtrack, a feeling of being very small and alone in an intimidating, unknown world which is somehow broken and needs fixing. The puzzles involved in the fixing range from trivial to frustratingly obscure, but for the impatient there are guides and walkthroughs, and for the determined, there's a great sense of accomplishment in untangling the secret.

												A friend of mine showed me this game a while back, he bought it for me and I'm glad he did. I really enjoyed the puzzles and how it looked, especially the grain filter, that gave it a really interesting feel. The game is not horror at all, though it can be a bit spooky due to the environment and the sounds, but thats what I loved about it. The game also had a Myst feel to it, if anyone reading this actually knows what that game is. Sure this game may seem strange at first, but give it a try, you might actually like it! Definitely worth the price.			"

												Kairo is a slow-paced puzzle game in a similar vein to Myst, if Myst didn't have all the annoying pixel-hunting and weren't a point and click game. Its atmosphere is surreal, strange, and overwhelmingly lonesome. That's the big word I think I'd use to describe this game - lonesome, and that lonesomeness becomes more and more eerie the further you go into the game. You are the only living thing in Kairo - everything else is a hollow, dead fascimile, with archetecture eerily reminiscent of human construction and yet alien enough you might think you woke up in R'lyeh. The world of Kairo is a small world that feels massive, alien, and completely dead... and I love it to pieces and back.Wandering through the surreal and beautifully eerie world of Kairo is very relaxing, the puzzles are very intuitive and can easily be solved with a little thought, and the simple design really makes it feel like you're stranded. And yet, solving the puzzles is so satisfying, satisfying in that ""I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed genius!"" sort of way. The range of feelings you get from Kairo goes from triumph, curiosity, and awe to fright, paranoia, and hopelessness - and what is art if not something that makes you feel deeply? Anyone who claims video games aren't art has never played this, and that's a damn shame. Did I mention that the music and the game's design is just so surrealistically gorgeous?Seriously, BUY THIS GAME. It's maybe $5 for a wonderful little piece of surrealistic artwork that recaptures the eerie loneliness and thirst for adventure that Myst did so many years ago in 1992. Kairo is a gem of an indie puzzle game, and anyone who is a fan of surreal artwork, puzzle games, and games where you chill and wander for a bit will love this. You really do owe it to yourself to play it at least once. Who knows? It may become one of your favorite games, just like it has for me.			"

												I quite enjoyed this game. The atmosphere was great, and it looked really cool. However, some of the puzzles were a bit -too- abstract, and for some reason touching a wall caused my framerate to drop dramatically. This got annoying in some areas, espeically being that the controls in this game aren't very tight, even with the settings tweaked. Some areas a a bit bigger than they need to be, so there's a lot of walking to do. Thank goodness there's a sprint button, but it doesn't change your speed that much. This game has very little replay value, unless you're one of those people who want to painstakingly go through every nook and cranny to find these tiny symbols tucked in corners of the levels.I think the game was trying to tell me a story, but I didn't get any sort of feeling of resolution at the end, unless I am supposed to find all those little symbols. That sounds absolutely miserable though. That would be like playing a 3d eye spy game. I have better things to do with my life.Overall, I enjoyed the game. Puzzles were nice, except for a few, which were really stupidly hard. The game is not that long at all, so these few dark spots really put a dent in the overall experience.I almost gave this a thumbs down, but at the end of the day, it did hold my attention, and I did say twice in this review that I enjoyed it, so it gets a thumbs up from me. But just barely.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a some kind of a puzzle walk simulator game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThe game will only ask you for the language once. There are 5 different languages.There are many different resolution sizes available.There is a volume slidebar available.There is a look sensitivty available.You can play with a xbox controller.About the game.So you are dropped into this game and you will have no clue what it is about or what to do. Most of the puzzles are pretty annoying and the game feel really bland. Even if you have manage to complete a puzzle, you will not feel that you will get rewarded for it. You will feel that you are just playing a boring walking simulator game with no impacts and progression at all.Graphics are not catchy and boring.Sound is minimalistic.Clunky control movement.Character is ""sliding"" and not walking.There are hints available.Feels really bland/empty.Other things.None.-------------------I Give this game a 2/10			"

												Even if the bland and desolate landscapes compliment the theme of the game, at some points it was taken too far and made some parts quite a chore. The storyline puzzles were of good difficulty, but for the hidden puzzles I had to consult a guide. Perhaps they would've been doable with careful note taking. The runes were of OK difficulty, although I only realized they existed at the end of the first area.Ran smoothly on my 2955U (1.4 GHz dualcore) 2GB RAM machine using the PS3 SIXAXIS controller via xboxdrv. Controls were decent enough, although the character had quite a bit of momentum. In my opinion the run could've been used by default while holding a button had made the character walk.TL;DR: A decent game if you like some FPS adventuring and puzzle solving. Bought at a discount, but even the asking price isn't bad for what the game offers.			"

												I enjoyed kairo. It was a really cool puzzle game, and although it was really short, I was satisfied with it. The abstract minimalist environments and the great music really added to the atmosphere of the game. That being said, the normal ending was pretty bad, but I don't think that's reason enough for a negative review. You should buy this game if you like stylish games like journey or abzu, but for people who like puzzle solving games, the puzzles in this one are a bit easy and tedious at times.			"

												It's like Dark Souls if you took out the RPG stuff and replaced it with puzzles. Explore some sort of ruins, fix some machines and hope for the best, and hopefully figure out what's going on.You get what you pay for, though, and this really is only worth about a tenth of a AAA title at best. There are similarly priced games that are more bang for your bulk, but there's something to be said for lighter fare. It's like getting a salad instead of a burger. Buy at your own discretion, but it would make a good thing to show someone not very into gaming, like a kid or a parent.			"

												Kairo pales drastically in comparison to critically acclaimed success, Myst: a game of similar presentation and design caliber, created with a modest budget for its time, and which made a far greater impact on the gaming world. Kairo takes any and all reason that could (and frankly should) be percieved within a puzzle game, wipes its proverbial posterior with it, and readily hands it back to you with a childish snigger. What facets of Kairo that would seem to lead towards some sort of explanation is eerily creepy and unsatisfactory because it doesn't explain a single thing. I found it a disappointment and a borderline insult to the puzzle game genre.			"
