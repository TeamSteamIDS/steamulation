Full Disclosure: Hot Tin Roof was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer. Video review embedded below. Buried under its tortuous level designs, needlessly convoluted mechanics, and overly ambitious plot, there’s the game Hot Tin Roof wanted to be.A quirky mixed of film noir, classical adventure games, and exploration focused platformers, it’s full of heart but lacking in direction. It attempts to blend so many styles of play as to end up degrading all of them with an unfocused design that often left me confused and frustrated, wondering how such a promising start had spiralled into a mess of half-finished concepts.Hot Tin Roof follows Emma Jones and her sidekick cat, Franky, two up and coming detectives thrown onto their first case when a wealthy business man is murdered and his will stolen. Events quickly become much larger in scope however as the murders start piling up, fingers are pointed, and Emma and Franky are the only ones seemingly capable of doing anything about it.While Hot Tin Roof’s setup is lovingly reminiscent of classic detective films, it has trouble piecing its plot together between its opening and closing moments. Events and clues are presented in an anachronistic, disorienting manner which often accidentally discloses key plot points before you’re meant to understand them. It commits a cardinal sin of any whodunit narrative, by only ever introducing important elements when they’re immediately relevant to the mystery at hand and thus degrading the impact of seeing how the pieces fit together in the end. I was constantly being clued in on the happenings of characters I’d never been introduced to, relationships that seemed to spring up out of thin air, and revelations that I didn’t understand the significance of. Everything comes together in a way that feels agonizingly contrived and stretched too thin, as if originally intended as multiple stories haphazardly bundled together for a shocking last minute reveal of how everything is connected. Only in this case I already knew what was happening, I just wasn’t allowed to proceed until the game realized it too.Maybe what’s more disappointing than what Hot Tin Roof tries and often fails to do with its plot, is everything it leaves on the table. The elements I found most interesting, like the rampant inequality levied toward the rats, the discrimination of cats by their human owners, and the sprawling city left to rot as people built a new one above ground, are all used as window dressing for the actual narrative which in many ways is fairly routine and simple, only delivered in a way that suggests otherwise. I’d have loved to greater explore the different inner city societies that the game hints at, or to have seen an expansion on the difficult relationship between Emma and the waitress of a local diner, but Hot Tin Roof is too preoccupied with its web of plotlines to do anything but introduce these and other subplots before abandoning them.Abandonment is something I felt in a lot of areas of the game, from its near complete lack of direction, to an excessive number of mechanics that have a habit of stepping on top of each other. The world is huge and twisting, and without a map or anything pointing you toward your objective I was left to wander in the hopes I’d find some sidepath I’d missed, or stumble upon a button prompt I’d accidentally passed over. At times it became so bad I began to wonder if I’d broken the game, but it was only that I had missed a trigger somewhere the game had never informed me I needed to go.Exacerbating this issue is how much of the world is used for nothing but putting distance between you and your destination. I spent a significant amount of time wandering through barren streets, empty hallways, and dull caverns looking for the one clue I was required to pick up to proceed, and often the only way out was to retrace all of my steps essentially doubling the amount of time needed to travel anywhere in the game.Hot Tin Roof’s mechanical structure similarly takes on more than it had any need to. Abilities come in the form of different bullets for your revolver, but most are used only for extremely particular tasks, usually ones that require more convoluted executions than the result would seem to imply. It also has the habit of neglecting most of your abilities to focus on whatever new toy you’ve acquired, but then force you to use an older ability in a way you were never informed it was for. Switching abilities also requires you reload your revolver bullet by bullet, which while a cool system takes up an exhausting amount of your playtime do to the constant necessity to switch abilities.Throughout my time with Hot Tin Roof, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was playing something unfinished, and which had had little to no playtesting performed prior to release. It’s trying so so hard, and at times I was completely on board, but it’s bloated design consistently felt like a project that had veered wildly from its original intent into something larger than it had the ability to pull off. I’m not sure how I could do anything but adore a game costarring a cat in a fedora, but clearly Hot Tin Roof has given me that answer, no matter how much I didn’t want to hear it.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												***Written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***At the time of writing this review I am stuck and so I cannot progress any further than I already have hence my short playtime.Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore a Fedora is a platformer meets noir detective game. In Hot Tin Roof you presume the role of Emma Jones, a PI who's partner is the world's first Cat investigator, Franky (short for Franscine). A number of crimes have taken place in Hot Tin Roof and it's your job to figure out what's going on and who is behind the recent crimes. HTR is set in a place called Hot Tin Roof, a place full of cats, pidgeons, rats and of course humans and there are clear divides between the different types of animals which clearly play a role in the crimes that have taken place.+Nice art style/graphics+Outstanding writing which leads to a lot of laugh out loud moments thanks to the game's humour+From what I have played the plot seems very interesting+Rather than unlocking skills you find new types of revolver ammo which give you new ways to interact with the world+You can question different characters about clues you have found which often point you towards what you're looking for+Good controller support in-game but the menu isn't very controller friendly+Interesting puzzles which aren't too difficult to solve+You save by visiting the bathroom which is quite an interesting idea and leads to some funny lines early on when Franky explains this mechanic+Has a Cat that wears a Fedora, I mean c'mon that's cool right?-At some points you do have to do quite a lot of grinding for the game's currency so you can afford to buy items which are required for progression-Save locations are few and far between-There is no map or any form of fast travel so you have to do a lot of walking back through areas you have already visitedVerdict:7A well written noir adventure game which falls flat slightly due the lack of a map and fast travel system.El K.

												UPDATE: Literally within hours of posting this they put out two updates/patches, one of which fixed the original bug that prevented progress after a certain point. While the other points still stand, they've  fixed the issue (at least for me) on saves that kill completion of the game. However, at this price point, I'd still wait at least for sale to get at least your money's worth for the first few hours.First off - in terms of style, humor, and mood this game delivers exactly what you're looking for. It's witty, tongue-in-cheek, and one of those games where I could be posting screenshots all day.In many ways, it feels as if the developers and creators spent a lot of love and time starting the game and creating the idea, but eventually lost interest or ran into production issues because the game starts strong but quickly devolves into frustrating platforming puzzles and a punishing gauntlet of bugs.In early levels and stages, you're rewarded for your exploration with secret areas, collectibles, and so on. But later on, you run the risk of finding a collectible or jumping through an invisible wall which will render you unable to escape and forcing you to use the last savepoint to resume your progress. It got to a point where it felt like a rogue-like of chancing whether or not I would bug out or find a collectable. The save checkpoints are cute and humorously executed, because as many times as you do it it never quite gets old - however the sloppiness in code execution, combined with long distances between savepoints ultimately has led to a point where I can resume yet find myself in a place unable to complete the game, essentially remembering my location in a map yet resetting all the doors, trapping me inside.I really REALLY wanted to love this game - and in many ways I still do - but unfortunately because of the large number of bugs and sloppy techncial execution towards the end I can't recommend it in the state it's in. Rule one should be - you must be able to finish the game.			"

												Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora is a 3D Puzzle solving crime game with a bit of platforming. The Game starts of with Jones a Female Private Investigator and her cat Franky who is also a female. The game mentions 8 bit graphics and while it is 3D it does accomplish the feeling of those type of graphics brought into a modern time.Here is a full review on my channel

			Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora is 3D Puzzle solving crime game that incorporates some platforming. It also incorporates a wide variety of mechanics involving your gun's bullets.		

Pros:- Graphics are great and throughout the levels I did not run into tearing or graphical glitches-Sound track is amazing it really gives you an old timey feel when playing the game - Fairly intuitive mechanics as it is easy to figure out how things work. Even if you get stuck and don't know how use something Franky will be sure to tell you what to do, how to use it, or what to get. - A story that keeps you constantly involved. The story does not get boring as you are never really doing one thing at a time. You constantly figuring out to get to one area, what clues to use on a civilian, or what case to focus on. -Clues are found easily but if having trouble you can always ask your chief or save money for a clue to be bought. -6-8 hours gameplay-Fairly comedic-Very Bug freeCons:- Some aspects of bullets are not explained well for example Knockback bullets can be use to propel yourself it took me 30 minutes to figure that out. -Grinding for money can become a problem when you need to buy a big purchaseOverall the game is a lot of fun I have been recording/playing it before it was released and have almost completed the game. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys puzzle crime games. I am constantly using my brain to think how to get past certain situations to progress the game. Franky and Jones are on the job and there will be no one who can hide from them.			"

												This game is too charming to not recommend. It has a lot of major faults, it's clearly a freshman endeavor. But giving it a thumbs down would feel like criticizing a poem a loved one wrote for you. It's earnest and charming. You noticed it uses a slant rhyme, but you don't want to make the author feel bad about it. They did something nice.The good points of the game:The high concept/theme works well. The ""cube people"" concept is used just enough to be fun, but not overbearing. Sentient animals in a noir setting has precident in books like Gun, With Occasional Music. Hot Tin Roof does an excellent job making the idea its own, while still using the background metaphor of interspecies classism.The soundtrack combines jazz with chiptunes. After listening to it for a while, I began to appreciate how difficult that must have been. It clearly required a bit to thought to put the two genres together in such a coherent way. Easy, early accessibility to a sound test NPC suggests the devs knew how well the soundtrack turned out.The revolver tool felt extremely satisfying to use. It's is your main form of puzzle interface, and the animation/SFX never stops being rewarding. Literally chambering the solution to a puzzle provided a sense of anticipation to your now-inevitable small victory. The inclusion of the self-propelling knockback bullets helped mitigate a lot of my gripes about having to re-tread areas do to unclear objectives. If there's one thing that makes retreads feel less bothersome, it's satisfying active movement acceleration.Major characters don't get a lot of development time, but manage to feel colorful and noir-thematic without being too trope-dependant. The writing does a good job using tropes to circumvent the need for characterization without making characters feel flat. It subverts tropes in places where nior can seem mean or rough, making for a charmingly ""noir nice"" overall aesthetic. In particular, it portrayed the ""noir foreigner"" trope with humor and even-handedness.The okay:Franky, the tag-along character, was a high point. Her writing is fun, noirish, and cute, and she doesn't get in the way of area interaction. I liked Franky. But the game allows you to shoot her, and she makes a sad meowing sound when you do. I really didn't want to shoot Franky. But the game requires a good amount of aimless exploration, and it provides you with a bullet type that propels you forward quickly when shot behind you. So I ended up shooting the heck out of Franky. I even got a shame-achievement for shooting her a lot called ""Franky Hater"". I wish I couldn't shoot my friend by accident.The writing is a mixed bag. Franky manages to be a funny sidekick without being annoying, which is a seldom accomplished feat. But Jones is a little too plain, and doesn't have a Detective Flaw. Most NPCs, particularly street-level ones you interact with for a single plot point, are surprisingly compelling. But NPCs that you don't interact with for plot seemed rather dry.It was a fun idea to play as a female detective in a setting where visual sexualization is essentially impossible. But that necessitates more dialogue-based gender representation, and Jones' dialogue was usually a bit too straightforward to address her gender identity. This could easily have been a failing point though, with a ""too much to prove"" character, so it's not necessarily a bad thing.Every puzzle area has a puzzle that makes good use of your combined abilities. But there are usually areas between these that merely require you to use your abilities to traverse them. This could function as conveyance. But the game's unclear objectives means you'll end up re-treading these areas frequently, and that transforms the teaching mini-puzzles into a chore.The lack of flavor/landmarks in the background of traversal areas means that it's easy to get lost in them, extending the chore of re-traversal as you walk around hoping you're going in the direction of your objective. Some sections have great background art, like posters for the cat-mayor done in both block-cat and realistic cat art types. They clearly had a capable art team. It'd would have helped navigation if more flavor was included.The bad:There are almost always unclear objectives. The investigation process is obtuse, and entirely necessary. Players only vaguely know what they should be doing at any time. Sometimes the game helps by restricting player access to areas in purposeful ways. But expect to consult a message board or a Let's Play. I actually consulted a Let's Play, looked on message boards for help, and found the Let's Play-er on a message board looking for help.Unintentional sequence breaks can really mess you up. Not understanding your objectives will lead to exploration, and exploration will lead to sequence breaks that you can't entirely recover from. I somehow missed a section where you question suspects in an interrogation room. Hours later the plot had moved on, and I was in a random cave, and I got a one-sided cut scene about questioning the suspects. It lead to a warp to the interrogation room, which I couldn't use because the suspects were already in jail at that point. I missed a clue that would help with the game's ending. I believe said ending got a work-around in a patch just to compensate for people missing clues due to unintentional sequence breaks.I'd recommend Hot Tin Roof to someone I know would like the themes, and would be able to work past the rough patches. But it's not polished, and it's not for everyone.			"

												This game is terrific. I don't think I've ever played anything quite like this; I could repeat the (quite correct) observations others have made about the innovative combination of exploration platformer and point-click adventure game, but one comparison that kept (favorably!) coming to mind as I played was an old Sega Genesis game called Quackshot, of all things, primarily in terms of the exploration and the gradually-unlocked arsenal of trick bullets.Hot Tin Roof is fun to *play*, in terms of the hopping and climbing and box-busting and puzzle solving, but what made me fall in love with this game within the first hour of play was the writing and the world-building. The game world has tons of atmosphere and charm, and the writing is top-notch; both the story and the dialogue (of which there is a ton, and it's all worth going through - you can't get stuck or punished for trying out a smartass reply) are as good as anything I've found in a game. The game is certainly cute, but that doesn't mean that the underlying mystery and themes aren't thoughtful.I do hope Glass Bottom Games gives us another chance to play in the city of Tin Roof and environs; there are a lot of characters whose lives after the end of the game I'd love a chance to catch up with. And an in-game minimap might be tricky to pull off mechanically, given the twisty-turny layout of the game world, but it would be much appreciated next time! ;)			"

												Really enjoyable metroidvania detective game with a lot of enjoyable conversation options ( I know my first playthrough will take a lot longer then an average persons playthrough since I will read all the different dialog options and choose them all).One thing to realize to make the game more enjoyable is that holding ""r"" will reload all 4 bullets with your current bullet configuration instantly without having to manually remove and replace each one individually, though you will still have to frequently manually reload bullets to switch between types, the 4 earliest that you can get is ones that break objects like crates, one that reveals hidden levels/platorms/etc, one that is a grappling hook, and one that lights things on fire)All in all, even if it's not very long I still find it well worth the asking price if you like either metroidvanias, CRPGs, or Noir games, while it's not a true metroidvania, it's got elements of ""you need to get this bullet type (which might as well just be a skill that you happen to use via your gun) to be able to solve this puzzle to get to this area to find a clue to get this search warrent, blah blah blah. And you may find things you couldn't before coming back to areas with new bullet types.But be warned, if you don't like reading flavor text and prefer voice acting skiping over text, you will not get as much out of the game since it is all text which gives the game part of its fun, much like how a big part of CRPGs isn't the RPG part but the conversation trees part which is also very often text only without VO since there are a lot of tree options. And like CRPGs if you just do the main required dialog the game can be relitivly short but if you do all the dialog you can, it has a lot of good content there that takes more time. "

												I'm a fan of the noir genre and I was pleasantly surprised when I came across Hot Tin Roof; noir and kitty-cats, what could be better, right?I like it, it was charming with its graphics, atmosphere, and I enjoyed each individual character's personality.The music was great, too!One of the game's key features was a revolver that aquired special abilities for each type of bullet you collect: Blowing bubbles, lighting torches, using a grappling hook, and more. It was a fun and unique trait for this game.The initial premise is good, but, there are a couple of issues.The game may seem long, and it does take awhile to beat, but the story itself is a lot shorter due to the complex puzzles.So, if you do decide to buy it, I recommend taking your time exploring the game so you get as much out of it as possible.The game is fairly frustrating at times and it's easy to get lost in the 'puzzle areas', though it's less infuriating as The Impossible Game, thankfully. I had hoped that the story and the side quests would've been a bit longer. The noir genre relies on good story-telling and it just seemed to be lacking in this game, but I guess that's due to the strong emphasis on the platformer puzzles, so take it with a grain of salt.Also, there are times when you can purchase items in the game. However, I found that it was very easy to mine for money early on, and once I bought most of everything that was available, money became useless.It would've been really nifty if I had been able to bribe characters for clues or tips to progress a case or complete a side quest. If there is a sequel for Hot Tin Roof (and I do hope there are plans for it because it was delightful!), I hope that Emma's cat partner, Franky, can do more than just act as a guide; I felt that at times she wasn't too helpful and she did get in the way when I fired the revolver, but she was good company. Overall, I enjoyed the game and there is replayability value since there are various side quests to seek out and there are (from what I've read) around fifteen different endings. If you like noir, cats, and puzzles that are more complex than what you'd find in Mario - I'd say it's worth a try!			"

												Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora is all about the fusion of seemingly incompatible elements into something unique. What do you expect from a game, when the first thing you see are detectives in fedoras and trench coats, working inside a dimly lit police station with wooden furniture and red carpets everywhere? Maybe some gritty story about a rotten-to-the-core megalopolis, full of injustice and corruption, ruled by undefeatable criminal masterminds? However, it cannot be so grim, one would think, when the protagonist detective is a boxy woman, her partner is a boxy cat, and they jump and wobble as they move. Moreover, their whole world is like that too - boxy and jumpy. This visual style is lively and memorable, if limited, but one would think: can it convey something beyond a wacky-zany-surreal adventure? And then the heroes get an urgent request to investigate a recent burglary, and, shortly after, a homicide case. The plot only goes grimmer from there, holding faithfully to the noir canon. It does not get bleak and depressing, thanks to the carefully mixed light-hearted humor in the dialogues and interactions, that manages to ease the mood, without turning everything into an outright comedy. Also, the city and the characters you meet are not doomed to the worst: there's a big freedom of choice, and you can help citizens via side quests - almost all of your actions will be acknowledged in the game ending. The soundtrack helps game atmosphere greatly. When you play something noir, blues music with a juicy sax is necessary. In Hot Tin Roof that sax is accompanied by 8bit-ish synths - they fit in the ensemble as naturally as a xylophone or a rhodes piano would. The overall sound is chill and relaxing, and, with all the intricate sax solos, it stays in the background, as a good soundtrack should. That chillout mood is perfect for the gameplay - there's nobody to fight and kill, with aimlessly wandering green blobs in underground areas coming as close as this game gets to enemies. Your trusty Wobbly revolver is for overcoming obstacles and exploring the game world, which has its fair share of secrets. You collect new types of ammo as you advance in the game, and in a good Metroidvania fashion, you can always revisit previously locked out areas and use your new toys to find something desperately needed or just helpful and interesting. And remember -  you don't have to reload your revolver chamber by chamber, hold R to instantly reload your current configuration! While this tip is present in the game, I wish it came by earlier. The game world is, again, a fusion of 2D and 3D. For the most part, you navigate it as a 2D platformer, but you can switch planes and make turns at some points. This actually simplifies the comprehension of the locations, as instead of sudden and not always explainable screen switches, you have obvious connections between streets, passages, and shafts. Another important tip: if you stand on the edge of the platform and can't see what's down there, most of the time there's nothing and you'll fall back to the ground level if you jump there. This experiment with mixing and fusing gameplay mechanics and styles results in a one-of-a-kind game, and it's well worth its price. As of today, Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora has roughly 7k owners according to Steamspy, and this rare gem deserves much more recognition. P.S. For more hidden gems, follow the steam CRIMINALLY Low Sales curator.			"

												Criminal investigations for all ages. Emma Jones, a firefighter known from the previous title Jones On Fire: Kitties Are Cute And Should Be Saved comes back as a private eye in Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora. Simplistic graphics and unique platformer design make for a great casual title with a little twist of humour. Obviously targeted at younger audience with cute animal characters and bright colour palette but doesn't lack dialogues with a good dose of humour and nuances caught only by an adult ear. A lot of reading for kids but works awesome with adult supervision especially when treated as a book. Reading to children in voices is highly recommended.Pros:  kids friendly  interesting 3D turned 2D platformer mechanics  funny dialogues for all ages  that good old detective story feeling  proves the game doesn't have to be AAA to be fun  casualCons:  for some might be too childish  quirks with aiming gun when coming from the right side of the screen  repetitive music  unvoiced dialogues make for some amount of reading  casual "

												Full disclosure: obtained a key to the game via the #GamesMatter initiative, with the only requirement that I comment about the game, good and bad opinions alike.Short version:Get it. It has rough edges at times, no it is not perfect, but I've played so much stuff in the last 30 years that I love stuff that is DIFFERENT, and this is cool, different and fun. Some will tag it 'metroidvania' but really it is its own thing. Is adventure sleuthing a genre ? Now it is.Longer version:I pondered a while if I should click YES or NO at ""do you recommend this game"".. As mentionned in the short version, the game does have rough edges, even outright bugs (being worked on, dev is really neat for that and so accessible both here and on twitter) but it has soul and it has style.. It is NOT a copy cat (heh) of anything, and I love it for that. It has a bit of a problem of meshing looking for clues/advancing the story and the platforming puzzles.. My mind would be in one of the two mode but rarely engaged in both at the same time. Part of this is that level stretch for too long for nothing, and that the camera is too zoomed in to be able to easily map out the universe in my head without an in-game map.Dev has stated that a 2D map isn't easily done (since levels curve around here and there) and that a 3D one is totally out of the question (ressource wise, and with the excellent point that this was attempted and failed by the big N in Metroid Prime). Maybe street signs or just crude drawings of maps on the walls in game would have helped.. or maybe some type of fudged teleport systems to get to the underground city of Remington or in and out of dump.. So navigation was annoying, but you do get used to it after a while, especially when you have all the gadgets. If you have a problem with spatial orientation, getting around and exploring nooks and cranies could be an issue.Writing is fun and witty, even if the overall plot got a bit convoluted at times to me because chunks will arrive after long periods of platforming. Game could have done the classic adventure game 'characters on each side of the screen zoomed in' type of discussion maybe, at times it all felt tiny to read the speech bubbles, giving me the impression of chitchat even if important clues and infos were dropped.I've played the whole thing with a controller, and the platforming works just fine. The clue interface is annoyjing at times and for that I'd reach for the mouse for a second to go quicker. Most reviews will explain the gun ammo/reloading system and while it annoyed me for a while it wasn't that big of a deal in the end, but it'd be a lot better to clearly explain the quick reload option ! Thinking of other game with different ammo with the controller it could have been nice to skip the reload and switch ammo type with shoulder buttons, but the current system feel more thematic to the noir tone of course. On the puzzle side, having a fixed slot order could have helped in some spot where I wanted certain different type in a specific order. Nitpicking really.More nitpicking: the clue interface and the options/save/quit panels should have been separate. Broke the immersion. Also list the timestamp on the save slot, since there's no indication if one is used at all or not..Still reading ? Tiny warts and all this is still good fun, plus is has cats with ties and guns that shoot bubbles to reveal secrets. And rocket jumping. You could do a whole lot worse in your gaming choices! I had played the dev's Jones On Fire (Android) and will most definitely look forward to their eventual next project.			"

												A bit rough around the edges, but it's got pluck, and that counts for a lot.Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora is an interesting mesh of Metroidvanian exploration and platforming and story-based adventure gaming. Comparisons to classic LucasArts adventure games seem to be plentiful in other reviews, and the long shadow of those luminaries can certainly be seen here. However that influence is mostly reserved for the story and humor of the game. The real meat is a much more contemporary hybrid of genres.The story drops into the role of an investigator in a world rich with atmosphere and surprisingly deep in social structure. These details are presented by a plethora of NPCs throughout a somewhat open city. One of the major joys in the game is exploring the map, not for upgrades or collectables (those these are there), but for encounters with NPCs and further details about the goings on in the city. This was by far my favorite part of the experience, and those interested in a game with a quirky and unique voice in a noir setting should be very satisfied.Make no mistake, though, despite the early game being fairly straightforward with its navigation and story focused, the later part of the game features some rather challenging platforming sections. The shift to this focus seemed somewhat drastic to me, and the mechanics of it could have been better explained. It's nothing insurmountable, and it may not be an issue for most, but after settling into a story focused game I had to adjust my paradigm to platformer. In this regard, I should also mention that even though a gamepad worked well initially, I found I had to switch over to keyboard and mouse later because aiming precision suddenly became extremely important.Other complaints fall into the 'lack of polish' category. I encountered a few minor graphical glitches, and some more problematic mysteriously vanishing characters. More problematic to me, as it interfered with the story end of it, was how dialogue options don't seem to change according to story contexts unless they have to: sometimes you'll talk to a character from an earlier point in the game, hoping to get insight into current circumstances, only to realize they have no new dialog options forcing both them and your character to rehash seemingly nonsensical dialogue given the current circumstances.Most of that can be explained away because of a smaller budget and a small team. Indeed looking back at the stretch goals on the Kickstarter page (where I did back this game, by the way), one can see hopes for a much more ambitious project with even more depth and more areas to explore. Some of these skeletons still exist in the finished product, and there are hints that the game could see some expansion with the right circumstances. If that's the case, I can't wait to see what comes next, but for the time being I'm more than satisfied with this great little game.			"

												I enjoy quirky games that have a sense of humour and aren't overly-complicated.  And I enjoy mysteries.  I enjoyed these aspects of the game, and I do recommend it, but there are some caveats.The concept of the different ammunition in the game is a great one, and makes the game simple, provides many possibilities for problem solving, and is kinda cool.  But the way it was implemented drove me bonkers.  When in a room and needing to use different ammunitions, sometimes the puzzle would require three or four of a particular type, then you would have to switch out to a different one (or two), do something with them, and then switch back.  Granted, I'm sure in hindsight that I could have streamlined that and analyzed the problem and come up with a more efficient ammunition usage, but who wants to do that?  Swapping out the ammunition is such an annoying mechanic, it would be much easier to put in some sort of ammo configuration and swap to it with a button or hotkey.Still on the ammunition, some of the proximity/mapping of where you are in relation to the target object is sometimes not very precise.  Trying to light something on fire sometimes takes three or four tries...needlessly frustrating.If you watched my let's play of this series, I get quite angry with the controller response -- PLEASE do not take that as a negative on this game.  That was a problem with my PC that was registering a button press multiple times and just causing no end of frustration for me.  I finally figured it out, so the controller response was fine in the game, my only beef is with the mechanic behind the way you reloaded and chose ammunition for the gun.  There were a few spots where precision is required and I'll chalk my difficulties there to poor hand coordination and not knock the game on it.With the exception of one puzzle, which turned out to be a side-quest, and not necessary to complete the main story line, the puzzles vary from easy to hard, but not too hard.  I think I relied on hints two or three times through the series, one of which was for the impossible-to-solve-so-I-didn't-side-quest, and in hindsight if I'd used common sense and had more patience I would have eventually solved them on my own.  There were a few ""tasks"" which I'll group into the puzzle category, that made you revisit the maze of levels in parts of the game I'd much prefered to not have to go back down into the bowels for, but it wasn't too onerus, just time consuming...would change that in a future game.I don't mean this in a negative way...the game was simple, and has a simple design.  That is part of its charm...there aren't all these different button combos, and it is a unique story and setting.  Aside from some of the criticisms above, I did enjoy this game.  If you lack patience, or are prone to give up on stuff if you get mildly frustrated, then this probably isn't the game for you.  But if you give it a chance, especially if you like cats (I don't, ironically), then I think you will get a lot of enjoyment from this game.It's a simple, quirky, funny mystery with cats and guns.

												I have nothing but praise for this game. Right from the start it's incredibly endearing, filled with fantastic writing that both manages to be real and topical, and maintain an air of humour. The writing is top notch. Every character introduced is unique and by far the majority of them have something to amuse and entertain. Good writing and dialogue in games is incredibly important to me, and Hot Tin Roof never fails to satisfy or impress. The theme and setting are used perfectly, which combined with the wonderful music really makes the game an enjoyable experience.The gameplay is basic, but that's in no way a bad thing. It's a non-violent Metroidvania, in which you gather new types of ammo for your revolver which in turn give you access to new abilities. The basic ammo lets you break boxes. The bubbles let you reveal secrets. The grappler lets you climb. Each time you find a new one, you're unlocking a new part of the world that you couldn't access before.The world feels really big, too. Overwhelming at first, but you can quickly get used to it. This feeling returns every time you find some new location to explore as well, making everything even -bigger-. I would've appreciated a good map to go with the game; if there is one, I couldn't find it, which has you relying on memory to figure out where to go, where you've been. Like I said though, you'll learn your way around the place soon enough.It's a good game, and the price is perfect. I recommend this whole heartedly. :)			"

												Well this is an extremely frustrating game. Warning, it is NOT an adventure game, which is what i was expecting. I love noir. I love cats. I love lesbians. I love funny dialog. The creators have made a wonderful little world here that incorporates all of those things, unfortunately the game itself is a platformer. The kind of platformer that forces you to fall down the same hole and repeat the same room over and over and over till you get the timing perfect, and then when you finally get past, something kills you and sends you back to a checkpoint three rooms ago. There is so much promise here, but being forced to collect coins and jump around like a Mario brother is absolutely not my cup of tea. Only for die-hard platformer fans.			"

												This is a lovingly hand-crafted indie adventure-platform game that originally secured funding through Kickstarter.You play as Private Investigator Emma Jones, with her sidekick cat Franky.  You walk (or rather, bounce) around different locations in the town, chatting to NPCs, examining clues and crime scenes.  You use the dialogue menus to discover and discuss clues you find.There is a puzzle platformer element to it, but not challenging or insta-death - more of a puzzle style, like the way Psychonauts did it.  You'll find various tools to help you traverse these sections, and for (someone who doesn't get on with platform games generally) the game is fine with this in.The strengths of the game lie in the story that unravels via the characters you meet, and also the artwork and the music.  The story unravels as you walk around the town, using a combination of dialogue interactions and puzzle solving to piece together clues.  Whilst the conversations are interesting, you can't skip dialogue if you repeat a thread.  But the characters are interesting and fun and make the world feel alive.The soulful saxy-electronic soundtrack bounces along nicely in the background, working with the prettily crafed and shaded graphics to produce a feeling of film noir.If I had any criticisms, it would be repeatable & unskippable dialogue, and the UI could do with a bit of a polish.On the whole, I highly recommend this if you are looking for something different that provides a fun story and a gentle challenge.

												I came into this game really wanting to like it. I'd watched 'Nerd3 plays...' of it and the clever dialouge drew me in. The art style is  fresh though at times I feel its a bit too sharp around the edges and needed more polish. I do feel the people who made it had their hearts in the right places and wanted to make a good homage to the noir genre.Disclaimer: I'm not good at platformers and this game turned out to be one. I wasn't aware of this when I bought it. I thought it'd be a P.I. puzzle solving, collecting evidence kinda game. On closer inspection '3D Platformer' is in the description as a bulletpoint and as a tag however the screenshots and trailer don't show this. It was too late for me to refund though.I haven't finished the game so I can't comment on the story. Look to other reviews for that.Pros: Clever/funny dialouge, lives and breathes the noir genre, cute rats that are not automatically bad guys (just a personal one).Cons: The platforming! Clunky controls, very difficult puzzles in the factory level that require more precision than the game allows (I'm stuck here). The gun bullets at first seem an interesting way of doing things but the slow reloading of them becomes labourious quickly and its difficult to tell which bullet you'll be firing first.Conclusion: I really wanted to like this game for its great character however I felt like I was constantly fighting it as I progressed due to stubborness rather than enjoyment. The factory level was the last straw for me. Some tightening of the controls and maybe more visual hints would go a long way.			"

												Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore a Fedora is an ambitious (if somewhat flawed) indie metroidvania. Thanks to #GamesMatter for the code!Hot Tin Roof is an adventure-platformer with a unique premise. In a gritty (yet adorably rendered) town of Boxians, cats and rats, you'll investigate a series of crimes and attempt to unravel the criminal conspiracy threatening Tin Roof. Doing this requires interrogation, thought and good-old fashioned puzzle platforming.While the game exudes noir style and is very enjoyable, niggling control issues combined with occasional bugs (Old Town's ""ghost"" acid blobs caused the most problems for me) sometimes kill the pacing. The game is vaguely kid-friendly, but (as stated by the developers) is intended for adults. So, you'll encounter minimal hand-holding and some moral concerns such as scattered language.In some cases this ""hands-off"" approach can be great (not having to go through a ton of tutorial text is a DEFINITE plus), but in others...Let's just say that especially in an age of gaming focused on increased accessibility, the lack of things such as objective markers or notes/hints of where to go/what to do next may frustrate some players. This is designed to appeal to a certain type of gamer--and HTF's over 1,200 Kickstarter backers show that this niche is pretty underserved.Despite any issues, I personally enjoyed my time with Hot Tin Roof and would recommend it overall--especially to Metroid or adventure fans seeking a title that tries something ""new.""

Product received for free
												Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora is a funny little adventure game where you take the role of former firefighter, now Private investigator Emma Jones and her partner Franky (a cat). The game's plot revolves around Emma investigating a chain of criminal activities through out the city. You have to explore the city, find clues, ask people about the case, get a search and/or arrest warrant, collect items, etc. To do all this, you have your trusty revolver which can shoot different types of bullet, i.e. grapple bullets, bubble, knockback, etc. Each has their own unique use in the gameplay.The world is not too big but interesting. I love how the animals (cats, rats, pigeons, etc.) are members of the society in a way that they are treated almost like people. I mean, we have a cat running for mayor, rats going on bad deals, a pigeon trying to get his life together, etc.The way the game is presented is good, they give the audience an idea on what kind of game it is.The graphics is well done (in my opinion anyway). It's not the realistic type of graphic but more of a minecraft block type (but more cartoonish) and that really makes the game more alluring. The colors used are somewhat dim and that compliments the solving mystery vibe of the game.The sounds used in the game are the classic detective movie music. The ones where a detective enters a bar and a guy is playing a clarinet type of music. This gives that ""Im a classic detective"" vibe for me. Gameplay wise, the game only allow you to walk left, right, up, and down. You can also jump and climb stuffs using your revolver. The game as an adventure game also feels like a puzzle, but the easy kind. You have to use your tools in order to progress further. Your health bar is symbolized by a flower in the top left of the screen. Each time you take damage you lose a petal. You have a default of 4 petals and as you progress, you can gain more petals.There are also dialogue choices present but I find that they give no significant changes in the story, I think they are just there to let you give Emma and Franky some sort of personality. Although some dialogue are funny and from time to time the game makes my giggle. Another thing about this game is to save, you need to use the toilet. This was a very clever mechanic and made me love the game even more.Now for the bad bits. There was one instance in the game where as I was going down the camera didn't follow my character and so I was unable to see my character. I can still here them walking and jumping but I can't see them. This forced me to load a previous save. Another this with the camera, sometimes it goes crazy. Like it goes left and right, but this is on specific areas.Additionally, there is a part in the game where you kind of need to grind to earn some bits(currency) in order to purchase some tools but it isnt that much of an issue.Overall, I give the game an 8/10.Check out more game reviews by me and other people here: https://cassus.org/ "

												The game is charming and cute. Filled with witty dialogue and unique ideas, I'd reccommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good detective game. I will comment that later in the game in the gum factory it can feel a bit tedious working your way through. It's worth it once you make it through and it feels good to finally arrest the perp. The only true downside of this game is that it has to end.			"

												This is one of those games where it's hard to describe exactly what the genre is but I guess it's sort of a metroidvania crossed with an adventure game? Either way it's pretty fun to play. You play as detective team Emma and franky (the fedora wearing cat). There is a bit of a conspiracy to unravel, multiple endings to uncover, some little side quests to do along the way and even a super secret mystery easter egg to uncover that franky will love.  I saw an article the other day on rock paper shotgun complaining that the murder mystery / police procedural in gaming largely comes down to point and click type games where you have a fixed path. This game demonstrates how a mystery game could be done. You are given the tools to follow a clue trail, and if you choose to ignore those it plays out differently than if you do you due diligence and gather the evidence. I like that there are multiple ways to do a lot of things that need to be done. Optional clues to uncover and secret entrances. It would be great to see something like this applied on a much bigger scale with more mysteries to solve, where you could finish the game without even seeing half of the content. I know gamers nowadays would get the heck confused out of them by something like that, so it'll remain a dream.Anyway, this is definitely recommended if you like metroid type games and appreciate a bit of experimentation.

This game is nothing like the old movie with Elizabeth Taylor BUT is does have an awesome oldies feel the reminds your of the old Humphrey Bogart movies. The play style is easy flowing and the puzzles challenging but not to much so, also your partner is a wise cracking cat thats wearing a fedora. What more could you as for? Still not sure about buying the game? See my play through!

												In the end, this game hits a certain demographic. It hits players who don't mind exploring, and don't mind being patient. This is very much like the old lucas arts days, as you will get lost, and a lot of the mechanics will wear over time. Reloading the gun got extremely annoying, and several of the shots didn't make any sense with camera angles. It's the story that'll drive this one, but it wasn't enough to overlook several of the flaws that wore on me as I played the game. In the end, For story related minded people, it's a game that I'd look at when it's on sale. Other then that, it's a pass.For gameplay footage and more analysis:

												Really love this game! It's quirky, funny and everything I looked for. The dialouge is great. Except...The controls are iffy. It is hard to climb and is more platformer than I hoped for. When I got this game, I had no idea it was a platformer. It is really easy to fall through the floor and end up all the way at the bottom. It's terrible because there is no frequent saving!!  I really want to advance but I keep getting stuck in the same place over and over again. The reloading is hard especially since a lot of the time, you need to use multiple bullets. Another thing, I got lost so much because there is no map and the game is so complex. There is so many ways to get anywhere and if you missed anything at all, you will get nowhere.  Very frustrating.I really love this game but it's too hard.			"

												Im going to try to keep this short, the game is good its witty and fun and it has just the right about of odd humor that i personally love. The styles cool and for the most part the mechanics are good, though i did run into some trouble with the gun from time to time. My only real issue with this game is that some of the objectives arnt clear you'll get them eventually but sometimes it takes a little longer (that could possible just be me ), the main thing though is some of the areas are a little tedious there fun at first but then it just feel like im doing the same thing over and over again and i start losing patience. Once you get past those parts its fun again but then youll be faced with another puzzel similar to that in the future. Overall its a great game i love, but its very time consuming at least for me since i have little patience. I would definatly recommend people play this game and even if you are little unsure wait for a sale its worth it.			"

												I appreciate a game with talking cats a female protagonist who likes girls.This game is very cute, and is a fun little thing to play through when you want something light-hearted to play between things like The Last of Us and Fallout. The story, style, and dialogue is quirky, and the guns in this game are creative, to say the very least. The only issue I have with the game is that the layout of some levels is incredibly annoying, and it can be difficult to figure out how to progress from one area to the next. I would appreciate a decent map system, and perhaps for some of the areas where everything seems to be the same colour to... have different coloured elements in them to make navigating them easier.

												Hot Tin Roof is probably one of the best 2.5D platformer games i've ever played. The game has a good and funny story to it, with some interesting characters to discover along the way. The gameplay itself is also very fun, with a mixture of puzzles requiring different weapon ammo, and a very large map to explore.The sound design is good, and the art is also very nice. It has a low-poly feel to it, and yet is very detailed t the same time.			"

												Solid metroidvania game with a noir theme. Strong points in the form of a good sense of humour, and satisfying puzzle solving with little in the way of hand holding. Hits all the right notes in terms of exploration, with the added benefit of pointing you in the right direction should you become confused. With a little more polish, particularly in regards to dull environments of the ""dungeons"", this game could be even better.			"

												Hot Tin Roof is an adorable puzzle platformer that's challenging enough to keep experienced gamers interested, but with friendly hints for people newer to gaming. It's not for kids, but can be played with kids (some of the jokes will go right over their heads, like in the better cartoons). Basically if you are a person and you own a gaming thing you should buy and play this.			"

												A great point and click/puzzle/platform game with an adorable atmosphere and style. I like that you get to play as a female Boxian with her feline fedora'ed friend. The dialogue is funny with it's sometimes dry and sometimes silly humor. The atmosphere is like a boxy noir new york, with lots of little references to classic noir works. Adorable and fun game.			"

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Hot Tin Roof The Cat That Wore A Fedora 

			Views: 62		

			You’re the Private Investigator on a string of grisly murders, scouring for clues in a 3D side-scrolling world. Available here: Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/253390/ HomePage:...		

This is a summary of what can be found in the video review     Hot Tin Roof; The Cat That Wore A Fedora is a pseudo Noire Detective game where you try to solve a murder with the help of your trusty Cat sidekick. The trouble is, as you go through the game, you begin to wonder if you are the one solving the mystery, or are you just there as a mouthpiece for your cat. I did experience some crashes from the game, and since there are save points in the game rather than manual saves, I did have to replay many sections to catch up to the progress I had made.The music is good, but songs stay the same on each section, so it does repeat quite a bit if you spend much time in any certain area.            The art style is a stretch for a Noire game, as this takes a more cutsie slant on what is traditionally a dark, gritty atmosphere. It tried to stretch the Noire adult theme too far, which hurts it overall. I go into more detail on this in the video review. An excellent example of this immature take on an adult style theme would be when you save the game and have to watch your character take a crap in a bathroom.   Your partner in this game is a white cat with a hat. The cat has more of a presence on the board than your character does. It feels like you are the crazy cat lady who is always talking to her cat and asking them for help instead of using any intelligence to solve puzzles and put together clues. Every step of the story is reliant upon what the cat thinks about each clue, and you can't progress without her helping you. It takes away any sense of significance you might hope to feel as a detective, when the cat is more of a PI than you are.     The dialogue and character interactions are simplistic, watered down, and childlike. The game lacks a sense of purpose in your actions, and the progression. It is very chunky and stagnant, making it hard to feel any connection or immersion to your experience. The one thing this game did do well was it's platforming. which is ironically something they did not market it for.        As a Noire title, and as a detective game, it's a failure. It claims to be a detective game, but you don't do any detecting in the game. As a cutsie platformer game, it did okay.  I cannot recommend this game as what it proclaims itself to be is a  misleading, and  a lie.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.https://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho "

												I dig the game! I like the style, I like the gun and I like the platforming. And I usually hate platforming, so that's a big deal. I also like the dialogues, actually. Although now and again it's weird because you come back and have a conversation you've already had.But if I don't miss my guess it's built in Unity, right? With that in mind - why on eart does the framerate drop below 30fps in open areas for me? What's going on out there? Indoors I keep a steady 150fps, but as soon as I leave - drop. Anyway, I thought it was weird.I'd say it's def worth your time, on the whole.			"

Humor is a nice touch peppered throughout and the characters are so much fun to get to know. I think the only real downside I have encountered so far is getting lost in the world, but to my knowledge some of that has been fixed in the most recent update (1.13); plus, it's marketed as ""Metroidvania,"" so I wouldn't be playing if I didn't expect to get at least a little lost every once in awhile.

I did not regret it.I love the music, the atmosphere and the great writing. I played with the latest update, containing all the additional hints and little helpers, so I can not support the earlier complaints about a lack of direction and confusion- yes, sometimes I had to think hard (or even look for help on the web), but the game never became frustrating. In conclusion, I would recommend this to everybody who likes to have their brain teased ever now and then and enjoys a nice atmospheric story.			"

												One of my favorite games of 2015, Hot Tin Roof is a metroidvania loveletter to film noir with a story that pays humorous homage to a great genre of film while remaining wonderfully original. It's creatively designed and while I feel that it drags a bit towards the end, overall it's worth checking out.

												Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora is a game that I had looked forward to for a while. I first took note of it back in 2013 after its developer, Glass Bottom Games, managed to rake in $25,000 for its development on Kickstarter. So, when a review copy landed in my inbox a little over a week ago, I was excited to dive into its film noir inspired world. Except, things didn't go exactly to plan. Instead of being enthralled by the dimly lit city of Tin Roof, I quickly found myself overcome by the dark shadow of disappointment.  Hot Tin Roof is not a bad game, so allow me to elaborate.After being laid off from her job at a fire station, Emma Jones turned to private investigation work with her sidekick Franky the wise-cracking, fedora wearing cat. The pair are asked to investigate a case involving a death, a break in and a missing will. What follows is a dark, humorous and often dull investigation involving rats, pigeons and lots and lots of cats.The city is a large fully 3D world that, in an interesting design choice, you will be exploring as a sidescroller.There are loads of different characters to meet, whom Emma seems to have a bit of a history with, and in true film noire style a lot of the dialogue with these characters will leave you scratching your head. Conversations with certain characters often feel like you've joined in with no frame of reference of what was siad prior to your involvement, and rather than being intriguing they become tiresome, instead.In fact, dialogue is a bit hit and miss. Frankie will often chime in during conversations, making remarks with her tongue lodged firmly in her cheek, but for the most part I found myself eager to blast through reams of text due to how inconsistent its quality was.  Most conversations have a branching structure meaning you can quiz people about different things, but, again, it's all a bit of a chore. Lines of investigation you have already exhausted aren't removed meaning it is easy to click on them again, leaving you to trudge through conversations you've already read through. And you can't even jump from one topic to another, instead you need to finish up one line of questioning, close the conversation and start over again, sometimes enduring long-winded text sequences for the second, third or fourth time.There's more to Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora than conversations though. It often feels like a classic point and click adventure game, in a way, due to the myriad of different locations you visit. Such film noir standards as the diner on the corner and the police depot are highlighted by other shady locations like the rat's underground base at the dump, and the crumbling ruins of an old apartment complex. To their credit Glass Bottom Games has crafted an interesting city filled with detail and, with stylish lighting included, it's pretty gorgeous, too. There's just one problem, it is exceedingly easy to get lost in. As I mentioned before, despite playing like a 2D sidescroller, Tin Roof is actually fully 3D and this poses a problem. The developers obviously want you to explore the world at great depth, and root out all the clues to help you in your investigation, but they neglected to include a map! Each section of the city loads up in separate chunks, and not one large city that you can explore at your leisure. With all the corners you will be turning and buildings you will be seeing, it is easy to become disoriented. My enjoyment of the game would have increased many times over had I known exactly where I had been and where I was going.Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora doesn't exactly play to its strengths, when I wasn't getting lost or looking for clues I was playing through arduous plaforming sequences, which were made that much worse by how loose Emma controls. The game takes a pretty fun and unique approach to puzzles though, so it isn't all bad news.Puzzle solving, which uses Emma's gun,  is the game's saving grace. Different kinds of ammo solve different problems, so  bubble rounds, for example,  show hidden platforms and levers to help you reach new areas, there are also fire rounds that can burn select flammable materials, and rounds that act as grappling hooks to help you reach higher platforms. I just wish that the developers had taken the same inspired approach to the rest of the game, rather than making stylistic decisions that are harmful to the overall experience. As I said, this is not a bad game, its probably even a great one, but it is wrapped up in a series of poor design choices.I don't mean to be too harsh on Hot Tin Roof, but it has its problems. Little problems. Little problems that stacked up and grated on me over time, until I couldn't stand to play the game any more. The biggest issue, for me, is the lack of a map or even a mini map for each location you visit. I can deal with finding clues and examining each area carefully, but if I don't know where I am or where I have to go it is difficult to become immersed in the city around me. If you are an old school gamer that enjoyed the Lucasarts point and click games you will probably love Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora, and its lack of a map or handholding will do little to faze you, but If you have a low threshold for running around in circles, you had best sit this one out.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks to the deverloper for review code.

												Hot Tin Roof is a lovely experience, with challenging puzzles and a killer noir story. I was smiling to myself throughout the hard-boiled dialogue, and was definitely humming the bass lines from the incredible soundtrack for about a week after my first time playing. And, let's be honest, the cats are AMAZING.			"

												Looking at the Steam achievement comparison thing-o, I think I can say that I am probably one of the first people in the world to finish this game who wasn't a tester of some sort. It pulled me in...! So, whereas a lot of the reviews I've seen on this seem to just be reflecting the first hour / general ambience, this one will hopefully be a little more in-depth.THE PROSI really enjoyed the graphics, audio, and overall tone of the game. The noir tone delivers, and bouncing around the streets is enjoyable in itself. I like the revolver system - it's very creative, though I think the way it works will frustrate some people.The music in particular is really excellent. Soaring horns and all that. It fits the mood perfectly, and feels done with a lot of love. I enjoyed a lot of the puzzles, and a few of them were really satisfying to solve in an old-school, what-the-hell-this-is-impossible-oh-wait-no-it-isn't kind of way.I also think the writing is really well done. But that brings me to:THE CONSThe way that the narrative and writing itself is presented is difficult to follow. Doesn't feel like it was extensively tested on people who were going in totally blind. Characters have conversations that make references to things you don't know about, the clues you look at seem to follow huge leaps of deduction that are confusing, and you generally spend a lot of the game wondering if you missed something. Apparently I hit a bug somewhere along the way, but truth be told I was a little uncertain about what was going on the entire time.You'll understand the broad strokes of the plot, and the dialogue really is good (and funny!) but when you reach the end, and your characters recap the case you've just solved, I think you will be bewildered by the people and events they suddenly begin making extremely detailed reference to.At the same time, I don't think it's the writing - I think it's the interface and the design. I think it's the way that the conversation and clues system works. If you're able to stop and read every clue right as you get it and really make a non-metroidvania-esque effort to follow along, you might have a different experience.OVERALLI would absolutely recommend Hot Tin Roof. It does noir atmosphere and metroidvania gameplay really well. If you liked Jazzpunk, this one is a no-brainer. The characters are endearing and the writing is enjoyable - it's just shortchanged a bit by the way it was implemented.Have fun!			"

Hot Tin Roof is like a mix between a metroidvania and a LucasArts adventure game. You're a nonviolent police detective in a violent world of coldhearted murder, child abandonment, and forced surgery. Also, cats and birds and rats can talk. This game focuses entirely on exploration. You're using new bullets you find for your revolver to bypass platforming challenges and find clues to navigate the intrigue of your (interconnected) cases. The characters are cute and likeable and the art remains striking and appropriate the whole way through. The soundtrack is fun and very listenable.Everything in this game fits together well, but it's got the rough edges of an indie title; if you're easily lost you'll have some trouble, as there's no map (and I don't even know how you'd map this game). There's a lot of backtracking through old areas to pick up new clues when you acquire new tools, which gets a bit old, and I had a few points where I wasn't sure where to go next.If you're the sort of player for whom clever dialogue and fun exploration will make up for a bit of awkwardness in navigation and structure, check this game out.I was a Kickstarter backer.

												It seems to have a good point-and-click, noir angle, but I can't get in the mood due to lacklustre controls and scattered storytelling. The visuals aren't that indicative of the actions to take or of ways to proceed through the game, so I could have benefitted from a short tutorial before being released into the world (and I'm against tutorials, whenever possible).Some of the design choices are real game-killers for me. While it seems like a more ""real-world"" way of going about things, delivering the story through auto-advancing dialogue bubbles and forcing you to reload individual revolver rounds really detracts from the experience. I wish I could like it, but I don't think I can :(			"

												Excellent fun. Great writing, a fun noir setting, and great platforming gameplay. I've been following this game since I first saw it a year and a half ago at PAX, and I'm glad to say the final product is even better than I'd hoped.			"

												I had a lot of fun with this game - the humor and puzzles were pretty good. There was a section in the middle/end of the game that was pretty difficult, and the pistol doesn't always seem to pick the right chamber to fire a bullet out of, but I'd say give this game a try!Also make sure to save as often as possible (have your character visit the bathroom) - Steam was crashing on me with this game for some reason, maybe a couple times an hour.The gum factory section made me rage so hard.

												I'm maybe just over halfway done with this game as I'm writting a review for it but anyway. You save by using the toilet. I repeat. You SAVE YOUR GAME by USING THE TOILET. And your health (in the form of a flower that the main character apparently wears on her person) is restored when you wash your hands. This is a really pretty cute game. I like the idea of talking animals and such and the dialog options for both the human investigator and the cat investigator are so snarky. The way the camera pans around corners and stuff is cool too. It adds a bit of level to a typical side scrolling platformer. The few downfalls are 1) that the controls (for the keyboard at least) are annoying as heck. The game turns into basically a platformer part way through and navigating all the platforms and avoiding fire gets a little frustrating with the sensitive controls. 2) It's difficult to figure out what the heck you're suppose to be doing. I have no idea how you'll be able to figure out what to do if you take a break from playing it for too long. Overall though, I'd say this is a pretty cool game, though it's probably not worth $15. Maybe $10, more like $5 I'd say.			"

												Absolutely incredible.It brings to mind sweet memories of Sam and Max, Grim Fandingo and many other great titles. Here we have puzzle, mystery , platforming and adventure action mixed to a lovely blend and with a touch of Noir.Became an instant fave. I highly reccomend it. I just wish i had more free time for singleplayer games to play more of this.			"

												If you enjoy platformers mixed with noir mysteries, then Hot Tin Roof is just the game for you. The mechanics are fresh, the dialogue is hilarious, and the game is just plain AWESOME. I'm not very good at platforming so it does get difficult in places, but it was a very enjoyable experience :)			"

												Video Review Below.While Hot Tin Roof may graphically not look like much. It makes up for it in style and charm!From quips, clever jokes and Noir themed dialogue. With its unusual cast of characters. To the fun puzzles. Hot Tin Roof is a game anyone can enjoy. You will scour the city for clues and secrets. Gaining access to new areas in Metroidvania style with your trusty revolver. Using unique bullets that shoot bubbles or grappling hooks!Glass Bottom Games made a very solid game that runs well and plays well. The city is large and takes some getting familiar with but thats all part of the job! Brass tax, Hot Tin Roof is family friendly and you will get your bang for your buck!I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

			The nights are cold and long. The city reverberates with life. Like a dog growling in an alley. Stinks like one too. All that doesn't really matter to Emme Jones private investigator.		

I hope you enjoy!Martyr			"

												I really wanted to like this game. The idea sounded fun and like something I would enjoy. I cannot get past the first part. I'm sure I'm doing something wrong, but it's giving me nothing to work with. If i try to leave it forces me back in and gives me a cryptic, useless, hint. I thought the revolver and its unique ammo as progression would be cool, but it's just tedious to manualy reload each individual round after 4 shots. Also its asking me to use something called ""bubble rounds"" which I dont have nor can get because I'm stuck. The idea seems fun, but this game is not. At least, not in this state. Maybe if there was a quick reload, or better f**king hints, it would be more... playable.			"

												Inconsistent Game Logic, repetitive & monotonous. You use your gun to interact with things, but it only has 4 bullets and they need to be reloaded manually. It gets real old, real quick.In the time it took to get bored of this game I played through ""30 Flights of Loving"" in its entirety. Speaking of which, buy that game instead.			"

												I'm giving this a thumbs up but it's more a 3/5. This game has some heart and soul but mostly lacks in the later stages from pacing issues. It's a mixture of platformer and puzzle solving, with the diffculty curb being fair for the most part for some one who does not play either a lot. I think the game could have benfitted from a fast travel unlock about midway through to help speed up the game, and some of the later puzzles felt heavily padded. I feel like this game is the first in a series, that when I come back in ten years the sequal will eclipse it.			"

												I'm enjoying Hot Tin Roof so far, having purchased it as part of the Humble Freedom Bundle. I will confess the interface took some getting used to. Everything you pick up or hear about is considered a ""clue"", even if it's not relevent to solving the current mystery in question. This can lead to some convoluted interface using to give something to someone. I can see what the developer was aiming for, something similar to Blackwell's ""notes"" system I think, but they've merged it with a traditional game ""inventory"" and it's a little confusing. Other reviews have mentioned that the gun needs to be reloaded manually but they obviously didn't play far enough in to find the character/contexual command that tells you to hold down the reload button and your character will do a full reload. This way you only need to access the reload menu to switch ammo types. It has taken me a little while to get used to the 3D-grid system the game is using for its maps but again, once it clicks you can actually position places in your head in relation to other places and you're away. So when I was given a task I was able to work out ""I need to speak to this person at the end of the town"" and off I went as the map system had 'clicked' for me. The characterisation is funny with some very amusing lines and references to other classic adventures including classics from the Lucasarts stable.I'll happily keep playing this one right until the end.

												This game is one of the best detective games I have ever played. It is thoughtfully laid out and every single detail is answered in the end, and that shows that real thought and effort has gone in. I do not intend to spoil the end but I am sure you will be satisfied with the end, because I know I am!While the start can seem a bit slow, and eventually you may feel a bit of repetition going on, each of the characters have real personalities. Each character contributes in some way to the story, and the detective skills are very much required to look at the dialogue being spoken and to cross reference them with your notes. While it is not essential, and the game will help you out if you need to, this game has a lot of complexity to it, which allows you to get involved with the story and make your own investigations - this is something that I really like - you do not need to follow a set path and while the story is, inevitability, linear, the game does not say “you have to do this in this order”.The level design is very well made and I especially like the use of the contrast between simplistic tessellations of objects and their detailed textures. The levels make good use of 2D and 3D elements, such that the world appears 3D while the camera is fixed on a 2D plane.The cat model for your detective friend is a nice addition, and even helps you out where necessary.There is some plat-former type elements to the game which is further developed with the use of the gun ammo, which you pick-up along the course of the story. Though, I must admit, this can be very frustrating, especially when there are no save points around!Another main part of this game’s composition is puzzles; there are a couple different types such as finding hidden levers or trying to time your jumping and coordination skills to perfection. Each puzzle fits nicely into the theme and is another great addition to liven up the game.Further more, I like the way that, when you go into a new area or a new layer of a building, the previous layer disappears and only the new one remains, which makes the game not only less resource intensive, but really resonates focus on the layer you are one and not the other layers/background.A really nice touch and to emphasize on the cleverness of this game, the title itself is actually a play on words for a phrase called “like a cat on a hot tin roof”, which really impressed me at how thoughtful the developers were!If you intend to buy this game, I advise you to take one thing at a time and not solve all the little details at once, ever-wise, you can get overwhelmed and confused. (Remember to talk to your chief for clues if your stuck!) The story is complicated and may seem overwhelming at times but if you have read a few detective stories recently, then you should be in the mind set for a complex story. Some people have critiqued against the game for this but as Hercule Poirot once said, “Every murder has a simple solution behind its lies”.All in all, this is a great game and while not too long (my first complete run through took about 7 hours), it is really well polished and I hope for a sequel some time in the future. Great job developers!			"

												Pretty good. Engaging storyline. The main town itself feels quite large, filled with characters who are interesting and quirky with very witty dialogue. More than that, though, the characters and the world does feel very real and you can probably lose a few hours immersing yourself in the town. In this respect, Hot Tin Roof does the point and click part well, but the controls aren't tight enough to be a great platformer, and there is quite a bit of platforming after completing the first area. Level design doesn't hold your hand (which I really enjoy) and might need a bit of thinking to get through. Problematic platforming aside, I'm enjoying it so far.			"

												This game is alright. It has some solid play to it, but gets bogged down with some small issues, and one big Core issue. Really there are only two things I couldn't overlook- The dialogue mechanics but not the writing, and telegraphing where to progress. Entering into dialogue becomes a chore after the first time of talking to anyone because the only way of exiting dialogue is by finishing a conversation. Because it's a detective game, whenever I got new evidence, I would immediately try and question the related parties. But they almost never had anything new to add, so I would try to quickly get out but would often end up accidentally choosing the option that leads to a loop. This could be easily solved by adding a Westerado-esque 'walk away' option. But that's more of a personal issue, the next one is a fundemental flaw in design.It is increadibly easy to sequence break this game. I would so often get to areas I didn't need to be yet, and have no idea what the significance to the current case was. As the 'Hardcore Gamer' review said ""An entire murder took place and I had somehow collected the full set of clues for it and acquired an arrest warrant before I’d ever even seen (or heard about) the murder for myself.""Metroidvanias live for exploration, and Detective games live for deducing clues and what to do next. This mashes both in the same way you mash potatos. I didn't look for clues in the place I thought the criminal had motive to strike, I happened accross them as I blisteringly wandered around in a pyrotechnic haze. I managed to arrest every criminal except the last with out a warrent from the police chief, and when I finally did need a warrent he asked me ""Which case?"" and I was stupified. I had never even realized I had other cases (all of which I had solved, and without a warrent)Overall it's a nice game, but it really needs to work on telling you where and what you are supposed to be doing.
