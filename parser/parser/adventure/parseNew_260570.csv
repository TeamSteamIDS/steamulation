												One of the best adventure games i have played, and I’ve played a lot of them.The story is really great and keeps you playing. Characters are deep and well though-out.The Music is phenomenal, very climatic and gives really a lot to the game. One of the best soundtracks I’ve listened to.If you like old-school adventure games this is your jam (and who am I kidding. If you like the genre you probably played it a ton already)			"

												This adventure game signed the legendary Jane Jensen (Gabriel Knight series) was Jane's first since parting ways with Sierra. It had a long and troubled development over many years but the end result is VERY good. And now it's finally avalible on Steam.Weaving one of her signature stories that blends the paranormal with the contemporary, in this case neurobiology and the unused potential in the human mind. When street magician Samantha ""Sam"" Everett gets waylaid by a broken motorcycle on her way to London and in need of shelter and money decides to pose as the new assisstant for the reclusive neurobiology researcher Dr. David Styles in his gothic mansion outside Oxford. Pretty soon strange events are afoot and you play as both Samantha and Dr. Styles to try and get to the bottom of it.The game offers interesting puzzles of varying difficulty, especially when Sam has to use her street magic to manipulate people and objects to progress. The soundtrack by Robert Holmes is gothic and hauntingly beautiful, especially the songs by The Scarlet Furies.  They really helps to set the mood of the story.If adventure games and good stories are your thing, this one is an instant buy. I don't think you'll regret it.			"

												Recommended for anyone who likes adventure games for their story, settings, and characters. If you're a fan of magic (as in magic tricks), then this is also a special treat.This title is made by Jane Jensen of Gabriel Knight fame from the ""golden age"" of adventure games. As far as writing a compelling adventure game, she knows what's doing.Technically, there are some issues, and lack of polish in places reflects the limited development budget. But all this is forgivable, I think.Mentioned in the description, but not shown in the screenshots (probably rightfully so, to avoid spoilers), the chapters actually alternate between two playable characters. This ability to play ""two sides"" of the story is a major feature of Gray Matter.This isn't a puzzle oriented game. You won't be stuck hunting pixels. Progress is mostly straightforward. Each chapter has several main tasks you need to accomplish that are sometimes dependent, but sometimes allow you to explore in an order of your choosing. Note that sometimes the game expects you to arrive at a particular location to progress (this confused me twice).Be warned that the game starts off somewhat slowly in the first few chapters, but gradually picks up pace. Stick with it until at least the third chapter before deciding to give it up.			"

												9/10+ modern point and click adventure game, with nice presentation and incredible soundrack+ fantastic writing, great dialogues and good voice acting, very deep , dark at times mystery story about neurobiology and the possibilities of the brain as well as magic+ likable protagonist, great npcs, dr.styler a very well thought character with dark secrets+ classic point and click gameplay, with the interesting addition of magic, where you have to play  a sort of mini game when using magic according to each cirmstance, you have to read the manual (ingame manual) and experiment a lot in this department, it can become frustrating at times, but also very satisfying when you figure out how to use it+ excellent score system where you track your progress in each chapter- a bit stiff animations+/- pressing space reveals all hotspots in a scene, they could skip that since it ruins the exploration, some casual players might find it very usefull though, since the game can become difficult at timeshave played it retail and finished it once, now i repeat it on steam, it's imo one of the greatest modern adventure games and i recommend it to all adventure gamers on steam.

Brightened eyes, my secrets lie not far away His medals and his badges are all dull by day Many have I an answered plea, my general now I'll often see He comes at dawn, out on the lawn, in quiet stepsWith darkened eyes and wounds that bled, have pillow for his weary head He lays his body down to rest, among the dogs and gathered nest* During the earlier years of my adventure gaming career, I had the chance of playing Gabriel Knight series; a masterpiece of the adventure genre. I was stunned by the narrative quality, atmosphere design and character depth; yearning for more as it comes. Sadly, after the third game, there was radio silence from the creator of Gabriel: Jane Jensen, the novelist and game designer extraordinaire. After years of suffering that silence, Jane Jensen returns to create Gray Matter, a wondrous stand-alone adventure game with a captivating world of its own: a modern folktale.During a hellish storm in the middle of the night, riding on an old motorbike towards London, we meet Samantha Everett. She is a brilliant young woman who's been on the road for quite a while, travelling the cities of Old World, collecting tricks and illusions, aspiring to become a great magician one day. As the fickle finger of fate turns the road sign during the storm, Samantha ends in Dread Hill House, an old mansion that resides on the south of Thames Valley, Oxford. The accursed bike gets busted, and without much hope for any other shelter for the night, Samantha rings the doorbell and introduces herself as the new ""assistant"" that Dr. David Styles, world renowned neurobiologist and the master of the household's been expecting for. From that point onwards Samantha will find herself in a web of mystery, distrust and intrigue, building lies big and small to protect David, as David will become frustratingly trapped within the events of old that's been haunting him. Is there a light at the end of this tunnel for them?Gray Matter is a story of mystery with incredible character design and story depth, melting science and magic within the same pot as an expertise of Jane Jensen. There is a vague two-ways transition between the real and the illusory in the tale, making you question what would be mere trickery, what would be rationally explainable and what would be... actual magic, perhaps. Such masquerade is the direct subtext of the name of the game, aside a component of the central nervous system if you ask me. We have no idea what it is, or better: we have many ideas without solid answers. Such is the beauty settled in this mystery.The display of anecdotes borrowed from folktales and mythologies of the world brought together to present a lovely environment design, illustrated with a selection of haughtily beautiful artwork. The places reimagined within the game carry real life ties and authenticity, bringing in wondrous historical details to your attention in every turn. Characters are unique, charming and quirky in their own way - and with marvelous voice acting, I must say - making you warm up to them faster than you'd realize. At the end of the first chapter, I guarantee that you'll get captivated by the story, the design and characters, pushing yourself to see more of them.The gameplay is basically your old school adventure. You explore the environment and interact with people, locations and items. But I must warn you: there is no hand holding. You will encounter riddles, puzzles and logic tricks, expecting you to think outside of the box. When you are playing this game, keep in mind the kind of relative reality used in Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll. The simplest answer, hidden behind a heavy curtain of misdirection will always be your friend. As Sam being a magician, you will sometimes be expected to pull of magic tricks to bend the events towards your favor. For that purpose, you'll be given a magic interface for you to plan the steps of your trick. You will also be given the opportunity to play as David from time to time, learning more about him as you play. The map is fully interactive with action indicators and there are also some bonus actions you may take in each chapter to reveal a bit more as you play.Gray Matter is an adventure game done right: challenging, intriguing, empathic and immersive. My only complaint would be that there are no Steam achievements yet. But there really is a suitable substructure of the game for achievements already, so I hope we can see them here around one of these days. This is a hidden gem that both adventure gamers, and anyone with an appreciation for either art or narrative building would love.Because he's safe in arms now, what luck have I that I should see Safe in arms now, my bloody boy returned to me From Jericho back home to me...**Lyrics by The Scarlet Furies - Safe In Arms, from Gray Matter the Game soundtrackPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Cerebral challenges with a spunky protagonistThe Good:* Locations are exquisitely drawn* Decent but sometimes underwhelming voice acting* Good inventory system that does take getting used to* Performing magic is a neat idea* Story is a slow burn but worth sticking with* Progress indicators on map really helps* Characters feel real and act/react realistically The Bad:* Pace is really slow, don't expect Monkey Island progress* The magic & other interfaces are clunky and confusing* The talking head models are oddly unsettling* The sheer amount of locations and options can overwhelm* Characters often don't look like they are in the scene* Some dialogue is unskipable* Serious bug in chapter 6, requires you save often* Conclusion is unsurprising if you've paid attentionBackground: Seen it come up in bundles, finally scored a copy. Completed the game (12 hours).Impressions: An innovative twist on the PnC genre with a compelling character, ideas and a decent paranormal mystery story. Clunky interface choices that make it hard to know how to interact and perform tricks. I enjoyed the game and liked the artwork which reminded me of J.M. Linsner at times. The plot is a slow burn that demands patience but is rewarding as you progress. It's hard to recommend for everyone as it's target audience is somewhat narrow but what it goes for it mostly achieves.Recommended for: Paranormal fantasy book readers and those with patience and in for the longhaul.Conclusion: 7/10. A very solid and rewarding effort thats not everyone will love. "

												This game has been an absolute delight to play. I must say I am a fan of the adventure-type, point-and-click and puzzle genre, but this one has blown me away. The story is gripping and very immersive, the characters are well thought out and the magic tricks Sam can do to distract people are just brilliant. I started playing and couldn't stop after that and finished the game in one go (depriving me of sleep, but so worth it!).If you are a fan of the puzzle/point-and-click/adventure game, this is a definite must-have.I really hope they will make a sequel to this game.

												Now where do I begin this review... I personally very much like this game. Pros:- Interesting character development- Engaging story- Good voice acting- Gorgeous ambient soundtrack- Beautiful environment models- Interesting but not so hard puzzleCons:- Puzzles and storyline are not so related to each other. You have to go one place to another, back and forth to find a small piece of cutscenes or dialogs. Since this game is slow paced, most of the time you just walk, walk and walk.Fans of adventure games please be sure to grab this game.			"

												Strange things are happening in Oxford, England. Someone appears to be playing dangerous pranks on people but witnesses are baffled as to how they are done and nobody knows who the culprit is. You play as Samantha Everett, a skeptical magician who has decided to get to the bottom of it. Also trying to solve the mystery is Dr. David Styles, a reclusive  neuroscientist who is conducting experiments on psychic phenomena.The story is well-written and I got hooked in early. I managed to complete the game's 8 chapters within a few days, which is quite rare for me when it comes to point-and-click adventure games. Though I'm not surprised since the story was written by Jane Jensen, the same writer for the 90s Gabriel Knight adventure games.The game features lovely pre-rendered artwork (very wallpaper worthy). In fact I loved discovering new locations just to see what pretty artwork the game's artists had created.The soundtrack was composed by Robert Holmes, the same composer for the Gabriel Knight games, and it really helped immerse me into the  the gothic environments within the game.I'd recommend this game to fans of point-and-click adventure games, especially those who enjoyed the earlier Gabriel Knight games.One thing to note is that you need to Restart your PC if you're using Windows 8+ after installing. Otherwise the game will not be installed properly and run very, very slowly!			"

												A great point and click adventure game that really reminded me of the feeling I had when playing Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within. I really got invested in the story and its characters, Eventhough they are a bit stereotypical, each of them has a strong personality and are quite likeable. Wanting to unveil the game's mistery made me play hours on end without losing patience or feeling the need to go check walktroughs even when things got a bit more difficult. The fact that you get to play two characters during the game is also a nice change of perspective and freshens things up a bit.			"

Posted: January 19, 2015
												This is not a game that's easy to review for me as it's easily the most internally polarizing game I've ever played. It's a game that I both love and hate in equal measure, one that makes the most obvious, horrible mistakes, while still managing to dazzle you with its heart.The game starts off really well with a beautifully rendered slide-show cutscene that looks as if it were painted by hand. It does a perfect job of setting up a mood and introducing our protagonist, and is immediately followed by a very simple and easy tutorial. It's a tutorial that nearly lies to you though, starting you off with a couple of puzzles, only to then bind you to what comes to be something like two hours of primarily dialogue, wandering about and looking at things.The game is slow. It's insane how slow it is. The story gives you almost no hooks to catch you with other than the hope that you'll enjoy the characters and the -promise- of a mystery enough to continue. The actual puzzles in the first two chapters are all very simple. The game does a good job of telling you what you need to do in order to progress, and as you figure out the methods, it'll hint towards the means. They're (mostly) well designed and a joy to unlock, but they never quite feel like they're the main focus of the game.The main focus is the story. It's not a bad story either, it's sweet, it's got its mystery and its build up, but the pacing is glacial. Finishing the first two chapters took me about four hours and in that time I learned extremely little. Yes, you do find out tidbits about both Sam (the protagonist) and Dr. Styles (her employer), but none of it is surprising and none of it carries the shock that the writers seemed to intend. The 'accident' is mentioned very quickly in the game and you're told not to ask people about it (and the game doesn't let you, either), but when it's finally revealed what happened -- it's completely predictable and almost disappointing. A cutscene shows Sam responding to it with shock, surprise, grief and empathy, whereas the player's reaction is more likely that of; ""That's it? Really? That's the big reveal?""Yet, like I said, the story isn't bad. It's just not good. The characters are fine, admittedly even if they feel like they're taken out of a teen romance story, with the orphaned sorta-gothic tough girl acting as the lead, who ends up living with a dark, mysterious and secluded, brooding man with a dark secret and-- yeah. You see where that's going. Along the way she gathers around herself a group of social stereotypes, all of which feel entirely two dimensional. Yet, again, they're not bad. They're entirely likeable even.Then there's the graphics. Another point that really has me struggling to make a decisive judgement on it. It's gorgeous. Mostly. All the environments you go to are beautifully rendered, clearly handmade with so many little touches. I can only think of a couple of locations where I actually wasn't impressed with what I saw. Some of the locations are straight up amazing, even. Check the screenshots and you'll see exactly what I mean. Yet I did say that they're gorgeous, mostly. Mostly. See, all this amazing art is actually given to you at a surprisingly low resolution. Playing at 1920x1080 I was exposed to gorgeous art that had been muddied by being stretched out across the screen. It felt like such a waste. It's only a 5gb game too, it's heart breaking that they didn't just up the size and add higher resolution backgrounds.This is then combined with another good & bad, the character models. They actually look just fine. The resolution is high enough and the details are good enough. The lighting in the scene illuminates them well and the shadows are actually rather pretty. Yet despite this, the fact that you have a high resolution 3D character in a lower resolution environment causes them to pop out horrendously. Not a single character in the game ever looks like they're a part of the world they live in. You're constantly reminded by how the world is nothing but a 2D plane. To make matters worse is that every once in a while the models are given idle animations that are way, way too exaggerated. One scene has the American sitting on the grass, constantly going between leaning back and sitting forward, with him kicking his leg into the air in between. As the conversation goes, he'll do this constantly.Another up and down is the voice acting. The voice actors themselves were very likeable. Their voices fit their roles and they did their lines well. The downside is that this game is stuck with the ye olde adventure game type of talking. It's the kind where as they talk, a box of subtitles pop up. Once the character has finished speaking those lines, they stop. The subtitles go away and a new box opens. Then the character continues. Every time this happens there's this weird and awkward pause that completely snaps you out of it, and really shouldn't be happening in a modern game like this. Conversations should be fluid, especially with such a lovely cast; people should actually talk like they're talking to each other. Not like they're by themselves and reading subtitle boxes one at a time.So what's the verdict? Honestly, despite everything, I want to like this game. I do. Every part of it just shines with heart and effort. You can tell that on every front, the developer put their heart and soul into the game. They worked -hard- on it, and that fact gives it so much charm and likeability. This shows best in the art I believe, but also in the puzzles themselves. They're rather simple, I admit, but they're a joy to solve. They're fun! I wish the game had more of them, a LOT more. It's fantastic to chase after Daedalus clues! It's equally fun to flip through the book of magic tricks to apply them to a situation, then map out the choreography. Simple, yes. Easy, yes. But fun. Charming, clever and full of character.So I really believe I can suggest this game to people that enjoy adventure games. If you're okay with slow pacing, if you enjoy an easy story and you'd rather have fun puzzles instead of difficult ones, this is a game I can recommend to you. Like I said, this game is a labour of love and I want to see more from the talent behind it. :]			"

												I'm on the fence about this game, but in the end I'd recommend it (weakly). I think the devs did a nice job overall, though the game does have some flaws. In particular, I think they did a nice job of steering away from the standard genre cliches and doing something different in terms of characters, plot, setting, etc.Pros:+ Excellent story. Fairly unique plot. Good pacing. Kept me engaged throughout. The story alone is enough reason to play, at the end of the day.+ Good characters. Chatacters were distinct, and were not simply the standard cliches you see in every other game.+ Several pretty innovative elements (both in terms of story and gameplay). Most notably, the main character is a stage magician and is able to do magic tricks to solve certain puzzles. (This mechanic is not very well done, but still nice to see something fresh.)Cons:- The game is unreasonable in terms of expecting you to do very, very specific things at certain points in the game. At several times, I got 99% of the way through a chapter only to get stuck on a single action because I didn't do something very small (like look at something or go back to an area I had already searched). As a result, I had to consult a walkthrough several times. In each case I was very annoyed at the ""solution.""- I appreciate that the cutscene artwork in the game is unique and different, but it is not very effective at conveying what is actually happening. Some of the cutscenes can be pretty confusing in terms of following what is actually going on.			"

												I have played as many adventure / point-and-click games as I could get my hands to in this life and this is definitely one of my favorites. The truth is that it doesn't really have challenging puzzles at all; they are all pretty simple and even I could say lame. However, I loved it, for the following reasons:- The artwork. It seduced me from the very beginning. The videos seem to be a sequence of oil paintings, beautifully done, starting with the protagonist. The whole atmosphere is a work of art.- The story. It was cool and original, even though it had a couple of cheesy moments. If I heard Dr. Styles saying ""Laura"" one more time, I would have snapped, and it is my name!- The music! I want the soundtrack!- The lack of illogical ""inventory-based puzzles"", which is usual in adventure games and forces you to pixel-hunt the entire screen, looking for items that make no sense, until you need to combine a baby rattle with a crystal glass and pepper spray to open a door. Not here. Even though it could have used more challenging puzzles overall, I am glad that the usual nonsense of other games wasn't present here.- Well, I guess this is kind of a spoiler... Including magic tricks was, for me, very cool.Now, on the downside, besides the lack of challenging puzzles I could mention that the story, cool as I found it, has a couple of ""holes"". There were, particularly close to the end, a couple of things that didn't make any sense and that weren't explained. But, in general, I loved this game and I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys artistic / story-based adventure games.			"

												It's hard to explain how this game totally pulls you into its world in the way that only classic adventure games can. Its strengths are beautiful backgrounds and objects, well-developed characters, and a great mystery story that keeps you guessing until the very end. There aren't many puzzles that will stump you; the focus is on exploring this fictional Oxford and discovering the next part of the story. Sam, the protagonist, can use magic tricks to manipulate people, but this mechanic doesn't let you be as creative as I first imagined; you just choose tricks from a book and execute them according to the instructions. Still, it's a nice way to continue the themes of the game--illusion, deception, and magic--into the point-and-click gameplay.Now that I've finished the game, I find myself really missing the atmosphere and the characters. (FYI, one character is a bit of a ""funny Jewish guy"" stereotype, and the main romance in the game isn't developed at all, but these are small complaints.) The voice acting is solid; the soundtrack is great; the animations leave a bit to be desired, but the still art is fantastic. The game is broken up into chapters, and two chapters equal one in-game day: first you play in the morning as Sam, then in the afternoon as Dr. Styles, another neat feature. Overall, Gray Matter is definitely worth purchasing for anyone who likes the sound of adventure-game-meets-graphic-novel. It has some of the best writing of any modern game, and boasts a surprisingly complex plot that takes time to unravel. Lots of buried clues and rewards for an observant player. I was surprised to find that this game hasn't reached a more general audience, because it's fantastic. Both sad and funny at times (sometimes unintentionally funny), it's also a great experience to share with a friend.P.S. I ran into a bug where cutscenes at the end of the game kept repeating, but was able to choose ""skip scene"" in options to overcome this.			"

												I own all Gabriel Knight games as well as the books and I'm so glad this game is finally available on steam.I have finished this game before but I didn't hesitate one second to buy it when I saw it on the frontpage of the steam store.When I was younger I got a demo of one of the Gabriel Knight games from a PC magazine I had a subscription to and played it over and over and a few years later It hit me that I had to get the games I discovered when I was younger since they have always been in the back of my mind.Gray Matter brings back all the feelings from the early point and click games, and it truly is one of the best of its genre.If you are interested in puzzle solving adventures with great storylines this really is a game for you and for its price it would be foolish not to give it a go.

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I wasn't a big fan of the magic tricks, but the way they are done makes them pretty easy to accomplish with little headache so they didn't detract from gameplay. The story was engrossing and surprising. I didn't love Sam, but she was somewhat likable. She was a bit annoying at times, but that was mostly her acting like a teenager who thinks she knows more than she does so it's forgivable. I found Dr. Styles very likable for someone obsessed with his dead wife. The game overall was great. I found some of it impossible to get through without a walkthrough because clues on what to do next were either too hard to figure out or non-existent, but if you don't mind using a walkthrough this game is worth it.

												Gray Matter was a really enjoyable game for how cheap it was - I was so surprised! The voice acting is really well done, the character development is good and every character is unique in their own way, the puzzles can be challenging but in a fun way; they keep you engaged. The story is also really good, especially if you have an interest in the supernatural and the mysteries thereof. It's longer than most puzzle games - atleast 15+ hours. It has some awesome easter eggs in the game, as well as recreating  the area of Oxford in very good detail! For the price steam is asking, there is no reason you shouldn't pick up this game if you like puzzles adventures. It was really well done, and I would play it again.			"

												A solid adventure with quite an interesting protagonist. Fans of Jane Jensen's earlier games (Gabriel Knight, i.e.) should take a look. I enjoyed playing it, although I've been highly annoyed by the final part of the game. It felt like a dumb treadmill, with puzzles being pretty much unrelated to the rest of the game /narrativ. The game wouldn't have needed that artifical time stretcher, quite the contrary.If you're searching for a decent, albeit somewhat old fashioned adventure, go get it. Just don't expect to be blown away by cinematics or eye candy effects.			"

												Great game for an adventure game fan. A little glitchy, but not terrible. Really good voice acting. The plot was interesting. I feel it wrapped up in a somewhat predictable manner, while leaving somewhat of a plothole or.. leap of logic in it. But that is only a minor detractor from an overall great game. Particularly the visual composure of the scenes with the thoughtfullness of the puzzles. Most of the puzzles and item combinations and stuff makes sense without being overly easy or overly difficult, it's pretty medium in that respect. Which I like, because I like to get through the story without getting bored, while having to put some thought into stuff.			"

												Interesting premise, a mix of the supernatural and modern magician illusionists represented by two main protagonists who each try to figure out what reality is concerning some recurring mysterious events. However, one of the main protagonists feels like a Japanese anime supervillian, and there is not a single likeable character in the story. The story occasionally craps itself when the characters do something completely against their established personality, which makes it difficult to immerse yourself when you just can't understand why anyone acts like they do and eventually you just have to give up and observe everything at a distance, which is a shame.The game also commits the cardinal sin of objects you've already looked at suddenly changing function when you poke at something else somewhere else that magically furthers the story, without letting you know. Which means you're constantly running around rechecking every clickable thing you've already clicked, looking for the one thing that'll now allow you to continue. Gameplay is frustrating, but that's par for the course for most adventure games. Considering all the running around you have to do, it would have been nice if the running controls worked consistently. Sometimes you can double-click to run faster, but it doesn't always work and there's a big animation delay.I had massive performance problems with the game, as have a bunch of other people on the forums, but setting the game to WinXP SP2 Compatibility mode fixed it for me.

You play as two different characters, one of whom is convinced the events are due to paranormal activity and the other who is convinced it is due to a magician's illusions which really helps tell the story form the different perspectives. The puzzles are mostly straightforward, you just mainly need to go round and talk to everyone and look at everything to progress the story. There are a few convoluted puzzles but not too many. The length of the game is pretty good too for a point and click game. The locations are beautiful as is the cut scene art, only slightly marred by how the 3D models don't quite look like the characters do in the cut scenes. I also really liked the music there were a couple of times where I just sat and listend to the music for a bit in the menu before I started the game. All in all a pretty good game.			"

												Gray Matter is a point&click adventure game by Jane Jensen. Need I say more?It's very well written, clever and ever so interesting. The protagonist(s) are rather unique and definitely not your usual, avarage Joe characters. They are likable but not without some obvious flaws (like Samantha likes to jump to conclusions really fast). The puzzles (especially the Daedelus riddles) are exciting even if the game is a bit easier than I'd like. Overall the game still looks nice even though it's years old (despite what the store page says) and the soundtrack is amazing (even if it's only a few songs).I highly recommend playing this!			"

												It was so nice to have found out about this game and played it through. It's been awhile since the true meaning of ""adventure game"" came out like this one. I understand why this game has been reciving such high reviews.I really liked the main character, Sam and her magic. It was really cool to actually perform some magic in the game too.The game starts off with somewhat unnerving movie, then sure enough, I, Sam had to go into that old looking mansion where creepy Professor Styles resides...Some of the puzzles were challenging, especially at the ""the game of life"". It was little confusing to me but I guess one will surely need to put on your thinking cap on here.If you are true fan of Adventure games, then this is it!			"

												Gray Matter marked the return of Jane Jensen to the point and click adventure world.  I would mark the return as a success. Much better than her subsequent game, Moebius, but not in the same ballpark as the original Gabriel Knight.Gray Matter shows the same quality of research as we saw in the Gabriel Knight series, although not to the depths of Gabriel Knight 2.  Here we learn about magic and are shown about real, historical Oxford.  It's a pleasant atmosphere, with the tone and mystery of a gothic romance.  The story holds your interest, and the game introduces a number of archetypal characters that feel like a bit more than caricatures.  The music by Robert Holmes is fantastic and deserves special mention as well.The puzzles don't feel gratuitous, and the game strikes a nice balance in terms of difficulty (although the game definitely tends toward the easy side in comparison to the tougher Gabriel Knight).  My only complaint with the puzzles is that a good deal of travel is necessary to complete them- e.g. you can't take an object from a magic shop until your character realizes what they need the object, rinse and repeat.  I've seen some complaints about the ""magic system"", but I found it easy to follow and enjoyable.On the negative side, Gray Matter exists in that unhappy grey area of gaming- too much budget to make a 2d, hand-painted, low res point and click game (like the original Gabriel Knight), but not enough of a budget to actually work out the kinks of the interface.  The movement, the cutscene art, the inventory system- they're all clunky and just not all that great.  This is a large part that holds the game back from being a great adventure game.  The other issue is a lackluster ending- the story holds interest, but in the end there isn't a twist or any kind of ""big impact"" at the end.  The comparisons to Gabriel Knight 1 or 2 don't do this game any favors here.Final verdict: A successful effort by Jensen, with some very strong stuff here.  With the flaws in mind, however, it ends up being a ""good not great"" adventure.			"

												From acclaimed adventure writer Jane Jenson of Gabriel Knight fame, comes her first point and click game since her Sierra days. It was worth the wait.You play as Sam Everett, a struggling yet talented young American magician, who seeks to join the mysterious Daedalus Club, an exclusive magicians’ society. On the way to London, her bike breaks down and she takes refuge in a beautiful gothic mansion, pretending to be an Oxford student sent to assist the mansion’s resident, Dr David Styles, a physically and emotionally scarred neurobiologist who is in deep mourning over the loss of his wife from a tragic accident. The game has eight chapters in which you will alternate between Sam and Dr Styles perspectives as they try to unravel the mysterious and spooky events that are going on in and around Oxford. The story is, for the most part, really interesting and the core mystery keeps you guessing. Unfortunately, the final chapter, while full of the more interesting puzzles that are on offer throughout the game, offers an unsatisfying and rushed conclusion that leaves several questions unanswered. The voice acting is well done, especially from the main protagonists Sam and Dr Styles. So too from the supporting characters with the exception of the bit part characters who are laughably bad. The gameplay is a classic point and click experience. You look for information and clues for the situation at hand and search for items that will later come in handy for solving a puzzle as well as talking to a host of colourful characters. The puzzles, for the most part, are logical and well tuned and, bar a few, overall not too complicated to solve. I felt the difficulty was just right and left me with a sense of satisfaction after having worked them out.Graphically the game is beautiful. The pre-rendered backgrounds make all the locations in the game gorgeous, the character models are not too shabby either being fairly detailed and the hand drawn animated cutscenes are just as attractive as the in game visuals.The music too, is beautiful, I cannot stop listening to the soundtrack. It fits in with the game's mysterious and haunting theme perfectly.Overall this is a wonderful point and click adventure and I highly recommend you play this, especially if you love adventure games.

												Gray Matter is one of the best adventure games i've ever played. For me, it's an adventure game that does everything right. Designed by Jane Jensen, renowned game designer (Gabriel Knight), it has all these things that make this game truly a gem.Interesting and relatable characters, excellent storytelling, challenging puzzles. Gray Matter is a great game and it deserves our attention.			"

												Didn't know anything about this game when I started playing it, came with some bundle ages ago. Extremely presently surprised with this.The graphics are pretty good, the music/audio is good with decent voice acting and I didn't notice any bugs. The story is great, kept me interested all the way through and I often didn't want to stop playing it when I needed to.There are a few small issues but they are pretty picky. First, I'm not sure if any of the developers have actually been to England as there were a few odd things, such as steam vents in Oxford and pricing written as 3£ rather than £3 in the background.There were also a few times where a cutscene would end and I didn't have a clue what I was meant to be doing next. After exploring a bit I soon worked it out though.If you're in to adventure games then I would recommend this.			"

												Story: 3/5Gameplay: 3/5Voice Acting: 4/5Overall: 3/5I had heard rave reviews about the story so I was pretty excited for this game. The story is interesting enough but never really grabbed me. You switch between two characters and they're the only ones who get any real development. The rest of the cast just kind of felt...there. Still, it's a pretty well told story for the most part. The ending felt very abrupt and messy though and left me very unsatisfied.The gameplay is pretty standard point and click but there are very few actual puzzles. The game consists of mostly visiting every location and clicking everything. There was one annoying time when I was almost done a chapter but couldn't complete it because there was a specific spot in one area that I never clicked.Overall though, the gameplay was decent and the story, while certainly not my favorite video game story, was enough to keep me interested.

Do you believe in Magic? Or is your mind so logic and scientific that tries to find a resonable explanation for everything? Do you believe Love will last even in the afterlife?Well, if the answer at one of those questions is yes, this is your game! You must have it in your library!In my opinion, it is one of the best adventure/point&click game I've ever played. I loved it and enjoyed every single moment, turn of events and tricks. Do I recommend it? Absolutely!One of the strong points of this game is the discovering of the development of its story step by step while you're playing it, so I will not given any drescription of it, just the few hints above, illustrating some of its topics, and a list of its pro&con.PRO:  The plot is enticing, brilliant, original, well structured and developed. It casts a spell upon you so that you will be enthralled by it and held in its power  Graphics are well drawn and designed both for gameplay and cutscenes  Gameplay is perfectly built: there is an initial tutorial and whenever you bump into a new situation the tutorial will show, explaing how to deal with it. When you move the cursor on top of the screen the inventory is showed (remember that objects can be combined in it); on the left corner there is an icon that works as main menu and there are two buttons: one with a series of horizontal lines that shows you the ""paragraphs"" of the chapter and your progress in each of them in percentage (it's very very useful! So you're able to figure immediately on which you must focus to get the story going on) and one with an asterisk that shows the map of the places you can visit. Clicking the spacebar shows the hotspots.  The soundtracks are atmospheric and make you be involved deeply in the story  Dialogues are well written just as the voices of the characters are well actedCON:  I think a younger fresh voice for the main male character would have been more fitting, but it's just my opinion  The scripts and style of them are, in same case, blurred or tendig to overlie each otherIn summary, my rating of the game is 9/10 "

												This game was everything games are supposed to be. I was drawn in be the art style, the music, and the pleasant usable interface. Then I began to realize the depth of the story. The characters are all multifaceted and interesting. The painstakingly designed and rendered scenery suggests a deep familiarity with the area and makes me curious about the inspiration for the story. Oxford was never on my list of places to visit but after that glimpse it may well be. The detailed backstory available in the game was interesting and educational.The puzzles were really good, not being entirely apparent but always with ample clues if you read things. I did find that I wound up using the area hotspots more often than not as i was too interested in the story and the puzzles to worry about playing pixel hunts but a couple of times I was dissapointed that I had as there are some cleverly hidden zones that would have caused me some enjoyable frustration. The idea of Samantha's magic tricks was a really novel presentation and seemed to add some extra dimension to the adventure. In general none of the puzzles weren't overly routine but the fresh feel of it and the great detail helped anytime it was too obvious.I'd also like to give this game a nod for making some efforts to offer some positive messages through the actions and choices (or refusals) of the protagonist. It's refreshing to see good values and health being given a positive light in gaming. Not to get on a soapbox and wave my cane or anything...It was a very moving and immersive game with a well written if extensively foreshadowed story.You probably wouldn't like it. I really did. Thanks for making this. I'm looking forward to future works.			"

												I've played a fair few point and click adventure games and this ranks pretty low among them. The voice acting and dialogue is good and it would probably have made a good tv series or book but as a game it's really bad in almost every possible way.Most of the puzzles are pretty straightforward in the actual steps required to solve them, nothing gets mechanically more complicated than combining two items and using the result on another or typing in a code on a keypad. This can be seen as a good thing, you'll never get stuck trying to figure out what particular order to combine items in or stumbling through some complex order of inputs on a machine, but to cancel it out it's generally complete nonsense what puzzles you're actually supposed to be solving. Interactions with your environment is limited to one action per interactable environment object so you don't accidentally miss picking something up, but this is canceled out by having some random items equipped overwriting this one action (but not all items) creating moments where you have to use an item on a door but don't realize because the cursor only tells you to walk through it. You can hit space to make titles appear over every interactable ""if you get stuck"", but it's pretty much mandatory to have these on all the time since there's otherwise no indication most things can be interacted with aside from the mouse cursor changing and there's a lot of stuff overlapping that you could easily miss being seperate interactables. There's also the occasional offscreen interactable that you'd have no clue was there without seeing half the title for it poking out since 99% of the game is static single screens and there's no other indications for which are dynamic long screens that will pan when you walk to the edge of them.The narrative does a really poor job of directing you to where you should be going, unlike something like Monkey Island where Guybrush will say all his thoughts aloud the characters in this will keep most of their ideas and motivations to themselves so you'll be expected to be rooting through someones stuff to look for incriminating evidence when to the player there's no reason to suspect them since the character is being paranoid without vocalizing it. The motivations make perfect sense for the characters but not the player so I spent a ton of time wandering around wondering what exactly I was supposed to be doing. The map lights up areas you need to visit to progress the chapter but it lights up EVERY area with important things to do for the entire chapter so that isn't helpful until you're wrapping things up at the end. Each area's progress is not independent either so you can have three areas lit up that you can't actually do anything in until you complete some arbitrary action in the fourth. You can also see a listing of your progress towards the chapters ""questlines"" but that just gives you a very general idea of what to do. For anyone who takes a break and comes back a while later mid-chapter you're basically screwed and stuck trying to use every item on everything. hell that still happened plenty to me and I did all my play back to back.To top all this off, the game doesn't even run very well. It's got a couple bugs that will cause it to drop tons of frames unless you restart your computer and sometimes that won't even fix it. At a few points characters I was supposed to talk to didn't render on screen and I had to leave and reenter the area. For an adventure game with prerendered backgrounds and very few fairly ugly models on screen at any time this kind of performance is inexcusable.It's a shame every single aspect of what makes this a game is so poorly executed, it has an engaging enough story and characters that it could have been a decent book or movie but the mechanics ruin the pacing and make the whole thing a greuling experience. Worth a watch on youtube, not worth a playthrough no matter how cheap it is.			"

												Old school point-and-click game with a context of magic and paranormal activity.The game is played through two main characters, much like in the Gabriel Knight series, also created by Jane Jensen. The gameplay is known for most: pointing, clicking and discussing all the way. This works of course as well as it should  and there wasn't much to complain about. The story is divided into chapters each having its own puzzles and goals. The puzzles are relatively clear and not too difficult. Compared to the Gabriel Knight series, this game involves also a fair share of fantasy elements and nods to mythology, which suits the story just fine. However, as a negative side note, the game is not too long and the story seems leave a couple loose plot lines unresolved. Maybe there was a sequel planned, which never came about?All in all, this is a good game with nice features for those wanting to solve yet one more mystery through excessive molesting of the mouse. However, the game is not the best in its genre, missing a few unforgettable moments.			"

I had to get help from the internet a few times, but most times I got stuck it would turn out I hadn't finished all conversation options with a character or something. Only puzzle that really had me stumped was the club maze near the end. If there was a sequel to this, I would buy it instantly =D			"

												I went into Gray Matter expecting an 'alright' point-and-click adventure with decent puzzles and mechanics; what I got instead was an incredibly well written storytelling experience, albeit with gameplay one would still deem 'alright'. The atmosphere created was very mysterious, with heavy dashes of both gothic and paranormal sensibilities, so fans of those conventions should be quite pleased with the presentation. Because the genre of the game is point-and-click, one shouldn't go in expecting heavy action-  although there were some great build ups to dramatic revelations, and tension in the style of a true tale of mystery, which keeps the player hooked until the end.Pros:+ Quality narrative with an interesting mix of characters+ Excellent voice acting and attention to detail+ Puzzles in my opinion not overly difficult or easy, but might require a glance or two at a guide+ In-game graphics were okay, but the cutscene/hand-drawn art were quite nice+ Great Soundtrack, both ambient and vocalized+ Samantha Everett and David Styles as dual protagonists were well developed and had intriguing interactions with both each other & side characters+ You learn a little something about magic tricks and neurology. Think about the last time this happened in a game you played!Neutrals/Cons:- Certain areas of the game experienced a HUGE degree of slow down (Ie. Christ Church Exterior)- No where does it mention (from what I recall?) that you can double click on an area to have the character you are controlling JOG to the spot instead of casually strolling- Subjectively there was some potential wasted with regards to character development, and the ""building up"" so to speak did not always feel like it flowed smoothly- The ending felt a bit abrupt, and again there was a lot of stuff from the story which could have been wrapped up in a more complete manner. Was hoping for a more detailed epilogue due to all the time and effort invested in developing the cast, but alas many questions went unansweredOverall:8.5 out of 10If you're looking for a slower paced game with a page-turner of a story, and either don't mind or enjoy point-and-click mechanics, ""Gray Matter"" is the game for you.

												Excellent mystery advenure game laced with a hint of paranormal. Strong writing penned by Jane Jensen.  The experience is slightly marred by arcane 3D models and animation which would not have been great even even 10 years ago.  Despite some minor flaws, a must buy for all adventure games fans. The good: Strong writing that keeps player entertained throughout the entire experience Interesting magic puzzle mechanicsNicely rendered backrounds blended seamlessly with wonderfully done 2D art and cutscenes. Suggestive voiceover and decent musicThe bad: Character models are very dated with animation that is sometimes almost painful to watch. Character portraits that pop up during conversations look like they all had ""egg"" shaped head as a base model to which different noses, eyes and hair had been plastered into later (think kinda mid 90's fallout style). Full sized models you otherwise interact with resemble these potato men portraits only if you crank up your imagination to the point where you start seeing a white rabbit with a golden watch popping up from under random furniture in your house.Puzzle design has some rough spots here and there. On several occasions you can come accross objects which you cannot pickup before having perfomed a number of unrelated tasks, forcing a player to back-track for no apparent reason.Some of the bonus objectives feel pointless and combined with the technical issues mentioned above bear a feeling of project lead used to large budget realizing half-way through production that the actual budget is too small for the projects ambition.

												A very interesting game, full of details and a great soundtrack. I've spent a lot of time enjoying and playing the game. It's hard to find a good point and click with a nice story and so on... I think this game was amazing! The story and dialogues are easy and well built, I don't regret even a bit buying and playing. :)			"

												Oh god, I can talk about this game for hours, and still couldn't explain what so great about it. But I'll try me best. In short -- this game will make my top 10 of adventures any time any year any millenium (alongside Longest Jorney, Space Quest franchise and Gabriel Knight)First of all don't expect epic story or world at a prejudiece of disaster, player will need to save! No, this is a story about two humans, two souls, two destenies. Both of our heroes have their agenda, but there is also a mistery in old British castle that will affect both. But they look at it differently. One is a sceptical, another fatefull. Actually, let's take a closer look on our heroes.Samanta Everret is an American red haired dare beast of a lass, who acidentely get involved into a working for famous neurobiologiest. She's a sceptical, tough, antihero like persona. No remorse or a second thought if there is something needed to be done! She can lie, trick people, go into extremes, argue... and bloody hell she's amazing at what she does. It also help in her life style, that she's magician (not real though, just ye standart showwoman trixter). In her chapters, player will come into situations and events, wneh her art will help her get the job done. Unfortunately, there are no experiments... You just taking trik from a book and perform it step by step. But still this is a nice little addition and somewhat of a unique play mechanic. But this lass have a dream, to became a part of Dedalus club -- a very discreet, magician community. Will she achieve her goal? Up to player to find out.Dr. David Styles on the other hand is a misantropic, socialy awkward, hermet... And who can blame him? Telling his story would be a spoiler thus a crime! He lost his wife, he really cared about and loved, and after some acidents, dedicated his life to neurobiology, in attempt to... Some may call him boring charecter, but for me, he alweys will stay one of a perfect example of those mad scientist, that don't see to destroy world or have revenge on someone. No, he just wants to do his job, he seek some remedy for a broken soul, he gave up on life but still have faith. it's hard to describe this charecter, you should just see for yourself.What about an actuall story? Well, the game is developed by Gabriel Knight creator; So be ready for a mature, dark and actually frightning game! There are no gallons of blood of jump scares. No the mystery and keeping player in dark is scary enough. The real fear comes from what you can't see, thus giving birth to fear of seeing what was mystery. Again, this is a story of people, not world. Oh yeah and soundtrack! The musik in main menu sets the mood already... and it will continue throughout the whole game.There are no video cutscenes, their place are given to a comix style. Are they good? Yes they are. unfortunately that could not be sayed about the game animation itself. Charecter models and amimation is bulky, and there are lack of animation for deeds you perform. But those can be overlook, if only you are not some kind of animation maniac. Saying that, locations on the other hand, look astonishing! The are bloody amazing! The amount of details can be overwhelming at times.What about puzzles? Game is easy, really easy. Not in it's favor, but yes... I doubt anyone will need solution for this. Most of puzzles are point 'n click items based, and those are not quite easy to solve. But on the other hand, compared to modern ""Adventures"" -- that are either too dumb (not realising what made old adventures great), or without any actual puzzling or adventuring (hello Telltails), I would say it has a balance between story and puzzles, and there are actual thinking must be involved.So yada yada yada. Do I recomend this game? I had disk with it back in 2011... Lost it... Was sad... Now i have it on steam, and would buy it again for sure! So yes. If you like Gabriel Knight, if you are up for a mature, dark and frightning story, if you like oldschool adventures. Then this game will remedy your hunger.			"

												Gray Matter manages to be a brilliant breath of fresh air while remaining a traditional point & click adventure with old-school appeal. Little to be said here that every other reviewer hasn't allready said: an original, modern story, fantastic writing, beautiful art, interesting and original puzzles, great music, great voice acting, this game does everything right. Jane Jensen knows her craft, it's great to have her back at it. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.			"

												I'm actually torn between whether to recommend the game or not. It reminds me a lot about Fahrenheit in a way that a mysterious and captivating story gets ruined by a rushed up and shallow ending. At least all the mysteries are explained. Kinda.Why have I finally decided not to recommend the game? While I have certainly enjoyed the voice acting and the story (except the ending), the production values of the game are not really that high. The visuals, especially characters models and animations are subpar for 2014. The cutsences are just a series of images. The puzzles are pretty boring and obvious for the most part. And you have to visit the same locations again and again in the first 7 chapters (only the last chapter has a lot of cool new content).There are also some technical issues related to the perfomance. Also there's no autosave feature which is really bad since these days you are accustomed not to save your game manually.Bottom line: while Gray Matter is not bad, there are so many great adventure games these days (from Daedalic and King Art specifically, not to mention Broken Age and Sherlock Holmes series) that have higher production values. Sorry, Jane Jensen, but it seems your time has passed.			"

												Gray Matter is a classic point-and-click adventure game. It is aplyed from the third person POV and the player controls a female character. Well, the story is great and charming - you have a magic protegonist and it seems oh-so-lovely that she can do these tricks. However, do not get attached to the simplicity of illusions. Things will get pretty undergound when  you get to the later plot twists.The general positives of this game are the classic P&C-ness, the dialogue and of course, the magic. If you're not into slow, P&C games, then this one is not for you. Another thing that I personally find as a negative side is that sometimes you need to visit a specific place so that the story can continue. This is  abit off, but oh well.Generally, this is one of the top P&C quest games I know.			"

												I will admit that I was expecting this game to be the one I buy on sale, play once, and leave to gather dust in my Steam library. My standards weren't very high and I hadn't heard of the developer before. I have never been more wrong in my life.The storyline is incredible, the graphics are damn good for a point & click game and the voice acting is pretty believeable. I was hooked within the first five minutes of gameplay. I love how you don't stay as one character and you are kept in suspense during the entire game. Buy this game; you will not regret it			"

												Gray Matter is an adventure point-and-click game that, while not braving any new ground for the genre, more than makes up for it with a great and immersive story, beatiful scenery and a likeable cast of characters. The plot mixes science and paranormal elements in a masterful way and is advanced by well-written and often amusing dialogue. The characters themselves, while not immeadiately likeable, are very well portrayed and are given life with surprisingly good voice acting. The dialogue is often ripe with cultural references and the bonus challenges a la ""DaVinci Code"" will be a delight for the cultivated gamer. The soundtrack is quite adequate too, mostly composed of classy, although sometimes repetitive, piano pieces than fit the mood of the game. Although the camera angle is fixed, the graphics are quite detailed and colourful and it is not rare to find neat little details that add to the enchanting vistas (such as a tiny spider hanging in its web in a dungeon or a tree leaf blowing in the wind in the distance). The gloomy sky above Oxford is particularly beautiful. One last thing to note about this game is that there is next to no hand-holding: most of the time, you rely on your own logical and common sense to solve the puzzles or advance the story. There is no objectives table and you are often required to thoroughly inspect the surroundings in order to find out what you need to proceed. This can lead to some frustration along the way but is also quite rewarding in the long run.In the end, Gray Matter's intriguing and thought-provoking story and atmosphere more than makes up for any small shortcomings, making it a worthwile aquisition for any action fan or even casual gamer.

												A tragic death. A secret society. A series of unexplained accidents. A mysterious experiment. All come together in Gray Matter, a charming adventure game that hearkens back to genre classics, namely Syberia and The Longest Journey. Like those games, Gray Matter is headlined by a compelling female protagonist, the magician Samantha, who journeys through an Oxford seeped in atmosphere and intrigue. As she adventures throughout Oxford, Sam meets a curious cast of individuals: the mysterious magic shop owner, Mephistopheles; the sultry foreign exchange student, Helena; the shy and superstitious nursing student, Angela; and the infamous neurobiologist, Dr. David Styles, just to name a few. The game's story, while not without its loose ends, is the strongest feature of Gray Matter. Happenings begin to coincide that force the player to question: Are these events supernatural in origin? Or scientific? Are they parts to an elaborate illusion, carefully orchestrated by a puppeteer lurking in the Oxford shadows? Or some combination of all three? Suspicion is thrown onto all core characters and the solution to the mysteries in Oxford remains elusive right up to the game's closing act. The game's visuals will likely be disappoint to some, given that the game originally released in English around 2011 and the game looks more like it was a product from the early 2000. That being said, if this is something you can look past, the game's scenes and area are still a delight to look through. Less enjoyable are the close-ups of the in-game models, displayed in the bottom left whenever a character is speaking. These close-ups make some characters appear strange and wooden and this becomes particularly jarring when the player sees depictions of the characters in short, illustrated cut scenes between game chapters, where they look much better, but also very different from their in-game models. The game also suffers from one of the classic weaknesses of adventure games: progression is often dependent upon clicking or finding a very specific area/object, sometime multiple times. Several in-game features actually offer the player help with this, however, if needed. Pressing spacebar enables labels for clickable areas/items of interest and the game also features a ""progression bar"" for everything needed to finish and complete a chapter. It's important to note that this isn't a checklist, but rather a tool that tells the player if they've done everything that needs doing for a specific task or quest line that chapter.These quibbles aside, all in all, I would wholly recommend Gray Matter to adventure game fans, especially those who are particularly fond of certain classic games within the genre. Gameplay is fun, if simple in the traditional sense - puzzles are largely limited to collecting items and selecting which items to use or combine in specific circumstances. The graphics, while also simplistic, do not impede the true strengths of the game: the characters and the storytelling. The game truly left me clamoring for more, which is a shame, as the game, as well as its creator, has hinted towards a sequel, though any such project seems to be in limbo, at least as of now. Happy adventuring!			"

												This is one of the best recent P&C games I've played. The artwork is gorgeous, the puzzles are reasonably challenging, the magic tricks provide an element different from most other games of this genre, and the chapters are not entirely linear, allowing you some freedom (not much) to explore and do things in the order you want. The music is lovely (I want the theme song). The drawbacks are that it takes forever to wait for your character to walk across the scene to interact with and object or travel to another sublocation. The video cutscenes are glitchy and repeat, forcing you to skip them. Using and examining objects isn't entirely intuitive- for example having to right click to grab and drag documents to read them after  zooming in. You can turn on labels to show you clickable items and areas, but it's a bit of a pixel hunt with some things to figure out where to click, especially when there are multiple items in a small location. A lot of objects and locations seem to be clickable/ examinable for no apparent reason- but not enough random items to make it seems like an added challenge to the game- just enough to be annoying. I am not finished yet, but it feels like store onlu has one possible outcome despite the number of interesting characters you interact with. Despite the negatives this is a fun, beautiful game with an engaging story and interesting characters, and I hope it becomes a series, or there are at least more games in this style.			"

												So, the game is very beautiful.  The characters are likeable (mostly), however I found the main character to be annoying at times because of her attitude towards certain things.  The other characters and Dr. Styles are all interesting and have their own unique personalities.  The story with Dr. Styles and his experiments were very interesting to me and added more of a mystery feel to the game, however I wasn't totally into Sam and her magic part of the story.  For example, it takes a pretty weird turn at the end where suddenly everything is vastly different than the rest of the game... that had me confused and I was just rushing through it because I wanted out.  As for the magic tricks, I thought they added a little more to the gameplay and were easy enough to do.  One thing to keep in mind: Always interact with everything in the environment.  Even if it means just looking at something as sometimes even minor parts of the story can keep you from getting 100% for that part.			"

												I loved the atmosphere, music and story of this point and click video game. The animations were a bit laggy but the backgrounds made up for it and story-wise the game was really good. While there were references to gothic or psy fiction, the story managed not to fall into stereotypes. I liked alterning between Sam and Dr Styles and it was very rewarding to see the story unravel and to use magic tricks to have my - well, Sam's - way around.

												Good point and click adventure from Jane Jensen, the creator of the acclaimed ""Gabriel Knight"" series. Just like Gabriel Knight, Gray Matter is a mystery story that deeply involves the supernatural and paranormal, while exploring real locations, talking to a lot of characters and solving multiple inventory puzzles.The Pros:-Unique  story, involving life beyond death, magic and the power of the mind. It starts a bit slow, but it quickly picks up the pace and becomes quite intriguing.-Interesting characters, with their own motivations and personalities.-Decent voice acting-Most of the puzzles are pretty straightforward, yet challenging enough that you'll feel accomplished if you figure them out yourself. The game also includes a screen that tells how far you are into each chapter, and even into each puzzle.-Although very simplistic, the magic tricks puzzles and fun to do.-Superb music by Robert Holmes, very reminiscent of Grabiel Knight. The Cons:-The graphics. The backgrounds are ok, but the characters are really ugly. Specially when you get a close-up of them whenever they talk, they look horrendous, like lifeless Second Life models. It's really jarring when you compare them with the beautiful traditional art that you get in the cutscenes.  -Some veterans might find the puzzles too easy.-Some times the game will require you to see a particular thing, talk to a particular person or visit a location before allowing you to continue. It results into having to sweep through the entire map, clicking in every hotspot when you're at the end of a chapter and you've completed 97% of it, not knowing what's left. -At the very end, the game falls into the Point & Click common mistake of throwing you into a series of puzzles that have nothing to do with the plot and only slow down the pace of the story in a moment of critical climax, just so it feels like a last challenge, a ""final boss"" before the end of the game.-There are a few obscure parts in the plot that are never explained, but it's not too frustrating. The game seems to be set for a sequel, but for now there's nothing about it.In conclusion, it's got its flaws, but the story and enjoyable gameplay makes up for them. Gray Matter might not live to Gabriel Knight standards, but to be fair, what does. It's still a very recommendable title for any seasoned fan of the genre, and even for newcomers.			"

												I normally don't play Point & Click adventures, and after reading the reviews, I thought I'd give it a whirl.My first impressions are that the game seems to have a lot of potential. The animation is ok. Robitic, but ok. The story line seems credible, and the voice acting is a little staid, but bearable.I almost, when completing the 1st task to put your rabbit back in it's home, swtiched the thing off and uninstalled. Just don't pick up bunnies by their ears, ok? This ONE thing, almost made me delete the game within minutes of starting.Graphically, it seems quite nice, but like almost any other P&C adventure, the settings are too quiet. Oxford just is NEVER that sedate. Samantha, in her own way, I find quite pleasing to the eye. (I wonder why? ;-) )The magic trick side of things is quite a nice touch, and it's a different thing to try out, certainly for me anyway.I suppose, despite the hour I've been playing, I need to give it more time. I'm hoping I come to like it more, but I'm holding my judgement.First impressions, Fair to middling, but I'm not going to slate it, but I'm not going to rave about it either.5 out of 10			"

												I love adventure point and click games. When I bought this game, I downloaded it and I crossed my fingers that I would be able to play it on my older computer with a GeForce 9500 GS 512 MB graphics card. After several attempts and adjustments in the games settings (I turned the resolution down a bit and a adjusted a few other settings so the character wouldn't move so dreadfully slow and  I double-clicked where I was going that helped speed up most of those walks) and tried over and over until I had the settings just right and I was able to start my adventure! Yay!This game is truly a gem. This mystery story is well written, the characters voice acting was spot on, the music is relaxing and games and puzzles were fun. I had to use walkthroughs to get through some of the trickier puzzles. You have to use and learn the magic book and go shopping at the magic shop for items to solve some puzzles, and yes, it required some reading and lots of talking with other characters, but that is half the fun in these types of adventure games.There is a map, diary, the magic book and lots of inventory to play with. I love this game and I totally recommend it! I hope you will like it too!			"

												Just completed gray matter and i really enjoyed this game. Puzzles i found quite confusing at first,  but be patient and keep pen and paper handy. The story line was good and puzzles where actually important to the game not just a way to another place or extra side games they kept the game flowing. Well worth the price give it a go.			"

												A Game, in of itself, has to serve several purposes, dpeending on it's design and intent.  Adventure games, for me, have to provide interesting characters and a good story, and in this they are like a book or movie.  Yet they also require not just interesting puzzles, but puzzles that are neither so easy as to be boring, or so hard or nonsensical as to be frustrating.  No, to borrow a phrase 'Put wax lips on moose'.Gray Matter's game play does have a few hitches.  My main criticsms would be that it was initially hard to get into the interface, and too often in the game, you have to sort of muddle about, clicking on stuff to figure out what you are suppose to do.  The progress meters are very helpful in this regard on occasion, as are the ways the different locations text gets different colours based on what can still be done there.  Still, the game could use some refining in this regard.However, the game gets my recommendation for the story-telling.  You don't come to a game by Jensen and expect to get bad storytelling, and true to form this game had amazingly evocative sets, characters and plot.  With a short cast of characters I was deeply involve in the story, and it's ending had parts that were genuinely emotional.  A game that can push buttons and evoke emotions like a good movie or piece of music is worth the price of admission in my book.			"

												It might be rough around the edges, but if you're in the mood for an old school point-and-click adventure game, Gray Matter fits the bill. It has a certain nostalgic charm to it and most of the puzzles are well designed. You play a wanderlust magician who has ended up in a small English village, and ends up working for a mysterious researcher.Being a magician, you have the ability to pull of sleight-of-hand tricks to overcome certain puzzles (like swapping an item with another without the other character realizing). At first, it's quite enjoyable - you get to plan out your moves in sequence and then play it out. Too bad it's introduced quite late in the game. Also, once the novelty wears off, it becomes tedious - you first need to find the correct trick to pull of from inside the magic book, then you simply follow the steps. There are no alternatives and you must do exactly what the book says, or you fail.Overall, the atmosphere, puzzles and story are enough to keep the player engadget and mystified (my attempt at a clever ending).

												This game was a lot of fun. The story was interesting and engaging throughout.  Also the puzzles were fairly obvious with only a few times that I forgot to backtrack to the correct spot to finish the chapter.  The music and sound quality of the game were very top-notch. At times the main character's voice actress was a little flat but the rest of the characters were engaging and all felt like real people that were involved in these situations.			"

												Good adventure with a few issues, the game is kinda short (around 9/10 hours) and the magic system is meh.On the other side I really liked the story, made by the same writer from Gabriel Knight and the soundtrack was amazing, I still listen to it from time to time. The static backgrounds are pretty good, the 3d animations (and the floaty faces) aren't. But in an adventure game I really don't care that much about that.The puzzles were all pretty easy, except for a particular one so it's pretty accessible to everyone.Get it on sale, you won't regret it.

												Liked:- Decent story which is quite compelling.- The puzzles are really good fun. Definitely not particularly hard but engaging nonetheless - you shouldn't need a walkthrough for this. Everything is pretty logical - there are no stereotypically bizarre point and click solutions here.- Graphics are OK for this sort of game.- Plenty of game for your money - should take more than a dozen hours to complete.- Interesting subject matter and decent writing- Definitely compelled me to keep playing to the end.Annoyances: (fairly minor!)- This is set in England but I don't think people working on the game seemed to know much about England. There were a few really odd things in it such as references to 'Western England' which isn't really a thing and even if it was, Oxford is not in the West. This game features steam vents, which I have never in my life seen anywhere in England. (I've seen them in New York...??)  Also the prices are a little weird (even taking into account that it's set in 2005)- Although the in-game graphics are OK (for a point and click) the cut scenes are pretty odd looking. They're a series of hand drawn slides, some of which work, others don't - the artists don't really seem to have nailed drawing people. Particularly one of the main, mask-wearing protaganists - some of the sketches make it look as if his eye is in a very weird place. Some of the pictures just looked plain odd.- A few minor bugs such as automatically playing cut scenes twice (second time with no voice over....?) - nothing game breaking.All in all it's a decent experience which is fun enough and worth a look.

The Good- Nice rendered graphics (and Samantha is hot :)- Nice artwork in the cut-scenes but I expected a lot more for a game from 2014- Nice Music- Decent Story, but felt like it ended abruptly.- I like the more realistic characters because there are too many ""Cartoony"" adventure games out there.- Doing magic tricks is kinda cool but superfluous. It doesn't really add much, except to take up more time going back and forth in the book to do the trick properly.The Bad- Ridiculously slow gameplay- Hotspot indicator system lags, and could have been done better (Memoria style)- No hint system (needed a walkthrough when I was stuck)- Sometimes you have to perform the smallest, stupidest action just to finish a chapter, and you have absolutely no idea or hint on what that is....Call Charle's Mum?! Ughhh...  - Performance issues on a decent CPU/Video Card  (seems shadow related)- The journal is completely useless, whoever let that out of testing should be fired.I expected A LOT more from the ""legendary"" Jane Jensen, but I can't blame her entirely. The team should have spent more time on mechanics and flow. It's just a slow crawl... and a savegame bug in Chapter 8 nearly cost me 14 hours, LUCKILY another steam user put the Start of Chapter 8 up so I could start from the begininng of it.I would still reccommend it because it was still pretty good, honestly though, Syberia 1+2 (although waaaay older) were better than this.

												The reason I have about 100 hours clocked is a bit silly. I just love the soundtrack so much, that I would leave the game on at night. So soothing LOL The story was very interesting, and the Magician storyline was just as fun as the main mystery. I do feel there were a few points that I wish had been resolved, I feel like I was left hanging on some of the juicier bits, but perhaps it was my overactive imagination thinking they would even be important enough to go into detail on. The voice-acting was very good, the cut-scenes were pretty neat (very artsy), the characters were fresh, and the locations were all gorgeously done. I can't say if this was an accurate depiction of Oxford, but it sure made me want to visit.			"

												I just finished the game and have very mixed feelings about this game. I used to play all the Gabriel Knight games and loved every one of them (although the one playing in Germany loses a lot of its flair if you are actually German and know how bad the German of the ""Germans"" in the game is... quite hilarious).So I was really looking forward to this and picked it up as soon as it got on sale (okay, I'm a bit cheap..). Anyways, I have 2 main problems with this title:1) the progress in the game. The game is an adventure that is separated in chapters and to finish one chapter means that you have to do certain tasks. The problem with that is that you often end up with not knowing what to do to progress. For example you can end up having done everything that seems reasonable, but the game waits for you to do a not really motivated phone call or talk to a certain character again. This is albeit the main tasks in your list are all finished. What it means is that more often than one would like, you find yourself walking around all locations and trying out all possible things to get that extra point that lets you progress in the story.Which takes me to my second point:2) The story is awful. It feels like a mix of a cheesy soap opera and teenage horror story. I never watched or read Twilight, but this is pretty much how I expect it to be.You have the young female outcast who accidentally comes to the house of the much older (yet not older looking) professor, who has a dark and sad secret.. blabla. The actions of the characters are really poorly motivated and downright don't make sense ( like the one girl you meet, steal her ID, break into her room, search her stuff. She barely knows you, but she still considers you as a true friend after finding out about it and even goes to quite a length to warn you. Which is also rather ridiculous, because finding and gaining entrance to the place where she actually warns you, is the main task of your character and takes her quite a length to achieve, but apparently every other person in the game can immediately accomplish that task without even breaking a sweat.) There are plenty of plot holes and when the whole story unravels and is revealed in the end it feels even more ridiculous. It also feels very rushed towards the end.That said, I like many of the riddles in the game. The difficulty is quite low, so you can play it and finish without much help (except for aforementioned minor and unmotivated tasks) and I liked the idea with the magic tricks you sometimes use to accomplish some things. So,  I feel quite mixed about this game and would have given it a mixed rating if it was possible. If you like point and click adventures and don't mind (or even like) cheesy highschool romance/fantasy stories, then I can recommend it. If plot holes and poor stories put you off, then don't get it. Although sometimes it is so ridiculous that it almost becomes a satire and is funny again. The reason that I opted for negative and not positive is mainly due to the lots of positive reviews that are also quite mixed, so I want to balance it out a bit.			"

												It looked like this game was taken out of a romance novel. On some occasions it didn't make sense to me at all. A lot of trial and error thing and lots of walking around trying to make sense of what I was supposed to do or find. Very few clues. The thing that made even more complex was that we had two things happening. The experiment and the invitation to the Daedalus Club. Sometimes those 2 things overlapped and I wasn't sure which one I was following. I thought Gabriel Night game was much better than this.I’m sure many female gamers will enjoy it, I didn’t and I’m glad it was over.			"

												I only played the first two chapters, and I can't stand the character's slow animation anymore.Walking is way too slow, double-click running is somewhat better but still suffers from the terrible turning speed.Maybe there's a good story in the end, but if I were to finish this I could actually finish two other good games within the same amount of time.

												OMGYawn.I like point and click adventure games, so I am the patient sort. But this was a game of ""hunt the pixel"" from the word go. Not fun, not in anyway. I remeber why I returned this back to the store when I purchased the hard copy. And It would not use Nvida video card and kept defaulting to my lesser intel onboard. Yuck just yuck.Avoid it unless you've never played a lame duck like this if only to find out how infuriating it can be.You have been warned			"

												I bought this game on an impuls, and I'm dissapointed. The characters move too slow, they move as if they're robots. The story is pretty boring, and it is not clear what the player must do. Sure, there are progression bars, but they only show the parts of the chapter that have to be completed, not what must be done to complete them. I needed a walkthrough to know how to finish a chapter and that's really dissapointing. I regret spending my money on this, and I wish I could get a refund (which is unfortunately impossible).			"

												Most adventure/puzzle games have a decent plot to frame the puzzles.  Some are better about integrating the puzzles into the story than others, but most strike a good balance.  This game gets it exactly right.The story and characters are very engaging.  The two characters you play as each have their own takes on events, and interpret things to match their worldview.  As the player, I still couldn't tell who was right, right up until the last few scenes.  Every time I was leaning one way or the other, someone would find a piece of evidence to throw it right back up in the air.The puzzles mostly flow naturally from the story.  Some are shoehorned in - but they're shoehorned in in the game world, as part of a deliberately set up series of puzzles.  Pretty much everything else is just a matural flow of combining what you have and doing magic tricks.I only have two complaints about this game.  The first is the character's movement speed - after the first hour or so, I was always doubleclicking to get them to run, and it still sometimes felt too slow (and occiasionally accidentally skipped a piece of dialog, but luckily everything is recorded in your character's journal to go back and review).  The second is more of a wish - like in many games which have special subsystems like this one's magic tricks, you only use each trick in your arsenel once.  It always makes perfect sense why you're using it (although there's a few that could be interchangeable), but you never have the opportunity to reuse them, and you can never pick the wrong one.All in all, I highly recommend this to any fans of the genre, and to anyone who finds this type of game hit-or-miss.  This one will be a hit.			"

												Good point & click adventure with some flaws but very atmospheric with a (very) slight horror element. First of all: if you don't care one bit for supernatural elements and alternative / noetic science then this is no game for you. Same goes if you hate stories that leave one with unanswered questions and plot holes. As I said it Gray Matter does have its flaws and not only story-wise but some of the cut-scene drawings don't quite fit with the character models (in some scenes I was confused for a sec because I couldn't recognize a character and thought that was someone new & previously unmentioned or even a mistake), as well as quite a few of the character animations (too fast, too much, too ""what the hell is s/he doing?!""). If the cut-scenes and animations were better it would be by far a much better game, too. It really is a shame.But none of these flaws make the game unplayable or not entertaining. I played it twice (only once on Steam) and always enjoyed it. I rather liked the main character - Sam - and her character design. Those magic tricks were a nice game play gimmick, I only wished we'd have seen more of it (thanks to the shoddy character animations we can't really see the tricks being done). But they give a nice explanation how we (as the PC) get away with ""borrowing"" so many items, something more point & click adventures could use. ;)Gray Matter begs for a sequel and I hope it gets it! (I have no clue how likely or unlike this is but I keep my fingers crossed.)			"

												I enjoyed this pretty thoroughly. Interesting story, good music, and above-average voice acting. It's a standard point and click adventure game, with a fun supernatural/scientific theme. The characters were not inventive, but they were solid enough. I got stuck a few times, and ended up having to go back for silly little details, like adding someone's phone number to the cell phone. But other than that, I really enjoyed it. Played it through to conclusion in two days. I recommend it, but only if you can handle graphics from 2008.			"

												A very good adventure, definitely worth the time. It may not be the new Gabriel Knight but it has its own merits.Pros:+ Interesting plot on modern, low-fantasy setting+ logical puzzles + nice music+ successful combination: magic mixed with supernatural mixed with science+ helpful system when you get stuck (identification of items and places)+ correct game length and adequate contentCons:- sometimes the interface does not work with environment and objects- behavior of characters is rather unrealistic (way too kind and too forgiving)- once you find how to execute them, some magic tricks are very trivial			"

												i would just like to say that Gray matter was a pretty good point and click game as a whole. i wish the magic tricks had a little more instructions too it. it took me a bit to figure it out. the graphics could have been better, some scenes were a little blurred for my taste, like at the end when you finally see davids face, that scene should have been sharper since it was such an important part of the story. most of your time is spent walking. double clicking is intended to make the characters run. but i couldnt seem to get sam to do this much. even when i /could/ she would get stuck in corners which was really annoying. david seemed to have an easier time of it but still moved to slow for my taste. there was also some text between screens that gave a little info, but most of it moved by too fast for me to read. i remember one was about icarus and daedalus and another was about homer but thats pretty much it. also when playing david you couldnt read it at all because of the black background. but overall i rate this game 8/10 and would definately buy it again. cant wait to see a sequel. my note for a second game would be work on the notebook a little. maybe add little hints or clues. or make it a sidebar or something.

												One of the best point and clicks i've played in a very long time. And i've been playing them since the goold old MS-DOS days. Great story, music, gameplay, and very likeable main character. Some voiceacting could have been better but it still was far better than many of the games I've played. Also, the game isn't slow as one person reviewed. If you've played enough of these games, you'll realize you can double click to either run or immediately go to the next room. Pretty simple really. Another issue I saw people had with this game was its lack of direction and ""difficulty"". I can understand that argument. Though I actually enjoyed that portion of the game because it was much more realistic in that sense. Too many point and clicks make you do absurb combinations of items and interactions with the environment and I find myself using a walkthrough to figure some of them out. This game didn't have any of those crazy things and I didn't find myself using a walkthrough once. It simply felt as if I were in the mc's shoes and what would be my next step? Anyways, if your a fan of point & click adventures, this game is a definite must play.			"

												Overall, I'd give this an 8/10. Grey Matter has a strong, darker, almost gothic visual style. All the scenes are remarkably well thought out and portrayed. The obtuse camera angles and foreground props really immerse you in the locations. The characters are decently developed. The only real weak point in my opinion was the voice acting of the minor characters, Helena and Angela especially. The main cast was solid. The cutscenes were kinda weakly done and some of the character animations were lacking in quantity and alignment. The soundtrack is very good, compelling, and even catchy. It fits the atmosphere of the game well. The story was great and really had me guessing until the end even tho everything did ""wrap-up"" a little too quickly and conveniently. This game is very worth the $10 and will keep you entertained for a week at least. Jane Jensen proves she's still got it! I'm glad this game came to Steam, otherwise I'd have never played it and I'm looking forward to her next one.If you like adventure games, this is highly recommended. It has a more serious tone than say, Golden Age, but still has it's light humorous moments. The style is reminiscent of the original Gabriel Knight- one of the first games that I purchased on CD-ROM back in 9th grade, 1994. There is a cool magic angle for alot of the puzzles and some riddle type stuff. Don't cheat! If you're stuck, just go back to look and interact with EVERYTHING again. Use all your inventory items on everything and everybody. I think we are witnessing the return of the Adventure Game!Source: I've played almost every adventure game from Sierra, Lucasarts, Westwood, ect. Loom, Monkey Island, anything with ""Quest"" in the title which, btw, I believe Quest for Glory was the framework for Elder Scrolls. Thanks for reading; Game On :)			"

I wouldn't say it's really outstanding in any of these areas, but there haven't been many recently released games in this genre that don't try to get by on being funny or silly, so it's really nice to play a quality game with a more serious mystery story.There are some nice features to help you focus in the right areas too: locations on the map where you can make progress are coloured differently, and you can highlight the clickable objects around you so you don't need to wave your mouse around.

												Gray Matter is a beautiful game with an intriguing story. I was hooked on playing this game to completion especially after Chapter 4. I love the way this game incorporated neuroscience theories and the magic tricks into its sci-fi/paranormal storyline. Although maybe the 5 senses portion is a bit of an overkill (but it does make sense in the story context)--you do get more backstory that way.I also had the slow performance issue (character moved super slowly, choppy first cutscene) when I first played the game, but that problem went away and never came back after I restarted my machine once. It's not so obvious what the Chapter bonus tasks are, but hey, that's the reward for exploring the game environment.			"

												I don't know how I missed this adventure game when it came out in 2010, but boy am I glad it was mixed in with a bundle of ultimately lesser games. Look, this is a Jane Jensen adventure game (she of Gabriel Knight) and if that name means anything to you then you know what you are getting into with this title. If not, well, prepare yourself for some great adventure game writing and (mostly) fair and interesting puzzles. I don't recall any puzzles that commited that required the dreaded ""adventure game logic"" and, honestly, I think the puzzles in Gray Matter are some of the best I have seen in regards to being tied to the game's setting and writing, albeit a little too easy for hardened adventure gamers.Speaking of Gray Matter's setting, is it ever dripping in it. Yes, the Britishisms are a touch to kitschy, but a secret society of magicians that have left esoteric clues throughout the university and town is great. You solve some puzzles by repurposing magic tricks that the main character knows (she's a magician) and then there is the mysterious mansion with the possibly mad, certainly bereaved, scientist experimenting with dreams.Right then, enough gushing. Let's get into the faults.1. There's a weird framerate problem that I encountered on startup. It seems to (somehow) be tied to the uptime on my Windows 8 machine and rebooting fixed it every time. Watch out for that.2. Occassionally the game wants you to trigger a specific cut scene or conversation before it will let you solve a puzzle/proceed. This isn't usually a problem, but if you make a logical leap here or there you might hit it. I certainly did. The frustrating thing with this is that there are two main hubs in the game: the mansion and the town/university and sometime the trigger you need to hit is not where the puzzle you are working on is. If you get stuck try going back to the mansion and wandering around.3. As I mentioned earlier, the puzzles are (for the most part) easy to solve. I'd have liked a few proper head-scratchers in the mix, but it's hard to complain when they fit the story and characters so well.All said, I loved Gray Matter. I can't remember the last time an adventure game enthralled me like this one did. Play this game.			"

												I would definately recommend this game. The music is excellent. Good enough that I'm concidering buying the soundtrack. I personally love the art. The characters are great. Very enchanting. It pulled me in and touched me in a way that very few games ever do. Only real down side was that at a few points it was hard to figure out what I needed to do next. But that is normal in these puzzle/adventure games, and this one had WAY less of that then normal for the genre. This is how this kind of game was meant to be. It went above and beyond in most areas.I would love to see a second installment.			"

												For a game released in 2010, Gray Matter is a strange experience: it feels remarkably like 1999. Backgrounds are beautiful, but pre-rendered; characters are modeled in 3d, but strangely robotic. Inventory is another callback to the grave: a top-down interface that just feels old and is tiresome to use.Despite not shining in the technical front, the slow-burning story does make up for it. While containing a dangerous lot of pseudoscience about neuroscience and quantum mechanics being passed for actual scientific consensus, it's very interesting to see how both fronts (rational and mystic) are tackled by the game, and become, effectively, the driving force behind the mystery.As a final note, I'd recommend a walkthrough, since like pretty much every point and click in existence, the game does feature things you need to do for progress that are just beyond reasonable logic.

												I bought this game because it says ""by Jane Jensen"" right on the can. I really enjoyed Gabriel Knight and thought I'd give this one a try.In some respects it is BETTER than Gabriel Knight. For one, I like the main character better. Sam is adventerous, loyal and steered ba a somewhat idiosyncratic yet strong set of morals. The graphics are really nice and the incorporation of magic into the problem solving ist surprising, rewarding and integrates really well with the feeling of the game. The atmosphere is as good as GK (I don't think you can beat that...): It is dark and mysterious, the music is great and the cut-scenes with their hand-painted style work beautifully. The story is riveting and the twists are nicely done. With the exception of some MINOR bugs (and I mean minor!), this game left me without a single complaint.12 hours is a good time for an adventure to take (without a walkthrough, I found the puzzles neither too hard nor too frustrating to solve on my own - with the possible exception of the bonus points, which are, as the name suggests, just a bonus), and I enjoyed every minute of it. Thoroughly.			"

												I just finished playing it and I like it. I like the storyline, how the game played from two different point of view. We are made to guess all along what direction the story will goes.It's one of Jane Jensen's game, for those who like classic point-and-click adventure game must know that name. So, no wonder the game's storyline is good.There is a bit of a glitch on the characters walking where sometimes they can turn back and turn around before walking in the pointed direction, but it's minor and, for me, didn't take away the enjoy of playing the game.The soundtrack is good, the voice acting is perfect, not to mention none of the characters is annoying I-want-to-strangle-them type.All in all a good game. I wish it could be longer so just I can explore more around oxford pulling magic trick in every corner.One thing I just remember, there is one thing that made me cringe. Please, please do not teach people to hold rabbits by their ears. It's animal cruelty >.<			"

												This is a wonderful game. A point and click that feels old school. The story is captivating and I did care a lot about the characters. Interesting and solvable tasks, a bit of magic and a bit of suspense. I will certainly play it again. And I fear whatever game I choose next, it won't be able to keep up with this one.			"

												I'd have to say this is one of the best modern point and click adventure games. The story, characters, writing, music and puzzles are all good. I wouldn't say it's really outstanding in any of these areas, but there haven't been many recently released games in this genre that don't try to get by on being funny or silly, so it's really nice to play a quality game with a more serious mystery story.There are some nice features to help you focus in the right areas too: locations on the map where you can make progress are coloured differently, and you can highlight the clickable objects around you so you don't need to wave your mouse around.

												Grey Matter was an excellent point and click game. The story was refreshing and enjoyable. The use of magic tricks to solve tasks was interesting and new to me. Some of the Daedalus Magic Club puzzles were tough but do-able. The only complaint I had whilst playing is the fact that the character(s) walk slowly through huge areas. The game is based on the fast travel method, but if I left a building it was annoying to walk across a lawn or two to access the fast travel map. Especially if I had done the same part several times. Other than my mild annoyance, Grey Matter is very enjoyable.			"

												You play as a street magician stumbling upon oxford due to a broken sign and told a simple lie to get a place to stay overnight. You end up working as an assistant to a professor because you motorcycle breaks down and you need a place to stay and cash and food.  While you work as an assistant, weird events take place and you try to figure them out.  During the process, you rely on your magic tricks to manipulate people and events to your advantage. This game is literally 10/10 on story. It is very story rich like a visual novel with a lot of suspense because you play as the magician and the professor to gain different sides of the story.The music and the background are great also. Beautiful scenary.Game play isn't too solid, this is simply point and click but you often need to complete one event completely before you are allowed to advance.  The riddles are simple up until the end... which becomes extremely difficult.  The magic tricks that you pick don't always make sense and for a magician, you don't use tricks enough.  This is the only major flaw in the game but if you prefer plot, then this is perfect game for you.This is by far one of the best point and click I've played. This isn't a hidden object game though.

												i would just like to say that Gray matter was a pretty good point and click game as a whole. i wish the magic tricks had a little more instructions too it. it took me a bit to figure it out. the graphics could have been better, some scenes were a little blurred for my taste, like at the end when you finally see davids face, that scene should have been sharper since it was such an important part of the story. most of your time is spent walking. double clicking is intended to make the characters run. but i couldnt seem to get sam to do this much. even when i /could/ she would get stuck in corners which was really annoying. david seemed to have an easier time of it but still moved to slow for my taste. there was also some text between screens that gave a little info, but most of it moved by too fast for me to read. i remember one was about icarus and daedalus and another was about homer but thats pretty much it. also when playing david you couldnt read it at all because of the black background. but overall i rate this game 8/10 and would definately buy it again. cant wait to see a sequel. my note for a second game would be work on the notebook a little. maybe add little hints or clues. or make it a sidebar or something.

												Gray Matter is an adventure game made by Jane Jensen, the creator of the Gabriel Knight games, and both it and Gray Matter are some of the best adventure games around.Gray Matter takes place in Oxford, England where an aspiring magician from America, Samantha Everett, ends up stranded out in the countryside flat broke. With some trickery she becomes the new assistant for a reclusive professor of neurology, Dr. Styles. Styles sends out her out to gather some Oxford students for some research but when strange events start going down Sam and Doc Styles have to work together find out what's going on.Gray Matter is a beautiful game with a great soundtrack and environments. The character portraits look rather janky though but they don't drag down the great atmosphere. The writing is some really good stuff.  Sam and Doc Styles are likable and interesting protagonists and the plot is interesting throughout. Jensen’s passion for researching history and real places like she did in Gabriel Knight is still prominent here and learning about Oxford really helps to immerse you in the game's events more.The puzzles for the most part are good though Sam’s magic tricks tend to end up being busy work. The game also kind of trips over itself at the end with a weird heavily puzzle-laden final area that really doesn't gel at all with the rest of the game and has nothing to do with the story at all either so because of that the ending comes off as pretty rushed. Overall though Gray Matter is a well-written game with fantastic atmosphere and a likable cast that is well worth your time			"

												This game is a bit of a mixed bag for me. The story is good and the graphics are great so it should make for a great adventure game, shouldn't it? Well ... the game has quite a lot of small annoyances. For a start, the game feels very static - as beautiful as the backdrops are, it all feels rather disconnected as if you're walking through a painting. The music is great and in the same style of that of previous Jane Jensen games (Gabriel Knight anyone?) but despite this, this is the first Jensen adventure game where I didn't really feel part of the world. Perhaps the mix of 3D and drawn backdrops is the reason.But, the biggest problem this game has, are the controls. I wondered why they're so clunky compared to the MUCH better controls used in the Gabriel Knight games so I checked to see if it had gotten a console release and guess what? It did. Once again the console version caused the controls of a PC version to go down the drain ... . The inventory is a fiddly mess - move a little bit too much downwards and it will close and clicking & dragging doesn't exist anymore.On the plus side, the magic tricks do add a unique layer to the game. On the negative side ... they're needlessly fiddly as well. Most of the times you know exactly what needs to be the done but the game makes you go through all the little steps anyway.All in all, this is a solid adventure game with a poor UI and some other smaller flaws. Recommended but with reservations.			"

												Gray Matter is a French/German production game about an independent female magician named Samantha Everett who is traveling abroad in Europe. During a dark stormy night she got lost upon traveling on her motorcycle and got redirected to Oxford due to a broken road sign. Her cycle gave out, and Sam finds herself near a reclusive manor where she seeked shelter at. She was mistaken by the maid for the grad student from Oxford seeking for a job offer for the head of the manor. As the actual grad student never did showed up, Sam decided to pretend to be the grad student sent from Oxford. Before Sam knows it, she is currently taking residence at the manor and the owner of the manor is a neurobiologist named Dr. David Styles. Due to a freak accident, Styles has become reclusive to his manor and rarely leaves it. The job offer as instructed by notes left by Styles and the maid, Sam must recruit six students from Oxford to under go a session that involves brain pattern, memory, and dream patterns. As Sam goes out to fulfill her task, she also seeks to par take in a game that will allow her to be part of the Daedalus Club, a private club where only the best magicians are permitted to join. With her keen sense of intelligence and magic skills she will succeed in gaining her goal as well as helping Dr. Styles find peace with himself. This game has beautifully designed backgrounds that are equivellent to a painting as well as well researched info on Oxford and London in general. Gray Matter is a great addition to any well received point and click game made from Europe as the story and mystery makes you want to keep playing it all the way through. The characters and the plot also have given a lasting impression on me as it's a game I can revisit time and time again. If you love games with strong women protagnogists then I highly recommend this game.			"

												Very good game for anyone who likes point and click mysteries. Great Characters, Story, and Voice Acting.  Several different types of puzzles to solve, though the puzzles themselves could have been a little harder with the exception of the finale which was a bit over the top to say the least. It's not perfect, and one of the game mechanics nearly broke the game.  You have to click on all clickable hot spots in order to advance the story, even if the hot spot isn't really relavent or related to the story.  This means if you miss one chair or vase or anything as you're going through a chapter and get to the point where the chapter should end you get stuck, you'll find yourself running around the entire game world looking for that 1 stupid thing you didn't click on.  Bit annoying. I also have a complaint about the ending, but i'll try not to give too much away.  Basically there's so many subplots going on in the game and most of them are not wrapped up by the end.  It feels kind of cut off.  Could have added another few hours of story to explain why this happened, what happened with that, and what happened with so and so after the thing. Overall a neeat little adventure style game with a main character a little more interesting than average and a scooby-doo type story with a little more originality. Also there's  a rabbit.			"

												If you're looking for a classic point and click adventure game and haven't played Gray Matter yet, this is one of the games you likely don't want to miss. The gorgeous graphics, interesting story, intelligently designed riddles and a lot of suspense, combined with a masterpiece of a twist at the game's ending, make this game a piece of art.The main heroine is a introvert goth girl that ends up in a rich doctor's manor during her trip around England. Being the manipulative sociopath we soon get to experience fully throughout the game, she lies her way into becoming his assistant. Most of the gameplay comprises of Samantha forging IDs, putting a plug in someone's phone, manipulating people into helping her and breaking in. The other part of the game is collecting memories and doing menial tasks as doctor David Styles, who lost his wife in a car accident that also left him terribly scarred.The amount of riddles is amazing and they are neither too easy nor too difficult. I didn't have to find a walkthrough for any of the riddles, which made me like this game even more, but dispite that, I got stuck TWICE. That was because playing as David you can get very frustrated as what to do next. At some point I clicked through almost every available location to make the story progress. I consulted a walkthrough to find out that there is an MRI room in the basement's main room that  has a computer David can operate. Okay, my mistake. I missed the location that was previously inoperable when Sam loitered around it. But then I got stuck again and couldn't get the story to progress, as I've learned where the Deadalus Club was located, yet it didn't show up on the map. I thought that it was a glitch. After I've checked the chapter's walkthrough step by step, it turned out that I didn't print out a file that was among the files in the folder on David's computer, that suddenly became printable in one of the chapters, so I could use it in... the same place I got stuck before. That made the chapter go to 100% and the Deadalus Club location suddenly was showing up on the map after David left the manor. That was actually rather awkward considering that for Sam the Deadalus Club was on the map and she would refuse to go there saying that she has something to do before. The fact that an errand to-do-list kind of parts of the game require you to click through locations semi-randomly searching for the thing that makes you progress to the next part ruined the game's continuity for me and I was disappointed that I had to look up a solution, because I wanted to figure out the game without help yet I was stuck at trying to figure out what the thing that you're supposed to find at the moment was. It turned out that I could solve every riddle, but I got stuck because there are moments that make you confused as to what you should do - and some parts of thegames were made in a way that there were blatant clues added as what should be done next. The locations re marked with colors ranging from gold through silver to greyed out, showing whether you've done everything in there required for finishing that chapter. This makes me wonder if the people testing Grey Matter requested that to be done, because of the amount of confusion coming from certain actions opening up others in places you've already clicked through a few moments ago and now they suddenly have an NPC that wasn't there before.This goes only for the short chapters where you get to play as David, and Sam's part is pretty much flawless. This is a 9.5/10 game for classic point and click adventure game fans.			"

												A very compelling and intriguing premise combined with interesting gameplay and characters, I was hooked throughout. Highlights are the strong story and the urgency for me to find out what happened next! The visual style adopted in the cutscenes really add to the sense of mystery and drama that unfolds, as well as the unnerving events and atmosphere created. The soundtrack is beautiful, never overwhelming but always fitting the moods as you go exploring deeper into the plot. Robert Holmes did an amazing job.My only gripe is the final parts, it felt a bit rushed and inconclusive. But I've heard rumors of a sequel so maybe it will be resolved then. Nevertheless, it's a solid title that I absolutely adored.			"

												I picked up this game both because I like paranormal stories, and because the game author came highly recommended.  I was expecting to be blown away, but although the game was good, I don't think it entirely lives up to the hype.The thing that bugged me most of all was actually the writing.  Much of the dialogue, especially Samantha's, felt choppy and flippant.  I didn't really get a sense of personality from her other than ""generic upstart teenager with delusions of grandeur.""  I also didn't like that her character talked big about her ""magician's code,"" and then wantonly broke it at every opportunity for her own personal gain (although maybe that was intentional to show her immaturity).Beyond her character, I was let down by the overly predictable plot.  The premise of the story is solid, and blends together a number of canon paranormal and horror themes, but the way it unfolded left me disappointed.  It is frustrating as a player to so easily figure out what the ending is going to be, but then have to watch your character blindly ignore the clues and run around circles for hours.  I also felt that the ending was entirely avoidable, and the tragedy was shoe-horned in for emotional effect.Despite these issues, the other aspects of the game are top notch:- There is a unique cast of well-developed side characters that have interesting backgrounds and talented voice actors.- The puzzles are creative and varied, with the magic tricks bringing an innovative and novel twist to the genre.  Even veteran adventure gamers will find it both challenging and refreshing.- The art and cutscenes are beautifully rendered, with a blend of hand-painted flashbacks and 3D CGI.  I also appreciated the thematic touches of magic and fantasy that were woven throughout.- There is a good mixture of seriousness and humor within the overall suspenseful atmosphere.- The colour-coded map system is a nice gameplay feature, allowing you to instantly teleport to various location hubs, and informing you of where you still have available actions.- There are several hidden bonus quests and actions which add flavour and depth to the story.  (Although I was sad that there is no in-game reward for 100% completion, nor are there any Steam achievements.  An alternate ending might have been nice.)Overall, I would give this game an 8.5/10			"

												I found this game by chance, and decided to play through. I have to say this: This game is FANTASTIC!Amazing story telling, nice style of cut scenes, high quality music, and brilliant puzzles. What more, I get to know some of the magic trick in this game. I even tried some of this game trick with my friends. How cool is that?To say the least, if you are a fan of adventure games, you must try this game. What depressed me is I can't find the soundtrack of the game.I even feel bad finishing the game, but hey, good ending.			"

												Beautiful design, great characters, an interesting story and interface that will help you find your way to the next objective without spoiling anything or forcing you to hunt pixels? Yes, please! Gray Matter is a magical game - and not only because the main character is a magician.			"

												It's refreshing having a strong, independent, intelligent female main character for once. the voice acting is well done.The puzzles and riddles often require some thought and aren't laid out for you most of the time. One early riddle even requires you to have knowledge of something that isn't even discussed in the game.the amateur magician angle is quite unique and provides an interesting dynamic to the game for manipulating objects and people.I haven't finished the game yet, but I've put in over 10 hours and still enjoying the game quite a bit, I really hope they consider a sequel.

												Gray Matter does enough to keep the players going to uncover the mysteries behind its stories. It may not be greatly appealing to the eyes, but the story is captivating enough to entertain the players. With a small price to pay for such dark mystifying adventure, fans of this genre shouldn’t hesitate to go for it.  Full Review[www.noobfeed.com].			"

												Recommendation qualified noting bugs (well documented and easy to circumvene) and by unnecessarily tedious last 10% of the game with non-sensical puzzles in the labyrinth. Otherwise a delightful, refreshing story in an often repetitious game genre (adventures), with convincing character development. Here is to hoping Jane has one more title up her sleeve.			"

												This game is a bit of a mixed bag for me. The story is good and the graphics are great so it should make for a great adventure game, shouldn't it? Well ... the game has quite a lot of small annoyances. For a start, the game feels very static - as beautiful as the backdrops are, it all feels rather disconnected as if you're walking through a painting. The music is great and in the same style of that of previous Jane Jensen games (Gabriel Knight anyone?) but despite this, this is the first Jensen adventure game where I didn't really feel part of the world. Perhaps the mix of 3D and drawn backdrops is the reason.But, the biggest problem this game has, are the controls. I wondered why they're so clunky compared to the MUCH better controls used in the Gabriel Knight games so I checked to see if it had gotten a console release and guess what? It did. Once again the console version caused the controls of a PC version to go down the drain ... . The inventory is a fiddly mess - move a little bit too much downwards and it will close and clicking & dragging doesn't exist anymore.On the plus side, the magic tricks do add a unique layer to the game. On the negative side ... they're needlessly fiddly as well. Most of the times you know exactly what needs to be the done but the game makes you go through all the little steps anyway.All in all, this is a solid adventure game with a poor UI and some other smaller flaws. Recommended but with reservations.			"

												I just finished playing it and I like it. I like the storyline, how the game played from two different point of view. We are made to guess all along what direction the story will goes.It's one of Jane Jensen's game, for those who like classic point-and-click adventure game must know that name. So, no wonder the game's storyline is good.There is a bit of a glitch on the characters walking where sometimes they can turn back and turn around before walking in the pointed direction, but it's minor and, for me, didn't take away the enjoy of playing the game.The soundtrack is good, the voice acting is perfect, not to mention none of the characters is annoying I-want-to-strangle-them type.All in all a good game. I wish it could be longer so just I can explore more around oxford pulling magic trick in every corner.One thing I just remember, there is one thing that made me cringe. Please, please do not teach people to hold rabbits by their ears. It's animal cruelty >.<			"

												I Love the Puzzles and the riddles in this game, they are very carefully designed to make you immersed into the game, the story kept me on the edge of my seat because you kinda feel you are the main character, i would love to see a second version of this game and more people buying it.

												I love the story and the characters - they are very well structured and voiced. The use of magic tricks as a method of problem solving is very neat.The most magical part of the game though is its soundtrack which sets you in just the right mood for the upcoming adventure.  "

												This game was awesome from start to finish.  It's a very long game with 8 chapters.  Graphics were great, sound everything.  There aren't too many point and click games that are this in depth.. SUPER GAME!  I'd pay $29.99 for this one.			"

												I was hesitant to try a game like this, but felt the low price would make it worth the effort.  Some reviews were very positive, so I felt I would give it a fair try.  I usually prefer Myst-type games, so exploring around until I figure out the next step is what keeps things interesting for me.  I have to say, I am glad this game was so cheap.  I lost interest within the first 30 minutes.  The magic trick sequence -because you can't really call it a puzzle, is where I gave up. IThe thought of having to complete more sequences like that was just too much.  Also the incessant clicking on objects for the character to speak some dialogue is monotonous and a detraction.  Maybe I am spoiled after Obduction, Quern, and Infra.  With any luck, I will find more great games like them.			"
