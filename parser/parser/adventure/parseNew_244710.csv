												Rating 7.5/10Overview:  Adventure + The gameplay has you controlling a mother badger with her 5 babies following. You have to find/hunt for food to feed your babies as well as traverse the dangerous environments as you avoid harm. + Really loved the art style, it has a minimalistic quality to it yet feels very unique it its own way + The game takes place over a series of different environments each area getting progressively more dangerous and more unique. It is always an interesting experience when you reach a new area. +Losing a baby feels sad and yet you have no choice to move along reminding you the harsh realities of nature. Very few games invoke that sense of feeling yet this game does it in such an easy way. + Good sense of pacing, +No HUD, allowing for a more immersive experience + Free DLC to extend the games very short length The Bad-game doesn't  do the best of jobs explaining certain gameplay elements often leaving you confused in certain areas. -The game is very short. It will take roughly 1 hour to beat, there is however a dlc that changes up the gameplay a bit to keep you interested in a few more hours if you like. ConclusionThis game is a perfect example of an indie game done right. You don't need super realistic graphics to make the game standout. The developers combined an interesting concept with a unique art style and made a game that I was engaged with throughout the end. Losing a baby is sad because you legitimately feel like you failed as your duty as a parent. This game pleasantly surprised me.  "

												Shelter is a lovely survival game which has you playing as an intrepid babdgermum or badgerdad whose job it is to save your kit.The game plays very well and looks fantastic. The soundtrack is joyous to listen to and the threats ingame tangible. Over a very short time you feel a real connection with your baby badgers and will do anything to save them.Sadly, the game falls down on it's length, which is my only criticism. A lovely little game, but little it is, with around 1 hour for a full playthrough.Still a fun experience!Nilesy			"

												This game is amazing. Yes, it's short. Yes, it's basic. Yes, it's far from being graphically groundbreaking. But guess what? it works!... It speaks to your guts without a single word.  It's an experience with a lot of soul. No HUD needed, no briefing nor story. In the wild life, it's the instinct that tells you what to do. Although the game being very short, it's a little piece of art that you should play to the end the best way you can. It's self-rewarding.			"

												This game is almost too emotionally engaging. I often found myself seriously distressed at the thought of losing one of my beloved badger babies or being unable to feed them. I can't handle this game.Pros:+ Emotionally jarring as you experience life through the eyes of a mother badger.+ Unique atmosphere. The graphics and soundtrack added to the experience.+ Gameplay is smooth, although some things I found very difficult (like sneaking up on a fox).Cons:- Crying, lots of crying			"

												There are few games that are unique and fun to play.  Shelter is both...trying to keep your babies alive is not something that is easy.   There are times when this game is frustrating...but it has enough rewards that it will keep you going...because if you give up your babies will die ;).   This is becoming a favorite with my girls and their friends...It will bring a smile to your face when you hear them scream...because some wild animal got one of the babies...Not because your sadistic...but because you know they are really getting into the game and enjoying it.  My girls after playing have to tell me how they lost a cub...or how they got by so and so...You and your family will enjoy this game...It truly is a family game...all ages can enjoy this game...			"

												What started as something I thought of as a relaxing, light-hearted adventure ended up becoming a very emotionally engaging assault on the senses. Every new level/setting I entered I would think to myself, ""there's no way they can top this"", but lo and behold, I was even more impressed with each new area I entered. The music is incredibly well done and obviously hand crafted personally with much thought put into it, as every piece fits it's respective area very, very well.As fine as I think the game is in it's current state, I don't think anyone would deny that more areas would be a very welcome addition. The game is quite short but doesn't overstay it's welcome, in my opinion it's just right for the concept and the message it's trying to convey.This is a game you'll want to show your friends and family.

												Shelter is a game were you are a mother badger who is trying to take care of 5 baby badgers and get them to a different section of the forest. You need to feed them on your travels with apples, radishes, carrots, catching frogs, and mice. There are also some other challenges you come across like birds trying to swoop down and nab your babies, fire, and floods from the rain. It's a cool game and fun trying to see how many you can keep alive to the end.There's also a nurture mode where you need to feed them each day so they get big enough to travel. Not sure if this goes by real days or just time spent in game. I found two food items in the small area you can forage but that was it. I would need to log back in another day to try and find more. Gives some replay value to the game but not much.It won't take long to do one playthrough but you can always replay to see if you can improve or decrease your survival skills. It's worth checking Shelter out if you can get it cheap.			"

												Shelter is a unique experience that will make you care for the little bundles of love that are your squeaking kin.In Shelter there are no score tickers, timers, kill counts, or lives. You play as the mother of five young badgers and your job is to escort them from point A to point B without any of them going hungry or starving. Shelter accomplishes the goal of informing you of duties without the use of clumsy tutorials or a narrator describing you each task. Instead, the game lets you walk around and figure it all out in an organic process that leads to understanding the world quite quickly. Shelter doesn’t tell you to grab the food and bring it to your baby but you understand that it needs to be done before moving on. This lesson naturally teaches you the importance of food to your young’s survival.Controls are simple; you walk around with W, A, S, D keys and gather/attack with the left mouse button. You can also call for your young with the right mouse button and sprint/crawl with the usual Shift/CTRL scheme.Before going on any further about the game I need to pay praise to the wonderful world that Might and Delight has crafted. The entirety of the game, be it in an open field or a damp cave, feels like it’s been hand stitched into a quilt that wraps the player in a warm and sometimes dangerous embrace. The landscapes are bright and colorful, with textures that can only be likened to Wind Waker and even then only slightly so. The art style of Shelter, much like that of the developer’s previous title, Pid, is one entirely unique to the game. Food is important, it’s your children’s lifeblood and it stands out in the world to make finding it fairly easy. This simple way of making the food standout from the world allows it all to feel, at the risk of sounding redundant, natural.The standout graphical effect isn’t the only way to know food is around; it turns out your children are quite capable of helping you on that front. Your young’s squeals and squeaks of delight when near a food source notifies you to ram into a tree or pull an onion from the ground. The threat of starvation is but one of many dangers that loom over your young. Birds of prey soar above, waiting to snatch small badgers for their own, the darkness of a cave calls to them, and forest fires aim to burn all in their path. Every level of Shelter starts off with a simple enough problem, your young need food. Their squeals and squeaks cry out to help and off you go, looking for sustenance. But then it all changes, something happens and soon food is an afterthought and the threat of death is one that becomes far more immediate.Your young move slowly so you must wait for them to be close before pushing forward, for fear that they may straggle behind and be snatched by the bird. This sense of immediate danger happens often in Shelter and to the game’s advantage. It’s not often that you care for a non-player character but in this case you care for five, and deeply so. This sense of life and death goes both ways in Shelter as it’s not always your young that are the prey of a hunt. Badgers are omnivorous creatures so animals are fair game as are fruits and vegetables. Stalking a fox in Shelter and landing the killing blow, knowing it will feed all of your young at once, is an incredibly satisfying moment. From high grass to high grass you crawl, hoping the fox hears nothing, and then, when close enough, you pounce on the fox and land the killing blow.I must give credit to the phenomenal soundtrack created by Retro Family. They’ve proven their worth by composing a soundtrack that pushes you forward when you know you need to stop and care for your young. Each moment of danger is amplified by the music and when my group was in danger I felt as though I had a responsibility to protect them all. Forest fires wouldn’t stop me from protecting my children and no rapid river would take my baby from me. The music elevates when necessary and amplifies the motherly feeling of each moment.Shelter is a survival game in the basic sense but it’s also about exploration; that being the exploration of yourself as well as the beautiful world around you. Are you the type of person who will try to run from danger or will you stop and brave any harm to protect those you love, Shelter will tell you. The world is crafted in a beautiful manor, the soundtrack amplifies each emotion, and the gameplay, while simple, makes for a deep and moving experience.			"

												Nature, and by extension life, is harsh. Very harsh. This is what this game is about. The controls are simple and the world is  quite small and linear. You're a mother badger who has to look after her cubs. The mechanics are built around that, so if you really try to keep them all alive and well fed the game can be very tense and dramatic. It's short, but I think it accoplishes what it is set out to do quite well; it explores an idea through envoirmental storytelling and solid, coherent mechanics. If you know what you're getting into you won't be dissappointed.			"

												This is one of my favorite games in my library. Now, I know, people, including me, tend to say that ""this is one of my favorite games I have"" for everygame, but when I say that about this game, I mean it.It has a very touching story. To put it simply, you are a mother badger and must survive with your five cubs. When playing it, it wasn't hard at all to emotionally attach myself to the cubs [which may or may not boad well for you], as they are so cute and you are their mother, their protector and provider. I only lost two cubs out of the five, but it still brought me to tears. It does a very good job as making you feel like the mother badger. Simply, it is a must play for animal lovers alike and a well-made game that is enjoyable to play. Can't wait for the second one to come out.			"

												Shelter is by far, the best ""indie"" game I had ever played. It's story is simplistic and heart wrenching. It never speaks a single peice of dialogue. I'm being serioius too, even Pokemon Mystery Dungeon did not make me feel so many emotions. The game also has a very unique art style, which is very easy on the eyes. The enviroments are filled with creativity and detail, and there was never a boring moment for me.It's soundtrack is also very nice. It fits the atmosphere of the game really well.Although the game is very, very short (an hour and a half to finish the story) it is still entirely worth it. But if you still wish for more content, there is the ""nurture"" mode. This mode has you raising your cubs by tracking food and bringing it back to your family. Be sure to check back every day, otherwise.. I find this game utterly fantastical in almost every aspect. Most games I've played don't even come close to this level of story telling. So with that in mind, I'd personally give this game a 96/100.			"

												You play as a mother Badger who is protecting her five offspring. You'll need to keep them fed, and out of harm's way. My biggest problem with this game is the lack of content. For the ten dollar price tag, you get about a one hour campaign. There's a ""nurture"" bonus mode where you bring food to your babies and watch them grow, but it's not very interesting.There's really not much to this game. You keep going on a linear path, feeding your offspring any food you come across, and here and there the game will throw a very clearly scripted hazard at you, killing one of your babies if you fail to guide them away from it.Linear and boring gameplay, muddy visuals, poor conveyance. A great concept with bad execution.			"

Its about nature and how cruel she can really be.The unique art style and music really contribute and make the game something special. There is some replayability here, get to the end with all your babies alive and feel like a champ doing so!It will take about two hours of your time to do so, you will not be shooting at people or aliens or bananas and you will not be driving super fast cars.

												Shelter was developed by Might and Delight (who previously made Pid). In Shelter you play as a mother badger who is protecting her five cubs whilst travelling from one home to a new home. You traverse through five different level styles, all strikingly different from each other in terms of visuals.Though this is 'a game' available on Steam at a cost of £6.99 there isn't really a whole lot to it gameplay wise, and I would say it feels more like a story or interactive piece of artwork than an actual game. The visuals are what makes this game quite unique: the muted colours, and the blocky textures. The game doesn't give anything away in terms of objectives, or ways in which you can go, though the levels are fairly linear.The objectives of the game are basically to travel, and feed/protect your cubs. As you go from level to level, your cubs get chased by birds, scared, sick, and it's your job to keep them together, alive, and well. I completed this game in around 90 minutes with two of my cubs left alive. It genuinely gives you a sense of ""Oh no!"" when you realise a cub is missing, or when you see one being taken from you. The game relies on a good sense of timing and awareness of your surroundings to get through it without losing any of your cubs (I assume that you can complete the game without losing any cubs).My main annoyance with this game was the camera. When you're sneaking through shubbery trying to get your cubs to eat, or spinning the camera to make sure everyone is together, and you get clipping through trees, leaves, and other inanimate objects, it can be very frustrating. Because of the low camera-view it can also be disorientating at times when you're trying to work out what direction to go as everything looks very similar.I didn't notice anything specific in terms of bugs other than cubs on occasion spin in a circle on their axis instead of actually picking up food that you've put down for them when they're standing on it, and in the third 'Wildfire' level this can be particularly annoying when you need to keep moving. I won't discuss how the game ends, as that's the only spoiler that can be given about the journey/story. I'll just say that I didn't like it, and to me ruined the games overall sense of purpose.This game has previously been available as part of indie bundles, and if you were intrigued to see what it's all about, I'd recommend you wait for a sale or another bundle as £6.99 feels steep for the length of the game. The game is very sweet (and equally harsh) emotionally, the tension in some areas of the levels is great, the soundtrack is good, the visuals are unique. I'd recommend it as a bit of a novelty game (particularly one to fuel the 'are games art?' argument) as I did enjoy the experience, but there is not enough replayability for me, it's too short, and even though I lost cubs during play it didn't feel difficult enough, or emotional enough for me to want to play a level again to see if I could save a cub that I'd lost.

												Hoo boy, where to start? In Shelter, you are a mamma badger and your goal is to feed and protect your babies. You have five, and they start to fade when they need food, and you have many dangers to protect them from, like Scary Freaking Birds (TM), forest fires and The Dark. I got through the first couple levels and thought.. I got this, I'm a great mom. I've got all five badgers, everyone's fed, A+ to me. Then I fell into a cave. And something scared my badgers into the darkness. Ensue baby badger screaming, and then there were four. This irritated me, so I dubbed the one with the white back ""my favorite"" and put him in charge of keeping the rest of the babies in line. We scoured the cave for food, and with my four remaining babies fading fast, I finally found what I hoped to be a way out. Insert scary noise, scrambling baby badgers, and then there were three. I scolded Favorite, and thought about putting him in a time out, but The Dark didn't seem like a great place to do so. We ventured up into the light, finally, killed a fox, survived Scary Freaking Birds (TM), torrential rains, and in an attempt to run upriver against the some rapids, I lost Favorite. I considered giving up right then and there, but I was determined to prove I wasn't a completely worthless mother, so I trudged forward.I lost my will to lead my two remaining babies to the end. I dubbed one of them ""New Favorite"", and proceeded to feed him any extra food in hopes it would help us make it through to whatever hope lies at the end of our 'tunnel'. He became a bit of a pig, even stole food from his only remaining sister. We pushed forward through forest fires, past rivers, and more Scary Freaking Birds (TM). Unfortunately, the lack of food to his sister must have ran its toll, because she simply couldn't outrun the bird, and then there was one. We were almost there, I could feel it. That, or I was simply going to give up because I couldn't take it anymore. Whichever came first. We reached a large field, I began to run for my life with New Favorite following me faithfully, probably only because he wanted food - at this point he was as large as I was...--Spoilers Ahead-- ..and the Scary Freaking Bird (TM) attacked me. Repeatedly. I tried running. Hiding. There was no escape. And yet, as my nearly-dead carcass was carried away, the last thoughts in my mind were... ""At least New Favorite survived. At least it wasn't my last baby. Maybe my motherhood skills aren't a complete waste...""And then I hoped that little fatty ran, so my sacrifice wasn't for nothing.I'll wake up to nightmares of badger screams tonight. And Giant Birds. Thanks Shelter.			"

												For all the saviors of the galaxies, legendary heroes, and lone hopes for humanity that populate most video games, developers have been ignoring one of the world's fiercest protectors: mothers, and their love for their childen. Shelter casts you as a badger, sole guardian of her five cubs, who must set forth against the harsh world to try and lead her children to safety. Through storms and wildfires, your determination will be tested and the lives of your underlings repeatedly put in danger, as you travel on an intense journey that not everyone will be able to survive.Shelter isn't a game you sit down to relax to; it's a harrowing adventure that at times is truly terrifying do to how emotionally taxing it becomes. Without any dialogue, no hints at a story or exposition of any sort, I became extremely attached to the little badgers I was trying to protect. Prancing around and hopping excitedly when stumbling upon a bit of food, they are almost entirely oblivious to the dangers around them and their joyful manner makes it even more saddening when you inevitably lose one. Death is all around you in Shelter and once a cub is gone, it's gone for good. There are no checkpoints, no extra lives, and no second chances; this helplessness is what makes it such an intense experience, and is something I don't believe I have ever felt in a game.Controlling your badger is simple by design. You can sprint and sneak to catch prey (and avoid being it), pull food from the grounds to feed your children and keep them strong enough to continue on, and often have to rely on stealth to get past hostile animals by sticking to the tall grass. There honestly isn't a whole lot to the gameplay, but that's because it intentionally is not the game's focus. Developer Might and Delight didn't try to make a great ""game"", it made an experience, one that is intended to make you feel something meaningful, and is an exemplary example for games as an art form.Regardless of how you view the argument, Shelter is an astoundingly unique pilgrimage through a gorgeous papercraft world, with a masterful score that affects every moment of the game. It's over in just over an hour and will likely leave you with an empty feeling after the credits role, but I think this was what the developers wanted. Nothing is ever perfect in life, and Shelter boldly reflects this fact without taking away your every hope. While certainly not without dispute and it's own share of problems, Shelter made me feel a sense of connection and responsibility that few if any other games have managed to accomplished, and I believe is something that you should be taking note of.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Let me start by saying that even though I'm not recommending this game here, it isn't by any means a broken or even objectively bad game. It's just that what it does offer will appeal to only a very particular type of player.I am not a good mother. In my first and only playthrough, I managed to lose all but two of my cubs. The cubs must be fed regularly or else... As they get hungrier, they become pale. This makes it easier to decide who gets to eat next, a decision you will be making very often. While the controls are generally manageable, it can sometimes be difficult to steer the mother badger toward the desired cubs at feeding time. The task is somewhat alleviated by the cubs spreading out around you, but they occasionally continue to adjust to your adjustments and a mildly frustrating process of microadjusting with the WASD keys ensues. Fortunately, there is plenty of food in the game, so starvation should never actually be a problem. Were I to play this again, I would try to skip more than half of the food I collected.The path you travel is very straightforward. Sometimes areas open up a bit and there might be different routes to take around an obstacle, but they always lead to the same exit. I would have liked to see some kind of reward for exploration apart from another token of the same food items (which, again, are bountiful). As it stands, you are always best rewarded by traveling directly for the exit.There are a few timing puzzles. None of them are especially difficult, though it's a bit of a guess how to proceed through the hazards at times. This is always what cost me my cubs. I found this to be one of the game's strengths, however, as it does enhance the feeling of being in the wild and trying to make the best decision possible without all of the necessary information. Reloading is impractical, and the long stretches of relatively boring wandering serve to discourage starting over when something goes wrong. While this is effective in design, it's a bit overwhelming (especially for such a short game) that boredom is the greatest penalty for failure and cheapness. This factor alone is my biggest hesitation about recommending Shelter.Aesthetically the game is a mixed bag as well. I personally enjoyed the music (folky post-rock vibes) and the art style. The most confusing flaw in the production is the washed out look of the game. No matter how I set my monitor, it looks like the brightness is far too high. This might have been designed to give the colors a pastel quality, which it does to some extent, but I found it far too distracting throughout the game. It was something I was never quite able to adjust to.I try to save my recommendations for games I think anyone could enjoy. Shelter asks for a lot of patience from the player, which will certainly not be for everyone. There are no glaring bugs, however, and the game is short enough to not overstay its welcome for the most part. If you're already intrigued by Shelter, pick it up and have fun! On the other hand, most players should know what they're getting into.			"

												This game is all about your experience and you know when those types of games work best? When you don't know what to expect. With Shelter that wasn't the case - without knowing any spoilers, just by going through game description and few screenshots, I pretty much knew how it is going to be.... And it turns out to be worse than I expected.Good things?Graphic. Very interesting, very different, really good.Atmospheric music.Unique idea.Engaging. At least for the first part. Game does a pretty good job in making you care for your little badger family, but sadly that isn't enough to call it a satisfying experience.Bad things?It feels like a chore. After you get used to the mechanics, you expect something to happen, but for the long time there is absolutely nothing going on. It gets boring really quickly.Not challenging at all. No feel of danger. I expected that I will be playing this in fear of the family of badgers, but truly, there wasn't any real sense of threat. There are far more dangers waiting for animals that just the few rare ones that we encountered here. And they aren't very well done.Repetitive. You keep doing the same things over and over again. And things like getting food or avoid danger are not even remotely hard.No replay value whatsoever.Bugs. Sometimes camera gets stuck on the tree and you can't see anything that's going on. It's not only annoying, it may actually cause you to make some mistake.In short - unique idea, but pretty disappointing game.			"

												I started the game with 5 pups and finished with 1. I lost the other 4 to predators and rapids. Shelter is a thought provoking game with draws you in. You are a mother badger and you need to look after your 5 pups by feeding them and protecting them from predators and the elements. Each time I lost a pup my heart skipped a beat followed by a sadness and guilt. No other game has ever made me cry!!I won't spoil the ending but I will say it is expected all things consider and in some ways I am glad.Once you have finished the game you get a new mode called 'nuture' this is where you can look after your pups starting from when they are new born and completely helpless. The pups grow bigger as the days go on and will follow you into the world after around day 8. If you don't log in then your pups will die.The sound track and game play is great. The camera and graphics not so much so. The graphics do draw you in but it would be better to be a little clearer as it's easy to get lost.I would definitely recommend this game if you are looking for a thought provoking game which draws you in and takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. However, if you enjoy fast paced, action paced games which are big on thrills and spills then I would definitely suggest you skip it.I applaud the developer for the accuracy in portraying the animals and I will definitely be getting shelter 2.

												Shelter- a Sophisticated ReviewShelter is a 2013 game by Might and Delight.    You play as a badger, mother of five cubs. Your task is to venture out into the wilderness and watch your little ones grow over the course of the four seasons. To me, it isn't obvious why, because you neither are really searching for a new home (or ""Shelter"") nor do you lack food in the beginning. Nevertheless it is one very interesting experience.    There are about 5-6 different areas that you have to cross before reaching the ending. All of them contain some kind of threat to your cubs. Except the first one- which is a ""light-hearted"" introduction to what turns out to be a ""heart-breaking"" experience. Everything starts out just perfect in summer or spring (I'm not quite sure) and then the environment slowly starts to show its claws- be it through predators, a waterfall, a forest fire, or just the harsh weather in winter.   The levels are quite big and are made to give you an open world-feeling yet everything about the game feels linear. Even when you start loosing some of your cubs, you begin to ask yourself: is this really my fault or is it all scripted? Strange thought, but this makes sure you play the game more than just once. Maybe it is possible to finish with all of the five cubs. Or what will happen if all of them die?   When you finish ""story-mode"", the so-called ""Nurture""-mode is unlocked, where you have to check on your cubs every day in rl to make sure they get something to eat and grow up healthy. A very interesting concept to keep you playing.   The gameplay is very intuitive, though anything but challenging. You only need the typical WASD-scheme, left mouse button to interact, shift to sprint and ctrl to sneak. All you have to do is look for all kinds of food to feed your cubs with. At the beginning you are left alone with looking for things to eat, but as your cubs grow, they start running towards everything they see.   With things you find you can only feed one cub at a time. That is until you decide to try out your hunting skills. Mice are the easiest to catch, but then there are foxes or frogs. When you manage to catch one of these there's a feast for all of your cubs.   One thing that really bothered me however is: How does the mother survive without eating anything? Does she feed on her cubs being content and healthy or have I missed something?   The artstyle is really interesting, but after some time you begin to realise that technically it's well beyond it's possibilities- especially for a game released in 2013. The textures(even for me- someone who normally doesn't really give a s**t about graphics) have very low resolution and the lighting is very dim and colorless.   The soundtrack however is perfect. In every scene (or level) it enhances your experience- by creating a tense atmosphere, winter atmosphere, light atmosphere and so on.   Although the game runs fairly well on my PC without any technical problems whatsoever, after I finished it, it hardly got back into the main menu. The screen just sort of kept popping for a whole 30 secs.CONCLUSION:   Shelter is a very special experience. Over the course of only 70 minutes it managed to personally engage me into the journey of a group of virtual animals- some would call it a family. Everytime I lost a cub I felt bad- it made me feel as if I was a loser to make that happen. At the end I had only one cub left and it felt like victory to me- with a bittersweet aftertaste- but a victory nonetheless.   It is also a very tedious experience. The visuals aren't as fresh as they should and the pseudo-open-world just hinders the experience as in some closed off areas there is nothing to find except a single carrot. Also the popping menu screen leaves a very bad impression in a technically nearly perfect game.In general, Shelter is something you have to experience. It isn't the best and it has its problems, but as a whole, it is a gratifying experience. You get to learn that although the world can sometimes be cruel, it has its reasons. It genuinely makes you feel good- although it also makes you think.7/10			"

 Warning! if you are prone to heart attacks,forming emotional connections or want to have a pet badger this game is not for you! but if you like family and taking care of your children continue reading  There is no questioning that Shelter is a work of art. It employs a graphics style all its own, the end result of which delivers at once a realistic and alien world. The natural environment is at once your friend and enemy, and you and your five badger cubs must make a truly hazadarous journey through it. Can you provide enough food for each badger cub to survive? Can you guide them safely past the flying bird's shadow? Can you hope to navigate them all past the deadly rapids? When the forest is aflame, can you quickly discover the safest route? Shelter is a tense and emotional experience you should make time to play. The whole game isn't much longer than an hour in length, but that brief time spent is really something remarkable. Also after you play this you will hate birds T^T Overall 7.5/10 fun game ^_^			"

Product received for free
												I wanted to let you all know first i was gifted this game from a dear friend. This game is not about sheltering in a bunker or like Fallout shelter, this game is more natural in it's settings. The story is non-existant, but obvious too. You are a mother badger trying to save her cubs from dying. That is the best description that i can tell you about this game without ruining it, since i wish to be spoiler free also. There are sad moments in the game.Many people will not like the look of the graphic style, but it did not bother me. Also, the ending is somewhat sad. This is a game for nature lovers and animal lovers. The game is quite safe for younger children, like other MIGHT AND DELIGHT games. Also, if you wish it, the mother badger and it's cubs come back in the game Meadow, that you can play also.If the regular game seems too short or too easy, there is also a hard mode called ""NUTURE"". This mode is opened after you finish the regular game once. It features challenging gameplay with much more challenging ways to find food and playing in it. Just check under ""Extra"" menu on the main menu screen for the game.One thing i will suggest is to buy it during a sale as i found the story is quite short. Note that M@D usually put their things on sale once a year, so watch for it on sale if you want it for a cheaper price.Recommended for child-friendly, natural settings and sad storyline.			"

												I lost my mother when i was 12 years old. I didn't believe when I first saw her on her bed with white liquid in her mouth. I felt something strong, like a hypocrit feeling, the same you feel in the nightmare. All my body was like into a nightmare. I tell her to wake up, her eyes were all open, not moving, her body was only moved by me trying to shake her saying again and again wake up. In an instant I remembered I had this feeling, it could be with my unknown father I lost when I was 5 years old. I call the strongest I can my big brother, I saw his eyes changing, we could see each others like in a mirror, impossible to understand what is happening. He reacted the same as me, calling her, trying to wake up her. Nothing. He called the firefighters and everyone of my family, in the meantime I tried to wake up my mother but nothing. I was blank but had hope while waiting the firefighters. When I saw them I was enlighted, finally I could finally see my mother moving by herself and talking. I heard many noises in her room, like trying multiple things on her, I had big hopes. They got out of her room, her faces couldn't be capable to see throught us, they couldn't say a word, we knew. I cried the most I can, my brother was destroyed, trying not to cry. My family came. Everyone was shocked, I never saw my grandpa like that. I could not believe what was happening, all of it really seemed like a nightmare. I knew my birthday will coming soon, I talked about it instead, like not knowing what was happening. I was petrified. Couldn't  define reality. I had  very dark pictures of these scenes. While I'm shaking while writing this down, I refelt these real nightmares.She died from a hearth attack. Later I knew the causes and realised what she did for us, me, my big sister and my big brother. After my father death I knew she changed alot, morally and physically.  She had just one objective: taking care of her children and she did what she could. She worked hard, she had alots and alots of stressfull times, she had terrible bosses,she had hours of transport eveyday, she smoked alot, not eating well. Her only pleasure time was with us, she spent her rest of her life for us, she died for us. Spending everything to make us the most happy as possible. I cried while playing this game. I remember all the memories with my mother, realising even more she was the most beautiful mother I ever had. Mom, I still love you <3.			"

												Designed as an experiment to see how far you can ramp up the gamma in the Unity engine, the scientifically accurate Badger Simulator 2015 primarily serves to teach kids that badger cubs are omnivores that eat a grown cat's RDA every hour. In an epic play full of deep & morally relevant messages about adolescence, parenthood and the circle of life (sans Elton John), you are assigned the part of Badger Mommy, genetically engineered not to need any food whatsoever herself, and you bid your time (your hour, to be precise) babysitting your most adorable [citation needed] kids along a reasonably linear path of invisible boundaries, not passing go or collecting $200 until the game eventually runs out of scripted encounters. In the meantime, this corridor shooter without any shooting will hurl tons (I measured!) of emotionally charged music out of your speakers. Functionally it's a bit like a third person Lemmings game with the Lemmings following you 95% of the time, furthermore devoid of the various joyful abilities proper Lemmings have. Worth the purchase (or the effort of playing) only for the peculiarly jolly Predator-esque airborne takedowns Badger Mommy can perform on the various hostile mobs inhabiting Gammaland.Length: 1 hourEvils: Unity; scripted as much as any CoD campaign; omniscient bird AI; bugsReplayability: You can hypothetically strive for a perfect playthrough. Depends on how often you'd like to endure ""dat gamma"".			"

												Here's the deal. Everyone should play this game. Just not at this price. Skip to the end for the abridged version. Excuse my gushing if you dont.The game:Im not saying that this is the greatest game ever made. But I am saying that it touched me in a way that no other game really has. The game really puts you into the character of a badger mom because it gives you NO dialogue or instructions whatsoever. You have no choice but to take the game at face value. Also, there are two ways to deal with loss in a video game. 1. make it a big deal. scream NOOO to the heavens, play a sad song, penalize the player heavily, maybe even in a game over if the loss is too drastic, etc. 2. DO NOTHING.  this game is so simple. theres so few ""things"" in it. and when you lose something, the game doesnt penalize you. it doesnt do anything. it just expects you to carry on. The game treats you the way nature treats itself. by not caring. The game could play sad music, or give you some debuff (maybe the mama moves slower or the babies are harder to control when one dies) but they dont. and somehow, when the game gives you no punishment, thats the worst punishment it can give you. Like your loss doesnt matter. as if no loss matters. and youre left with the staggering thought that it was all your fault. Its a very interesting game. Because it shows us about the struggle between human nature and the wild, and death, and loss, and rearing children, and a mothers love, through the use of a family of honey badgers and no dialogue whatsoever. Its truely something.This is really what a indie game is supposed to be. simple, experimental, and made by someone who CLEARLY knew what they were doing.The Price:That being said, the game is $10, and you can beat it in an hour if you try, an hour and a half if you dont. I am extremely fortunate that I bought this game when it was on sale for about $1.50. I think knowing how much I enjoyed it, I MIGHT have paid $5 for it. MAYBE. But im a cheapskate, so take that into account. But then again there would be no way I could know what it would mean to me before I bought it. so thats why Im telling you now.TL;DR-Game is extremely more philisophical than it seems. it was an emotional ride-absolutely dont buy this game for $10. put it on your wishlist and wait. buy it for nothing more than $5. its an hour long-NAME YOUR KIDS AT THE START. makes the game alot more hard hitting			"

												Getting attached to little creatures and hoping they live is very common for me, hence why I played this game! But that does not mean I can inherently recommend Shelter to people, or to say that it's exactly worth much.This is yet another game where Steam really should have more options than just a Yes/No.The overall experience is still nice (though rough around the edges), and certainly made me want to keep my little creatures alive. But it will take you less than 1 hour to complete. My total gameplay time is actually messing around with things and trying to understand why the visuals of the game are badly done, which I'll get to shortly. (And I don't mean the fact that they chose lots of flat colors.)You essentially control a mother badger and must take 5 children along with you throughout 5 different chapters/areas, as time passes along as you play. Each area has a different type of obstacle, threatening to take a child away from you. Your goal is simply to keep them safe and to move along a mostly linear path. You find food as you go, and must make sure to feed the proper child badgers, paying attention to whom you've recently fed and who is hungry. The actual difficulty of finding food was non-existent. In fact, there were portions where I was just running past items, and none of the child badgers starved at all.Besides the above, there really is nothing else to the game. You get to the end, and it's done. You can replay if you want, but it's the same ""experience"" repeated - unless you're trying to trick yourself into thinking you never played it, and that you'll save more children the next time around.The visuals of the game are nothing special, in my opinion, and actually made things really difficult to see. For me, the title screen was almost blurred together with similar colors to the point where some text was unreadable (and the same applied when the credits were rolling after I completed the game). And while playing the game, I had to turn my computer's brightness setting down to almost nothing, because the contrast is super high in the game, leaving a bright white layer over-the-top. It was just extremely difficult to see. The game itself definitely needs contrast settings, but none exist in the Options.There really is not much else to say about Shelter without explicitly talking about the details of the areas, which doesn't make sense for a general review.As I said above, I don't think the game is bad, but I also don't think it's exactly great or something to recommend. I myself got sad with things happening to the children as I played, so I suppose I would say to try it out if you are drawn to that. But the game itself isn't exactly worth the full price, as most of it is relatively simple in visuals and overall design, without much longevity.UPDATE:I surprisingly found this game to be more enjoyable than the sequel, because at least this game had unique progression and events. The other game is minimalist and too repetitive.			"

												I shed a single tear for my single surviving badger child and four more for the ones who died (two in the darkness, one to the water, and one to that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ eagle/hawk).Pretty cool game where you are a momma badger trying to feed and protect your five baby badgers while travelling....umm...I dont know where....I suppose yoru travels are only limited by your imagination, lol. Proper positioning of the food you gather and use of cover (in the form of tall grass) are your keys to survival. Dont do what I did and keep moving forward after dropping food for your kids. I found out after the first two perished that this was probably a bad idea, lol. Keep them in eyesight whenever possible and try to not feed them in the open if that option is available.Anyway, this is a somewhat slow paced game, but I thought it was pretty cool, and that soundtrack was pretty awesome in my opinion and was perfect for the moments the songs played. The gameplay is as simple as walk/run/look around and then the multipurpose Rmouse/A button which is used to dig up roots, ambush critters, drop the food you gather,and call your kiddos when they wander off.The graphics are cool in the same way that the graphics in Proteus are cool. The story/gameplay itself is actually pretty linear although it may not seem that way at first. There are five levels I believe. the ending...well...it's sad, poignant, and a circle of life deal. All in all, I felt this was a pretty interesting exploratory game from the viewpoint of a badger. You kind of grow attached to the momma and feel some remorse when you lose one of the kiddos. I think I will give this game an 8 out of 10. There are better games out there, but this one was good and pretty unique as well.			"

Shelter has some great artwork, a high 'cute' factor, as well as an original premise - but it ultimately falls a bit short on being an 'entertaining' game. The whole adventure was quite linear, with nothing novel or interesting really happening. If the trailer makes you go 'awwwwww', then you may enjoy an afternoon with this, otherwise, I'd recommend avoiding altogether or waiting for a deep discount. "

												I had five children: Cap, Straight Line, Arrowhead, Wingtip and Zero, all named for the markings on their back. I protected them, fed them, taught them, hid them from claws and fangs; but it wasn't enough. Cap disappeared in the dark. The worst thing is not knowing what happened to him - did he get lost, did he starve, did he fend for himself and grow up nice and strong? Or did some horrible thing bite into him and drag him away from me as he tried to call to me for help?Straight Line drowned in the river. I remember the pale red sky pelting us with cold rain, scrambling across jagged stone, and watching helplessly as a flood of frothing mud washed my second born away, forever.Arrowhead flew away. The fire licked our heels, all hiding places burned away. A clever hawk swooped my cub up in cruel claws as we fled through the burning forest in a panic. We didn't have to time to grieve, only to run.I have two children: Wingtip and Zero, named for the markings on their back. They know all the things a badger should: how to scavenge roots and fruits to eat, how to sneak through weeds and spring upon a fox, how to catch a frog in the reeds at the riverbank, how to bark to find each other in the night, how to weather a storm in a hollow log, how to survive a fire by running on hidden paths, and how to find Shelter in the forest. I'm tired. Old. Soon I will be too slow to continue hunting, but I am not afraid of death. The regret of not being able to save everyone in my family once ripped at my insides. But they died knowing they were loved, and now as I watch my surviving children scavenge for themselves I can finally sleep. Take care, cubs.			"

												This game is a perfect example of an indie game done right. You don't need super realistic graphics to make the game standout. The developers combined an interesting concept with a unique art style and made a game that I was engaged with throughout the end. Losing a baby is sad because you legitimately feel like you failed as your duty as a parent. This game pleasantly surprised me.			"

												10/10! Shelter is a truly wonderful game! It's a pretty easy-going, yet heart-warming tale of a mother badger and her cubs. The game reflects both the cruel and beautiful aspects of nature. In this game there is a set storyline with 5 levels to walk through. If you prefer an open-world game with more freedom, I suggest you buy Shelter 2 instead. It's just as wonderful, but you get to wander freely and hunt whenever you like! I assure you though, this game is totally worth it!			"

												As a short story, Shelter works well. Being a mother is difficult, and you sacrifice a lot to ensure your offspring outlive you. There's a nice little ""circle of life"" tale here. The gameplay though is more limited, searching for food to give your little cubs to ensure they don't die of starvation, and following a mostly linear path through life. The game throws various scripted encounters at you, and it can be quite thrilling at times (ducking between the long grass in the middle of a forest fire being the highlight), and losing a cub is really quite affecting. It's a short game, around an hour, and you probably won't want to replay it, but it's a worthwhile experience to have even though it's not quite as good as it could have been. The visuals are unique with its watercolour pallete, and the music fits the mood. It's very much an experience, a mildly interactive morality tale.			"

												A short but lovely game. I wish it had been a bit longer, but for what the story is and such, the length fits it. Anything longer and it probably would've changed the game completely and would take away from it rather than adding anything. The story is fairly straight and to the point. A sad but true story of life. Definitely recommend if you enjoy these sorts of games. The art style is beautiful, and considering the length it's more than worth it's current sale price ($1.99). If you have the change the spare, definitely pick this up and give it a shot.Also, I dare you to play it and NOT get sappy or emotional. Bet you can't.			"

												this is the best badger simulator that i own. a lot of you probably regret being born a human - justifiably. that weird creeping guilt you feel after sex (or more honestly jerking your lonely nub)...badgers don't feel that. badgers only know how to find apples and frogs in a forest that is for some reason fifty percent birch. remember when you had 200 dollars, spent 140 on steam sales and now have 60 dollars to divide between your angry italian landlord who yells MANJA MANJA before he eats supper, and your own suppers? badgers don't yell italian words or use currency. in this game you will know only the joy of apples and frogs. your only fear will be eagles. they are huge and beautiful just like the real species of giantus eagleus that jrr tolkien was inspired to write about in ""The Hbbit"" but they are also the only thing you should fear. instead of saving you, they will eat your cubs. sorry about the spoiler but i only am trying to save more cubs. buy thie game			"

												I just want to get 1 thing clear, If you are prone to heartattacks, emotional connects and want to have a pet badger, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! But, if you love family and story-lines, this game is for you!You start off in a cave with 5 pups and you need to feed one a raddish to get it feeling better again. Once you do this, you may leave the cave and start exploring the world for yourself.I wont give too much away but once the eagle takes away your first pup (AKA Oli) you will pause the game and hold back tears, knowing that you will never be able to get the sound of your baby badger pup's screams out of your head.Second, once your family come crashing down in a log and smash into the base of a mountain and a fox takes away Gerard, you will scream and hate foxes and darkness. And when the time comes to cross that river, Austin will drown and you will fear water.Fire will scare you and make your heart race.Open fields that are barren of grass will make you shiver and fear the oncoming eagle attack.Or, you will loose track of food and your babies will starve and you will feel like killing yourself to allow your pups to eat.And the ending, the very sheer truth of what it beholds will crush your very body and will to live.Overall, this game is literral art! The geometrical art couldnt have captured the sheer beauty of the scenery more perfectly and the soundtracks make the game absolutely stunning!I love this game so much and I am guaranteed to follow the Shelter series for a very long time!12/10RIP Badgers <3 2016 - Forever			"

												It is a beautiful yet sad game that will remind you how precious life is. Nature can be cruel and this game portrays it beautifully. The gameplay is fairly easy and there aren't any complex mechanics; anyone could jump right in and enjoy? the game. If you are person who is attached to cute animals, people, game characters easily; this is going to be difficult. The art style stands out and looks beautiful. The story line is pretty linear, and I would have loved if there were more routes thrown in. The sound and music match often match the tone of the game; however they don't stand out as much as the overall art style does. For those who have not so powerful computers this game can run on older hardware (I've managed to run it on Intel HD Graphics) after tweaking a few settings. Don't expect 60fps though; it does consistantly give about 30fps which is playable.Overall Shelter is a very unique game and most people will like it.			"

												Shelter is a very interesting game using a minimal design space that allows the player to control a parent badger as it moves its cubs from location to location. The controls are also relatively minimal, which is good as it doesn't get in the way of the simplicity of the concept and design. It's an ingenious title in that it puts the player in a relatively weak position and forces us to protect our young. I don't believe there's any inherent negative when you lose one of your young, though the emotional effect is there as you count up your young and notice that one of them is missing. Sometimes you're not even sure what happened, but the emptiness can sit with you.The invested player will soon find themselves scurrying back and forth quickly, looking for food, scrambling to hide them all when a threatening shadow appears, and generally fretting about the location of each of your young. It very quickly creates just the type of atmosphere it sets out to do. While it may not be a game that its players will return to often, for the price the players will receive an enjoyable, yet stressful, journey that portrays its source material very well.			"

												Nature is both beautiful and brutal, and so is Shelter. Between predators, starvation, and environmental hazards, being responsible for the survival of five little badger cubs is a terrifying proposition. By the end of the first 'level', there's so much built up tension and dread that the end simply can't come soon enough. Every second is a risk, the next threat could come out of nowhere - a fear which is doubled by the lack of a real saving system. The tragic death of one of the cubs can't be reversed without returning to start of the area and accepting the same risk all over again. Every death feels as if it could have been prevented, despite being unable to control the cubs directly, increasing the guilt of any loss. Leaving room for feelings is Shelter's strong suit. Every part of the game is made so simply - the controls consist of movement, a way to quicken that movement, and a single action key; the music is an uncomplicated guitar strumming which becomes more hectic as danger approaches, and the visual style is made up of only a handful of textures repeated over blocky frames. Nothing's left standing in the way of the player's own grand adventure, constructed from a very basic premise: survive and keep your children safe.			"

Shelter...*Note: This review is strictly based off of my opinions and experiences with the following game.* Overall Rating:: 7.5/10 Replayability Rating:: 1/10 Game Performance:: 10/10Shelter is a fairly enjoyable experience - it's the type of game you can curl up to at night and play while you're hidden amongst a mountain of blankets. As a mother badger, you must care for your cubs and journey with them through beautiful environments. While not everybody will enjoy the art style, it's something new and interesting. And while the gameplay can be repetitive, it's entertaining enough for a single run of the game.However, a single run is most likely all you'll really get - or want - from this game. After you've completed it, there's nothing really extra to go back for. The story doesn't change, there's no choices, no collectables - and it becomes very linear. The paths you'll take will always be the same, you'll always encounter the same prey, and the same events will always take place at the exact same times. Unless you really enjoy the game, you'll probably only play through it once.Also, the game is rather short - which in this case, isn't a bad thing. I feel like if it would've dragged on, it would've become quite boring to sit through. It makes for something simple and easy to play if you don't have much time to mess around.I'll also add that I've never encountered a glitch in this game - not a single one. I'm sure that other people have probably encountered a few, but in my case, it ran very smoothly.So, would I recommend it? Yes, I would. Although it's not a game for everybody, and it isn't the perfect game, it's still something sweet and interesting, and something that deserves a chance.			"

												★★★☆☆ - ""Worth a try, but only on a discount"" PROS:- Innovative idea- Tough loving, its hard being a mum and this game has the ability to make you attached without any characters- Art style just works beautifullyCONS:- Short, takes about an hour but losing your little ones makes you wanna try again- A little aimless, I got a little bored just waddling around. Could have done with a bit more, as theres only a few animals to catch and food to find.VERDICT? Im a little on the fence with this game as I found it disappointing and a little boring, however I've decided to recommend it due to its intelligent and fresh idea, but it could and should have been expanded on with better execution.

												REALLY SHORT (but thats probs a good thing as it would probs getting boring after awhile). What it needs is maybe abit more variety, establish your 'home base', not just scavenging for food in the forest but also raiding outskirts of small villages, farmers fields, interacting more with the wildlife (not just eat or be eaten), just something to increase the game life and allow for more levels without getting repetitive.Oh, and only saves at the start of the level so remember either finish the level or be prepared to start it again.....but its a a new twist on the survival genre...playing as a Badger....isnt for the people who only like shootin things....this is more the people that like a slower story driven game, even though there isnt actually a story, except the story of life, the story of trying to raise your little Badgers.

												Shelter is a survival game.Prologue You play as the protagonist, Badger Pistorius. This game is set 3 months after the tragic death of your wife, she died after a farmer shot her when she was going to the bathroom. After she died you were left alone to fend for your 5 darling kids. Stripe, Stripe is the athletic type, he's good at football and likes to take the mess out of his little brothers, especially the ginger one but we'll get to him. Then we have Oscar Jr, he has no legs but luckily since his dad is loaded after winning badger olympics 2012 he has spring legs that let him get about. The third child is Jacob, this is the only child of Pistorius' that is adopted, he's actually a rare breed of endagered chinese badger. The fourth child to the couple is David Tones (the ginger mentioned earlier) Tonesy isnt very good at much and always gets bullied by his siblings especially stripes, tones has dreams of joining the badger battalion and serving under super blue badger but sadly for him this would never happen. Last but not least we have Shelby, Shelby is the 5th born of the brothers so her always gets in frays, his favourite pass time is mischief, he doesnt listen to his dad, the young whipper snapper doesnt know his dads advice could someday help him.The games opens and you're in some kind of cave with your 5 kids, however for some reason tonesy is laid in a ginger heap on the floor starving to death, I walked into the next room and luckily their was what can only be described as a dead child in a green t-shirt on the floor, I got the child and gave it to tonesy thinking it would finish him for good and I would have one less mouth to feed, but the dead kid brought him back to life. We all set out into the world.Once I left the cave the graphics amazed me, word of warning only play in 1080p as it is the best for vis game. I began headbutting apple tree's as this is the only way to harvest apples as a badger, every apple I got I gave to Stripes as he has the best chance of playing for England in th world cup. the others were reyt upset and hungry. eventually I came across a fox, it said ""oreyt mate whats up hows your wife and that"" I burst into a rage and screamed ""U WOT M8, I dint touch her"" and jumped at least 15ft into the air, I propelled myself forward using only will power and spring legs onto the fox and sunk my teeth into him just like I did to my wi... nm. My little darlings then feasted on his dead corpse then stripes said ""oi tonesy this fox is ginger but ure gingerer lol"" and we all lolled.I thought this game had a mint balanced eco system where badgers reign supreme and cant be stopped. Then all of a sudden the music changed and a Kestrel swooped down and stole my vole lunch. I was shocked my first thought was 'I hope stripes is okay he has a big game next week' I looked back and they were all hid in the grass, I said ""Shelby dont go out of vis grass for heavens sake"" shelby grinned and ran out of the grass the hawk grabbed him and laughed I was like damn. We set off to find the hawk nes in the hope I could trade some secrets of how to avoid justice in order to get my kid back. when I got there the kestrel was said ""You can this un back if I can have tones."" so I accpeted and we all watched as tones got eaten by the hawk and then it burped.  eventually we reached the end by this point it was me and stripes as the others had starved.Striped scored 15 goals and made the england team, I was so proud I wish his mum was here t see it but she's dead, through no fault of my own.Over all I thought the game mechanics and story line were good, would reccomend to any MLG types looking to hone their quickscopes and survival techniques. After I played this I survived longer in a round as a siper on tf2 than my previous best. Proof tbh. And the character development was good, how the choices I made changed how the story panned out, I would have like Juniour to make it but you cant have it all haha.10/10 for this badgerific game.

												This game is special as it hits you right from the very beginning as being something very different from other games. It's simply unique in its simplicity and brings out the beauty of what we seem to have mostly forgotten while living in cities and leading a modern life, ignorant of the continuous struggle to survive in the wild. The simple act of feeding to living another day - it's something that most of us take for granted, but finding food in the wild is an adventure of its own for these wild creatures.There are no achievements to unlock in this game. There is no button-mashing involved. No alien robots to vanquish. No zombies to kill. It's simply down to the very basics of nature and how we instinctively react to protect our own. The story is touching and the more you play, the more you get involved into the lives of the mother badger and her cubs. This game exhibits a universal appeal, irrespective of the kind of games you usually love to play. There is adventure in protecting yourself and your family. But at all times, you need to make sure that your cubs are fed regularly. This is as real as it gets, with some elements of surprise intertwined into the story to keep the experience fresh and exciting. The graphics might seem somehow washed out or really bright, but the game really distinguishes itself from all the other games out there by drawing your focus and care to the gameplay itself, although the graphics look really good, once you understand the concept and setting and then you can truly appreciate the majestic beauty in doing the simplest things to stay alive and survive.Forget everything as you dive into this game. There is no 1st place here or any trophy to win. Enjoy nature and living as you would have, all from the perspective of a small creature out on its own to protect its family in the wild. It's magical and well worth the time to experience a great adventure!			"

												♥♥♥♥ing eagle.First of all Shelter has great graphics, it's really one of the nicest games I've played on that side. It looks like an interactive drawing or something. You take the role of a mother... badger. Yes. Badger. Who has to protect and feed her cute (and slightly stupid) baby badgers all along the game.  Obviously, they can get killed in a lot of different ways (I cried for each single baby badger I lost.) and you have to figure out how to protect them on each part of the game...Quite a good short indie game, really worth trying.

												BEATEN = Total Play time until completion - About 1.5 hours.And then there were (hopefully) 5.A (gorgeous) game where you play a mother badger navigating environments to fins food for your kids (via hunting or gathering) while avoiding environmental hazards and predators. When an owl came down and snatched my kid i channel my inner Mel Gibson (from Random) and demanded that son of a bi*ch to give me back my son. It's really hard losing kids - even fake ones. By exiting and restarting a section, you restart the last level you were on. I did that a bunch.  Still only managed to keep 2 by the end. Also it is worth noting the soundtrack is a really stellar ambient mix. Great game. Short and sweet, but worth the 2.50 i spent on it for sure.			"

												I played this game around Mother's Day and I just felt terrible. I thought I was doing so well, everything seemed fine and all my little babies were making it but then things started going downhill quickly and I realized something....I would be a terrible mother.Short game, not a ton of replay but there could be some in attempting to better how many of your cubs make it, and overall a cute little story. This is something you play for the experience and the art not because of some amazing gameplay. But if you go into it with the right mindset it really is a rich little experience and I greatly enjoyed it even if it left me a little teary eyed.			"

The visuals are great, gameplay is simple but challenging at times.  It gives you a very clear window into the life of a mother badger and how difficult it is to survive and protect your offspring.

												So, Shelter 1. My first game I played by Might & Delight. My review on this badger family survival, recommended! I love the Shelter style they gave to this game, I lost 2 badger cubs but all and all it was a great game. I love the life cycle they gave to it I felt sad seeing my mother badger taken away by an eagle but at the end the eagle was doing it to feed her babies. This game will stress you out! But other then that. Beautiful picture it draws.			"

												I have not been invested in a game as much as I have been with Shelter. Every moment is intense. One moment your exploring the beautiful forest, and another you spot a shadow approaching above you in the distance. The entire game was a rollercoaster for me, and I mean that in the best of ways. But that moment you lose your first cub, is one of the worst feelings. It's at these moments of life and death situations you are reminded of how fragile life really is. The game is that intense. This could sound cheesy as hell, but this game has really stuck with me the past couple days and has made me appreciate life abit more. I have not finished the game, nor played the second installment, but if it's anything like the first couple hours I have recorded, This game also is a welcomed break from what now seems like a over saturated market of games. I could have found my new favorite game series.			"

												Shelter is a third-person survival game where you play as a mother badger attempting to protect her 5 cubs from hunger, predators, and the elements. It's quite short (it can be completed in roughly an hour - less time than it takes to drop all the trading cards), so consider the price accordingly. The graphics are a washed-out stylized pastel, which works well for the rather whimsical feel of the game at times, which contrasts nicely with the danger which is present.All in all, I enjoyed it - the short length plays to its benefit as it didn't overstay its welcome. I felt terrible when I lost one of my children, so it's effective at conveying that loss.Recommended if the concept sounds interesting - it's well executed, so if it sounds like something you might enjoy, you probably will.

												So I really didn't play this game for that long, so many might look past this game. But hear me out first, this game is actually quite simple. You play as a honey badger, and you have to take care of these 5 baby badgers and make sure you help them grow up. You are both a predator and somewhat of a prey, if you fail to watch out for the babies, one by one they all die. You could hunt foxes, frogs and etc, as well as eat fruits or vegatables and deliever them to your babies. Simple right? Well one thing, you badger moves really slow, and I mean really slow. So you really have to depend on being stealthy if you're hunting foxes, but during my gameplay, they easily hear me when I'm a foot awat them and then they're off. The babies are basically useless and only drag you down. They will always follow you around which kinda gives your spot away when hunting for animals, and when bigger predators hunt you down. I once was trying to sleathly move across these grassy areas, and because of the babies being idiots, they slowly followed me and one big bird swooped right in and grabbed one. The babies aren't smart despite being adorable. But it only takes 60-90 minutes for them to become adults, and after that, you're done, then new game, hunt, feed, repeat. It's basically a beautiful looking escort mission, and it's pretty annoying. I know there are people that are going to hate my review, but it's just how I feel about this game.			"

												Shelter is a game about many things. It's about motherhood, badgers, the circle of life, and protecting one's young from the dangers of the world. It's the sort of game that expresses itself through the gameplay alone, without words or other narrative devices from other art forms. It's beautiful, highly emotional, and aesthetically pleasing. Shelter is also one of the few games I have found that puts the player in the role of a mother which is refreshing to see. The experience is somewhat short, but it is one of the most rewarding ones I have had in a game in awhile.			"

												Shelter is a nice badger story, it is pretty challenging, even more so if you want to keep the pups alive, which of course you would want to, however it is possible not to cue the ending and just do whatever you want in the final level which i find is fun just fooling around with all the pups, yes i managed to keep all the pups alive. Overall i'd say its a nice rather short game and i'd give it 5/10 mainly because it's short, like really short  but if you're fine with short games and you like badgers im sure this will be a nice short game you'll like!

												While I love animals in real life, I don't get emotional very easily. It usually takes something quite serious to pull me in and make me care. However, it seems like this game has what it takes to do exactly that. I've only been playing for around 45 minutes, and I've already grown attached to those baby badgers! :)I'm still forming my opinion about some aspects of the game, but I can tell you one thing for sure already - if you have any love or connection to animals (besides eating them) - you must try this game! You don't have to pay the full price ($10). As far as I'm concerned, wait for a sale, get it on a bundle, or whatever. But make sure you do get it! One disadvantage I did encounter - you can't change the controls while playing, so make sure you set the controls the way you want them *before* starting a game. Being left-handed, this was quite an issue for me (couldn't operate the mouse with my right hand if my life depended on it).			"

												A simple simulation game with a haunting soundtrack and ambient sounds that capture some of the serenity of life as a badger with her cubs. Definitely a different kind of game and a unique sim idea.The developers said they wanted a game with a slow tempo and they even cut out gameplay ideas that diverged from this ethos. I guess they really achieved the slow tempo for sure because  there is not a whole lot going on to warrant sinking hours into this game. I played it for a while and got bored since there is not much to do and the cuteness overload kinda wears thin after a while. I didn't play long enough to encounter the eagle yet. The environment is created in an interesting art style but the paths start to look very similar after a few visits. Only buy this game if you like badgers and a relaxed play style without too much to do.			"

												Out of all the badger simulators I've played, Shelter would probably rank in the top 3 best ones. The use of an invisible force-field in the first burrow test chamber was an unexpected but effective way to force the player to ressurect the dead badger using the magic vegetable.This badger simulator uses third person view perspective, so it is unlikely to get occulus rift VR support in the future.Unfortunately, there is no multiplayer mode. If you are looking for a badger simulator, and this game is on sale for a large discount, I would reccomend considering Shelter as one of your options.			"

												There is no questioning that Shelter is a work of art. It employs a graphics style all its own, the end result of which delivers at once a realistic and alien world. The natural environment is at once your friend and enemy, and you and your five badger cubs must make a truly hazadarous journey through it. Can you provide enough food for each badger cub to survive? Can you guide them safely past the flying bird's shadow? Can you hope to navigate them all past the deadly rapids? When the forest is aflame, can you quickly discover the safest route? Shelter is a tense and emotional experience you should make time to play. The whole game isn't much longer than an hour in length, but that brief time spent is really something remarkable.			"

												Shelter is a unique survival game where your curiosity makes you explore what to do. If you are into action and saving the world this game is not for you. But if you would like to have a unique survival adventure in a world you have never seen before, this game is for you. The goal of the game is to survive the dangers of nature, and make sure your babies survive the journey. But nature is very hard and will put you on a test to see if you have what it takes to survive. That you have to do this, and especially how is at the beginning of Shelter a mystery. You find yourself being an adult badger in a small burrow. You start with 5 cubs, one of your cubs grey and lifeless. You will find food nearby, feed him and he becomes healthy again. When you get out of the burrow you will see a simple square like shaped forest with hand drawn textures. So it is not exactly your beautiful forest but together with the simple colors and minimal guitar music in the background you find yourself feeling safe and thinking all you need to do is walk around a little and feed your babies. The controls are easy and when you walk around pictures will give small instructions on how everything works. (Like shift is used to run and hunt for food). But the moment you realize the world is not as safe as you were thinking it is too late. The game will give you a sense of responsibility and survival instinct. There is no time for sorrow when you lose one of your cubs because you need to go on to survive. When there is not enough food  you will have to choose who lives and who dies. The game will learn you that nature is not a safe place.The graphics may not be nice and smooth but on the other hand they are unique. The game is very short, about an hour long. So I recommend to wait for a sale instead of buying the game for the full price. But the knowledge that life is at stake at the moment you fail and the constant threat is what makes Shelter a great and unique experience with a bittersweet ending after the credits.			"

 Badger simulator is shallow. Everyone loves badgers, right? I don't think that's enough to make a game good, tearing real gameplay from it and hide behind the visual dynamics of an artsy representation of a natural world.In Shelter there isn't really much to do, and the game relies on your ""ability"" to make the little animals which follow you around survive, walking around and concretly doing nothing of interest. The outcome is sadly a boring excuse of depicting something that wants to be different but ends up being only badly streamlined and shallow.			"

												While others may complain that this is just a useless ""artsy"" game, I like to think otherwise. The graphics style of it gives it a unique appearance and adds to the game play. Besides all that, you're playing as a mother badger with baby badger cubs. Baby badgers!! How is that not adorable and worth playing? The game, while admittadly is short, manages to captivate you within that short time. You feel as if these baby badgers are your own, and you will do anything to make sure they stay alive.

												A nice little journey within this game, has some fast paced parts that I really got sucked into. The artstyle of the game is amazing and I loved every second of it. The ending had some tear jerking moments once you understand what you did throughout the game.The only disappointing part is it is really short and some areas you feel rushed because of the birds so you can't explore to much without being pressured by the damn bird that trys to fest on your badgers!

												Clocking in at just over an hour for a single playthrough, Shelter is a wonderfully unique experience that doesn't overstay it's welcome. It doesn't have too much mechanical depth, but it doesn't need it with such a concise experience.The story is touching and explained entirely through gameplay. I won't spoil anything, but if you have any heart at all, you will care for your little pups by the end. The game forces you do deal with frightening or difficult situations, and you really feel for the babies that you don't have any real control over. Also, whether it was intended or not, Smokey The Bear ain't got nothin' on this game.It was an interesting and unique experience and I enjoyed my time with it, but that time is basically an hour, with nothing else to unlock or experience, with no divergent paths for subsequent playthroughs. The only thing that can change is how well you play the game, as that directly effects whether or not your pups die along the journey. It is basically the game equivalent of a short film that you'd see after the trailers in a Pixar Film.			"

												On the surface Shelter is a good idea, and has the potential for high emotional buy in, but the execution is poor and repetitive which leads to pressing forward and steering the badger around map after map until you become bird food. That will happen in 1-2hours depending on how long you care for the babies. I took care of the babies about half way through before I was trying to find a predator to eat them.			"

												This game has some merits, which I'm sure you can see just looking at it if it piques your interest, so if you're already interested, I'll tell you why I don't recommend it:The gameplay is slow. You're really not doing very much. In fact, your only controls are WASD, left mouse button, and shift/ctrl for run/""crouch."" All you do is go down a very linear path looking for food for your babies, which is either plants that you just pluck from the ground, or animals that you ""attack."" I feel like the animal interactions are also bugged, because on one level I missed three frogs despite being right on top of them.And about those frogs, they were on a ""stealth"" level. It's a nigh level where the fastest you can go is an incredibly slow crawl (except for some scripted events), and it is so tedious.The real tedium set in for me when I lost my first cub. It didn't feel like my fault. I gave my babies all of the food I found (except for the animals that ""ran"" away from me when I was right on top of them), which speeds them up, but one still died somehow. It really broke immersion for me and I stopped caring trying to care for my babies, because they just die anyway.The really funny thing is that this game is only an hour long. Imagine an hour long game feeling tedious.Aside from slow, tedious, and uneventful gameplay, it also somehow performs poorly. A 3 year old game that looks like this should not give an RX 390 problems, but it still had some jarring stutter trying to run it at 1080p/144hz. It seemed to stay around 70 FPS and moving the camera made it dip so badly that it disoriented me frequently.It also looks a lot worse in motion. I think the screenshots look fantastic, but when you're actually playing, the graphics seem less artistic and just feel poor.If you want a nice relaxing game, just look elsewhere. But honestly, for a dollar, maybe give this game a shot anyway.			"

												*spoilers*This game showed me how cruel and intense motherhood is. You grow up with your cubs then slowly watch them get plucked from your control; never to be seen by you again. The game is an emotional roller coaster. It makes your heart beat as fast as a lamborghini and makes you cry a river. Never before have I been this touched by any game, or possibly anyone other than an old man. It was so short, yet it felt so long. The experience was like that of no other. The music rode along with the game during the whole time. It was sheer bliss. Motherhood has crushed my soul, as my dear cubs were taken from my grasp. It was mother against mother in the end, and that was shocking yet beautiful. Just as the fierce and brave badger mother stayed by her own cubs' sides, the hawk mother did the same for her own babies. The badger mother's efforts and death were not in vain. One cub will live on to repeat the cycle, and have more cubs. The new mother will risk her life for the lives of her own. The cycle will repeat itself. Beautiful. This experience was like no other, and should be had by every person. I cried tears at the end and reflected on the game. I couldn't think of anything better that i have experienced. 10/10. I love you mom ♥ 420			"

Pros: Art, music, and environment are greatCons: Game is very short and mechanics are overly simpleThis game is a real oddity. If you enjoy art-focused games that tear at your heartstrings, Shelter might be for you. The premise is simple: You play as a mother badger, with a group of five young. Over the course of several events, you must feed five hungry mouths while avoiding the perils of predators, flashfloods, and forest fires. You will lose some young along the way, but nature is cruel and unyielding; we must press on.The game is very minimalistic, linear, and offers little to action-oriented players. However, the pastel ornamentation, ambient nature, and--good god--the soundtrack are what make the game. Seriously, that musical scoring is fantastic.Buy it if you want something different--a change of pace. I can't say it's worth the pricetag for just over an hour of gameplay, but I do believe that this game is a true work of art. You've never experienced life from the viewpoint of a badger until now.

												It was really nice to play. Has a bit of a abstract pallet knife art style to it. The gameplay runs quite smooth, nothing jarring, even from the couple of 'tutorial' popups early in game. All the feedback in the game just works fantastically together. Its all small, subtle interactions, but immerses you so well. For instance as the babies need more food their color becomes saturated. Only a few times did a baby badger (think they are badgers) get stuck on the edge of a log or something. Other then that the little guys followed their Mom near perfectly. Its definetly something everyone should experience.**Oh and a caution to the feels.**			"

												This game is beautiful. This game is a work of art. This game actually interacted with my emotions.Shelter puts you in the position of a mother badger watching over her five badger cubs. Your goal is to roam the wilderness while finding food for your cubs and survivingthe menacing hawk as well as surviving other natural obstacles such as forest fires and roaring waves. There isn't a single line of dialogue but rather a story you create for yourself with YOUR actions. Will your cubs stay fully fed? With they go hungry? Will the hawk capture any of them for lunch? Will they burn alive in the fires of the forest? Will they be swept downstream during a storm when you must find your way upriver for more food?By the time the hawk first rears it's ugly head you find yourself already growing attached to your cubs, at least I did. You make it your ultimate goal to keep them alive and nuture them as you watch them grow from cub to fully grown badger. Your ultimate goal is to make sure all five make it to adulthood. I unfortunately only could get 4 of them to the end of the game. I lost one to the natural obstacle known only as the river.This game really plays with your emotions. Fear as the hawk arrives, Joy as you catch that tricky fox, disappointment as the mouse crawls into a hole, escaping your grasp.The graphics are very unique in their art style and the soundtrack really helps you to get immersed. The game itself is very linear in its destination and the paths you take, but very open in the choices you get to make along the way. Occasionally I ran into a bug where my cubs would stand on food rather than eat it but it's nothing game-breaking.I give this a 9/10. This is a beautiful game and worth every penny, even more, even for such a short playtime. You can play it through once, play it through until you can finally save all 5 of your cubs, or simply replay it or it's extra ""nuture"" mode whenver you wish. Nuture mode is where you raise your cubs from infancy to adulthood in a very less-linear way. You can get on the game once a day, go out looking for food, hop off, and do the same the next day until they can walk, then when they can walk, go out looking for food with them. Even this mode has an ending; motherhood is not forever. It's really an amazing game and I think everyone in existence needs to try it.			"

												I would recommend this game to everyone I know. The art style is very unique, and the levels are amazing. It's a great game, and even if that isn't a fact, I and many others still believe it.Shelter is a game where you play as a badger mother caring for her five children. That's what makes the game so unique for most people, and why some decied to buy and play it. When you first play Shelter, most people think that their cub is dead, even though they're just hungry. So you just start up the game, and it's already making you sad and scared for your cubs. Now that, is pretty amazing.There are five levels to play in total. Each level has it's own dangers, food, and lay-out. From eagles to forest fires, there's plenty of dangers to your cubs, and each one makes you check behide mother badger every few seconds to make sure each one of your cubs is still following, and looking for food almost every second of game play out of fear your cubs will starve to death. It's amazing how much fear a simple game can give someone.Shelter is a game that plenty of people enjoy. It's a truely amazing game to sit down and play for an hour or two. If someone is tired of playing the game over and over, they can go to the extra menu and play nurture mode. In said mode they can spend about 5-9 minutes daily to take care of new-born cubs to grown adult badgers, for about a month.  I think that, if some people gave it a chance, they'd realize just how much it's worth it's price.			"

I'm a terrible parentShelter is a unique little game. Where you are a mother Badger with 5 cubs to take care of.You need to survive 5 areas with your cubs. You lead them, feed them, save them from other animals while you cross lands and waters to a safe place.It's kinda a survival game, without HUD or surviving bars on screen.Pros:- Refreshing, new take on survival games concept.- Atmospheric and nice music- Edgy & Emotional. Sometimes it makes you happy, laugh, worried, guilty or depressed.Cons:- Too Easy to get lost because of the level design- Suicidal cubs AI- Short game (Not really bad for me, but probably severe for some others)Conclusions:Yes. I recommend this game if you want a fresh breath from loudy games.But as i stated before, game is short (2 hours long) plus a seperate Extra mode (Nurture).So If you don't have a problem buying a short game for $10, go ahead. Otherwise wait for a sale. "

												I didn't really know what to expect when I started playing the fantastic Shelter. I can't even remember buying it. But there it was in my library, store page describing it as a survival game where you play a badger with a pack of children. And that's exactly what it is. But what I played was so much more.I mean, I only managed one playthrough, and I don't think I'll do another. But two of my badger children died along the way from what I believe to be a bear or wolf while guiding them through a dark area at night, and another one was swept away by a river. The emotion impact isn't huge, but it comes across as remarkable because of how realistic it is. This kind of survivalism happens in real life. Animals just like badgers, beavers, foxes, squirrels, any sort of animal that lives in the wild really. They come and go and struggle to stay alive, by all means, including hunting other animals. Which Shelter includes. I hunted mice, foxes and frogs. They perished and I apologized, but my badger family was hungry.I admired the simple graphics, the music started out as how an indie hipster would strum some notes on his acoustic guiter, but it elevated to intense drumming and other instruments, which was nice. I didn't notice any bugs, aside from the last level where badgers would get stuck on the vegatables instead of eating them. Just give the badger kids a shove and they'll see the veggies.The games only shortcoming was the purpose of leaving a perfectly reasonable shelter. Why did we have to leave the perfectly reasonable shelter to go on a dangerous adventure? WHY? WHY GODDAMMIT! Two of my badgers died because the developers didn't think, ""Hey, what if they just stayed in the area and collected and stored food there?"" The person that thought that was probably sacked or thrown out a window.9/10			"

												Some people think there should be a distinction between games and 'interactive experiences', or whatever you want to call them. Things like Dear Esther and Gone Home. I myself don't care, since I love both, but that's not the point. At first you would think Shelter to be an interactive experience; something that contains little gameplay and revolves mainly around the artstyle and the unique concept. However, you'd be surprised how much of a game Shelter really is. I wouldn't know what genre to put it in, but I'd say it comes closest to a strategic puzzle game. You play a mother badger looking out for 5 little badger cubs. The game rarely tells you anything, and let's you figure stuff out all on your own. Make one mistake and one of your cute little badgers dies. The only goal is to reach the end with as many cubs alive as possible. On the way you will not only have to find food to feed your cubs, but you will also encounter many dangers in the form of predatory birds, forrest fires, foxes, darkness and strong currents. All require a different tactic to get through. You can't just focus on getting yourself through though! Your babies have to make it too, which adds an extra element of suspense.Shelter is unlike any game on the market. It's unique, simplistic but beautiful artstyle fits the simple gameplay mechanics. The game is short, but succeeds greatly in making you feel attached to your little badger cubs. Trust me; you'll feel really bad when one of them gets eaten because of your neglect. There is little story, but that makes sense. These aren't talking Disney badgers; they're just badgers. They eat stuff and try to survive. That's it. That's the story. I have to say I adore this game. If you're only into action packed first person shooters I suggest you stay far away, but if you're looking for an unique, artsy and suspenseful gaming experience, pick this up. I do suggest waiting for a sale or indie bundle though, since the lenght doesn't really fit the price point right now.			"

												Great game, EXCEPT the horrible, tacked-on beginning that attempts to pull on your heartstrings.  You are given no tutorial for this first part, you have to somehow just know what to do, and then after that scene, you are given a tutorial about some of the things you already had to do in the first part!  The first part was clearly hastily tacked on after the game was made.  After that, the game is as it was intended, with a good, visual, as-you-go tutorial that worked perfectly.  The level design (after that first part) was also very good, which required some exploring but was not too confusing.  There are a few more tutorials I wish they had added because I didn't figure them out until later (such as that you have to feed your baby badgers individually if you want the hungry ones to eat).  I will also mention the caveat that the game is only about an hour long, but I picked it up in the winter sale for 2.50, so that's not bad.  Overall, very good experiential-type game.			"

												Shelter? It's simply amazing. You play as a Mother Badger who has five cubs you need to look after-You need to feed them and keep them safe from danger. The graphics are beautiful and charming, even if they are simple. The music fits, perfectly. This game comes with a mixture of emotions- Happiness, sadness (Like when a pup dies!), and even being frightened out of your skin. (Don't stare at the screen intently. Just. Don't.)I got this on sale for £1.74, because I am a sucker for nature games. The game only provides 1-2 hours of gameplay, but those hour(s) are worth it for the money. Right now it is on sale for £2.79 until January 2nd. Don't hesitate. Get this game now. You won't regret it. Trust me. "

												You are a badger; you have 5 children who need food; turnips, apples, frogs, rats, foxes are food that can be found/caught; wolves, floods, fire and eagles are trying to eat/kill your kids; keep them alive and kepe them fed. This game is incredible. Such a simple concept and yet so enjoyable. It's the kind of game where you can get a beer, and just sit down and play without having to be totally invested, mentally, in what is going on. It has a simplistic art style that reminds me of children's bedtime books, and a wonderful soundtrack that is relaxing and yet telling of events both happening and coming. It's not a long game, but it is totally worth every penny you spend on it.			"

How to Ruin a Nice Game? [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]In this washed-out game you will play as a hearthless badger that will kill dozens of frogs and foxes just to feed her always hungry sons. You will jump 5 meters in the air, break a fox's neck as a breadstick and set an entire forest on fire!Meanwhile your sons will grow up and became bigger than you, but still won't help you hunting or running out of dangers, just as real life sons would do!Soon you will sadly realize your actions are meaningless: badgers will die no matter what and they will grow up no matter how much food you will give them. This won't stop you playing the game until the (easily guessed) end, a measily 1 hour and half after the beginning.It's like Christmas: it's fun until you find the secret that lies behind :( .Best played with Keyboard and MouseRecommended Buy Price < 3$Score 7/10 "

												This game is by 'Might and Delight' found here http://www.mightanddelight.com/index.php?page=projects where you can also pick up some free desk top screen savers for shelter and a children's book with the same art style.Shelter is a mother badger simulation which harbors a Picasso type look to it all. The objective is to simply look after your five children and keep them alive against such difficulties and enemies such as starvation, predators, flash floods and bush fires. In truth the real enemy here is you and how neglectful you are as a mother. More than likely you will witness your children's helpless faces as they get washed away, burned like popcorn, waste away to nothing because you haven't fed them in the last five seconds, or you will simply hear what their screams and bones sound like as they get munched on by the pigs or hyena's that hunt in the night like they are velociraptors. The game is short lived as it only has five levels and a bonus tamagotchi level called 'nuture'. The game never holds your hand by telling you what you need to do and so more often than not you will find out the hard way through sacrifice. It isn't extremely difficult to complete this game with all five children still alive on your second run through, but it is on your first run though.You will learn various things in this game. You will learn what it means to be in the wild. You will learn the need to distinguish your children and not play favorites. You will learn the need to keep your children in the safety view of your watchful eye. You will learn to look ahead for danger, look for easier paths that do not encourage your children to be distracted from danger and you will learn to scavenge for food. It also teaches you that headbutting things will get you far in life, something that no doubt is useful in the real world too.The nuture game is a tamagotchi which requires you to log in daily and nuture your five cubs back to health. Each day you will find 1 or 2 food items. Once the children have been fed about 7 times they will then start to venture with you to the exit of the burrow. After day 7 you will be given a chance to venture further and be given access to the river. As days progress your game level and experiences progress. The limit of this experience is 365 days. You cannot progress any further after that. This level seems to have just been added as an after thought to add some more padding to the game in general and what's on offer.Highly recommend the game and at least a complete single play through so you can experience it for yourself if it ever goes on sale. You can also see a complete run through of the game here... https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGoldgfYpB4ARdxvMTpOpEwRYguTLZoK5 "

												Shelter is quite a unique game. You play as a mother badger who takes care of her younglings while keeping them safe from harm. You feed them various foods and they grow bigger. But your badger babies can die from hazards and predators which truely makes you feel bad afterwards. Music is nice and the paper art style is rather pleasing overall. The game is a bit short and I wish it was a little longer but it has quality going for it.6.5/10 A charming little survival game that has nice visuals, music and gameplay. Worth your time if you're interested in something out of the ordinary.			"

												Don't expect another Journey here, but just a well made adventure starring badgers. It's your goal, as mother badger, to shelter your cubs from harm in this one hour adventure. An original idea, I agree, and in the time it takes to finish you will experience several situations that might change the story. The whole game takes place in the woods, so it's all colorful and detailed (as far as the graphical style allows). There isn't a whole lot of action, so the gameplay is a bit on the slow side, but you shouldn't get bored of it before the end.I, for one, enjoy and welcome games like this, because they usually try to tell a(n emotional) story. Ok, the gameplay may be non-existent, but the experience itself is usually worth the journey. So I guess you could interpret that as a compliment (which it is in this case :))..[Rating: 78/100]			"

												Well, what can I really say? The only thing this game has going for it is the artstyle. The game is extremly short, it can be easily beaten in under 2 hours. The levels are very different from one another, but the gameplay is almost always the same: you get your cubs food by either slaming yourself against the apple tree ( and only the apple tree) or you pull food out from the ground, occasionaly you might get the chance to catch a frog or a mice or even a fox ( last one being extremly hard to catch). The only enemy you have to worry about is the giant eagle, but he only appears at certain areas of the game, so no constant threats. The game sadly never shows any heartwarming bounding moments between you and your cubs, so the ending is rather dissapointing, feels very forced and sudden. So, all in all, I would skip this one and maybe check out the other 2 games from the same studio, which is what I will do next.			"

												Honestly when I picked this up I wasn't expecting much from it, I kind of wrote it off as just another artsy eco-message game, but I figured I'd give it a shot for the sake of making a let's play video of it.Turns out I was in for more than I expected.The game really sucks you in. What I was planning on being just a ""Let's Play"" video turned into a full playthrough.It's engrossing. While I'm not a fan of the incredibly overdone gamma/brightness, and at times the textures they use are a bit over the top, the game is a solid bit of fun. You genuinely start to worry about your little babies (It helps they all have unique markings), and you don't want to see anything bad happen to them. (Though the environment is all too willing to shorten their lives.)Yes it's short (I finished it in a couple of hours), and the graphic style might be a bit much for some, but despite my preconceptions about the game, it got me to do something a lot of other games have not been able to do. It made me care.It was almost an emotional experience, and not one I'm going to forget anytime soon.If you want to try a break from the norm, this might have something for you.			"

												Shelter is probably one of the most bring games ever conceived in the entire history of computer games, and that also includes consoles.Considering the game was released in 2013, when multi-GPU systems, with hundreds of GPU cores are relatively common, this games graphics are awful. It is something that would perhaps be nice in the 90's, in the era of the 3DFx Voodoo accelerators, but nowadays these graphics don't have any appeal. PLayability is close to nil: there is no hint of what must and should be done in the game. You start as a badger with its 4 cubs in a cave. So, what now? The game doesn't tip you anything. You might as well stay in the cave. Actually, due to some bug in the game, the badge can't even exit the cave.As other users have put it, Shelter is just a plain boring badger simulator, although watching your neighbour's grass grow is a lot more entertaining.I strongly advise you NOT to get this game. It is a shame how developers even wasted time and effort on a game like this.			"

												Shelter is an incredible experience. For short, this game is like a long escort mission. I enjoy the game at first and it simply gets old halfway for me but I recommend this game because of the reasonable price.I got this game during Steam Weekend Deals for 2 dollars. So far, I've played 82 minutes into the game I haven't survived yet. I know I'm going to keep coming back to play Shelter until I managed to escort all five cubs to the end game.It may sound like a simple escort but you need to feed those cubs and make sure that they are not fallen victim to nature's wrath. The jungle can be nice and peaceful but can also be unforgiving.			"

												As a as a strict, hardcore indie gamer and as an indie developer myself, I really liked this game. The concept of playing as an animal is good enough, but caring for your adorable offspring is a fantastic idea and I wish I came up with it first. The mechanics work, and gameplay is usually varied. I got extremely attached to my cubs, even naming them (R.IP. O.J. Simpson, Sheriff Willins and Mailtime). I also really like the art style. It worked with the square issue that textured objects face to create a nice, homy quilt feel. And also the endgame. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't believe they ended the game like that. I cried my eyes out.     The one thing I didn't like about this game was that it was very linear. There were little opportunities for exploration and the objective seemed too clear. This might be a minor issue for some people, but I am not a big fan of linear games. Also, it is kinda short, which I don't mind too much, but I did pay $10 for this game. Shelter, however, makes up for this by controlling your emotions.     Other than that however, the mechanics work, the art style is nice and it plays with your emotions a lot. A LOT. Shelter is worth $10, and if you get it on sale, use the money you saved to buy tissues. I am very excited for Shelter 2, as in that one you play as bobcats, which probably means you won't get tracked down by that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hawk. Scroll down for spoilers.FINAL VERDICT:Pass me the tissues8.8/10--------------------------------------------- As River Song would say, ""Spoilers!"" ---------------------------------------------At the end, you are stuck in a wide open field with no tall grass for your cubs to hide in. The hawk first takes one of your pups (poor Mailtime) and goes away for a little while. When she comes back, she proceeds to punch you, then comes around for another punch and so on. Eventually you get so groggy that your babies run off without you, and then the hawk picks you up and carries you off to its nest. There's a shot of your remaining pups walking off into the wilderness, crying, and then the credits roll (insert sobbing here). After the credits, the game then ends with a shot of the hawk carrying your body to its nest full of hungry baby birds. The end. Proceed to bawl even more.			"

												This game is truely adorable. It's also a rare gem among games. What I mean when I say that is that animal simulator games seem to be SO rare... Why is this?? Many people have played, play and love this game. Think about it for a while... Maybe there should be more games like this? I have to say I'm disappointed to find that Shelter is the only game on Steam that allows you to play a animal! Why is that? Do some people think that animals would make for a boring game? I must say I give this game 5 stars for beauty, cuteness, easy controls, etc. But yes. Please let there be many more games just like Shelter. Would horses, birds, wolves, any sort of animal be too hard to ask for in a game?Bravo, creators, bravo!However, I have ONE complaint. The game is far too short. And the ending is scripted, no way to pass it alive. It IS possible to pass with all 5 cubs however. Anyway, I'd love it if Might and Delight tried to make another game like this. I would defently get it!Thank you for reading this, I hope that it's inspiring to the creators AND everyone else.			"

												I'm usually the type of guy who is slower at completing a game than other people, but I managed to finish this in 1.5 hours.  No complain in regards to the length of this game; in fact, I find that the length of it is just adequate.  If the game is longer, I probably couldn't have finished it in one sitting, and that would destroy the whole experience of it. By the way, I think if anyone going to play this game, it's best to finish it in one sitting.  It's like you watch a whole movie, except it is better; because you are more involved in it, you are controlling the badger in the game, and you are more attached to it.So, this game is all about playing mother badger sheltering her cubs from harm.  And there really isn't any story or plot in this game, but it makes you think about the deeper things that you normally won't think about.  After I finished this game, I thought about it for a long time, even when I'm lying on bed.  I thought about the existence of these badger, the existence of myself, or just life in general. Nowadays, I've been playing and looking for games that's 'different' from others.  And I truly hope there are more games like this one.

												Awesome game about a mother badger protecting her young badgers from dangerous things.For me, the 1.5 hours story is a bit short for the price, but the fun and atmosphere in this game, is priceless. In the future, I could imagine a gamemode, where you need to survive as long as possible, with day / night, trying to get food, everyday new challenges. But that's just an idea.Short:If you don't mind playing a short 1.5 hours game. Feel free to get it. For me, it was worth it. Even if it was short.			"

												Let's get the essentials out of the way: a. Shelter is short. b. Shelter is not an open-world survival sim, or even, really, aiming to be a realistic survival sim at all, beyond the fact that you're keeping five badger kits alive for two hours. Or . . . trying to. Gameplay's pretty simple. Feed your babies. Don't let them get eaten, drowned, or set on fire. And that's it. But simple as it is, it's a game you can screw up, or a game that can screw you up. Helps that the babies and the landscape are both lovingly designed, and so you're all I must protect you babies, but this landscape wants to devour you and I can't just put you in a safe basket and drag you through the four or five levels, here. When the game's working best, it's anxiety-inducing to lose track of your kids. I had this one point where I thought I lost all of them, and I ended up running my badger around in circles in a broad simulation of aaaaaah. It's good for that. Keep in mind.			"

												Shelter is probably one of the most bring games ever conceived in the entire history of computer games, and that also includes consoles.Considering the game was released in 2013, when multi-GPU systems, with hundreds of GPU cores are relatively common, this games graphics are awful. It is something that would perhaps be nice in the 90's, in the era of the 3DFx Voodoo accelerators, but nowadays these graphics don't have any appeal. PLayability is close to nil: there is no hint of what must and should be done in the game. You start as a badger with its 4 cubs in a cave. So, what now? The game doesn't tip you anything. You might as well stay in the cave. Actually, due to some bug in the game, the badge can't even exit the cave.As other users have put it, Shelter is just a plain boring badger simulator, although watching your neighbour's grass grow is a lot more entertaining.I strongly advise you NOT to get this game. It is a shame how developers even wasted time and effort on a game like this.			"

												Nature is beautiful, nature is terrifying.Death is inevitable, but breeds life.Also, one of my babies was eaten by a Gru.I had a lot of fun in this game, despite being irritated by the unclear intentions for the grayed out cub in the beginning. The graphics are what they are, and I feel that's sufficient for this game. Music is nice and atmospheric, if a bit repetitive sometimes. I ended the game with two of five cubs surviving, one having been taken by the night, one drowning, and one deciding it wanted food more than avoiding the bird stalking it.A note on the ending. It surprised me in a good way. The whole time I was thinking to myself ""No! No! Gotta find some cover!""When I realized what was going on, it inspired my first sentences here. Those two lines sum up the entire game quite nicely.			"

												Very intense game. Watching as my first badger was snatched right before my eyes sunk my heart. You want to protect your badgers not through player rewards, but through the calls and behaviors of the pups. Seeing them get excited and start hopping around a carrot that they cannot get without your help makes you want to stop, go back, and get that carrot for them. They reward you with such nice squeaks. When they get scared or attacked, they release a heart piercing cry. The badger cubs are helpless without you. They know it, and try to stay by your side. Seeing that vulnerability brings out a powerful empathetic sense of duty to protect them. It makes it so devastating when you fail. Disappointingly short, but it gets it's whole story told without feeling rushed. Once the last act started, if felt like the final act. I was not surprised or confused by the end. It made sense and provided a sense of conclusion that was very appropriate.I've been playing many games over many years, but Shelter is the first time that I was so moved that I felt the need to post a review. I purchased this game because of the beautiful polygonal art and I loved the concept of being a badger mother hunting for food while protecting her cubs. Would have been pretty happy simply enjoying the distinct plot, but this emotional roller coaster stole the show.I'm forever impacted by Shelter's use of character sounds and behaviors to elicit rewards and punishments.

												I'm biased right from the start because I've always wanted some good wildlife-simulation games where you play as wild animals trying to survive nature.This one has a beautiful but simple style. My only complaint regarding the visuals is that I find the light pastel color scheme a little difficult to make out. This lack of contrast is difficult both because you might not be able to see little tunnels to dive into for cover, and because you tell which of your babies is hungry by them becoming paler. So, you kind of have to be able to tell the difference between ""already pale"" and ""a little more pale"".The controls are also fairly simple. The game does a pretty good job of informing you what controls perform what fucntion, but like many indie games, it leaves you to figure out when to use them. I kind of like this, because I find a lot fo games these days really hold my hand and don't let me experiment much.The main game is short and very linear, though it's not too short for me to feel emotionally attached to the pups ones. The difficulty is far from impossible, but just challenging enough. Despite the short length and simple gameplay, I keep coming back because I hope to eventually have a playthrough where all of my little ones survive.I think I'd give this about an 8.5/10. It was definitely worth playing, even at the regular $9.99 price. -1 for the low-contrast graphics, and -0.5 for the length.			"

The choice to emphasize on lighting and surreal, painted textures was a good one. It only immersed you more into this storybook setting, which was lighthearted and sweet at first but quickly became a world full of danger and hardship, though there was still beauty. Buy this game.

												I applaud a game for being different and not being scared to be niche. A badger and her offspring simulator isn't something for everyone's tastes, but if you are into wildlife (as I am) you will probably enjoy this.Pros:While the game is fairly linear, the levels are constructed in a way that most of them feel open enough that you don't notice.There is a good sense of tension of keeping you and your offspring alive against the odds of nature.Cons:The gamma in the opening level is way too brightThe torch light in the night level is highly distracting and unrealisticBadgers are nocturnal and this isn't reflected in the gameplayBadgers keen sense of smell isn't in the gameBadgers attacking foxes? Highly unlikely.Overall I liked it, but it has its issues, so I would give it a score of about 70%			"

												I'm not going to spend too much time describing this game because you should experience it yourself if you are going to play it. If I had to put it in two sentences though I'd say: ""Shelter is a game where you play as a badger in a forest where everyone and everything hates your species. Especially birds"".The game itself is actually very pretty! The artstyle they used was really interesting and it has a few great ""background shot"" moments. Soundtrack is pretty mesmerizing. Stuff you don't usually hear in video games. There are some problems with framerate and some pretty harsh pop-in. Pop-in is something I would never want to see in an ""experience game"" like this. It does a good job of pulling you out of the experience. Shelter is not a long game (1 hour if you don't rush through it) but I didn't feel like it should have been longer. It teaches you a thing or two about nature. For full price I can't recommend it but for heavily discounted price get it. You should look up some similiar ""experience"" type of games like Journey, Dear Esther and Stanley Parable and if you are not afraid of lack of gameplay then get on this. It's not the best of its kind but it's definitely not the worst either. If you have it backlogged get on it instead of reading this. It's definitely worth your time.			"

												Short but sweet. Some may scoff at the pricetag for 1h30m playtime, but overall, I was pleased with what I signed up for. The only really problem I have is that quite a few parts have rather irritating invisible walls, instead of designing the levels in ways that the player doesn't feel as compelled to push those boundaries. Either way, the intent was achieved, the game quickly succeeds in making you feel responsible for your younglings and most definitely creates an emotional bond towards the end. If that description tickles your fancy, I heavily recommend it. I'm eager for the sequel anyhow.			"

The gameplay works better than in the most AAA titles you can find on the market nowadays and the ambientmusic in the background works perfect and supports the action on the screen.Although it's short I think it's near a perfect game and if you think what you would get for this money from a AAA studio, then I would totally recommend Shelter and say it's worth every single cent.

												This a lovely, and potentially saddening game.  It is made me think of the trials and tribulations that a mother goes through.  I felt so terrible each time one of my cubs died, and felt awful when I had only one left.  Then felt like crushed as a hawk swooped my last cub away.  When the hawk returned and killed me, as I tried to sprinit for cover, then hobble, then crawl as it attacked me, I felt I deserved it.  Yet, in the end, the hawk was just feeding its' chicks.I really love the pro-Mother aspect of this game, and that the creators thank all mothers in the credits.

												I bought this game on impulse mainly based off the graphica appearance of it. Yes, it's not revolutionary or fancy, but it is a very pretty game in it's own simple, pastel-tinted way.For a game that just focuses on your protecting your little of badger cubs, I both enjoyed and suffered through it very much. It has very simple gameplay mechanics that work and the story isn't blown out of proportion in anyway. This is nature and this is life. You have to protect your babies or feel the sting of losing them, which I admittedly felt a few times after losing one or two cubs.It's short, yes, which is a shame, as I do really love the atmoshpher and the design, but it accomplishes what it set out to do.

												Honestly when I picked this up I wasn't expecting much from it, I kind of wrote it off as just another artsy eco-message game, but I figured I'd give it a shot for the sake of making a let's play video of it.Turns out I was in for more than I expected.The game really sucks you in. What I was planning on being just a ""Let's Play"" video turned into a full playthrough.It's engrossing. While I'm not a fan of the incredibly overdone gamma/brightness, and at times the textures they use are a bit over the top, the game is a solid bit of fun. You genuinely start to worry about your little babies (It helps they all have unique markings), and you don't want to see anything bad happen to them. (Though the environment is all too willing to shorten their lives.)Yes it's short (I finished it in a couple of hours), and the graphic style might be a bit much for some, but despite my preconceptions about the game, it got me to do something a lot of other games have not been able to do. It made me care.It was almost an emotional experience, and not one I'm going to forget anytime soon.If you want to try a break from the norm, this might have something for you.			"

												As a as a strict, hardcore indie gamer and as an indie developer myself, I really liked this game. The concept of playing as an animal is good enough, but caring for your adorable offspring is a fantastic idea and I wish I came up with it first. The mechanics work, and gameplay is usually varied. I got extremely attached to my cubs, even naming them (R.IP. O.J. Simpson, Sheriff Willins and Mailtime). I also really like the art style. It worked with the square issue that textured objects face to create a nice, homy quilt feel. And also the endgame. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't believe they ended the game like that. I cried my eyes out.     The one thing I didn't like about this game was that it was very linear. There were little opportunities for exploration and the objective seemed too clear. This might be a minor issue for some people, but I am not a big fan of linear games. Also, it is kinda short, which I don't mind too much, but I did pay $10 for this game. Shelter, however, makes up for this by controlling your emotions.     Other than that however, the mechanics work, the art style is nice and it plays with your emotions a lot. A LOT. Shelter is worth $10, and if you get it on sale, use the money you saved to buy tissues. I am very excited for Shelter 2, as in that one you play as bobcats, which probably means you won't get tracked down by that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hawk.

												I loved this game. It was short and sweet, and even though it had no dialogue or human emotions I ended up feeling really attached to my digital badger mother and pups. Totally recommend if you're into story-oriented games. Waiting for Shelter 2 to come out.			"

												The art style is really nice and the music is beautiful. This game had me feeling so protective over the little badgers that any sign of danger created suspense.. The slow-pace does make it easier to exit the game after a while of playing but I still enjoy it for shorter gaming sessions. Looking forward to playing Shelter 2 in August!7/10			"

												You play as a mother badger going through various environments while protecting your babies from various hazards and keeping them fed. If a baby dies, it is permadeath for it and you try to make it to the end. There is no actual purpose nor story, but the art style is very pretty. I bought it on sale and it was a fun little short experience.			"

												As a as a strict, hardcore indie gamer and as an indie developer myself, I really liked this game. The concept of playing as an animal is good enough, but caring for your adorable offspring is a fantastic idea and I wish I came up with it first. The mechanics work, and gameplay is usually varied. I got extremely attached to my cubs, even naming them (R.IP. O.J. Simpson, Sheriff Willins and Mailtime). I also really like the art style. It worked with the square issue that textured objects face to create a nice, homy quilt feel. And also the endgame. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't believe they ended the game like that. I cried my eyes out.     The one thing I didn't like about this game was that it was very linear. There were little opportunities for exploration and the objective seemed too clear. This might be a minor issue for some people, but I am not a big fan of linear games. Also, it is kinda short, which I don't mind too much, but I did pay $10 for this game. Shelter, however, makes up for this by controlling your emotions.     Other than that however, the mechanics work, the art style is nice and it plays with your emotions a lot. A LOT. Shelter is worth $10, and if you get it on sale, use the money you saved to buy tissues. I am very excited for Shelter 2, as in that one you play as bobcats, which probably means you won't get tracked down by that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hawk.

You start to care about your cubs and you'll do anything to save them. It's a really intense game at some parts.The problem I have with this game is lack of instructions.

												I am a male that is 6'8"" tall.I've no aspiration whatsoever to raise children; for ""an accident"" to happen is one of my greatest fears...I just completed one (of the apparent five) levels in Shelter. That was more tense than most gritty action games; every few seconds, I would panic and swing the camera around ""WHERE ARE MY BEHBEHZ??!?!?!?!?!!"" And that Pokémon at the'nd of the level, straight circlin', waitin for one of muh behbehz to be a little too slow... I had to quit the game right there. There's only so much strain my heart can take. The art-style... th-the art-style... oh my, the art-style... (although, I would appreciate some sort of contrast options, unless the colors are meant to look like - er let's see 'f'I can get the terminology correct - washed watercolor, i.e. not vivid at all, to the point that it makes me feel the need to tweak my TV's color settings - the colors themselves are very subdued - every one of the colors within the environments is so bright (as in mixed heavily with white) that yeah, it's a little... off(?)))I recommend this gameEDIT: 1.4 hrs to beat the game. I've read there are different endings. I made it to the end with 4 of my 5 chil'ren alive. Dat ending doe... Throughout the game, it was actually rare for me to be contemplative of the ways of Nature - the game is basically a walking simulator as a badger, in which you can pick up (rarely hunt) food and get to watch the scenery change (two (maybe three) different instances force you to respond to the environment in a different way - which might not be bad when considering the 5 levels, but still - not much to it, but that could be argued as a strength so IDK). Really, that's what I got from most of the game. The ending actually made a statement like I assume the whole game was meant to, though. It's a neat game - not sure if I'd call it ""good"" necessarily but I did like it and it is worth checking for something different. I wonder how much more complex Shelter 2 will be.			"

												This game isn't long; it took me 68 minutes to complete. I was really intrigued by the concept, and at first I just thought it was a bit funny. After a while I grew attached to my little baby badgers, and quickly learnt to keep them alive at all costs. When one died, it made me sad. The game is kinda sad all the way through. The ending was the most depressing thing ever. It might be coz I smoked a blunt half way through but I was really sad when it finished. It felt like my soul had been torn from my mortal frame. 10/10.			"

												One of your cubs is growing hungry, but you look ahead and see nothing but tall grass and weeds. It is only a matter of time before all of your kits are starving. You are their mother, their protector, their role model, and their lifeline. It is up to you to protect them from anything and everything nature can muster.Shelter is a game that will tug at your heart strings. You'll find yourself turning around to check on your little ones almost constantly. Are they hungry? Has one run off? Are they falling behind? Shelter will only take you 1-2 hours to finish; however, it is worth every penny if you invest yourself into it - only then will it become an amazing test of parenthood and a story that you'll not be able to forget.

												You play as a badger and you have five cubs, they all follow you wherever you go, they look to you to find them food and to keep them safe from dangers (which mostly is a big bird).Even though you know nothing of this badger mommy and her cubs, you do whatever you can to keep them safe. You get in to the role of being the mother and it's a great feeling when you escape danger with a really small margin.The soundtrack in the game is GREAT, it's relaxing and creates a great atmosphere throughout the game. The graphics style is also great, love the asthetics overall. It's very simple but beautiful.Overall, it was a good game. Could have been longer than 90 minutes (1½ hours), but then again, I got this game gifted to me... so I guess I shouldn't complain, huh?

												Shelter is a beautiful and charming game where you are a mother badger tasked with the responsibilities of taking care of your five pups. Some players may find this simulation too linear, but the structure allows for it to be divided into chapters which shake up the mainly slow-paced action. The game is beautiful, made up of pastel textures stitched onto the world which change with the acts and colour palettes. It is a heartwarming journey in which you are able to witness the growth of your pups as they grow in size and speed, but it leaves you with a gnawing sense of failure in the almost inevitable death of your pups due to hunger, predation or just nature itself. The ending is an ode to motherhood that leaves you with a sense of legacy, grief and hope. It's only around 2 hours long, so probably wait for a sale, but it's worth it.			"

												This is a spoilerfree review of an entire playthrough of the game.In Shelter you play as a mother-badger trying to protect her baby badgers while guiding them through one danger after another. Like really, staying in the beginning cave would have been a better idea but whatever. The question you have to ask yourself is this: Is that enough for you to care? The game doesnt give you more than ""these are your children you are the mother protect them"" as a reason to care. The artstyle is interesting I wouldn't say good nor bad. The problem with it is that your baby badgers really dont look cute. They squeak in a kind of cute way and that is as good as it gets. This leads to my first problem: I didnt give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about my baby badgers. Of course I fed them since really there is nothing else to do in this game other than feeding walking and hiding. THe badgers stupidity doesnt help either. Lost 2 badgers to their own stupidity and another one was just suddenly gone without an explanation. That left me with 2 that I still didnt care all to much about. Those 2 made it to the end at least. The gameplay itself is a stealth escort mission that manages to be more annoying than most because of food problems and badger stupidity.  The music did its job, nothing I would buy. THe best moment I had in this game was when I accidently activated a bug and did a 12 meter superjump onto a non-expecting fox.  FAZIT: If you dont get attached to the badgers this game is a rather boring walking siumlator with food and stealth elements. And Badgers.P.S: Perhaps honey badgers would have been more appropriate, they dont care about all the dangers because they dont need to.			"

												Very cool art style.  Hunt and scavenge for food to keep your cubs alive, guide them around dangerous obstacles and predators.The only negative point is that it's extremely short, 1-2 hours worth of gameplay.  The gameplay is admittedly very simple, but for the short time you're playing, it achieves what it needs to.Can't wait to see what this developer has in store next, hopefully the success of this game allows them to increase the scope of their next game.

												You play as a badger and you have five cubs, they all follow you wherever you go, they look to you to find them food and to keep them safe from dangers (which mostly is a big bird).Even though you know nothing of this badger mommy and her cubs, you do whatever you can to keep them safe. You get in to the role of being the mother and it's a great feeling when you escape danger with a really small margin.The soundtrack in the game is GREAT, it's relaxing and creates a great atmosphere throughout the game. The graphics style is also great, love the asthetics overall. It's very simple but beautiful.Overall, it was a good game. Could have been longer than 90 minutes (1½ hours), but then again, I got this game gifted to me... so I guess I shouldn't complain, huh? Anyway, I will buy the sequel whenever I have the oppurtunity to do so.			"

												pros: nice graphics, creative visuals and music. authentic audio of nature. cute badgers. every level requires a different surviving technique so it's never boring or repetitive. cons: mouse too sensitive. and there seems to be a glitch with sliding the scales when u try to adjust gaming volumes. personally it was enjoyable but if i have kids, i wouldn't recommend them to play this game. i wouldn't do any spoilers but you'll know what i mean after you've played through this game :'( but if you're a strong adult, knock yourself out and play!

												I want to say good things about this game but also go off on a giant rant of why I F'ing hate this game.Overall, I'd say this game is good if you're into this type of stuff. The arstyle is unique and it's relaxing in the parts that aren't stressful. The soundtrack is fitting. The game itself is incredibly simple; keep your babies alive (as many as you can) and follow the extremely linear path to the end of the game. It's no more than an hour long but the experience itself is something rather different. This was a very good game in my eyes despite the very short length and linear gameplay, though I wouldn't expect anything more considering how the game is.However, why I really, really hate this game is because of how ridiculously stressful it is. I don't know about anybody else but I'm a huge animal lover. I'm pretty sure my eyes teared up a bit when I lost one of my babies in the game and I had to go back (and cheat) to make sure that all of them stayed alive. Plus, the end of the game is SO, SO, SO FRUSTRATING. You go through the entire game trying to protect your babies and at the very end a hawk swoops down AS YOU ARE RUNNING TO THE FINISH LINE AND TAKES YOU UP INTO THE SKY TO IT'S NEST. And as you're flying up into the air in the hawk's clutching talons, you see your babies running off into the treeline without knowing if they will survive on their own or not. And if I recall correctly, the very end shows a hawk's nest with the mother badger (you) squealing in agony as it gets ripped apart by hungry baby eagles. I both F'ing love this game but F'ing hate it at the same time. But overall, I find it to be well done. Certainly a unique experience and an interesting game.			"

												While Shelter isn't a game as much as it is an interactive narrative, it nails just about every detail it could. Art style, atmosphere, and sound track all come together to create a great experience that really puts you in the shoes of an animal without turning it into a purely mechanical challenge.The game won't last long but it's very cheap during sales and definitely worth playing, especially if you're looking for something simple to enjoy just for an evening.

												Very interesting! Could be a little disturbing at times, because this games makes You feel very much empathic to Your characters. I loved the simplicity and style of graphics, the coloring was brilliant. The idea is simply beautiful, sometimes You are left on the edge of Your seat. It's not a very easy game to play and I'm not sure how younger kids could receive it, because of the dangers the animals approach. There are parts that are really scary for a sensitive person, but all in all- very original and I'm quite sure- a must try game to those who are looking for something more different than usual big tittle games. I would also recommend this game to anyone who have fear related psychological issues in life. I'm very much convinced that many games can help overcome some of the psychological stuff we face in life. This one really helped me cope with some of the fears I had. It's basically like a training ground for Your own inner survival as much as a way to understand a little bit more. Of course there's always a timing issue with these things, but at the right time games like these can make their point in a persons life.			"

												I'm not going to spend too much time describing this game because you should experience it yourself if you are going to play it. If I had to put it in two sentences though I'd say: ""Shelter is a game where you play as a badger in a forest where everyone and everything hates your species. Especially birds"".The game itself is actually very pretty! The artstyle they used was really interesting and it has a few great ""background shot"" moments. Soundtrack is pretty mesmerizing. Stuff you don't usually hear in video games. There are some problems with framerate and some pretty harsh pop-in. Pop-in is something I would never want to see in an ""experience game"" like this. It does a good job of pulling you out of the experience. Shelter is not a long game (1 hour if you don't rush through it) but I didn't feel like it should have been longer. It teaches you a thing or two about nature. For full price I can't recommend it but for heavily discounted price get it. You should look up some similiar ""experience"" type of games like Journey, Dear Esther and Stanley Parable and if you are not afraid of lack of gameplay then get on this. It's not the best of its kind but it's definitely not the worst either. If you have it backlogged get on it instead of reading this. It's definitely worth your time.			"

												It's said that the greatest despair that a parent can face in life is the loss of a child.Shelter is a small story that you play which mimics parental love and the sorrow of loss by making you take care of five young badgers (You're the mommy badger) who need to be fed and protected as you go across the dangerous wilderness through day or night.I've noticed you should always try to keep them more or less fed at the same level or else the one that's least fed doesn't grow as much and becomes slower, therefore your possibility of loss of that young one is higher.I've loved playing this little story/simulation for it actually makes you want to protect the little ones as if it is your responsability - and when you lose one, it actually hurts.It also has a very distinct and great look to the game, with various textures to give that abstract depth of the wild life, the soundtrack choices are great for each moment...All I can say is that I loved it. Now it's time for you to find out if you're able to feel the pain of a mother.			"

												Shelter is an intriguing concept the developer neglected to actually construct a game around.The mechanics are incredibly simple and never build in any way, such that any given minute of the game is virtually indistinguishable from any other minute. Go forward. Grab food. Occassionally go fast or go slow to avoid some hazard. There is no particular goal, no score kept, and no story, so there is no sense of progression or urgency.Your single goal is to keep the badger cubs alive, but they have no personality, no narrative surrounding them, and there is no penalty if they die, so there is no emotional connection to them: You won't really care if they die or not.I don't know how long the game is, because I didn't finish it, but however long it is, it's too long, because the game's charm wears off after about 15 minutes, and once the charm is gone, there is no reason to keep playing.

												Due to the Steam Sale, I wound up picking a few games to add to my collection. One of which being a short indie titled called ""Shelter"". You play as a mother badger guiding her 5 pups through the woods to find a new home. Why? Because your small den won't be big enough for 5 quickly growing badger babies.Along the way, you need to feed them, protect them from fox (which they will eat if you manage to kill one), keep them from the preying eyes of eagles, and from the dangers of wildfire and rushing rivers.I managed to make it through the first time without a loss of offspring, so all five happy little fat badger babies made it to their new home.The ending was special.A very artisticly styled game that you can spend about an hour on to finish the story.  It was like watching an old story book moving around and easy to find yourself narrating it as you pitter patter around on your little badger toes.The replayability isn't overall very high, although if you didn't manage to make it through the first time with all 5 babies, challenge yourself to.

												I'm into artsy visuals and gameplay, but this game didn't really satisfy me.It looks great, and the explanation of gameplay mechanics is well done, obviously with the principle ""Show, don't tell"" in mind. Also the general idea of playing badgers is cute.I barely got a chance to get emotionally attached to anything in this world. When my poor badger babies were stolen from me by nature's cruel hand, it didn't feel... sad? I was like ""Oh man. Damn. Oh well."". It happened quickly and cheaply every time that it did happen, and neither the badger lady I was playing nor its brethren seemed to care at all. Basically, next to the cute idea of being a badger and the cute visuals, the game gave me no reason to feel attached to anything, no emotional buildup and all. Which is admittedly hard to do, when your game is as short!I feel like the lesson this game was trying to teach me was ""Look how difficult it is to survive in this hostile and cruel world!"". And yeah, sure, that's true. And then what?Without any emotional impact, there's not too much to take away from this game. The ending was anticlimactic, the gameplay mechanics that were there were really uninteresting - food was absolutely everywhere and felt like it had no impact, hunting the three kinds of other animals there were felt unnecessary and difficult - and most of the little gameplay time I have on this game, I spent waiting for my slow as ♥♥♥♥ badger babies to follow me.And sure, subpar gameplay can be excused when your game gives you a great story or atmosphere that you can lose yourself in, but I absolutely didn't feel that here. Towards the end of the game, I was ready to accept the walking-simulator-esque if I found some redeeming quality in it. And then the game ended, and there was no redeeming quality left to find. Unsurprisingly, replayability is close to zero as well. Can't really be arsed to go back and find SOME cute detail that I missed the first time that would make this game worth it.All in all, I don't think it's worth your time or money. It's not a lot of money, and it's not a lot of time, but personally, I didn't find it fun, and I got nothing out of it, emotionally. You might. Maybe not. Probably not.			"

												Shelter is an experiment in what the medium of gaming can provide as an experience. It goes outside the mould of standard gaming conventions and instead chooses to tell a tale about a Badger mother who must look after her cubs while traversing vast distance in search of a new home. While the game is only about an hour long, it is one of those games that any game connoisseur should not miss out on.If you are only into games for the pointless grinding and getting as many hours out of a single game and exposure as you can until the value of that experience essentially approaches zero, this game is not for you. If you enjoy seeing the breadth and scope of the medium, and enjoy playing a large variety of games, this one is worth a look. Overall this game is a welcome venture into a way of play that should be expanded upon in the future to fully reach it's potential.			"

												a really short game, though a heartwarming one.I could tell that I was really starting to care about the baby badgers just like what a mother would, especially when one of them was taken by the darkness in the evening stage. The sad thing is, just like in reality, there is no save and load option and it would never come back. :(Was really enjoying feeding them and watching them grow into the size of mother badger, satisfaction filled up easily just by successfully getting them a fox for the dinner, As for the last stage before the eagle's strike, I kinda sensed that something's gonna happen because of the vast plateau in front of me, nowhere else to hide and sooner or later the babies are going to starve to death if I dont proceed.But what I really like about the game is that at the end the game shows the eagle took the mother badger back to feed its children, a what seems like sheer evil has resolved into a equally motherlike character, just like our protagonist badger.

												It started to me like: ""What the ♥♥♥♥ is this game?!""I found it boring, meaningless, lacking so many things...But then, firstly the awesome soundtrack - kind of a sad and beautiful blues - started to put me on a certain mood. After that, the graphic art seems to found out his place, in addition to a growing concern about the ""children"" and some cruel things you must to do in order to keep them fed. And that's it... i can't say anymore without spoil.Shelter is a beautiful ode to nature and motherhood. You can give it to your own children if you have some, and show them some simple and important lessons about nature. It's a short (like 2 hours), different game, which will certainly add one more experience for those who are seeking for new things.			"

												I wanted to give it a positive review but I really can't. This game offers you an unique experience to be a badger mother and take care of 5 cubs while you pass few maps with predators lurking around. The actual game mode was okay, but I must say however the developer team didn't have as much budgets, if a majority of players actually have to go on the forum discussions just to check how and what to do in the very first 5 mins of the game, it is a bad sign. You should at least give people some sort of instructions, maybe an arrow pointing at the food on the ground (since really, the texture and color choices were horrible, it was so hard to make out the stuff to the eyes), not to mention the dumb precision of having to drop the food at the exact angle/spot. And don't even make me start on nurture mode. I was on Day--I think, 23 or 24? I have been repeating the same things over and over again for nearly a month and there was literally nothing that could tell me about when these cubs will leave or how this mode will end. You just don't expect people to mindlessly do this for everyday or two days without a sense of direction or time goal in mind. This tells you there was a serious lack of thinking in terms of developing and test-playing it in the players' perspective prior to the release. Anddd the result is pretty disastrous. I don't even want to touch this game when it's night/dark raining time in nurture mode, I just kept crashing into walls in the cave or kept getting lost in the map because it was wayyy too difficult to identify the surroundings. (Mind you, there is no map to show you your location or path) To be fair though, the real game mode's ending was quite a surprise and I could see it had somewhat educational purpose, which was good. But the more I play nurture mode, the more I think the developers could have done way better than that. I would have to give some consideration whether I should try out Shelter 2 or not in the future, but for now, I just completely lost any desire to do it. For people who want to try out this game, wait for a good sale maybe, and take my words: don't waste your time to dwell on nurture mode much. It's not worth it.			"

The graphics certainly are unique and beautiful, yet I did not enjoy this game at all because of the dreadful gameplay and would not recommend it, unless you are solely playing it for the visuals.The premise of the game that you are a mother badger trying to feed your offspring and protect it from hazards sounds promising, but I found the gameplay to be an utter disappointment. The threat of death did not feel urgent and thus playing the game felt more like a walking simulator without any fascinating gameplay elements or comments. Despite the linearity, I found it often confusing where I was actually supposed to go, as the visuals are fuzzy in that regard, that you have to find your way through trial and error to get to the next level. I also didn't really feel emotionally invested in this game, which is what it relies mainly on.Absolutely not worth the asking price.			"

												Well i saw the game and wanted it so i got it... but no just cant recomend this game 8.99 euro is way to much for the game its to short adn gets boring fast.I get that the game is about apreciating the art work and everything but just no if it was 1 euro i would recomend it.So the game is about you being a Mom Badger that has to protect your children aswell feed them. This is the part that really made me want the game.The game is interesting and gives you different challenges which is nice and the art work is well a bit edgy but still nice however what makes not recomend this game is the price point aswell that the game is so short and its actually trying to drag itself out. The world is pretty empty you are the predetor hunting frogs, foxes and rats. while there is a predetor far superior to you... the eagle. They could have added rabbits, bears maybe even hunters to make it more interesting and have more content but no.So the game is way to empty and to short for me to recomend it at that price point, there are far better indie games for that price as well cheaperYou can go out and play Free Games that a browser based that got way more content and will take more time to complete compared to this.

												Right so i have been utterly dying to play Shelter 2 for ages as it looks awesome, but i am far too tight to pay the full price so i have been waiting for it to go on sale. It hasn't yet, but this one did today and while i am not as interested in Badgers as a Lynx, i coughed up the money and bought it.And i actually regret it....It wasn't a bad game by any means, it was just not a lot of game for my money, even at half price. There is very little in the way of a tutorial and the beginning of the game was rather confusing, as half the time it doesn't tell you what to do. But i started with five lovely cubs- after eventually figuring out that i had to feed one of them at the start to carry on in the game. And to start with it's a nice game. Feeding five cubs is actually rather demanding and i searched for food all the time. Though catching the Foxes is really hard. I only caught one and i never caught a frog at all. xD And keeping your cubs safe from the evil birds and wolves was quite fun and challenging, on my first play through.  I lost four and only managed to get one to the end. :( And the ending, wow. Not what i was expecting at all and personally i don't like it. But for £3 something this game doesn't have a lot in it and for full price it's certainly not worth it.1) You pretty much just walk in a predetermined direction, while picking up food and feeding your cubs, while trying (and failing) to avoid getting them killed.2) And there are only 5 levels, which took me just over an hour to get through and that's with replaying the last one.3) It does have some replay value, as i will try and get all five cubs to the end, but once i have done that, it will probably just sit in my library gathering dust.Which is unfortunate really, as this game could be much more. There are not nearly enough animal simulation games out there. So in the end, it's not a bad game and i was rather gutted when i lost each one of my cubs, it's just not much of a game and i would therefore sorta recommend it, but only at half price or more preferably. (I will put not recommended though, as i just think it's too expensive for what it is.)			"

When danger comes around, you put them as a priorty and you must keep them fed. You find youself constantly checking if all you cubs are still with you (I even gave them all names :3 ). The eviroment changes around 5 times from Autumn rain to Frosty winter to predator filled night-time!  Different but really nicely designed graphics and the soundtracks are amazing.

												This game was really stupid in that the game is cruelly hard, and then what do you get?  Eaten.  The game is ment to be ""deep and meaningful"" but I find it a game of badgers being eaten by falcons. When you first start playing it looks cool (badgers running wild). But then the game gets all tense and sad. The music dosen't help ether. If this game was: you survive instead of: protect the babies and you could run around the forest like a sandbox, the game would have been really good. But the game, as it is, is terrible.Note: I am a 10 year old and this game really upset me.			"

For me it was too grindy, I felt like all I was doing was running around collecting food. There was no progression other than the environment I was collecting the food in. I played the game for about one hour before I couldn't be bothered anymore, I realize that's not long enough to give it a solid review, but I felt like I'd experienced just as much of the game after my first 20 minutes as I had after a short hour. If you are the kind of player that can really immerse yourself in the game and feel a strong connection to your cubs, and like to grind, this might be a game for you. However, this wasn't my cup of tea and from my experience of it I can't recommend it with a clear conscience.			"

												This game is incredibly slow, especially in the 2nd level, where you can't run.Everything inside each of the levels looks basically the same, so it's very easy to get lost, the levels are pretty big, and there is no way to know that you are backtracking, so because of that i accidentally managed to come back to the very beginning of the level from almost the very end. In the 2nd lvl, where i couldn't run... The only reason i finished it at all is because i left one of my cubs to starve, and then started running. yay. waste of time.Also, you can't save, so you cannot quit mid-level without having to replay it all over.

												It's such a nice idea and so aesthetically pleasing, but the reality of playing it is just frustration. Because there's no UI in the name of immersion, you're constantly left wondering what it is the game wants you to do. For example, at the very beginning, you're in a cave with four live pups and one I assumed to be dead. I wandered around the cave and kept trying to exit but repeatedly hit an invisible wall, utterly confused as to what I was supposed to be doing. Eventually I figured out you're supposed to feet a plant to this ""dead"" pup to revive it. This would have been far more obvious if they had just given the pup a breathing animation or if it had made pathetic whining noises or something, making it obvious it was in fact alive. The tutorial is mysteriously patchy and explains little. Certain commands are never introduced in the tutorial, like the bark and the crouch. You have to turn to internet forums to get an explanation as to what they do, or even that they exist. During the nighttime section, the dash command mysteriously disappears for no apparent reason, only to reappear at odd times that seem to have to do with a predator? I lost two pups during this section and I don't even understand what I was supposed to do. What's really boggling is that there are little visual tutorials for other tasks, but not for this section, so you're left completely unsure of what you're supposed to do or what even happened. Maybe this was supposed to be for mood, but it just made me annoyed at the game.Another frustration is the lack of cursor - doubtless done for immersion, but it causes endless frustration when you're trying to target pups to feed. I ended up picking up and dropping food four or five times each time before I managed to feed the pup I intended to. The umpteenth time you have failed to target something, it gets annoying.And the most grating thing of all was the constant blocking of the camera by the background elements. Is transparency that hard to implement?It's a really nice and atmospheric idea that was ruined by frustrating mechanics. I couldn't get into the game because I felt like I just spent the whole time trying to figure out what the stupid game wanted me to do as I dropped turnips over and over. An hour in, I had lost 3/5 pups and realized I wanted the other two to just die so I could stop dealing with them. At this point, I quit. The frustration of the mechanics prevents you from getting attached to the pups at all, which is seemingly the point, here.			"

												Interesting and unique game about paper mache creatures eating eachother in the wild. The game has an enticing environment but as a game it is quite dull. Although it is a touching story spoken with actions, it is a short experience. This would be better lived as an animation or even series than a few hour $10 experience. 61/100			"

												I have never played anything quite like Shelter.  Visually stunning, and emotionally resonant, this is one of the most memorable games I've played in quite a while.  It's the sort of game you have to experience for yourself to truly appreciate.Throughout the gorgeous landcapes, death is everywhere.  Your cubs don't have the experience you do; all they know is that you, their mother, will protect them.  But you are just a speck in the vast outdoors, and nature doesn't care about your pitiful pleas for mercy.This game is what indie games are all about (for me). Totally breaks the mold of what a traditional game should be about, look like, or play like. It's certainly not for everyone, but everyone should still play it. Such a beautiful, artistic gem. I enjoyed this game immensely.			"

												Well, it's......uh... a very simple game actually. I liked in the beginning because I thought I could walk around... it has an interesting art style, though the gamma levels are too much. But most of the game is too linear and scripted for me to want to replay any part, and the controls feel clunky. It's not really fun or deep or that interesting. I dislike the ending, and it's a really really short game. They should have worked on this way more before releasing.Also I've been a badger mother before and this doesn't quite do it justiceEdit: there is also a ""nurture mode"" which I thought could be an alternative to some of the game's flaws... but no. You have to play it everyday (!!! this is a ridiculous mechanic), I was on day 5, then missed 2 days... suddenly it said ""day 15"" and all my babies were dead. Game over. There is no freedom, no way out of the game's restrictions, instead of relaxing or reflective it felt pointless and frustrating.			"

												I tried to like this game. I really did. But I think it's really terrible. The gameplay mechanics are minimal, you are mostly just playing four-legged walking/running simulator. The art style is garish and incredible desaturated to the point where I can't tell what the heck is going on. It was painstakingly slow waiting for my little badger to run to the next area. There was one point where it seemed clear I needed to run into a little cave but the game forced my badger to turn around and not go in. No explanation. I hate that kind of crap in games. This game doesn't respect my time at all. I know it's trying to be all artsy and get across some kind of emotional message, but for me I was so annoyed with the bad gameplay there was no chance to make any sort of connection. It is a cute idea, and the little badgers are cute, but this just seems like lazy and terrible execution on that idea. I'm sad because I can tell a lot of people love this game, but I just don't get it. Sorry!			"

Posted: December 26, 2013
												When I first heard of this game, I thought it'd be in line with pretty much all the other ""survival"" games out there: hunt food, avoid stuff you can't kill, and above all, STAY ALIVE. But boy was I ever wrong... I've never, never ONCE, been one to scorn people (read: game developers) for taking a different approach than the ""standard average"", but I think it's time to break that streak now. This game had an interesting concept, but it completely failed to deliver on pretty much every single point possible (and some I didn't even think it WAS possible to fail at, too!)First, we've got the issue of the controls. They're simple enough, sure... but you don't really have any actual CONTROL over things. Least of all your rather rëtarded little cubs. They run around rampantly, stealing food from their starving siblings, and of course, at the worst of times, they follow their dear mother, i.e. the player. For me, this ended with two being killed by predators, and a third to die by starvation (though not in that order exactly).Then, we've got the rather extreme issue of orientation. There's absolutely no way to know where you're supposed to go, what you're supposed to do, or hell, even what you're NOT supposed to do. There's nothing worth mentioning in terms of a tutorial, so once you've started playing, you're pretty much left completely clueless as to what to do and when, in order to keep your mentally underdeveloped offspring alive.Next up, we've got the horrifying graphics. I appreciate funky visuals, don't get me wrong, as I focking LOVED Child of Eden for it's colourful style, and I'm a HUGE fan of the pleasantly vibrant style that Bastion has. Aquaria made me have an eyegasm from its gorgeous graphics. But Shelter? It failed to deliver even a nudge, when I expected a whammy. The colours were so horribly watered out and pale that it was a tremendously underwhelming experience, seeing the game itself, and the brightness was so horrifyingly high that even if I'd completely RUIN my monitor's settings just for this game's sake, it STILL wouldn't be worth it.Following up the last one, we've got that ""emotionally instigating sound"" the developers are boasting so proudly of. Maybe I've been spoiled with such intense soundtracks as the original Lord of the Rings trilogy's OST, or hell, even the TRON: Legacy music, both of which were awe-inspiring to say the least, but Shelter's sound and music just felt jagged, stale and unstimulating.And last but not least, an issue among games I've been able to cope with since the dawn of my gaming life at the tender age of three... LENGTH. I found Beyond Good & Evil to be pleasantly bite-sized, and basically every CoD-game ever made to be decently lengthy, considering how they've essentially been 99% MP-oriented since installment #4, but Shelter was so infuriatingly short that I didn't feel satisfied at all. Granted, I didn't pay even half the game's, ahem... ""actual value"" (*mock-cough* BÜLLSHÏT!) since I bought it during the 2013 christmas sale, but even for the low price of 2,24€ it felt lacking and mind-numbingly short. Honestly, I was mad at whatever shïtheads that anally excreted Blue Shift for making such a horrifyingly short game, but you know what? Whoever you guys are, I forgive you. At least you TRIED. At least you provided MORE than a single hour's worth of ""gameplay"". Maybe not by much... but at least you TRIED. Shelter, however, is originally priced at a whopping 14€ for barely more than an hour's worth of gaming, which is even MORE than what you'll give for games such as Shadow Complex, Castle Crashers or hell, even Magicka, all of which provide (by comparison) infinite amounts of replayability and content.All in all, Shelter was without a doubt the biggest gaming blunder of not just 2013, but probably the whole decade. I've seen some bad games out there, like Big Rigs or Nation Red, but most of the games that are bad are that way 'cause of bugs, glitches, imbalanced gameplay, but with Shelter, the fault isn't with the game itself. It's that the developers (a pox on you all) didn't even TRY to deliver anything more than an interactive motion picture at such a ridiculously overdone price that it makes the BluRay copies of Ghibli-flicks seem ""fair"".I give this game the lowest rating I've ever given any game ever, and hopefully, it'll remain the ONLY game I'll ever review that I'll give this low of a score to as well... 0.0/10			"

												The last few sentences of this review containts SPOILERS. I think this game needs some reworking.-At first you are not told what to do and why you cant leave the start point. You either need to have some clearvoiant ability or use google for solution.-There is far to less graphic settings. You cannot adjust nothin. Gamma is WAY to high for this game, i ended up using my LCD monitor settings to reduces the unpleasent look. Ican get use to washed out colors, but I dont want to be annoyed the moment i start to play the game.-Grahipcs style in general is quite uniqe but the textures could be less annoying if they were less dapled and patchy.-Lack of save game feature- You cant sprint during night wchich is very weird since badgers are nocturnal animals-Why it rains blood in level 3?-Little badgers that were my companions at the beginning just started to disapear i dont know why. In level 4 i had no companion at all. I dont know why it happened and where did they go-I dont know what is the purpose of this game. You just run through 5 or 6 six levels for less than an hour just to be eaten by a bird and then... credits. I mean, what?!I had high hopes for this game but im disapointed. I cannot recomend.			"

												While I did enjoy the story and the graphics were very very interesting and amazing (in their own artistic way)... there wasn't much to the game.  It felt a bit misleading to what the game would be about.... which really is walking through enviroments trying to keep your babies alive... only to be met with your own fate at the end... yeah.. spoiler... but you might as well know it now before buying this game.I did enjoy it... and would recommend people to play it, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything more than Free to Play (or when it's on sale... as it is as of this review).There's just about 0 replayability to the game, and while that's not /terrible/ .... it certainly isn't worth very much to buy a game that takes, for me, just over an hour to play, only to be met with nothing different on another iteration of the game.  I commend the developers, ten-fold, for the game, as it really does have a high sense of artistic creativity stuffed in such a quick game, but must ask that in future updates, possibly have more of a RND aspect to the events therein.  At least some new aspects or areas... or expand the game a littlle more than it's at.Otherwise... there's 0 gripes about this fabulous work of artistry!			"

												Brilliant but short. A simple survival game with a unique concept, can play through the whole game in an hour, though on my first playthrough all but one of my cubs died, so perhaps taking ones time would result in more badgers surviving. I found it to be quite an emotional experience, and though it was only about an hour of my time I found moments of it devastating. While 10 dollars feels fine to me (A movie ticket) some might find it steep for a game that can be beaten in under an hour. I would still recommend it with the caveat that you wishlist it and grab it on sale.			"

												A short game where all you do is run around, feed your pups, and sometimes avoid a giant bird from grabbing you. If you like artistic games you'll more than likely love the graphic style and environments. If you're expecting something artistic AND fun, you mind end up a little disappointed.			"

AUDIOAtmosphericVISUALArtsyDIFFICULTYEasyVIBEEyecandyCRAVINGExperimentalON SALEFrequentlyPROS: The crumpley paper-mache look throughout the whole game is very beautiful. The colors in this game are superb and transition well. It is a very emotive experience.CONS: Often, it's poorly conveyed as to what you're to do or where you're to go. Gaming has come up with very small touches like artistic highlighting or proper camera use to push the player in the right direction while avoiding damages to the aesthetic, but Shelter utilizes few of them. The game also happens upon severe crashes for both me and my friend. Reinstallation did not help for either of us.WORTH: This game goes on sale very frequently, almost monthly. I couldn't get it to work, but being able to get it and try it out for only $1.50 USD is a great price. Steam has also implemented refunds since this review was written, so you can get your money back if you have similar trouble!OVERALL: I want to be able to finish this game, but have been unable to because of the constant crashing. My friend whom I had bought this for is on a completely different system and is dealing with similar crashes. These seem to be problems only some are dealing with. I'm NOT warning you against purchasing this game since not many people are dealing with this, only informing you of my experience.SCORE: 4/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												I bought this game because the premise was simple and from the video, the style was very neat - in a sense that it was interesting. It is, by far, 'neat'. While the game is fun, I had to change the controls to something more.. easily accessable. It took a little bit to figure out what to do, since it just throws you into the game. First, I gotta say I love the models for the badgers and foxes. They're widdle and adorable. The noises and music are really nice, too. The second level gives you the 'creepy mood' without being over powering.The textures are very... messy. Tiling textures can be a pain, but looking at textures sloppily added onto the objects is also a pain - on the eyes. The textures are nice, but since nothing seems to tile, it just looks like a big, unfinished mess to me. The grass patches are obvious squares that go in alternating directions. It wouldn't take too long to easily make the textures they have tile, becuase they are already quite simple; full ambient, no shading. It is unique in it's own little style, though. You quicky get over it and enjoy the game. I think at first I just found it rather jarring.  I think my biggest pet peeve is the sky at night. Would it really be so hard to add glowing dots rather than what they have?? It looked like the cieling to a children's bedroom.The camera seems to get weird during some places, and it doesn't matter if it's close up or far away. Sometimes it just... does a weird 'thing'. Turns itself around? Suddenly too sensitive? It's hard to explain, but it's super prominent in the second level, which was hard to explore. The levels aren't linear - which is usually a good thing - but I find it easy to get lost, only being able to know where I've been from the holes of wild growing.. turnips? I thought they were potted plants, at first. Hehe.Anyway. The game is simple; maybe too simple. It's still fun, and I feel really bad for losing 2 cubs on the second level! If the textures tiled nicely, and didn't look like they were done in 10 minutes, this would be an awesome little game. It's easy to get attatched to your cubs once you figure out what you have to do, which can take a while to notice. From a distance, the environments are kinda pretty~ 10$ is actually quite a lot considering, so I'm glad I got it for $2.50.			"

And far too dark to have the baby hawklings eating the mother alive, I'm not into that crap. 2/10 Art was pretty but I cried into my pillow for an hour.

												An interesting experiment is what I would call this game, but overall it fails to provide a reason to pay $10 (at the time of this review without discount). The game places you in the feet of a mother badger who must direct her cubs through different perils until they reach shelter. These perils consist of starvation, hawks, fire, water rapids, and unessen creatures of the night.The gameplay consists of guiding your badgers and trying to keep them fed by finding various food around the world, or by hunting down live animals like frogs or rats. Most of the time though the game is a giant escort mission where you make sure your badgerlings aren't carried off by a hawk or rapid by stealthily running from cover to cover and hoping your children follow.The game is also very short consisting of 6 or so levels which only round out about an hour of gameplay. There is a little replayability but it is possible to lose children along the way and continue the game, so reaching the end with all 5 children intact could extend your time with the game if you so wanted.The graphics look a bit like papercraft which gives the game a very unique style and can produce some beautiful scenery. Sometimes though there is a sort of white wash that is very noticibly placed over everything which really hurts the vibrant aspect of the world.With all of this said I can not recommend this game			"

												At the very beginning of the game you are not allowed to leave the burrow until feeding the ""starving baby"" that looks like a rock, but the tutorial on what to do in-game doesn't show up until after you can leave the burrow. Thirty seconds into the game and I already had to visit the forums in order to figure out what to do.I lost four out of five babies in story mode without any explaination given at all.  I didn't lose them to the eagle, and I didn't lose them when we got hit by a wave; they were just suddenly gone and never came back.I tried nurture mode, but once again had to visit the forum because there's no in-game explaination that this mode is partially based in real time.  On day one, apparently all that can be done is bring two apples back to the burrow.  In order to do more, I need to come back another real life day, which seems unlikely at this point.I like the art, and the slow pace could have been a nice change, but in the end I can't help but feel that nothing I did in the last hour mattered much at all.

												Game has an interesting artistic feel to it which makes it somewhat refreshing. The game play; however; doesn’t give the player much of an opportunity to create an emotional attachment to the characters, perhaps due to shortness of the story. I would probably recommend on special and only if you plan to spend the money for about one-two hours of gameplay.			"

												honestly didnt like anything about this game. it started off pretty well, and i started to care for my babies. the first loss was pretty sad. but it happened so quick and i didnt really get how at first. the mechanics are pretty simple (almost nonexistant) but after I lost another one where i didnt think i could do much a lost interest. so I ended up only having one left after losses at points i didnt know wtf it wanted me to about it, and i honestly let the last one die just because i wanted to see if it would let me lose all of them (i thought it sould have died earlier, but i guess it was just very forgiving). and then the ending, which i wont spoil, went against it's own rules. the way the game worked before didnt work this time. i wont say anything about its deep meaning, since i dont think i got most of it with no babies.Also frame rate drops for me were terrible, and this game has no excuse for that, it has a nice artstyle, but is very basic texture wise			"

												Pointless walking simulator. So basically this game is just wandering around doing absolutely nothing except feeding your cubs, dodging a bird, and walking around. It looked pretty good in the trailers, but it's actually just plain boring. I bought this thinking it was a game where you can explore wherever you want, but you're actually on a set path. This game is barely worth the $2 I payed for it on sale, and you'd have to be crazy to pay $10 for it. One of the reasons I purchased Shelter was because of how nice the graphics looked, but once I started playing, I realized they weren't as good as they seemed. You can barely read the title screen because everything blends in with the background. Everything is really lightly colored. Nothing looks very realistic, and everything is made out of shapes. This game is not worth buying. Maybe it would be if it looked truly realistic, you could jump, fall off ledges, etc. I honestly don't know why this recieves so many good reviews. People say the game brings them to tears. People say the game is cute. People say the game is fun. They're wrong. If you want a good game for $10, go buy Undertale, it's so much better.			"

												Shelter is a great game with unique graphics, gameplay, and sounds. You take the roll of a mother badger fighting to keep your  young alive and to overcome many obstacles. It may be short, but it is a very entertaining game to play and a great experiance to go with it. The best time to buy it would to be on a sale, since it is a tad overpriced. The game soundtrack is absolutly awesome, as it keeps is mostly mellow mellow, unless there is danger. Besides the wildernes challenges, there is also the hard challenge of keeping your pups alive, which can be hard. Overall it is a great game, the only problem I had was when it lagged horribly during the night. I would reccemend this to my friends, especially on a sale though when it is cheaper.			"

In Shelter you get to experience the wild as a mother badger sheltering her cubs from harm. On their journey they get stalked by a bird of prey, encounter perils of the night, river rapids crossings, big forest fires and the looming threat of death by starvation. Food is to be found, but is there enough for everyone? You will learn that the cubs need food not just to survive, but to enable them overcome the varying challenges they will face as they make their way through the world. The question in the end is who will survive to live another day?  - Recommended!			"

												This is a game where you play as a mother badger. As the mother badger you have to try to protect your cubs from the dangers of the wilderness. You basically try to keep all of your cubs alive if you can and have to feed and nurture them. You may face dangers as in the wild such as a fox here and there and a hawk. Since this game is only about 60 minutes long I recommend getting it at a heavily discounted price. I do recommend this game since it can be relaxing and that I got it for under a dollar. This game does lack content to be worth the 10 dollar price even with the new game mode added. If you see this for cheap pick it up and sit there for the 60 minutes to see what you think. -Esikimo			"

												Shelter, or as I like to call it ""The Badger Game"" is a potentially PTSD-invoking first person badger game. You play the part of a single mother badger, desperately trying to lead your helpless badgerlings to safety. Not only do you have to feed the little guys, but you must navagate perils such as swooping raptors and road-kill hungry carnivores with a penchant for badger flesh. At least - I think there are cars eventually, but I don't *actually* have first hand experience with them so they may not actually exists. If they *do* actually exist the drivers may or may not actually intend to hit and/or kill the critters. I can't with a good conscious recommend this game because of the psychological trauma that I endured after one of my baby badgers, Two Stripes, was swooped up and carried off by an eagle within twenty minutes of starting the game. I found myself falling into a swirling pit of despair, shouting ""MY BABY! MY BABY!"" It was all for naught, Two Stripes was lost forever. I have yet to resume the game.Or, if you want to support an indie game about badgers, go for it. In fact, go for it. "

												Not a bad game, but too little content for that price tag. If you buy this in 50+% discount, maybe.I liked the ""story"".

If you create a badger simulation, where you constantly travel through forest half a meter above ground at most, you must not block the view every time there is a tree. foliage or a boulder between you and the badger. This game does that, and even worse. Often your view is actually inside the rock, tree or bush. You can either zoom in as much as you can to the badger, have zero outlook but not blocked your view much, or zoom out, have great outlook, but blocked your view 50% of the time. I believe camera is really the reason why not recommend this game, that's how bad it is. So sad. ""Fortunately"" the game is not long (an hour), so you'll not suffer for long.			"

												Do you like playing games on a laptop out in the sun? Then you'll love this game. Through the miracle of bad art design, this game will make you feel just like it even when playing in a dark room! This game also manages to both annoy me for the lack of tutorials and annoy me for exesive use of tutorials. You start off in a burrow as a badger where you can walk around with your badger-kids following you. As you explore you'll find some rocks, some sort of beetroot and an exit with an invisible wall. After reading a walkthroug i found out that one of the rocks is actually one of your hungry badger-kids. This was so obvious that the developers decided to not include any hint or tutorial. After that is done the invisible wall is suddenly gone when you try to exit once again. As you walk throgh the narrow passage, your camera will clip through much of the terrain and hanging roots. When you finally get out of the contrastless booring darkness, what should have been a cool contrast between the darkness of the cave and the refreshing light cast by the sun, is instead more grey eye-straining fullbright. You are immediately taunted buy several tutorials saying: - ""Oh you were smart enough to get out of the cave? Better remind you that you should gather food with the use key!"" and - ""This tree has a bright red apple in it. It's really easy to see as all the other colors are grey. Any idiot could probably realize that you can sprint into it so that the apple falls down, but we are going to spoil that for you anyway.""After that there is more gathering of food through a forest closed on both sides. How hungry are the badger-kids? There is so much food that you don't really have the time to find out because you'll soon lose any interest in the game. Im sure there's more beyond that point, but it was too long until the next step so I just stopped after a while. 1/10, overpraised linear casual game with interesting art style, destroyed by it's horrible low contrast and high brightness setting.

												Overall, I loved it.Reason for the downvote? The price.I got this game on sale for .64 cents, and at that price the game is totally worth it. It has a solid one hour of gameplay, but that's it. The game is really over after one hour of 'story'.The highest I would buy this for is maybe $3, but $10? Nah.I would love to see more, like different animals or in game features, but as it currently stands it's not worth the full pricetag.Definitely get this when it goes on sale for a stressful/fun hour of being a mother badger taking care of its babies.

												This is a game where you play as a mother badger. As the mother badger you have to try to protect your cubs from the dangers of the wilderness. You basically try to keep all of your cubs alive if you can and have to feed and nurture them. You may face dangers as in the wild such as a fox here and there and a hawk. Since this game is only about 60 minutes long I recommend getting it at a heavily discounted price. I do recommend this game since it can be relaxing and that I got it for under a dollar. This game does lack content to be worth the 10 dollar price even with the new game mode added. If you see this for cheap pick it up and sit there for the 60 minutes to see what you think. -Esikimo			"

												Hmm, who would have thought something like this could work out so well? A game about a mother badger feeding and protecting her cubs from the dangerous wildnerness that constantly keeps you on your toes.The game consists of 5 levels, each one with a unique theme, the first being a sort of calmer, introductory level to teach players the mechanics of the game (feeding, hunting and hiding), quickly moving on to the scary Night time, an hostile environment that easily scares the cubs, having them running into the predator's den. Then, you'll deal with a rainny day, traversing through overflowing rivers that might just drown you if you're not careful, after that leading to a Fiery forest, trying to keep the flames at bay. All this while trying not to be caught by an eagle, the ""antagonist"" of this game (or is it?), concluding everything in the last level, a constant hide and seek between the two species.This was an unexpected game, with a unique graphic style, and very beautifully done! The game brings a feeling of persistent consequence everytime a cub is lost, since there is no going back after one has been killed. As a result, you're constantly on your toes, and, despite its limited length, it's totally worth the time and money. There's the possibility of multiple playthroughs, trying to save as many cubs as possible.Overall a very positive experience, which I'll go through at least once again to see how different it is after a good grasp of the  ways of surviving. I'd advise anyone looking for something different to play it.			"

												It was very easy to find food, but the sense of loss and danger keep you on your toes.  The game pulls at you emotionally, but unfortunately fails to expound very much upon the mechanics it establishes. For instance, none of my cubs ever became hungry enough to fall sick which could have added the challenge of leaving a cub behind and keeping the others safe while trying to find food. Although the game begins with a sick cub, this idea is not once revisited.Overall, the game is wonderfully made and thoughtfully put together. I definitely recommend playing this, but I wish the ideas were a little more fleshed out.  I don't know if I can say that the $10 price isn't worth it, but the game's 1hr length definitely brings it under question.			"

Because heck, it's beautiful, it's nice, but way too short and way too confusing.There are tons of reviews of what's good about this game already, and I am gonna say I loved playing it. But the ending was sooooo confusing for someone who doesn't watch thru credits, so I thought I did something wrong. Then there were dangers for the babs that I wasn't aware of in a level, and these 2 of these ♥♥♥♥ers went and died while I was ??? with the ♥♥♥♥ing up controls. And then the other level with the water where you aren't quite sure what to do, and you just try winging it, only to loose another child, because you have no idea why they just died. So yeah, I mean it's a really good idea, a good game, but too short and it doesn't tell you jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can't believe I had to look up a guide for the first minute of the game. (So buy it when the price is reduced)			"

												There has always been a discussion if video games are actually art.Till August the 28th of the year 2013.This game proves that a game is not only entertainment, it can also be a beautiful metaphor...As soon as your first baby badgers die, you´ll instantly notice this game is about loss and tragedy. And while you progress in the game you cant deny that this is an accurate depiction of playing the support role in League of Legends. Once you realised, you´ll truly understand what it means to play support in all its glamour.Anyway this game took me 56 minutes to finish so I was still able to get a refund.			"

												Shelter is an amazing game.You play as a mother badger, tasked with feeding and protecting your five cubs, as you travel the world filled with rich atmosphere. A lot of your time is spent running around, locating or reaching food, and avoiding dangers not for yourself but for your vulnerable pups. The only real defense you have against the natural predators that stalk your pups is stealth, size, and determination. You WILL lose one of your babies, and you will be forced to move on immediately for the sake of the rest of your pups.This game has a lot of atmosphere and beauty to it. The type of game that you play for the experience. Sometimes it can be slow, or tedious, and at times it can also feel like a linear path which can take away from the world that is built around you. But it's far too easy to become immersed, to name your individual pups only to realize that your favorte one had gotten swept away by a bird of prey or by the powerful river. The repetition of survival feels present with each life.For anyone that enjoys an immersive, beautiful-looking and beautiful-sounding game, Shelter is for you. If you happen to also enjoy a dash of nature and is fascinated by the cruel challenges of wildlife, then this game delivers.However, if you need a game to have stimulating and exciting gameplay, and do not care for the idea of animal-sim games, then take extra consideration before purchasing this game. I will say that, for it's humble price, it has plenty to offer right off the bat.			"

												A simple yet fun game that took around 100 minutes to complete. The game is very linear, with each part having a challenge you must survive to get to the next area. Part of the fun was figuring out how to succeed with the limited instructions give. Also, don't expect the newest Battlefield in terms of graphics, which can be a bit repetitive. Your animals are cute and you definitely form a bond with them.I would reccommend to casual gamers looking for a light, yet heart pounding at times, journy. Word of advice, don't take risks durring the rapids! I lost poor little Jimmy and Arthur there...			"

												Shelter is a unique little game where you play as a female badger who must protect her offspring as they journey with her throughout the game's world, which consists of forests, mountains and rivers. You must feed your babies regularly or else they will starve - there are plenty of food items around the world, which is useful, however during more intense moments you'll need to make sure that your offspring aren't going hungry as you spend your time trying to reach a safer area.Dangers in the world come from other animals such as hawks as well as factors in the environment such as rushing water. These provide the player with a lot of challenge, especially if they want to keep all of their babies alive. Whilst the babies are cute, their AI isn't perfect, and on several life or death situations I've had them prance around a turnip instead of following me to safety. There are also a few glitches with falling fruit, where it falls on top of a baby badger, it will cause the baby to freeze up. This can be solved easily however.The music and environments are very beautifully-designed, and look like they've just come out of a book. I did encounter a few FPS drops, however, which seemed strange as I have a very powerful PC. The game's soundtrack is also wonderful, and it will also change in composition depending on what action is unfolding on screen, which is very effective, especially during the more tense parts of the game.My main gripes Shelter are probably the mentioned issues, along with the game itself which is a tad on the short side. However, there is also a nurture mode which I've not played yet, which has a much longer replay value and is a sort of tamagotchi-like mode where you must feed your offspring every real-life day.Overall, I think Shelter is a great little game, and a good example of a unique game concept that works well.

												A survival game about a mother badger trying to keep her cubs alive while wandering through the forest. Many dangers lay ahead, including evil birds, wild rivers and starvation. Being a badger is not all sunshines and rainbows, I can tell you that.The graphics in 'Shelter' are not bad and original but personally I thought they were a little on the bright side. The gameplay is mostly about running and hiding from other creatures and make sure your cubs make it aswell. You can give your cubs food you find but that's about it. Sometimes when you've been running from danger you'll notice one (or more) of your cubs is missing. In my opinion this part could be a little more dramatic, which may be unrealistic but personally I did not really feel bad for getting them killed. Overall Shelter is an OK and short game. It's not bad but to me it felt like it could be way more than it is now.			"

												NOTE: I actually do recommend this game, if you're a fan of SHORT, indie, minimalist games. I value my experience at about $1, and I wouldn't recommend paying more than that. I finished the game in just under an hour.Shelter was short so I'll try to be too. You're a parent badger and you need to get your 5 cubs to safety. You will forage for food and avoid predators and other dangers along the way. How many babies can you get to the finish? Shelter has a low-poly minimalist style, and I think this is a detriment to the game. What is food doing? Does it help? How much? How urgent is it versus rushing past everything? The game didn't communicate this. The game occurs over 4 medium-ish sized levels.With so little to talk about, because there's so little to the game, I was expecting more emotion in the experience, and it didn't really do it for me. Moral of the story: Nature is harsh, so pump out those babies, everyone!			"

												Time for an honest review.I saw Shelter 2 coming out, and saw this for cheap and went ""Heck yeah, I want that!""This game is nothing like the name, nor Shelter 2 would imply. There is no shelter. You do not return to a shelter every night (or day, if you're a nocturnal animal). You never do anything but walk and grab food for most of the game. Your cubs don't get hungry, food just makes them ever-so-slightly bigger every time they eat. Okay, you might think, hey, at least you can forage where you want. Nope. This is not an open world game. This is a ""follow the tiny corridors"" and ""find where the developer wants me to go"" game while picking up random fruit along the way. This is a platformer collect-the-coins but with no jumping... or platforms.Then you get to areas with eagles hunting you, dashing between cover, and that is fun the first time! It is repetitive afterward. Then you hit water streams that FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER either periodically send waves killing your babies, OR, randomly send waves if you stand on the water too long. With ZERO warning and ZERO instruction, you lose your babies. This just in: Rivers don't have gigantic waves. It's not the ocean.I was down to 2 of my 5 cubs by the end of the game and every single one that died was from some complete B.S. like a cub getting stuck, or not having enough time to cross a stream.The fact the game disables the ""run"" ability all the time, including the intro, makes it feel like it's preaching at you even though you it never says a word the whole time. It's like it forces you to bask in how much pride the developers take in their game. The game has good traits. But the problems I mentioned basically sap the fun back out and leaves you wondering... ""What that it?"" I applaud these guys for doing what they did. But you basically have to REALLY REALLY be wishing for this exact type of game to enjoy it, and if you expected different from the videos, well... you'll be disappointed.Lastly, replayability... there is none. There's nothing to do once you beat the game except try it all over again but without any of the surprises you had.			"

												Shelter is kind of a walking simulator for badgers. The player needs to guide the baby badgers through various locations - finding food and avoiding dangers. I'm not a fan of the stylized graphics or the gameplay. I only went partway into the 2nd level and I just couldn't take it anymore because I was bored. I don't understand all of the positive reviews, but I'm in the minority here so maybe I'm just missing something. In any case, I don't recommend it but a lot of other people do.			"

												68 minutes. Lost 2 guys, none of which I knew why or how (1 in the dark apparently, because they got randomly spooked and they scattered and 1 must have been out of sight too long, and the other to the bird, while I had no indicator on the ground where it even was...eh).   Anyway, I would not recommend the game for full price. Maybe 1-2 bucks. It's just too short. It's got no real replay value. The tutorial and the HUD itself are vague as in in ""almost not present"". The 360 controller is now supported, although you can neither rebind those buttons nor does the tutorial show them...they only show the keyboard commands.The game itself is fairly short as you've probably guessed now. Your missions is to guide 5 baby badgers to safety. Great that the game starts you off with ""saving"" 1 of your guys from starving...without telling you that a) he is starving (could also be dead for all I know) or b) how to save him (which brings us to c) where to find food and d) how to get said food and feed it to your young). I've worked it out eventually. You will, too, but it's unnecessary, especially since the game will show you how to gather food AFTER you have already had to do it. Bloody stupid. So, your guys need to stay well fed...apparently the greyer they get the hungrier they are. Apart from that you can also hunt some animals, though not necessary...you can be a vegan in this game and you have to brave some dangers, one of them the frequently returning and annoying hawk, the rest being the night (a whole level), fire (another level) and water (again, another level). All of those require ducking and running basically.   The game really isn't all that difficult, but you can't save. It's supposed to make you care for your young, but I found that rather hard. Meh, it's an ""interesting"" game and it deserves credit for what it does and its art style. It is NOT a bad game, it just isn't worth a lot of money in my opinion.			"

More boring than church as a child with your single mother and sister at 7am surrounded by crippled, hunched, octogenarians wheezing some 470 year old verse about wheat, sneering at you for not yet drowning in the throes of senility.The artstyle is a novelty that fails to carry or excuse the repetitive drone of the music, the sickeningly pathetic AI of your children, the shocking pathing of both your cubs and the supposed 'fodder' frogs foxes rats etc. which are utterly inconsequential and you don't need because there's ♥♥♥♥ing turnips everywhere, and by far the awful, AWFUL linear, and when I mean linear.. Draw a ♥♥♥♥ing line on your table, see that line - THAT'S THE GAME, linear playstyle. Pitifully short, actually not emotional at all, despite what you may expect as a result of the 7 year old girls who's fathers are trying to get them into gaming or explain the cold brutality of life, who have played this game and comment 'AWWWWW BUH SUH CUTE AND SAD' because the stupidity of your cubs is only matched by the impossibly infuriating implacability of your relentless, pathetically programmed, enemies ie, THAT INESCAPABLE ♥♥♥♥ING EAGLE.. Swear the next ♥♥♥♥ing bird I see I'm gonna KILL IT.. and by the time I finished with one ravenous, gimp brained ♥♥♥♥wit of a badgerbaby I couldn't care less about the 'beyond ridiculous' fashion in which I had lost the others. Don't waste your money, even on sale.. This worthless, laughable ♥♥♥♥ing mistake isn't worth $1Have yet to play the sequel.. If it's the same unimaginative, confining, agitating waste of time..

												Without spoiling the game, (I'll do that later) let's just say you are forced to do something you work really hard to prevent.  Then BAM!  That moment really sucked!   I don't really recommend the game just for that one forced event alone...  BUT, the biggest pain is having to constantly worry about getting food for your freakishly hungry cubs!!!  That is the whole game!  Digging up roots and bumping trees with your head to get apples to drop.  Once I got to kill a rat to feed one of my cubs.  Boring game!!!  Again, I don't recommend this game...  Maybe I should have played it longer, but that one forced event made me depressed!!!(SPOILER ALERT!) Dev's... You should really have made the game so you could save all the cubs...  You should not have to leave one behind to die of starvation!  Lame move!  And what's up with having to constantly feed them!  Not realistic at all!  Bummer.

												I didn't like it.  The concept is sort of interesting but the gameplay is really slow and tedious.It's simplistic conceptually, though quite challenging in parts, but the gameplay is so bad that I could probably never muster the will to replay it in order to protect the lives of all of my cubs.  Fortunately I got it on sale so I barely spent any money on it.Some people seem to like it but I'd have a really hard time recommending this one.  If the premise seems interesting just get Shelter 2.			"

												Without spoiling the game, (I'll do that later) let's just say you are forced to do something you work really hard to prevent.  Then BAM!  That moment really sucked!   I don't really recommend the game just for that one forced event alone...  BUT, the biggest pain is having to constantly worry about getting food for your freakishly hungry cubs!!!  That is the whole game!  Digging up roots and bumping trees with your head to get apples to drop.  Once I got to kill a rat to feed one of my cubs.  Boring game!!!  Again, I don't recommend this game...  Maybe I should have played it longer, but that one forced event made me depressed!!!(SPOILER ALERT!) Dev's... You should really have made the game so you could save all the cubs...  You should not have to leave one behind to die of starvation!  Lame move!  And what's up with having to constantly feed them!  Not realistic at all!  Bummer.  I was looking forward to this game being fun, not depressing and at times frustrating…Here are my system specifications: Apple iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8, Journaled HFS+ Extended file system.

												Shelter is a beutifull game, but is it a game you want to play ? In Shelter you play as a Mother Badger to get baby badgers to get some food, but when something happens it becomes a fight for survival. So how is Shelter ? Its a pretty good game. This game is pretty simple all you do is walk around and try to protect youre baby badgers from the lurking dangers. Its a really simple game it couldnt get more simple then Shelter. Now the art style is the most beutifull youll see this year it really delivers an amazing art style that will leave you breathless. The game is pretty short only an hour long but thats not neccesaseraly a bad thing its pretty much the right lenght for this kinda game. Overall you have an amazing game with a fantastic art style, simple gameplay. The only kinda problem i found in this game is sometimes there are texture pop in's and the baby badger might get themselfs killed when they dont follow you. Overall i give this game an 8/10			"

												It's hard for me to dislike any video game. ACtually I'm not sure there even is one I dislike? however I must say that  I played this game for about 20 minutes, and there is no option to save. When I went back to it, I had to start again, and the first run through was so zzzzz that I didn't actually want to play again. Well... to be fair, nothing happens unless you like pressing left mouse button to make your badger squeak a bit. oh and the baby ones squeak back at you too afterwards which is so rewarding if you like squeaking badgers. Other than squeaking and picking up strange fruit which look like origami from Heavy Rains child killer, you spend most of your time walking your badger. It is fun for a whole 2.4 seconds and then it gets a bit tedious. Imagine having sex with your mothers sofa. (not based on experience) so really if you like squeaking, walking badger simulations, this is your game, just be prepared for loading it up a 2nd time, and all the walking you did, may need to be redone. I wish there was a car or something so I could have run myself over, maybe there was, but I never got that far before falling asleep n headbutting my glass of milk...			"

												Every turn has a new suprise, what I thought was a straight forward walk through the forest and glade, turned into a educational look into the real life of badgers. Now you probably still think it doesn't sound very interesting but I only played 20 minutes so far and I'm itching to play more, I thought I was playing as an innocent but I was so wrong, I thought I was playing the predator but I was wrong; the world is a scary place.

												I really, really wanted to love this game. But alas, I actually hated my entire experience with it...I went straight in to ""New Game"" and had no clue about controls or what to do. It took a good ten minutes - inclusive of a YouTube play-through viewing - to realise the controls. Already I am disliking the amount of time and effort just to get out of my blasted cave...Atop this is the appaling camera. I am aware that this is an independent game and that ""auto"" camera is unlikely, but the manual nature of it is extremely irritating, given my constant (every few seconds, perhaps ten or fifteen seconds if I have been walking in a straight line for some time) need to adjust it. If you turn around, you will need to move the camera. If there is an object or scenery item near you, you will need to move the camera. It is that simple.Then there are the action controls. They are simple enough! One key to do some sort of action such as removing a plant from the ground or giving something to your babies. However, it almost never seems to blooming work! In particular, I was never able to interact with a fruit tree to make it drop its fruit for my babies, which means they will probably die of hunger soon... Alas, a wonderful concept, beautiful art and world, relaxing and immersive soundtrack... but let-down by OBYSMAL controls!.. I am hoping that the sequel will have better controls...			"

												Great game. I really like the progression of the main character ""Walter White"" and watching his relationship fail with his wife ""Skyler White."" Unfortunately the child in this game ""Walter Jr."" Does not really have much character devlopment other than eating breakfast but I did enjoy what appeared to be the comic relief ""Jessie Pinkman"" and his decent into depression and drug addiction. When first introduced to this character I was not expecting such a dark story line. Overall, fantastic writing. I cannot wait for the sequel ""Better Call Saul"" about the seedy layer character ""Saul Goodman"" where I believe you get to play as a lynx.			"

												TRUE GEMLet me start form the end. It was long time since I cried and even longer since I cried because of PC game well I think I can without shame say that Shelter made me reset this counter. I expect nice little game with badgers and it is that indeed. BUT  on top of that (perhaps like bonus) I get bucket of emotions and emotional knock out on the end.Let's get to the game as it is. First that will hit you is graphic is unusual but very lovely in same time. You play as mother badger starting in your den with 5 little cubs and one of those need your help straight away as it is weak of starvation, So you get it food or leave it behind your choice. Following is long journey for you and your litter as you take them from the den and on way to safety of mountains where they can learn what it mean to be badger. On your long and tiresome journey you will encounter many obstacles like dark and wolves, hunting eagle (or hawk i cant really tell), crossing creek during heavy rain and at last (not least) the forest fire.But then your journey is finished and safety of mountain forest is front of you there is only last meadow to cross and last Eagle/hawk to avoid so you move on and......What happen then I will not tell to avoid spoilers I only say this, after all the stress and fright of loosing my cubs what happened tear down the last wall and I sat there 5 minutes in tears. When someone make game that can pull you in so much that it slowly scrubbing away all those invisible walls you build so you can deal with everyday♥♥♥♥♥♥of world out there THAT game is definitely deserve space on your HD.I am giving this 10/10 things that will make you feel like you are there and badgers this is game for you.

												Experience the wild as a mother badger sheltering her cubs from harm. On their journey they get stalked by a bird of prey, encounter perils of the night, river rapids crossings, big forest fires and the looming threat of death by starvation.Food is to be found, but is there enough for everyone? You will learn that the cubs need food not just to survive, but to enable them overcome the varying challenges they will face as they make their way through the world.Are you ready for a truly different adventure, something that might evoke feelings you've never felt in a game before? In the wild, all living creatures are put to the test. The question in the end is who will survive to live another day?Retro Family have once again composed a beautiful soundtrack to an original and graphically innovative setting in a world of nature where shelter is your only hope and survival your only goal.

Funny game...The lack of gamepad support (mine wasn't recognized (XBOX360 Wireless) was a a little disappointing. The sound was okay. Sometimes it reminded me a little of the Diablo 1 Soundtrack, but in the end it isn't the same. Really not a bad game. Feeding the kids creates a little attachment.

												Low poly games tend to have something special: the lack of high detailed graphics is filled with hard work in other features. That’s the case of Shelter.As it can be seen in the trailer, the main carácter is mother badger. She’s in charge of her five puppies (a strong, mature, independent mother indeed). Our task will be to lead and protect them from the dangers of the forest.The gameplay itself doesn’t shine much: charge into a tree to make its fruits fall to feed the puppies, hunt a little fox for meat, cross a river in a rainy day… Everything in order to protect the cute badgers. Althought i just said the mechanics are not spectacular, they have a much deeper purpouse: to make you realize how fragile your babies are. They are curious, fearful, and all they have to survive is you. Through this journey you will discover how savage the nature can become. Shelter itself is quite short for the full Price, but on sales is very worth. It’s a nice choice for those players who like to disconnect from every other game than relies on shooting and running all the time.Just a last tip that will help you in Shelter:Don’t name your babies. Just. Don’t.Because i miss Johny.			"

No matter how hard the mother tried, she couldn't save them from themselves.  Each was so stupid in their own right. Eggplant wouldn't eat, Spikey would eat too much, Donut couldn't keep up, Sideburns scared easily, and Leafy loved birds.  One by one, each of them fell.  Leafy stopped to look at an eagle, which then picked him up and dropped him onto a rock.  Spikey was so hungry he went full cannibal and ate Leafy's corpse.  This, of course, scared Sideburns, and he ran off into a river which swept him away never to be seen again.  The smart ones that were left ran with their mother, who tried her best to protect them.  Donut, fell victim to his own fatassness and died to a fox that was trailing them.  Eggplant, the last of them all, died of a broken heart and an empty stomach; for he missed his siblings and couldn't live without them.  The mother, with no purpose left, made it to her final destination, curled up into a ball, and died.liek if u cri erytiem			"

												Do I recommend this game? Yes definitely.First of all I love indie games like this, the tear jerking, different art style type games. I think this comes in just behind Dear Esther, and thats one of my favourite games of this genre.After a while you do get attached to these little badger pups and when I lost my first one to that stupid eagle... lets just say now I hate eagles. It is so hard to keep everyone alive and thats what happens in reality and I think this game has captured that perfectly. Although also like most games of this genre I dont think there is much replay value there, and I did get bored after a while, I still think Shelter ranks up there with other tear jerker indie titles.10/10 from me			"

												This is definitely a unique game. It is very short compared to most, but understandably so.The art style is wonderful and suits the game perfectly. To me, it has more of an interactive movie feel than anything else. The story is free roam, but you are guided down wide pathways that you get to explore as you go making it also very linear. It's ending is unexpected, and gives Shelter a nice full circle finish.I’d say get this game on sale for about the cost of a movie and enjoy this nice little badger ride.After playing this one, I’ll definitely be giving Shelter 2 a go when it comes out, too.

												Wow that ending... just.. wow.Like many others I had the food stuck in my mouth bug. I was screaming at the computer, yelling at my mummy badger to drop the food to feed the baby badger. She didn't, I lost him. I had the intense lag during the night stage. It was somewhat manageable, but during certain sections I really felt it. (When you play, you'll understand which sections I mean)Yet, even with the bugs, it was an amazing game. I did not connect with my babies alot, but it was gut-wrenching to see them die to my mistake, and they are ADORABLE. Helps that I picked it up cheap.. not sure its worth the $9.99 price tag otherwise, though I have yet to try Nurture mode. So do take this with a pinch of salt. All in all, good game =)			"

												4/5 of my babies survived, and that's also how I'd rate this game. It's got cute, unique art and gameplay. Despite the visual simplicity it is a bit buggy still and things occaionally flashed neon green and purple for me which killed my immersion. The game itself was easy to pick up and fun. It's the shortest game I've ever played though, and the ending especially left me feeling more defeated than accomplished. So not very satisfying. Still, it's a breath of fresh air compared to all the hack 'n slash rpgs out there, and a good game to play in honor of springtime. I definitely suggest it, but due to its length I wouldn't pay full price.			"

												This is absolutely a lovely little game. You play as a badger and you're sole purpose is to make sure your five cubs stay alive. Keep the fed and out of danger.One of the reviews have said that ""this game brings out the mother in you"" and, at least for me, it did. I was paranoid, terrified and overjoyed playing this and I warmly recommend it. It is not hardcore survival, but it's really good at bringing you happy warm fuzzy feeling. ...and paranoid terror.Few hints, you need to feed the fifth cub before you can exit the burrow, and the game autosaves at the beginning of every chapter. There is no save function.			"

												This is an incredibly short, but beautiful game. The colours are pale and chalky and the music and sounds are soft and relaxing. The art style of this game and cute and inspiring and the storyline is simple and realistic. There are no goals or missions so you have to use your instincts to figure out what to do, which I really like. It tells you what to do with simple graphics but doesn’t have too much information or text to distract you from the feeling this game give you.The controls are simple are you feel a strong bond with your young. Even though the game is very relaxing it can still cause your heart to skip a beat when your babies are in danger. There are many challenges to get past such as a mother eagle, creatures hidden in the shadows, a rapid, and a forest fire.In each level you have to check on your cubs to see if any of them are hungry and when you find food you have to choose which one to feed it to as you have to share to keep them all full and happy.Even though this game I very short, it’s not a game that you only really want to play the once. This game is so nice that you’ll want to come back for more and maybe keep on trying until you reach the end without losing any of your babies (a personal goal of mine I have yet to reach).When watching the trailer I was hesitant about buying it as it looked too challenging and not really my kind of game however I am so glad that I DID buy it, as it has now become one of my favourite games.	This game is simple enough so that children can play too (although not too young, as some parts are hard to get around).If there is one thing that I don’t particularly like about this game is the ending (which I won’t spoil) however I don’t think that it needs to be changed, just made less confusing as it made me wonder whether I did it wrong or not.In conclusion this game is perfect for anyone who wants something to pass the time, or enjoys a nice, relaxing, and sometimes challenging game.9.5/10 "

Personally, I got it on sale and I loved it for 3 bucks. It's a different kind of survival game. You're not looking out for yourself as much as you're looking out for your badger pups. Really puts some interesting and different feelings into it. I've read lots of reviews where people have said they've cried during this game. It's not your run of the mill survival game.			"

												Shelter is a beautiful game depicting the life of a mother badger. I love the art style, but the text is often unreadable (fortunately only menu text is important). It only has partial controller support (you need a mouse to use the menus and the control tips are for keyboard and mouse). It's a short and interesting story told entirely through actions.Technically it's entirely an escort mission with stealth elements, but Might & Delight manage to use the escort format to connect you to your pups and make you regret their demise.I completed the main story and took a stab at the ""nurture"" mode (under extras) and wasn't interested enough to grab more than one turnip. I didn't see enough there to make fetch quests fun, but I didn't really give it a chance. Maybe later.			"

												Very cute game that plays strongly with the player's emotions. The objective of the game is to play the role of a badger mother tending to her cubs. You feed the cubs while progressing through the world and the various 'stages' and protecting them from hazard. Losing a cub leaves a feeling of loss and a failure as a badger mother.It's very tempting to speed through the game. This is a game that's meant to be enjoyed in moderation, for the sights and the overall feeling of attachment to the cubs. The scenery is beautiful, but a bit too bright/washed out. It gives it a consistent, calming, pastel colored, albeit polygonal world. If you do try the game, do try to stop and enjoy the surroundings. Highlights of the game include stage 2 (starry night/mother's light), feeling of loss upon losing a badger cub, and a well executed ending.It's a very short game, and a bit debatable as to whether 10$ is really the correct price point for it. The nurture mode is apparently modelled after a Tamagotchi style game and looks promising: if returning to the game daily to feed your cubs apples that you knock off from trees with your head and radishes you pluck from the ground is your thing.This isn't a Modern Warfare game. It's not meant to be graphically intensive, it doesn't have guns, and it's not overly realistic in the department of European Badger diets. It's not meant to be Badger Simulator 2013, though some would be eager to call it that. If the description above doesn't appeal to you, then don't bother.It's a casual, experimental game that's meant to be cute. You want to try this game if you're looking for something unique and are inclined to cute, casual games and prone to the emotional aspect.I love this game, but in all honesty, I might be biased... just a bit.

After that I realised my relaxing stroll was actually turning into tense, sad fight for survival and well-being of my beloved cubs.The game is basically see how long you can survive the dark and scary real world of a badger mum and her cubs. The ending of the one game I played had a great twist.The animation and art was great. Different, but who said that was a bad thing? It's very interesting.

												ART&MUSIC: The artistic quality of the game was one of my favorite aspects. The color remained vivd throughout, creating a different atmosphere than most. The rain had to be one of my favorites as red was everywhere (not the typical blue), and the music that matched -- abosultely stunning. CHARACTERS: Well, they are badgers. There's not much to them, but you certainly get attached. GAMEPLAY: I never ran into any problems...well, I did get lost a few times. However, that really made the game for me. Panicking, wondering where the 'mother' is supposed to go to next to get away from danger just added to the quality of the game. 8/10: It's short. I want to play through again and take the time to really make the badgers grow, but again it's REALLY short. What broke the game for me was the end result. Given that the game has such a 'dropoff' ending I would still recommend it for the music, art, and concept that it has to offer. Definitely can't wait for the second! "

There's also nature, and as we all know nature's a ♥♥♥♥♥. It's a good game if you like experimental indie games then pick this up.(Also the art style is awesome)Happy badgering!			"

												The moment you are constantly turning your camera around to check on your pups: you'll know Shelter has reached its goal. Shelter is a thrilling, upsetting, and sadly short, journey about a mother badger taking care of her young. The game clearly puts a lot of thought into the life of being a parent, and it really pulls it off for the player. During my first playthrough of Shelter i lost one pup; although close to the end of the level, i ran back trying to find him/her and i felt awful. I could not find him/her or simply load a save: I had lost one of my children. Shelter immerses the player into the role of a parent amazingly well and it only drives you in deeper as you constantly feed and nurture your children in order for them to stay alive. I am surprised this title has not won an indie game award for its immersive atmosphere and beautiful environment; but nevertheless, it is still a treat: award or no award. If you're looking for an immersive atmosphere and a huge focus on captivating the player, then buy Shelter.			"

												A simple game baced around protecting 5 baby badgers that you lead around the forest and away from harm. For 5 AI that could potential screw up a game, they  follow your every comand, I've never encounterd a problem with them, litteraly flawless. They even sit down and wait there turn to be fed, if you give them 2 or 3 seconds go get oriented. All of the levels vary heavily so its never like your looking or playing the same thing, each level has a different challenge as well. The art style works in the games favor as well, even a net book could run it and looks great. The controls are easy to get used to and never put you at an unfair disadvantage. Easily the best part of the game is you feel bad when you let one of your cubs get out of sight or die. I felt my heart drop every time an of them died or even got out of my sight, there is a real drive to see them all live throughout the adventure. At the time of this review the game is only $2.50 and honestly its more than worth it. the adventures thrilling, the asthetics are nice and at the end you feel happy yet sad. Give shelter a try.			"

												Pointless, cruel, badly implemented game. [SPOILER ALERT]: your character unavoidably dies at the end in a cruel way. It is also extremely difficult to play without killing some badgers: seeing cute cubs being drowned, burned in a forest fire, taken by an eagle while crying hopelessy for help, dying of hunger, etc. is amusing? Really?Graphics is very basic and primitive.Often one can walk through trees, rocks, etc. Art? for me it is simplistic, primitive design. No game save (auto saves levels). Yes, static screen shots look nice, but the game is bearly playable, and feels like something designed many, many years ago. Very disappointing. Not sure who it was aimed at - possibly children you want to punish with nightmares.			"

												I just about threw up rainbows while playing it. Seriously though, this game is pretty great and worth the price. The graphics are of an interesting style, but smooth and beautiful. You really feel for the adorable fuzzballs that are your babies in the dame, and when something happens you are heartbroken. It was a little on the short side, but a satisfying playthrough nonetheless.Also, Shelter 2 will be coming in the fall. It will be even better than Shelter 1. These games are a great investment.			"

												Shelter is an interesting and meditative experience.The art direction is superb, though the choice of the overly bright color ramp is a bit disappointing, as I feel the graphics would be so much better if the colors were more rich. However, I believe the intent is to mimic the feel of cut construction paper, which follows the general art direction.Sound and music are superb. The environment feels alive and popualted at all times. The musical cues are used to great effect to emphsize mood and provide backdrop, though they're honestly not needed and turning the music off does not make the game feel empty at all. That is incredibly rare.The core gameplay concept is very simple: Shephard and feed your younglings. However, Nature is cruel and uncaring. The game is pretty brutal, and each time I lost one of my young I actually protested aloud. You will build a connection if you allow yourself the immersion.Brilliant little game, highly recommended.			"

												This is absolutely a lovely little game. You play as a badger and you're sole purpose is to make sure your five cubs stay alive. Keep the fed and out of danger.One of the reviews have said that ""this game brings out the mother in you"" and, at least for me, it did. I was paranoid, terrified and overjoyed playing this and I warmly recommend it. It is not hardcore survival, but it's really good at bringing you happy warm fuzzy feeling. ...and paranoid terror.Few hints, you need to feed the fifth cub before you can exit the burrow, and the game autosaves at the beginning of every chapter. There is no save function.			"

												Shelter was a game I had been reading about for a while and kind of forgot about. However, upon rediscovering it, buying it and playing it, I found that it offers a very unique experience not found anywhere else! You play as a mother badger trying to escort her young along the paths of growing up and maturing to the point of taking care of themselves. You will escort them away from hungry flying owls, wolves in the night, forest fires and even huge waves of water trying to sweep them away! I found myself caring too much for those little guys. And you'll also find that the ending is completely bitter sweet. Definitely worth your time.			"

												Fun to play in it's own right. Comparing it to too many other games will not favour this one although as the actual game is fairly short (around 2 hours). Depending on what kind of person you are, however, those 2 hours can be a rather gripping experience. Protecting helpless badger babies from predators, storms or wildfire for a few hours is very fun and very engrossing.If you're the kind of person who likes Watership Down or Don Bluth films, get this game. They've also added a semi-sandbox mode which takes some inspiration from the tamagootchi toys of the 90s.			"

												Shelter is a survival game where you control a mother badger whose task is to take care of her cubs, feed them, and lead them to safety while protecting them from predators and other various threats. It's a short (~90 minutes) and linear game but very beautifully crafted and does a fine job of eliciting fear, sadness and joy as you make your journey. It's easy to get caught up in the experience and feel as though you're actually taking care of these cubs. That moment when a hawk swoops down and lifts away your child, or watching the rushing water carry them downstream, is surprisingly gut-wrenching. You feel as though you failed not just as someone playing a videogame but also as a parent to these virtual creatures.The game's visual style will probably be hit or miss with players. The blocky, pastel-colored design is unique and interesting, but the high brightness/gamma while playing can feel kinda strange. When I was done it took me a few minutes to re-adjust my eyes back to normal. The game also makes great use of audio cues and sound effects throughout to help make you feel more immersed in the nature setting. The camera work can be shoddy at times when near trees, rocks, walls, etc., but I didn't find it to be distracting enough to be a major concern.Overall, Shelter is a game that does a beautiful job of telling a story about the trials of parenting and the circle of life. A short yet emotionally powerful experience.			"

												The most distressing game I've played since Penumbra, Its like someone got around to making a video game based on watership down.  You have absolutely no stated goal, though in the first minute of the game its implied the purpose is to keep your cubs alive. Youll start by wandering around, picking up food for them (entirely because they eat it when you drop it - there is nothing telling you how hungry or full they are or need to be, and they never stop eating) then learn to hunt other animals juuuust before you are shown you can be hunted too. Youll need to apply what you learned from being the hunter to survive being the prey, the primary lesson being ""Your cubs are loud and stupid, and youre just going to have to figure out how to work around that""Its one big stealth escort mission, but you wont mind it while you sit in silent horror as your cubs playfully trot out in the open while a hungry falcon flies overhead. It also doesnt help that the game is a looker, and the soundtrack calming.			"

												It's not very long but I really enjoyed Shelter. There's a certain amount of tension in Shelter later on, it goes from simple foraging and hunting small animals to you being the prey. You do tighten up and look behind you to make sure your cubs have got themselves to cover.I really like the look too, it's not exactly complicated, but it does look quite autumnal, and mostly it's clear what you're supposed to be looking at. It's not for everyone, but where else are you going to find a badger simulator?			"

You aren't always going to be able to feed the one you want, especially in the night-time portions of the game. Other than that, they follow you around quite nicely and don't get into too much trouble!I would certainly recommend this game to friends.			"

Which isn't to say there's nothing to like. It takes almost no time to feel genuinely protective of your cubs, and chaperoning them through the world is fun. And it has a satisfying ending, even if it is short.Finally, if you beat it, make sure to let the credits roll completely. You'll feel better.			"

												Even though I feel like this game missed out on realizing its full thematic potential, I still found it more emotionally stirring and visually mesmerizing than many much bigger titles out there. Shelter toys with players' familiarity with game conventions and our notions of a control-success correlation by allowing randomness to factor into the cubs' survival. Although I think the developers did this to emphasize themes of survival-of-the-fittest and the inevitable losses of parenthood, it doesn't make for the most enjoyable gameplay experience. At just over an hour, Shelter is just the right length as it compresses and contextualizes these themes admirably, yet still fails to provide a compelling progression of gameplay mechanics. While I would have liked to have seen the game more fully fleshed-out, I still laud Might and Delight for tackling such unconventional subject matter within the medium.			"

This game might not be good in graphics or anything like that but I'm telling you it's well worth the money, plus I love the ending of the game, I wont spoil it because it will just wreck the game for others but seriosly, it is a really good game.

												Shelter art is awesome.Visuals and musics are really good and unique. Everybody won't like it this much but still, it's quite an experience.A few words about gameplay and gamesystem : Shelter is not a sandbox.You'll experience a driven journey with your cubs, trying to feed them and avoid environmentals and predators dangers.Gamesystem is quite simple and you'll discover how it works fast, but the important part is feedback is subtil and don't interfer with the game experience. Nothing will be prompted but everything is understandable by visuals and soud design.In fact, you'll live your journey and probably feel something quite new playing this game. Nature is rude and you may see the wild life by a different angle.In conclusion, game is simple, not long (and it's not a problem) but game design is great and it create something strong : unusuals feelings.

												The worst thing about this game is that the first part in the den has no instructions. There's also no part in the menu where you can view the controls and know what your badger is capable of. But after you figure out how to get out of the den, there are tutorials. Aside from that, it was a fantastic game. It took me less than an hour to play through all the levels. It's a simple enough game about survival. For the most part you're just walking around, trying to keep the baby badgers alive by feeding and protecting them. I recommend this game for those who like exploratory games and don't mind sad endings.			"

												Shelter has a cool art style and a nifty message.  The gameplay is mediocre which isn't so bad considering how short it is, however you probably won't find yourself wanting to replay this. It is best as a sale purchase.After my first playthrough I thought I had gotten a game over.  But it's actually how it's supposed to end.  The ending is definitely better when your pups survive.  "

												I don't get what other people were seeing in this. I don't hate it, I just don't recommend it to others. Shelter is a game where you are a mother badger escorting 5 smaller badgers to a different part of the forest. But Oh No! There are foxes, hawks, fires, floods, and more along the journey. The game begins with only 4 cubs and a grey one that appears dead on the floor. Without tutorial, you're supposed to know that to proceed you need to feed the baby badger a root. This never comes up again and it feels needless. After that, you proceed to learn how to get food (which you already did), how to hide, how to bark, and why you should hide. The problem is that's about it. The entire game is basically the tutorial portion repeated a few times. You'll find yourself in several hawk chase scenes and they just don't feel tense after the first one because its just the same scenerio over and over. The hawk squaks ever time you walk out of the grass, regardless of where it's shadow is and you ""just"" make it every time. My other problem with this game is that for a baby escort game, there's a lot of times where you'll find yourself saying ""Why did my baby die this time?"" Additionally, the gamma here is horrendous. Everything looks like your screen's blacklight is malfunctioning, but there's no way to change the visual settings. On top of that, there's a number of graphical glitches, such as floating trees and the camera constantly clipping or otherwise being annoying. I didn't even feel particularly sad when my baby badgers died because at first I thought it was scripted and since I'm not controling them, I have no ability to stop them from getting ?eaten by an owl? or swooped up by a hawk. For that reason, I don't even understand the ""crying into a pillow"" meme that litters the positive review section.			"

												9/10 A little gem. Beautiful art, simple but well-designed game mechanics. The chief merit of this game is how it challenges the typical narrative frames within which most games operate to provide a truly compelling--emotionally compelling--gaming experience. Sounds silly, but as a mother badger, you get very emotionally invested in keeping your little cubs alive. I've done my fair share of ""escort quests"" in MMO's, but this--whether because of how utterly dependent the cubs are or how unstoppable some of the predators are--really stirs your protective instincts. Not sure whether non-parent players will experience the same thing. That moment when you look behind you and you only see four cubs where there were five a moment ago is truly disheartening. I confess I didn't do so well on my first play-through (which took less than an hour). So I tried again, armed with my knowledge of the maps and mechanics--and did a little better. The ending of this little narrative is powerful.The only thing that knocks this down to 9/10 is that it crashed on Mac (a QA misstep acknowledged by the studio), forcing me to replay almost an entire level.Hats off to Johannes Wadin and Might & Delight. I confess I was a little disappointed to see they have made a sequel. A major appeal of this game is how one-of-a-kind it is. I'm not sure what a sequel can add.			"

												GIMME SHELTER-You are the mother of a group of badger pups. It's your job--nay, DUTY--to keep these babies alive. You have to feed them and protect them from the elements and an evil bird of prey.-The main game is very short, about an hour, and it features a linear narrative. The badger family goes through danger after danger. Not everyone necessarily makes it in one piece, either. Yes, the pups can die.-This is true survival horror.-The story lacks any words and uses cutscenes very minimalistically, yet it tells a very compelling story. Survival is a key theme here, but it goes beyond this in ways I probably shouldn't reveal. It speaks for itself. It's a simple, yet mentally satisfying story.-The music sets a peaceful ambience when it needs to, but also knows how to keep you on your toes for the more thrilling sections. Great soundtrack.-After you beat the game there is an optional mode called ""Nurture."" I did not play it myself, but evidently it's a more arcade version of the main game. Instead of following a story, you focus entirely on feeding the pups for an unknown number of days.FINAL VERDICT-I don't know if it's really worth the asking price, but I would certainly recommend it on sale. Just make sure you know what you're getting into before purchasing. The story is the meat of this game and it's only about an hour long. Sure, there is a bonus mode you could play for hours, but I don't think the gameplay itself warrants continued play. While the controls are fine--minimal, but satisfying enough--they aren't enough for me to want to play the non-story variant. I would love to play more if there was another story involved, but otherwise I can't see myself coming back to this one. If you want to explore a good example of minimalistic storytelling in video games, I would recommend Shelter.			"

												Pretty cool and sad, very sad game.  You play as a mother badger leading her badger babies across the dangers of the forest to safety.  Some quick things: Completion will take somewhere between an hour to two hours.  Simple controls, decent polygonal graphics, music is very moody, but in a good way, simple story, and a think about life kind of ending. Overall, pretty good, but I wouldn't pay more than a few dollars because the game is really short with minal replayability. Comes with another game called nurture which requires you to login every day to feed your babies - they could have left that one out.			"

If you flip through the discussion posts about this game though, everyone who does have something good to say usually starts with how awful it is when you lose your first baby badger. Brutal. I came here after reading about Shelter on a modern art blog (Hyperallergic), and I agree with them that the slow pacing, narrative weight and emotional investment that the game brings out in players are the greatest strengths of the game. The art style is incredibly relaxing as well... get it on sale if you're not sure about it, but my recommendation is here.			"

												First off, the art style of this game is breathtakingly beautiful. The soundtrack fits the scenary/scenario and can be very relaxing. The cubs are so cute and I really became attached to these kids. However, there is little to no instructions; this makes the death of one your cubs (0r all) 100% guaranteed. It can be frustrating because there are certain areas, such as rocks or unleveled ground, that is ""closed off"" to the player. I mean, seriously? A badger can't climb over a rock? Also, the gameplay is about an hour long and the last level is just...no. It was too confusing and the ending left you thinking, ""Wait, did it even end? Is that it?' For $1.49 (I bought it on sale), I recommend this game if you want to kill some time. I would NOT recommend this for it's full price though.			"

												The most distressing game I've played since Penumbra, Its like someone got around to making a video game based on watership down.  You have absolutely no stated goal, though in the first minute of the game its implied the purpose is to keep your cubs alive. Youll start by wandering around, picking up food for them (entirely because they eat it when you drop it - there is nothing telling you how hungry or full they are or need to be, and they never stop eating) then learn to hunt other animals juuuust before you are shown you can be hunted too. Youll need to apply what you learned from being the hunter to survive being the prey, the primary lesson being ""Your cubs are loud and stupid, and youre just going to have to figure out how to work around that""Its one big stealth escort mission, but you wont mind it while you sit in silent horror as your cubs playfully trot out in the open while a hungry falcon flies overhead. It also doesnt help that the game is a looker, and the soundtrack calming.			"

												This little game packs a huge emotional punch. The aim is to keep your brood of cute little baby badgers alive - you get attached to them very quickly, so be prepared to feel like the worst person in the world if one dies. They're wayward little scamps who don't always go where you want them to, which keeps things interesting. The world is also very pretty to look at, which always helps. People you cohabit with will also get some amusement from your gameplay - mainly due to your irrational cries of 'GET AWAY FROM MY BABY' peppered with the odd 'JUST EAT THE STUPID TURNIP - NO, NOT YOU, I MEANT STRIPY - GAAAAAAH' "

												As another reviewer said, welcome to BADGER SIMULATOR 2013!I recommend ignoring the hype and deciding what you are looking for in a game before trying.Your enjoyment of Shelter will be largely influenced by what you look for in a game. If you go into Shelter looking for a fin traditional game then you may be disappointed. What Shelter offers in this department is non-traditional graphics, invisible walls, long corridors with little explorations, lite-survival and caretaking elements, some somewhat neat stealth take downs, and annoying birds of death. Oh, and bugs that will cause your badger children to die. However, if you are looking for a game that also offeres a unique and harrowing experience that puts you in the shoes of motherhood in the animal wilds, trying to do whatever it takes as an omnivore in the middle of the food chain. The graphics remind me of picture books from childhood, recalling tales and fables about animals and their children in their world, full of morals and whatnot. This may be bunk to others, but as an artist it drew me into the world and realitic//naturalistc grapics would have had a lesser effect on me.The soundtrack itself is wonderful, blending into the game perfectly. I cannot say much about it specificly other than it filled the world just right, layering and never pulling me away.The sound effects are good as they should be, the badgers yip and yap in communication, the predatory birds caws are terrifying when first heard, and other animals sounds serve as environmental clues. This is all as it should be.So the real meat of this gaming experience comes to down to the scripted experiences you progress through. Your badger children age and grow as you take them through several environments, each containing various hazards such as darkness, fire, and flooding. You must constantly provide them food of either the vegetable of flesh variety. If you are not the type of person looking to be placed in the role of protector, mother, leader, provider; if you don't find yourself becoming emotionally attached as you play games, then you may want to give Shelter a pass.I am a white male gamer, age 32 and fall somewhere in the middle of attachment/unattachment. When my first two badger died to something in the darkness I was sad, but I expected it sooner or later. They were weak and scared. When my next child died in a flood it was upsetting but I still had two strong children to look out for. When one of them was taken by a large raptor because I took a wrong turn in some underground tunnels and came out the dangerous end, I was screaming at the top of my lungs at the computer screen.This game go to me.

												I jumped right on this when I saw it had ""badger simulator"" written all over it, and found it to be... disappointing. For $10 AUD, I'd expect more than a little under an hours worth of actual play time. The concept is great, however the actual execution was lacking. Also dat gamma setting. Everything is incredibly washed out in white, and I ended up losing two pups to starvation because the slight shade difference in a ""healthy"" pup and a ""hungry"" pup is almost completely unnoticeable.While a lack of tutorial might be desireable to some, it's needed when a large portion of players do not understand why they cannot leave the barrow. And of course, there are also a few bugs that need to be ironed out.If you'd like to give it a try, definitely wait until it's on sale. As it currently stands, it is not worth the retail price.			"

												If you liked the unique aesthetics and interactive-soundscapey-ness of Proteus, Shelter might be the game for you. It also sports a clearer objective - you're a mother badger, you've got five baby badgers to feed and take care of, and the rest of the world is against you (or at least, the rest of the world that's bigger than you are). Along the way you'll be contending with hungry birds, sneaky foxes, surging rapids and raging fires, all whilst you try to keep your quintet of kids in check. It's a short experience - little more than an hour - but a memorable one, and the soundtrack is utterly superb. Stay past the end credits for a scene that ties a nice, thoughtful bow around the whole package.			"

												I was very much looking forward to playing this game. I read that it was a similar feel to Pikmin and cute survival type games. I was bored and disappointed. And the controls left me motion sick. I had such high hopes after reading the reviews.The geometric aesthetic is lovely but the muted colours hurt my eyes. I'm am sadly not a fan of this game at all.I didn't feel for the babies at all. I felt more about emotions toward companion cube than the babies I was meant to care for. I was not touched and didn't find it terribly moving.  Which is interesting because I get emotional for everything. I don't mind short games but this was just boring. I feel like I wasted money. 2/10 - would not recommend.			"

												This is a nice little game that will take you about an hour to finish. Worth playing is you get it as part of a bundle, but not for more than a dollar or two.The art design is nice, but the instagram-style washout effects are a bit overdone so things are more difficult to see than they really should be. Maybe it's best not to have too much clarity though, as it might make the graphical shortcomings a bit too noticeable.As a small pet peeve, the credits at the end scrolled really really poorly, which left a bit of a bad final impression, coupled with the fact that the game glitched out when it went back to the menu after completion, which also seemed like a pretty big bug. Not part of the game, but definitely finished the experience with an amateurish feeling, which was really too bad.			"

												Wow~ I can really say its a really impressive game. Bad graphics doesn't mean its a bad game. It can really let you feel the responsibilities of a mother and when you do loose a baby , dang you would feel hurt ~ Pros ~ 1) Great Gameplay. Although its a really simple game , I'd say woohh, it's really relaxing and can even make you feel ""feels"" 2) Great Soundtrack 3) Can actually change the way you would look at things. 4) Ability to train you in certian areas like responsibility, caring, leadership, etc... 5) Crying simulator Cons ~ 1) Unstable optimization 2) Not so detailed graphics (But still really relaxing) Should you buy it? - Definitly! It's a must play for everyone!! Just don't play this before an important event or else people would ask why do you look sad or even ask what's up with your eyes. :/			"

												Feels like a proof of concept rather than a complete game, but it's short (only 2 hours) so it's forgivable. There's no tutorial or indicator of what is what. So it's basically a guessing game at the start unless you look up a tutorial or walkthrough. But the learning curb is really easy, which makes it again kind of forgivable. I ended up having to repeat the ending twice to be sure that, that was the real ending and not me messing up. It's fun and interesting but you can basically skip this one and go on to the second which is a vast improvement on this one.(The yes/no reccomendation doesn't help, there really should be a middle option. ""Do you recommend this game?"" ""Kinda? Maybe?"")			"

												Always wanted to be a badger and have your own cubs? Then this is the game for you. So you start of with 5 cubs. You try to find food for them. Mainly vegetables and small animals. On your travels you get attacked by bigger predators. Trying to keep your cubs save makes you really connected with the game. This all is set in a unique world with a great art style and atmosphere. The game could use a bit more polish. It has some annoying bugs. And it's also very short and linear. The concept could have been executed a bit better with an open world and some tweaks to the gameplay. The cubs need a ridiculous amount of food and I have never seen a badger headbutt a tree for apples. But beside it's flaws it's a unique experience you won't forget.			"

												Though the main idea is good, it lacks in many aspects.The graphics are highly questionable, extremely bright with dead colors that can easily trick you and mislead you in many ways.A high lack of story and a mediocre A.I. That can easily make you not care about the five babies you are supposed to take care of. Bad level design where in certain places I had no clue were to go and the graphics did not help at all, neither did the environmental variety. Bad and repetitive soundtrack.It has style, but style alone is not enough to make a game good.Generaly Shelter had a lot to give and it didn't don't buy it.			"

												In this game, you play as a badger. Yes, a badger. And it is awesome. The graphics are stylized and strikingly beautiful, and the music is excellent, always fitting the mood and indicating different things going on (if a baby has just eaten, if a predator is nearby, and so on). You must care for your five little baby badgers, and if you don't, you WILL feel like a heartless monster. My only qualm with this game is that the camera will sometimes go through trees (though this never happened at any crucial moments), but otherwise this is an excellent short game.			"

												This game is simply beautiful. A true work of art. Sound was great and the art style was appropriate and stunning. The main objective in this game is to survive as the mother badger and to help the baby badgers get food and to protect them from predators. As the badger troop trudges on, they encounter many obstacles, such as hawks, coursing rivers, and raging fires. Along the way, the mother can kill smaller game and pick fruits growing on trees or in the ground to give to the children. As the children eat more, they grow more, and become less of a liability.I've never become as attached to a main character as I was to this mother. Maybe that's just because these cute little animals are adorable (when the mother isn't leaping 20 feet and killing mice). Regardless, I enjoyed my journey with this family, and even gave the young ones names (Sam and Daisy were my favorite, don't tell the others.)It's a short game, but I think the overall experience and possible ability to start new journeys once the ending has been reached make up for that. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.			"

												This game is very emotionally intense. The baby badgers suck you in with their cute little barks and whimpers. And protecting them from a giant death bird bonds you for life. And then you notice that you only have four trailing behind you. So you go look for the lost baby badger, and you see him gray and lifeless a ways back. Or you'll see your pups run off only to have there be one less when they get back. And that's really hard. I'm sure there are some folks who can handle that; personally I cried like a dingo ate my baby when the last one got swept away in a flood. From an artistic standpoint, this game is flawless. It hooks the player in and gets them emotionally attached to its nameless little characters, each one with its own individual patterning. And it'll rip your heart out. Play with caution.			"

												Shelter is a beautiful game; the art style is pared down while still being both pleasing and engaging. The music is similarly haunting, with sparse percussion accented by big open chords. You play as a mother badger, looking after your five cubs. You must find them food, guide them through fire and flood, protect them from predators that strike without warning.The game is short -- about two hours -- but in that time it mangaged to evoke emotion without a single word of text or spoken dialog; it was a great example of ""show don't tell"", the best kind of interactive storytelling. The end, in particular, is quite poetic. And if the phrase ""interactive storytelling"" didn't just make you stop reading in disgust, Shelter is certainly worth your time.			"

												Definitely worth it for the 2 dollars I paid.I did emotionally become attached to my baby badgers as the game progressed, however there were some gameplay issues that detracted from the experience.I dislike it when levels force me to walk, rather than run. It just takes me out of the experience. Only one level did this though. The dangers of the environment are harsh, but realistically so. Nature is crazy after all.The only other thing was, there's no explanation as to how to do anything, but it's simple enough to figure out as you go. I guess that's a metaphor for life? Either way, it's a good game. I enjoyed it.Only 1/5 of my baby badgers survived. I am a terrible Badger mom.			"

												My babies and I survived everything all the way until our log collapsed into the darkness.. and I realized I only had four. I panicked for about five minutes but knew I had to quickly find a safer spot for the remaining babies. Then I guess I ran too fast, and I lost one to the dark. Then, two starved to death in the dark and wouldn't eat. So I had to leave them behind. I had one baby with me finally and I was fierce and protective, but that baby was swept away by a wave while crossing the river. In the end, I didn't even care if I lived or died, and I was eaten by a huge bird. My heart is broken. So broken. :(			"

												Looked like an interesting game, and the concept is great - but the game itself was a real disappointment.  Controls and movement didn't feel very responsive and the gameplay wasn't very interesting.  I was hoping for a simulation game that felt immersive and interesting... in my opinion that is not this game.  This is more of a ""try to use stealth with  clunky unintuitive controls and not much depth"" game.  Others may disagree, but I'm generally pretty happy with most of the games I buy - or can at least usually find something that I can enjoy... not so much with this one.			"

I would appreciate the game if, you really had a reason to protect them, something that made you care about them, you only feed them, and hide, and that's about it. Just run through most levels, hide from the eagles and repeat, also, feed them, sometimes.			"

												Overall, I would recommend this game. The music is soothing and the graphics are unique. The story centers around a mother badger leading her cubs forward, all while finding food and protection against the elements. The main game is quite short (1hr-1.5hr tops), but there is an add-on that extends the replay value a bit. I purchased this while on sale, as $10 seemed a bit steep for a game so short (but's that's just my opinion). However, I am quite glad I bought it and would recommend it.6 out of 6 badgers agree			"

												Sit down child (or, rather, stay in your seat I guess), and I will tell you how a game named Shelter not only will destroy your emotional center for the day, but also how it strangely makes you happy that you are not a badger mommy.Artistic beauty aside, Shelter is a story about you, a badger mom who just had five badger babies and need to keep them alive. You need to avoid starvation (as a baby badger that's hungry turns grey as it withers and dies), drowning (in a river with surfer waves that snatch your children away), fires of death (that chase you and eats your babies if you don't run fast enough) and 'murica (haha, no, but seriously, even eagles want to eat your babies, what is that about, badgers eat you eagle dugnubbit).I'd be lying if I said I didn't care whether or not my badger babies made it out okay, and that they're just a life-bar for me to get through the game and see some pretty neat sights. I suddenly realized what true motherly pain feels like over losing ones brood (or its fake, videogame-induced cousin, I guess), and genuinely panicked whenever that blasted eagle swooped down to snatch little Michael Jackson (Yes, I named my badger babies). I've said this about a lot of games lately, but the way it envelops me is just amazing, and the way the story (though little there is) just wraps around to thank all mothers leaves you satisfied rather than upset (you'll se what I mean if you play through it).The game is short, but there's a lot to what it has. Personally, I don't think much of the after-game mode where you can care for badger babies and have them grow up, but they'll die if you don't feed them daily or something. The story-mode, however, is what makes it work, and if a game can make much of very little, that's immensely okay to me.			"

Nearly lost one to the darkness.5) It was a rainy day, and we had to cross a river. I lost Velma to a sudden wave. My heart broke a little but it's okay. She was my least favorite.6) Made it through the rain.7) Some dumbass set forest on fire. Had to find my way out of the flames.8) Hawk picked up Shaggy in the middle of the fire. It was all a blur.

												Note: You definitely need/want an external mouse hooked up to play this game if you're using a laptop keyboard. You control movement with the WASD keys, and look around with mouse. This game is exactly what the gameplay video shows: no plot beyond getting from point a to point b, no surprise twists, and no level ups. It takes about an hour to play through. If these things are not your cup of tea, do not buy this game. If it is, and the game play video appeals: that is the game you are going to get. Enjoy! I resigned myself to only saving 1 of the cubs after I noticed that the hungrier siblings could be shoved out of the way by the others, and end up dieing of starvation unless I micromanaged the eating order. I am happy with my decision - it's like I'm taking revenge on every stupid AI I've had to escort in past video game ever. The art style is something different, and the soundtrack is very important to set the emotional tone in the game - there was clear effort made there.			"

Granted, the hour isn't half bad, but once you beat it, it has very little, if any, re-playability. Why? Because the story and the setting is very linear. The game mechanics are fun, but they have no depth, no new things you can do with them later on.They could have made the world and its challenges procedurally generated, but in a dumbfounding move they chose not to. I cannot recommend this game. I got this game on sale for a fraction of the original price mind you and still wish I could get my money back.			"

												Great game, nice artwork and music. Seems like a return to the old pc animal survival games, I was never able to play them but i found them on a search years ago, I was actually looking for a animal wolf simulation at the time.Its pretty relaxing, certain times you need to keep your eyes open (or maybe most of the time, I havent gone too far yet, I believe i am at the third level). Predators are out there trying to take ""yo babies"", one really good scene is where you have to plan to hide from a flying hawk (the music that kicked in was pretty good, fit the scene well). All the while in your travels you have to feed your babies.So far I lost one baby, not sure what took him out since it was during the night-time- but it sounded big and bad so i wasnt in a hurry to find out what it was. I will get the sequel when I am done with this (i believe its another animal you get to play). Very original game, different pace and feel than most games out there. I liked it, i would recommend it.			"

												This game is very emotionally intense. The baby badgers suck you in with their cute little barks and whimpers. And protecting them from a giant death bird bonds you for life. And then you notice that you only have four trailing behind you. So you go look for the lost baby badger, and you see him gray and lifeless a ways back. Or you'll see your pups run off only to have there be one less when they get back. And that's really hard. I'm sure there are some folks who can handle that; personally I cried like a dingo ate my baby when the last one got swept away in a flood. From an artistic standpoint, this game is flawless. It hooks the player in and gets them emotionally attached to its nameless little characters, each one with its own individual patterning. And it'll rip your heart out. Play with caution.			"

												Lots of people will say this game was boring for them, and they wouldn't be wrong. If you flip through the discussion posts about this game though, everyone who does have something good to say usually starts with how awful it is when you lose your first baby badger. Brutal. I came here after reading about Shelter on a modern art blog (Hyperallergic), and I agree with them that the slow pacing, narrative weight and emotional investment that the game brings out in players are the greatest strengths of the game. The art style is incredibly relaxing as well... get it on sale if you're not sure about it, but my recommendation is here.			"

Keep the fed and out of danger.One of the reviews have said that ""this game brings out the mother in you"" and, at least for me, it did. I was paranoid, terrified and overjoyed playing this and I warmly recommend it. It is not hardcore survival, but it's really good at bringing you happy warm fuzzy feeling. ...and paranoid terror.Few hints, you need to feed the fifth cub before you can exit the burrow, and the game autosaves at the beginning of every chapter. There is no save function.			"

Personally, I got it on sale and I loved it for 3 bucks. It's a different kind of survival game. You're not looking out for yourself as much as you're looking out for your badger pups. Really puts some interesting and different feelings into it. I've read lots of reviews where people have said they've cried during this game. It's not your run of the mill survival game.			"

												Truly unique game, but I can recommend this game by it's theme and idea. The game has a great atmosphere and strong emotional connection to the player.Shelter is slow, kind of relaxing paced game and is not for everyone. For impatient players like myself, the game can turn little boring. I think it is actually good for the game that it is not too lengthy. I will recomend because of the strong theme.Interesting, unique, experimental, emotional, artistic... still bit boring.			"

												This game is inscrutable. I picked up a pineapple, dropped it, it rolled down a hill past an invisible wall, and I walked around trying to interact with things for a while. Eventually, I alt+F4'd out, started over, and walked about some woods for a bit before running out of fruit to give to my little badgers. And that was it.There's probably more to Shelter than that, but the game makes no attempt to make it accessible to the player. There's no save-game function and movement is extremely slow, so I don't feel motivated to try again.			"

												Just finished this in an hour and I liked it.  What you get: A mostly mellow journey through what is basically a 3D painting, leading your five cubs through various dangers and foraging for food along the way. Why I liked it: The art style was refreshing and unique, and I had fun trying to keep my litter alive. The ending came abruptly but was fitting and makes me want to try again to see if I can save more than two of my cubs. Don't expect action or a deep sim-type experience from this. If you can appreciate a unique visual aesthetic, a nice soundtrack, and how everything blends to create an immersive world you may think ten dollars was worth it. I did.			"

												""Shelter"" is an unfortunate mix of very good and very frustrating.The sound direction is excellent, as is the music, which is rustic and ambient, with an undertone of danger that fits the game perfectly.The art is purposefully abstract - the world looks like an elaborate quilt. Unfortunately the beauty is weirdly washed-out, and since there are no options for adjusting the graphics, there's nothing you can do short of cranking down the brightness of your monitor. The camera is problematic, frequently getting stuck behind or inside geometry in the ubiquitous tight spaces and dense foliage.The gameplay is sometimes tense, sometimes frustrating, but most often tedious.The frustrating parts are largely due to the rules of the game being unclear. Can I actually feed individual cubs, or not? (I found later on that I could, although they would frequently just get stuck spinning around the food, without being able to eat it.) Did I have to sneak through tall grass to avoid birds of prey? (No.) Could I avoid them by hiding under bushes? (No.) Can the river drown my cubs? (No. I mean yes. Sometimes, but not always. What the hell?)The nighttime sequence was especially annoying. The game forces you to move slowly, makes everything beyond a foot or so impossible to see, and has your cubs run away from you at random intervals. Fail to chase them down, and they're simply lost forever.The best parts of the game are the tense parts - when you're being hunted by birds of prey, and when you're fleeing through the forest fire. These sequences are exciting, and even offer a break from the otherwise linear track as you decide which grassy patch you'll flee to next.The remainder of the game is largely monotonous. You wander through a series of foresty corridors, digging up roots and tossing them to the kids. Occasionally you catch a small, furry thing. And toss it to the kids.I like the idea of the game, but it's fairly flawed, despite its relatively short play-time. If the concept sounds interesting to you, wait for it to go on sale.			"

												A very interesting game with simple mechanics. In places it can even get pretty tense and it doesn't outstay its welcome (I've finished it in a bit more than an hour).The graphics style is interesting and the game has an interesting message. I didn't really feel a connection to the babies, though, but I guess that would be hard for the game to fix. Or maybe I could have done so myself by playing the free extra game ""Nurture"" afterwards where you feed your babies for 30 days or something.			"

												The moment you are constantly turning your camera around to check on your pups: you'll know Shelter has reached its goal. Shelter is a thrilling, upsetting, and sadly short, journey about a mother badger taking care of her young. The game clearly puts a lot of thought into the life of being a parent, and it really pulls it off for the player. During my first playthrough of Shelter i lost one pup; although close to the end of the level, i ran back trying to find him/her and i felt awful. I could not find him/her or simply load a save: I had lost one of my children. Shelter immerses the player into the role of a parent amazingly well and it only drives you in deeper as you constantly feed and nurture your children in order for them to stay alive. I am surprised this title has not won an indie game award for its immersive atmosphere and beautiful environment; but nevertheless, it is still a treat: award or no award. If you're looking for an immersive atmosphere and a huge focus on captivating the player, then buy Shelter.			"

												A simple game baced around protecting 5 baby badgers that you lead around the forest and away from harm. For 5 AI that could potential screw up a game, they  follow your every comand, I've never encounterd a problem with them, litteraly flawless. They even sit down and wait there turn to be fed, if you give them 2 or 3 seconds go get oriented. All of the levels vary heavily so its never like your looking or playing the same thing, each level has a different challenge as well. The art style works in the games favor as well, even a net book could run it and looks great. The controls are easy to get used to and never put you at an unfair disadvantage. Easily the best part of the game is you feel bad when you let one of your cubs get out of sight or die. I felt my heart drop every time an of them died or even got out of my sight, there is a real drive to see them all live throughout the adventure. At the time of this review the game is only $2.50 and honestly its more than worth it. the adventures thrilling, the asthetics are nice and at the end you feel happy yet sad. Give shelter a try.			"

												Shelter is a beautiful game depicting the life of a mother badger. I love the art style, but the text is often unreadable (fortunately only menu text is important). It only has partial controller support (you need a mouse to use the menus and the control tips are for keyboard and mouse). It's a short and interesting story told entirely through actions.Technically it's entirely an escort mission with stealth elements, but Might & Delight manage to use the escort format to connect you to your pups and make you regret their demise.I completed the main story and took a stab at the ""nurture"" mode (under extras) and wasn't interested enough to grab more than one turnip. I didn't see enough there to make fetch quests fun, but I didn't really give it a chance. Maybe later.			"

												I got this game on sale for $1.20 (Cad) because I had that exact ammount left over in my steam wallet from the Holiday Steam Sale. (At this time, there's about 17 hours left in that sale. So if you want it for really cheap, get it now) And I loved it.Basically, you're this badger who has these five badger cubs and you need to keep them alive untill they're adults. You and your clan (yes, that's what a group of badgers is called according to Google.) will go through many different areas to reach the final area of the game. In each area, your badgers will grow a bit larger till they're as big as you are. This game can be easily completed in under 2 hours (I completed it in 1.7 hours), so it can be a game for just an affternoon of your time, or you can play it multiple times, like I probably will.

												So... how to describe Shelter? Saying it is unique seems too superficial, and it doesn't do the game credit to be honest. In this modern day and age where the market has been oversaturated with many games that can easily be classified as ""mindless run, gun & slash"" fastfood entertainment, some developers try something different. Imagine a hybrid of a Bambi/Lion King animal based story, with a clear Circle of Life theme, spiced with loss, altruism and tragedy and an artistic painted storybook look to it. Art and emotion. That's Shelter. The game, in all it's simplicity and with its limited length and replay value grabs a hold of you and leaves you in equal measure impressed, feeling uneasy and with renewed insight of how fragile life can be, especially in the Wilds as part of the food chain. As you see, Shelter can't be defined or categorised easily and both topic, style and gameplay might not be for everyone... BUT what it does, it does very well and I can recommend this small but shiny gem to anyone who's up for experiencing ""something different"".In short:Pros:- Artistic- Unique- Experience a painfully clear Circle of Life story- Appeals to your emotions and has a psychological impact- Clings to your thoughts long after you stopped playingCons:- Graphic style won't appeal to everyone- Short- Simple- Low replay value- Controls can be a bit cumbersome			"

												ART&MUSIC: The artistic quality of the game was one of my favorite aspects. The color remained vivd throughout, creating a different atmosphere than most. The rain had to be one of my favorites as red was everywhere (not the typical blue), and the music that matched -- abosultely stunning. CHARACTERS: Well, they are badgers. There's not much to them, but you certainly get attached. GAMEPLAY: I never ran into any problems...well, I did get lost a few times. However, that really made the game for me. Panicking, wondering where the 'mother' is supposed to go to next to get away from danger just added to the quality of the game. 8/10: It's short. I want to play through again and take the time to really make the badgers grow, but again it's REALLY short. What broke the game for me was the end result. Given that the game has such a 'dropoff' ending I would still recommend it for the music, art, and concept that it has to offer. Definitely can't wait for the second! "

												Even though I feel like this game missed out on realizing its full thematic potential, I still found it more emotionally stirring and visually mesmerizing than many much bigger titles out there. Shelter toys with players' familiarity with game conventions and our notions of a control-success correlation by allowing randomness to factor into the cubs' survival. Although I think the developers did this to emphasize themes of survival-of-the-fittest and the inevitable losses of parenthood, it doesn't make for the most enjoyable gameplay experience. At just over an hour, Shelter is just the right length as it compresses and contextualizes these themes admirably, yet still fails to provide a compelling progression of gameplay mechanics. While I would have liked to have seen the game more fully fleshed-out, I still laud Might and Delight for tackling such unconventional subject matter within the medium.			"

												When I first got this game, I had trouble running the thing! The graphics weren't loading on the title page, and once the game ""Started"" I could hear background noises and the sounds of animal cries. Yet I couldn't see a thing! Just a white screen saying ""Loading"".I posted on the forums, and got no response. I tried contacting the developers...again, no response. I eventually managed to get the game going, by heading to the games steam folder, and setting it's compatibility mode for Windows 98/me (for some reason). Then the game would run, but hang when you exited it..I fixed this by running shelter as admin.Finally it all worked! So if you have similar problems, try that! Now, about the game!This game is heavily stylized and while beautiful, can be hard to make things out since items and creatures are of abnormal shapes. Even when you can make out the item, it still might be difficult to find things(Say, a hopping frog) due to the fact that the colors used in the game are all so light, that it makes everything seem faded and washed out.Other than that, playing as a mommy Honey Badgers leading her children through the treacherous wilds is incredibly enjoyable. The trouble getting the game running, was well worth the effort, and while the game is fantastic, it has HORRIBLE support.			"

												This game is oddly compelling. I just finished my first playthrough today, and I'm already looking forward to playing it again. The controls are extremely simplistic - you use the WASD keys to move, the SHIFT key to move faster, and the left mouse button to pull up food like turnips and radishes, pounce on prey, and give food to one of your five growing badger children. You get surprisingly attached to said badger children as the game progresses,  and losing one of them is a horrifying and severely depressing experience. Successfully completing a level with all remaining babies still intact is unexpectedly rewaring. If you're looking for a short, (mostly) calm, emotionally investing and altogether beautiful experience, Shelter is definitely the game for you.			"

												Definitely an “artsy” game. If you aren’t the type of person who sees games as another form of artistic expression, don’t bother with this. The graphics are a stylized, washed-out look and the gameplay is minimalistic, to put it generously. It seems extremely insubstantial for MSRP, and if I had paid that I’d feel cheated. However, 50% or more off and I’d be happy with the purchase.Just a note: developer, why did you pick the most evil animal on Earth for us to be sympathetic for? Maybe that was the cunning plan: to show those terrifying creatures from Farcry 4 to just be trying to survive…by biting people’s legs off. "

												You're looking at a game that has zero replayability, melodramatic, and unfulfilling.  The ending could have been different and would have been much more emotional as what they were obviously trying to go for.*****SPOILERS*****Yes, the mom dies and whatever badgers you have remaining are left to fend for themselves without you knowing what happens to them.  If the ending was reversed (meaning the cubs die while the mom is left all alone) then it would have been a much better and emotional ending since they were going for the whole ""damn nature, you scary""*****END SPOILERS*****The game was as long as it needed to be which was a good thing.  It got it's point it was trying to give across.  It's a basic game that does leave a lot to be desired though.  It's not so much about surviving nature, but more about running from a ♥♥♥♥ing stalker bird the entire time which I feel was the developer's only idea of challenge so they took that and ran 5 miles with it.  In all honesty though, I don't think there would have been much more to do with the game as far as variety.  It's a very hard idea to work with and I feel they did a good enough job with it where by the end, I respected what they did and how they managed to do it.  Would I ever play the game again?  No.  Would I recommend it to anyone else?  Unless you are VERY curious about it, no.  With it priced at 10 dollars, it's not worth the price.  I feel probably 5 dollars would have been more appropriate.			"

												Do I recommend this game? Yes definitely.First of all I love indie games like this, the tear jerking, different art style type games. I think this comes in just behind Dear Esther, and thats one of my favourite games of this genre.After a while you do get attached to these little badger pups and when I lost my first one to that stupid eagle... lets just say now I hate eagles. It is so hard to keep everyone alive and thats what happens in reality and I think this game has captured that perfectly. Although also like most games of this genre I dont think there is much replay value there, and I did get bored after a while, I still think Shelter ranks up there with other tear jerker indie titles.10/10 from me			"

												While this game is very fun to play, occassionally scary and heart breaking, I keep running into a problem that involves food the mother picks up and never drops.  This usually happens when one of the babies is too hungry to move on, and I cannot go back to feed it as it would have been eaten by wolves or a hawk or something else entirely.  The food stays in the mouth, and I cannot get other food for the remaining babies.  However, no matter how many times I try, I also cannot drop the said food for any of the remaining babies alive.I came here to see when the game was first released, thinking maybe that this is a small glitch and that it was being worked on in the process, only to find out that this game has been out since 2013, and I'm going to guess that no one has found this bug, or it has been found and reported with no patch to fix it.I still want to play the game and enjoy myself, though I hate having to reset the level that I am on at least 10 times just to not run into this small complication.

												If I could describe this game in two words, it would be beautiful, and sad. The game basically revolves around you, the Badger mother, trying to keep your kin alive. You harvest food, sneak around (There are birds that hunt you, and yes, they are frieghtening), and explore. The game sets a tone of bright and innocent in earlier levels, and becomes dark and depressing in later stages. I personally fell in love with the kin and really, REALLY, wanted them all to survive. But, this objective was diminished in one level where it seemed impossible to get through without one of the small badgers dying (leaving only a peep noise). This made me very angry as it seemed like a design choice, ruining my experiance. But maybe this is the devs teaching us something....You can't always have what you want, your heart WILL be broken and sometimes there is nothing you can do about it. Maybe im thinking about it too much. I did cry (like a little ♥♥♥♥♥) when I first finished the game and was a little disappointed about the ending (see previous points). But overall this game was a great experiance and I highly recommend it to everyone!!! 8.5/10			"

My only concerns are the graphics are questionable and it's got the same railroad playthrough as Journey, but with the stress of moving right along because of constant danger.

												Shelter is admittedly a terribly short game with gameplay not too dissimilar from games like Lemmings and From Dust, with respect to ensuring the safety of your followers. However, the emotional journey the game takes you on, with you starring as a mother badger, is ultimately a unique and memorable experience. The game is a tribute to all mothers out there that would do anything to protect their young.			"

												Shelter is one of my favourite pastimes. Though the main game is short, you can try again to be a better badger Mother -Which I find quite fun- and keep all your babies safe. The graphics are cute and simple, and the controls easy to master. The additional gamemode, Nurture, allows you to raise your babies in the den and gives you time to enjoy the scenery. Eventually they will grow and follow you through your journeys. I would recommend buying this game!			"

												Nice and Relaxing game. Sometimes it needs a super concentration on the environment but the majority of the game is relaxed! The environmentalist theme of the game made me buy it and the artistic look of it made me keep playing!the sound design is really intriging!			"

												Shelter is an adventure survival game centered around playing as a mother badger, giving an overall pleasurable experience. Chances are that if you came to this page to view the game that means that you are okay with playing artistic indie games, and at a price of $10 I think this game is well worth the experience it supplies (and for those of you who are on a budget, this game can be picked up for around $2-3 during Steam sales whether it be Fall, Winter, or Summer). As a survival adventure game, Shelter exceeds in its art style, which in my opinion can be best described as Low-Poly (if you play the game and grow to love the art style there is a couple of wonderful subreddits that showcase this kind of art style called /r/lowpoly, /r/low_poly, and /r/lowpoly2d). Overall the experience is superb as you play as a mother badger who is sheltering her five cubs, with an overall arching story that is very compelling and what I would describe as short and sweet. I believe in moderation of story time, and Shelter can take roughly 60-90 minutes to complete. This may sound short to you, but there is an option for multiple play throughs as one may wish to complete the game with all five cubs (if they did not achieve that the first time) althought the ending will always be the same. An additional mode was added at some point called ""Nurture"" (under ""extras"" on the menu) which essentially allow you to play the game in a reminescent Tamagotchi like way. I mean this in  the sense that you are now allowed to explore the open world as a badger and *constantly revisit* your five cubs *every day* to *nurture* and feed them until they are adults. It's a relaxing game mode to me since it's a good way to unwind and passively listen to Shelter's amazing sound score. Things that I did not like about the game mostly revolve around how the cubs that you are to protect have a janky AI which can be unresponsive in following you sometimes (it can range from not many occurences on a level to a fair amount) leading to the AI's impending death and you as the player completing the game without all five cubs. Another thing I noticed was that the environment may appear to be open world, but at least in the campaign mode you are very limited in what and where you can explore. Now in the ""extra"" feature mode of Nurture this is slightly alleviated but is still present. These two complaints of mine DO NOT DETRACT FROM THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE of the game, but are things that I reflected upon and complained about upon completion of the game. I would HIGHLY recommend this game, and it's coming sequel called Shelter 2 released by the same studio Might and Delight where in Shelter 2 you play as a lynx and have a supposedly more control and freedom over the open world. The trailer is absolutely magnificent and Shelter 2 will be released sometime next month. If it is anything like Shelte was then it will be a superb game with unique and touching plot points.			"

												This game was a beautiful and interesting ride. Playing the role of a mother Badger, you have to travel through locations and events while feeding and caring for your Badger babies.  The sounds and score are enjoyable, and the game is a simple, yet challenging adventure. The colors and menu font/color tend to be a little disorienting at first, but you'll adjust, and it'll be worth it in the end.I reccomend this game if you're looking for a short, yet enjoyable game.

												Not my kind of game, the story and progession is a bit too slow for my taste. And if you wonder about the art style, well it is how a game would look if you didn't bother unwrapping the 3d objects and tile things correctly. Surprisingly well done style though. The game is good for those who like a slow game where you experience the life of a badger. I recommend the game as it is an interesting game, just not for me. :)			"

												I was very much looking forward to playing this game. I read that it was a similar feel to Pikmin and cute survival type games. I was bored and disappointed. And the controls left me motion sick. I had such high hopes after reading the reviews.The geometric aesthetic is lovely but the muted colours hurt my eyes. I'm am sadly not a fan of this game at all.I didn't feel for the babies at all. I felt more about emotions toward companion cube than the babies I was meant to care for. I was not touched and didn't find it terribly moving.  Which is interesting because I get emotional for everything. I don't mind short games but this was just boring. I feel like I wasted money. 2/10 - would not recommend.			"

												Though the main idea is good, it lacks in many aspects.The graphics are highly questionable, extremely bright with dead colors that can easily trick you and mislead you in many ways.A high lack of story and a mediocre A.I. That can easily make you not care about the five babies you are supposed to take care of. Bad level design where in certain places I had no clue were to go and the graphics did not help at all, neither did the environmental variety. Bad and repetitive soundtrack.It has style, but style alone is not enough to make a game good.Generaly Shelter had a lot to give and it didn't don't buy it.			"

I'm not someone who expects excitement every second; I like slow-paced games, but this one... to be blunt, it just felt like a waste of time. It's not relaxing and a nice change of pace, like I expected, just tedious and irritating. Perhaps that's the point and it's a metaphor for motherhood.I'm glad a lot of people were able to enjoy it, but sadly the bad outweighed the good for me. I recommend giving it a pass.			"

												It's a badger sim, so that should tell you whether you should buy it or not.You play a mother badger who, with slim pickings in her territory, decides to move her five cubs to a more prosperous area. On the way you must keep the babies fed and safe from predators and natural disaster.I've heard a lot of praise for the graphics. They weren't my cup of tea, to be honest. They reminded me a lot of the wire-model Tekken 2 characters and sometimes it was hard to see where to go because of them. Also there were a tonne of times where I couldn't see what was happening because the camera swung into the middle of a tree. Most of the time this wasn't a big deal but during the night-time sequence where it is essential to be able to see where you're going, it was almost a game-breaker for me. The game's ability to play on your emotions is definitely its strong point. I was genuinely distressed when I lost the babies to any of the various calamities and accidentally setting my entire badger family on fire made me feel truly terrible inside. But the fact that I could feel so strongly after a short play-time says a lot.The price point is a bit high for what this game is, but if it seems like something you're interested in then it's worth a look during the sales.

												Two notes! It's pretty bright - part of the chosen style. Because of that, make sure to play it either during the day or in a well-lit room, unless you're a fan of eye strain. The other bit, it's a pretty short experience.Those two things said, it's still a really cute, artful thing! If you like either of those descriptors, you should maybe give it a shot!Also, if you're patient enough for it, there's an additional 'Nurture' mode, where you're supposed to play the game once a real-world day (as the time in this mode is tied to your computer's clock), bringing food to the baby cubs. By around day 5 or so they'll be big enough to walk around, and the longer you keep up that routine, the more open the game world becomes.			"

After that I realised my relaxing stroll was actually turning into tense, sad fight for survival and well-being of my beloved cubs.The game is basically see how long you can survive the dark and scary real world of a badger mum and her cubs. The ending of the one game I played had a great twist.The animation and art was great. Different, but who said that was a bad thing? It's very interesting. The music was great and created a great atmosphere.Definitely buy this game. Wonderful game.  "

												I got this game on sale for $1.20 (Cad) because I had that exact ammount left over in my steam wallet from the Holiday Steam Sale. (At this time, there's about 17 hours left in that sale. So if you want it for really cheap, get it now) And I loved it.Basically, you're this badger who has these five badger cubs and you need to keep them alive untill they're adults. You and your clan (yes, that's what a group of badgers is called according to Google.) will go through many different areas to reach the final area of the game. In each area, your badgers will grow a bit larger till they're as big as you are. This game can be easily completed in under 2 hours (I completed it in 1.7 hours), so it can be a game for just an affternoon of your time, or you can play it multiple times, like I probably will.

												It's a cute and artistic game that will rip your heart out. I recommend this game being purchased on sale as I did because it's not very long and the replay value is pretty low. That being said I will say it is worth buying because you will be a stressed out mother badger about an hour in. It's a two-three hour long game but within that time you will get attached to those five baby badgers. You find yourself taking your time to feed them and think some of your decisions through. It makes it challenging in a way, considering i've attempted played through it three times and lost at least one baby each time. The game does a good job at making you play the part and get you emotionally invested. The controlls are very easy and the style of the game sometimes makes you want to stay in one place and look around, which isn't a good idea at times.  They also have a tomogatchi style pet side game when you beat the main game. You launch the game once a day for a month and watch your badgers go from completly dependant to fully grown. If you don't have the time for that then no big deal, the main game is enough.My only complaint is I wish they would have included some sort of extra content besides nurture, the side game. Maybe some developer content or even a third game mode.  "

												THIS GAME EMOTIONALY COMPROMISED ME! I don’t get upset very easily but I can safely say that I NEVER want to be a badger and this had me balling like a baby. I lost two of my Babies, and apparently out of a litter of Five, three is a good number to have survived, But I don’t care. I. LOST. TWO. BABIES! Despite all the emotional trauma and hell that a Badgers life is. this is an extremely fulfilling game but I would not suggest it to the faint of heart, it can be quite upsetting and if you aren't diligent in protecting and feeding your babies you will fail and you will hate yourself for it. despite that I love this game more than I can put into words and the experience is something that I will never forget. Step into the paws of a Mother Badger and walk her life, its harder than you can imagine. don’t over think, don’t rush, don’t slow, stay alert, and always watch your steps and maybe, just maybe, you can keep all 5 safe and alive. Shelter awaits.			"

												Shelter is something unique.As someone who spent their young life dreaming of games where you could be an animal and experience life as one, Shelter is something I had to have.You play as an adult badger tending to their young. You start with 5 cubs and your goal is to migrate through the world you live in to reach a new area for your cubs. Along the way you'll encounter different environments, hazards, and obstacles that you need to overcome whilst still making sure that none of your cubs starve or die. Which is harder than it sounds.The experience is serene, and does portray nature as it is - sometimes cruel despite it's beauty. Danger can lurk everywhere, and hearts will break when cubs are lost along the way due to unexpected circumstances or a simple lapse of attention. If you're looking for something action-packed, this is not for you. It's slow-paced and it's emphasis is on the circle of life and taking things as they come, day after day.The game may not be entirely glitch free (one of my cubs fell off a cliff), but it's definitely worth playing if you're looking for something different. The only thing you should note if you're thinking of buying this is that it's short. The entire game can be played through in roughly about an hour.Would still recommend this for everyone who's ever wanted to become an animal for a short period of time - because that's what Shelter is at its core. It was a lovely experience for me, and with Shelter 2 now on the way, I'll be eagerly waiting for it!			"

In places it can even get pretty tense and it doesn't outstay its welcome (I've finished it in a bit more than an hour).The graphics style is interesting and the game has an interesting message. I didn't really feel a connection to the babies, though, but I guess that would be hard for the game to fix. Or maybe I could have done so myself by playing the free extra game ""Nurture"" afterwards where you feed your babies for 30 days or something.			"

												Just finished this in an hour and I liked it.  What you get: A mostly mellow journey through what is basically a 3D painting, leading your five cubs through various dangers and foraging for food along the way. Why I liked it: The art style was refreshing and unique, and I had fun trying to keep my litter alive. The ending came abruptly but was fitting and makes me want to try again to see if I can save more than two of my cubs. Don't expect action or a deep sim-type experience from this. If you can appreciate a unique visual aesthetic, a nice soundtrack, and how everything blends to create an immersive world you may think ten dollars was worth it. I did.			"

												""Shelter"" is an unfortunate mix of very good and very frustrating.The sound direction is excellent, as is the music, which is rustic and ambient, with an undertone of danger that fits the game perfectly.The art is purposefully abstract - the world looks like an elaborate quilt. Unfortunately the beauty is weirdly washed-out, and since there are no options for adjusting the graphics, there's nothing you can do short of cranking down the brightness of your monitor. The camera is problematic, frequently getting stuck behind or inside geometry in the ubiquitous tight spaces and dense foliage.The gameplay is sometimes tense, sometimes frustrating, but most often tedious.The frustrating parts are largely due to the rules of the game being unclear. Can I actually feed individual cubs, or not? (I found later on that I could, although they would frequently just get stuck spinning around the food, without being able to eat it.) Did I have to sneak through tall grass to avoid birds of prey? (No.) Could I avoid them by hiding under bushes? (No.) Can the river drown my cubs? (No. I mean yes. Sometimes, but not always. What the hell?)The nighttime sequence was especially annoying. The game forces you to move slowly, makes everything beyond a foot or so impossible to see, and has your cubs run away from you at random intervals. Fail to chase them down, and they're simply lost forever.The best parts of the game are the tense parts - when you're being hunted by birds of prey, and when you're fleeing through the forest fire. These sequences are exciting, and even offer a break from the otherwise linear track as you decide which grassy patch you'll flee to next.The remainder of the game is largely monotonous. You wander through a series of foresty corridors, digging up roots and tossing them to the kids. Occasionally you catch a small, furry thing. And toss it to the kids.I like the idea of the game, but it's fairly flawed, despite its relatively short play-time. If the concept sounds interesting to you, wait for it to go on sale.			"

												This game is inscrutable. I picked up a pineapple, dropped it, it rolled down a hill past an invisible wall, and I walked around trying to interact with things for a while. Eventually, I alt+F4'd out, started over, and walked about some woods for a bit before running out of fruit to give to my little badgers. And that was it.There's probably more to Shelter than that, but the game makes no attempt to make it accessible to the player. There's no save-game function and movement is extremely slow, so I don't feel motivated to try again.			"

												Well... it's a Badger simulator! Quite a unique idea, and it's certainly interesting being put in the middle of the food chain, trying to protect your cute little badger cubs from those mean predators, then biting a mouse's head off and sneaking up and killing a fox then feeding it to them.Only downside is that the game doesn't really have any replay value and isn't really that long.I suppose you can retry and see if you can get more of your cubs to the end the next time.

												I'll start by saying that I enjoyed the game. However, I payed $1 for it on a deal I found online.  I don't believe that this game is worth $9.99 or hardly even the $4.99 that it's on sale for as I'm writing this. The art in the game is by far it's best attribute. The way this game could be worth $4.99 and possibly even $9.99 would be if they added Trading Cards, Steam Achievements, and extended the length of the game. First time through I beat the game in 1.4 hours. I'm sure if I went back through I could easily beat it in 45 minutes.			"

												Shelter is a game with an interesting concept but deeply flawed implementation.  The game relies on you to build a bond with your progeny but never does anything to make you feel attached to them.  Because of this lack of attachment, the game breaks once you realize it’s easier to just let your children die and run to the next objective.  Combine this with twisting levels that are easy to get lost in and a playtime under two hours, it’s hard to recommend even when it’s on sale.			"

												A short yet beautiful adventure where your maternal/paternal instincts take over. It's a charming and short game about motherhood and trying to protect your young in a cold world. The game clocks in a little over an hour yet it doesn't overstay its welcome with its simplistic mechanics of feeding your young, trying to keep them together and keeping them from being devoured. The game is pretty simple but keeping your young alive is surprisingly difficult and over the course of your hour you'll find plenty of twists and turns and new mechanics to keep things free. You'll mostly be wandering around, trying to feed your children by either knocking down apples or even hunting small animals. There will even be times where you are met with more children than food and you have to choose who to feed (hungry children will fade and grow weaker and slower making them easy prey). Avoiding eagles, creatures of the night, trying to keep them calm when they run away scared and keeping them alive during natural disasters makes you grow attached to them. My only criticism is that for a game so short there are loading screens (which are quick) but load into very different areas of the forest. Such a short game would have been much better at providing a more seamless transition between the ""areas"" of the forest. All in all it's a great game.			"

												So... how to describe Shelter? Saying it is unique seems too superficial, and it doesn't do the game credit to be honest. In this modern day and age where the market has been oversaturated with many games that can easily be classified as ""mindless run, gun & slash"" fastfood entertainment, some developers try something different. Imagine a hybrid of a Bambi/Lion King animal based story, with a clear Circle of Life theme, spiced with loss, altruism and tragedy and an artistic painted storybook look to it. Art and emotion. That's Shelter. The game, in all it's simplicity and with its limited length and replay value grabs a hold of you and leaves you in equal measure impressed, feeling uneasy and with renewed insight of how fragile life can be, especially in the Wilds as part of the food chain. As you see, Shelter can't be defined or categorised easily and both topic, style and gameplay might not be for everyone... BUT what it does, it does very well and I can recommend this small but shiny gem to anyone who's up for experiencing ""something different"".In short:Pros:- Artistic- Unique- Experience a painfully clear Circle of Life story- Appeals to your emotions and has a psychological impact- Clings to your thoughts long after you stopped playingCons:- Graphic style won't appeal to everyone- Short- Simple- Low replay value- Controls can be a bit cumbersome			"

The game mechanics are fun, but they have no depth, no new things you can do with them later on.They could have made the world and its challenges procedurally generated, but in a dumbfounding move they chose not to. I cannot recommend this game. I got this game on sale for a fraction of the original price mind you and still wish I could get my money back.			"

			Life as a badger is never easy, especially as a single parent raising their five kids while trying to take a road trip through eagle country.		

Life as a badger is never easy, especially as a single parent raising their five kids while trying to take a road trip through eagle country.A delightful world with a painterly visual style hides the sinister tones of harsh survival.  Five hungry mouths to feed plus multiple predators searching for their own meals.  Compounded by natural obstacles only further raises the stakes.The gameplay and mechanics are simple but most badgers are not required to hack consoles or solve international crises.  The minimalistic UI works well in the vast majority of the time, but some more visual clues for what to go would help the overall experience.			"

												First off let me start by saying im a severe ♥♥♥♥ing autist so feelings have always been a problem to feel or experience for me, with that in mind.Shelter is a very well thought out and done game where you are the mother of a family of badgers.You start the level off with one sick badger which already kicks your instincts in to care for it and to find it food so it can get better. This keypoint is very well managed throughout the game as you have a start of 5 badgers.In my playthrough i had 2 badgers left. 2 died of starvation because the others picked all the food and one died in the river.The one that died in the river, it's scream almost made me cry as i saw it flush down the river. I was like ohgod no.You care for the badgers intensely which is very well done imo, from scaring off enemies to finding food or making them feel safe.The visuals are a real eye pleaser and the lightning, scenery, music etc are very well fitting to the whole overall concept.I'd give it an 8/10, not a full 10 because personally i'd rather have seen an alternative ending to the current one where you perhaps grow old and your badgers visit or along that line. and the other point because muh badgers died :'<.Overall a very solid buy and worth the price but preferably on sale if you can get it.-Poise			"

												I got this game on sale for $1.20 (Cad) because I had that exact ammount left over in my steam wallet from the Holiday Steam Sale. (At this time, there's about 17 hours left in that sale. So if you want it for really cheap, get it now) And I loved it.Basically, you're this badger who has these five badger cubs and you need to keep them alive untill they're adults. You and your clan (yes, that's what a group of badgers is called according to Google.) will go through many different areas to reach the final area of the game. In each area, your badgers will grow a bit larger till they're as big as you are. This game can be easily completed in under 2 hours (I completed it in 1.7 hours), so it can be a game for just an affternoon of your time, or you can play it multiple times, like I probably will.

												This game is amazing. Yes, it's short. Yes, it's basic. Yes, it's far from being graphically groundbreaking. But guess what? it works!... It speaks to your guts without a single word. It's an experience with a lot of soul. No HUD needed, no briefing nor story. In the wild life, it's the instinct that tells you what to do. Although the game being very short, it's a little piece of art that you should play to the end the best way you can. It's self-rewarding.			"

												When I first found this game, i thought it was going to be a new and intriguing animal survival/simulator, a genre rarely touched or done well before. But it turned out that was only half the case. You only care for the badger kits, and you yourself do not need to eat at all (playing as the mother badger). The graphics are apealing and soundtrack is pleasant, but that means nothing to me if the gameplay isn't at its full potential, and im sure that a portion of the playerbase may feel the same. Plus it's very linear, not really having enough space to explore and have a grand adventure being lost in the woods. Don't get me wrong though, I did enjoy this game for the past hour and a half of playing it(which is the length of the game), foraging and occasionally hunting foxes, voles, and frogs to sate my babies' hunger. But i honestly think this game could have given a bit more in what it's focused on. Then again, I'm not entirely sure of the devolpers intentional feel they want the game to give to its players. If you want a charming, relaxing game that brings you closer to your [badger] family, then this may be one of those games. However, if you desire a more challenging game that truly tests your will to survive (this may be the case in the game's sequel: ""Shelter 2""), than I'd suggest looking somewhere else.			"

												*****This review may be subjective... In reality the game... objectively speaking... is kind of a mediocre one... 63/100**** *And now considering what i felt... the feels I got and the joy I had...: Good game. At its standards and style... let's say 76/100... The story is beautiful... little bit sad (that's a reason why it is beautiful) but the nature is as it is. Art style is very good. Soundtrack if good enough. Gameplay isn't amazing (simplistic: collect food and avoid death) but I can say that at the first run it is quite challenging. Still... if you want to get to the end with all 5 babies... it is more than hard... I am seriously... you have to be very careful... The game may seem short... and it is... but longer with this content it will get boring... I hightly reccomand playing it looking at details and connecting to the world... if you rush in the game you will have a short run... i had a very nice and almost slow run and steam registered me 2.4 hours in the game. The game is nothing but a nice experience that I personally enjoyed and I think lots of you will enjoy it as well. ^*^*^IMPORTANT: The real problem here is that it may seem expensive... and unfortunately it is.  ~ 2 h gameplay and kind of a mediocre to be objective... it is not worth more than 6 euros... Consider at my review itself the fact that i bought this game at a sale.... and I paid 1,09 euros... If you're wondering to buy or not to buy this game... and you can relate a little bit to what i've said... than wait for a sale so the game is 6 euros or lower... otherwise... being one at my kind with tastes and things... you will get to the conclusion... good game... but i want my money back god damn it... you will realize is not worth 10 euros (as i said... 6 euros is pretty legit to me).Hope I helped at least a little bit.

												It's a cute and artistic game that will rip your heart out. I recommend this game being purchased on sale as I did because it's not very long and the replay value is pretty low. That being said I will say it is worth buying because you will be a stressed out mother badger about an hour in. It's a two-three hour long game but within that time you will get attached to those five baby badgers. You find yourself taking your time to feed them and think some of your decisions through. It makes it challenging in a way, considering i've attempted played through it three times and lost at least one baby each time. The game does a good job at making you play the part and get you emotionally invested. The controlls are very easy and the style of the game sometimes makes you want to stay in one place and look around, which isn't a good idea at times.  They also have a tomogatchi style pet side game when you beat the main game. You launch the game once a day for a month and watch your badgers go from completly dependant to fully grown. If you don't have the time for that then no big deal, the main game is enough.My only complaint is I wish they would have included some sort of extra content besides nurture, the side game. Maybe some developer content or even a third game mode.  "

												I'm obsessed with this game, the art, the music, the concept, everything about this game was done beautifully! Won't comment on the ending of course since it's pretty much the only thing that can actually be spoiled, but I barely made it with all 5 of my babies! (whom I named of course; Mini Me, Zero, Stripe, Beatle, and Orion)The game can be intense, it becomes immersive very quick so when you lose a baby there's a real sense of panic which I hated and appreciated at the same time hahaPeople had been rather harsh on judging this game so I was a bit skeptical at first but imo, everything about it was done perfectly 15/10 would pay to stress over virtual badger babies again.

												Crashed twice before I could finally get past the first section. Very short, but feels really long because of how bored I got by the end. Framerate is terrible in the last section. I will give it this though. I did feel bad every time one of my babies died. Unfortunately, that's also the worst par. The first two died at night because this game hardly explains anything, and I had no idea what was going on. I'm still mad about that. The third was swept away. (That one was mostly my fault though.)I named the last two Sans and Papyrus to remind me of a better game. When they died, I couldn't even off myself and was horrified at the thought of starting all over from the beginning. Luckily, that wasn't the case. My last two babies survived till the end, and then I returned it.0 out of 5 badger babies. Would not play again. Not really worth the $1.50.			"

Really puts some interesting and different feelings into it. I've read lots of reviews where people have said they've cried during this game. It's not your run of the mill survival game.			"

Keep the fed and out of danger.One of the reviews have said that ""this game brings out the mother in you"" and, at least for me, it did. I was paranoid, terrified and overjoyed playing this and I warmly recommend it. It is not hardcore survival, but it's really good at bringing you happy warm fuzzy feeling. ...and paranoid terror.Few hints, you need to feed the fifth cub before you can exit the burrow, and the game autosaves at the beginning of every chapter.

												THIS GAME EMOTIONALY COMPROMISED ME! I don’t get upset very easily but I can safely say that I NEVER want to be a badger and this had me balling like a baby. I lost two of my Babies, and apparently out of a litter of Five, three is a good number to have survived, But I don’t care. I. LOST. TWO. BABIES! Despite all the emotional trauma and hell that a Badgers life is. this is an extremely fulfilling game but I would not suggest it to the faint of heart, it can be quite upsetting and if you aren't diligent in protecting and feeding your babies you will fail and you will hate yourself for it. despite that I love this game more than I can put into words and the experience is something that I will never forget. Step into the paws of a Mother Badger and walk her life, its harder than you can imagine. don’t over think, don’t rush, don’t slow, stay alert, and always watch your steps and maybe, just maybe, you can keep all 5 safe and alive. Shelter awaits.			"

			Life as a badger is never easy, especially as a single parent raising their five kids while trying to take a road trip through eagle country.		

Life as a badger is never easy, especially as a single parent raising their five kids while trying to take a road trip through eagle country.A delightful world with a painterly visual style hides the sinister tones of harsh survival.  Five hungry mouths to feed plus multiple predators searching for their own meals.  Compounded by natural obstacles only further raises the stakes.The gameplay and mechanics are simple but most badgers are not required to hack consoles or solve international crises.  The minimalistic UI works well in the vast majority of the time, but some more visual clues for what to go would help the overall experience.			"

Don't be fooled by cute artsy graphics, it will make you curse the majestic eagle for snatching little Sam. !@$# Nature, you can be so cruel.

												Shelter came in a Humble Bundle for me eons ago. When I first got it, I fell in love with the graphics immediately. Shelter follows the story of Mother Badger and her five cubs. You have to overcome the challenges of the wild to ensure the survival of your litter. It's a quick game, with about an hour of game play, but a lasting impression. The game is moreso a moving art piece. The plot progresses slowly, changing only when the chapter shifts. Essentially, you set the pace for the game and you have limited freedom in exploration. Overall, the maps are pretty linear, but you can sniff around. The mechanics for the game are simple, and it's pretty low stress (apart from wanting to save your cubs). Feed them, feed yourself if you choose, and move forward. Pros:- Artistic masterpiece- Great sound track; super relaxing- I got pretty attached to all of the badgersCons: - Plot driven, but not a plot heavy game. Thats a pro or a con depending on what type of game you're looking for. - Pretty short game play. I wish it was just a little longer.- The flow between chapters appeared choppy at times. - I got pretty attached to all of the badgers :(			"

I named them Shaggy, Velma, Daphne, Fred, and Scooby.2) Found food by digging and ramming myself into trees. 3) Had to prevent little fatasses from eating the food off the ground before I fed them. 4) Tried to feed them at night, but had to chase them everytime they ran away. Nearly lost one to the darkness.5) It was a rainy day, and we had to cross a river. I lost Velma to a sudden wave. My heart broke a little but it's okay. She was my least favorite.6) Made it through the rain.7) Some dumbass set forest on fire. Had to find my way out of the flames.8) Hawk picked up Shaggy in the middle of the fire. It was all a blur. Must have been the clouds of smoke.9) Made it out of hell.10) Went about my day as normal until the hawk picked off Daphne and Fred. 11) And then there was one...12) Tried running fast enough accross field to avoid hawk. Failed.13) Got carried away by hawk but got to see Scooby carry on my legacy.10/10 would sacrifice life for Scooby again.			"

												This game is very emotionally intense. The baby badgers suck you in with their cute little barks and whimpers. And protecting them from a giant death bird bonds you for life. And then you notice that you only have four trailing behind you. So you go look for the lost baby badger, and you see him gray and lifeless a ways back. Or you'll see your pups run off only to have there be one less when they get back. And that's really hard. I'm sure there are some folks who can handle that; personally I cried like a dingo ate my baby when the last one got swept away in a flood. From an artistic standpoint, this game is flawless. It hooks the player in and gets them emotionally attached to its nameless little characters, each one with its own individual patterning. And it'll rip your heart out. Play with caution.			"

I lost my babies several times at night because something made a noise and we ran in opposite directions. Really hit me in the feels.I'm glad I got it on sale, I'm not sure if I would pay $10 for it.

												*************POSSIBLE SPOILER************Shelter was a very beautiful and emotional game but it is short. The game doesn't need to be any longer than it is, the animations are a bit glitchy and sometimes there may be a graphical error but beyond that Shelter was amazing. The music in the game should also be acknowledged- it both helps translate the raw and guttural emotions of being a mother badger to the player as well as paint the scene for each stage. Though proceed with caution- the game is not so much about your survival; it is about taking care of these five little cubs. Each of them are almost constantly hungry, and even as they age and are less prone to hunger, as a mother badger- you (or at least I have felt this way) will still proceed to feed and protect them. ~~~~ VERY LIKELY TO BE A SPOILER ~~~~You feed and protect these, in your heart, still baby badgers until your final breath. The final stage was incredibly dramatic. Though they are now grown and capable of fending off for themselves, you still mother them and until that moment you are stripped away from them- they depend on you for their safety. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~So anyway, this is my first review. It's a short game, beautiful, touching, well executed and it has a very strong musical accompaniment. I'd suggest this game to anyone looking for a break from the normal gore and willing to step into a new kind of violence. A gracful  one that is likely to be very realistic with one that actually exists, just more descretely in our lives but painfully apparent through this game.			"

												Shelter is a game where you play as a Mother Badger and must look after your 5 children. To look after them you must lead them to safety while making sure they are fed. To ensure their safety you must run and hide in thick grass from a Hawk, lead them across raging rapids, and help them escape from a fire. You scavenge food for them, which could be anywhere from plants in the ground to fruits in trees to catching live prey and letting them feast upon its miserable existence. If you lose 1 of your children to anything you must protect them from or if you let them go hungry, it is a sad and emotional feeling that is created upon seeing it pass away. The game has a heart wrenching end that is almost guaranteed to bring you to tears. If you have about 2 hours to spare, buy this and play it, you will not regret your decision.			"

												Overall, I would recommend this game. The music is soothing and the graphics are unique. The story centers around a mother badger leading her cubs forward, all while finding food and protection against the elements. The main game is quite short (1hr-1.5hr tops), but there is an add-on that extends the replay value a bit. I purchased this while on sale, as $10 seemed a bit steep for a game so short (but's that's just my opinion). However, I am quite glad I bought it and would recommend it.6 out of 6 badgers agree			"

												The worst thing about this game is that the first part in the den has no instructions. There's also no part in the menu where you can view the controls and know what your badger is capable of. But after you figure out how to get out of the den, there are tutorials. Aside from that, it was a fantastic game. It took me less than an hour to play through all the levels. It's a simple enough game about survival. For the most part you're just walking around, trying to keep the baby badgers alive by feeding and protecting them. I recommend this game for those who like exploratory games and don't mind sad endings.			"

												Shelter came in a Humble Bundle for me eons ago. When I first got it, I fell in love with the graphics immediately. Shelter follows the story of Mother Badger and her five cubs. You have to overcome the challenges of the wild to ensure the survival of your litter. It's a quick game, with about an hour of game play, but a lasting impression. The game is moreso a moving art piece. The plot progresses slowly, changing only when the chapter shifts. Essentially, you set the pace for the game and you have limited freedom in exploration. Overall, the maps are pretty linear, but you can sniff around. The mechanics for the game are simple, and it's pretty low stress (apart from wanting to save your cubs). Feed them, feed yourself if you choose, and move forward. Pros:- Artistic masterpiece- Great sound track; super relaxing- I got pretty attached to all of the badgersCons: - Plot driven, but not a plot heavy game. Thats a pro or a con depending on what type of game you're looking for. - Pretty short game play. I wish it was just a little longer.- The flow between chapters appeared choppy at times. - I got pretty attached to all of the badgers :(			"

With a uniquely captivating artstyle, this linear story of a badger family is fabulous. While its gameplay is simplistic, it is well designed and tells its tale well. The soundtrack is pleasant and matches the environment well. I would recommend this to those who like games which are more about the environment and story then the gameplay.			"

												It's something different from what I'm used to play. Also it's different from other survival games, since here you must take care of your children while you yourself seem to be untaouchable and can't die of starvation. The game also has a rather unique graphics solution. An excellent example of how you can make a beautiful game with low graphics. It's very beautiful in an artistic way.Gameplay is simple - explore, find food to feed your cubs and protect them from various dangers. Your primary goal is to get ahead, explore untill eventually you reach the end. Food source is limited despite the fact that you can harvest fruit, vegetables and even hunt small or not that smal animals, so it's best not to linger too long in one place, but keep moving ahead.As for the cons: There's no tutorial to start you up. You start the game in a cave unaware of what you can and must do. Luckily community guides can help (spoler: that little white furry thing that apears to be dead is not dead, it just needs food)There are some elements of a tuturial in a form of flash images that display a message, but in my oppinion, it's not enough. I saw a picture of rocks in a river, I suspected it might indicate that we can hide behind rocks, but I was not sure about that and did not wan't to risk it... Yeah I should've hid behind the rocks.Over all I like the game and I will buy the sequel, but it was really short. I finished the game in about half an hour and later replayed it to end it in the best way possible and now I don't see myslef playing it again. It's nice and I enjoyed it, but the reply value is really low.			"

												Crashed twice before I could finally get past the first section. Very short, but feels really long because of how bored I got by the end. Framerate is terrible in the last section. I will give it this though. I did feel bad every time one of my babies died. Unfortunately, that's also the worst par. The first two died at night because this game hardly explains anything, and I had no idea what was going on. I'm still mad about that. The third was swept away. (That one was mostly my fault though.)I named the last two Sans and Papyrus to remind me of a better game. When they died, I couldn't even off myself and was horrified at the thought of starting all over from the beginning. Luckily, that wasn't the case. My last two babies survived till the end, and then I returned it.0 out of 5 badger babies. Would not play again. Not really worth the $1.50.			"

												Feels like a proof of concept rather than a complete game, but it's short (only 2 hours) so it's forgivable. There's no tutorial or indicator of what is what. So it's basically a guessing game at the start unless you look up a tutorial or walkthrough. But the learning curb is really easy, which makes it again kind of forgivable. I ended up having to repeat the ending twice to be sure that, that was the real ending and not me messing up. It's fun and interesting but you can basically skip this one and go on to the second which is a vast improvement on this one.(The yes/no reccomendation doesn't help, there really should be a middle option.

												Shelter is a charming and quite moving game with a striking art style. It suffers from a number of minor bugs, and slightly awkward controls and camera, but nothing that significantly diminishes the overall experiences. That said, it's worth pointing out that the game has a playtime of only just over an hour and lacks the variety between playthroughs to merit many replays, so bear that in mind.I would recommend this game for anyone into more arty games, or who is looking for an emotionally powerful game with more gameplay and mechanics than you find in other genres like walking simulators. Further, this is a good example of a ""short and sweet"" game that won't waste your time, so if you're time poor and looking to fill an evening, this is a good choice. In addition, if you're considering whether to buy this or Shelter 2, I would say this is the superior experience and would recommend you try it (even if you think lynxes are cooler than badgers).

												I'm obsessed with this game, the art, the music, the concept, everything about this game was done beautifully! Won't comment on the ending of course since it's pretty much the only thing that can actually be spoiled, but I barely made it with all 5 of my babies! (whom I named of course; Mini Me, Zero, Stripe, Beatle, and Orion)The game can be intense, it becomes immersive very quick so when you lose a baby there's a real sense of panic which I hated and appreciated at the same time hahaPeople had been rather harsh on judging this game so I was a bit skeptical at first but imo, everything about it was done perfectly 15/10 would pay to stress over virtual badger babies again.

												It's midnight and a soft yelp from behind me indicates that my first pup has been claimed by the creatures of the night. I would lose two more over the course of my journey.  Disheartened, I took a step back to remind myself that this was only a game and the burden I felt from the loss of my pup was unwarrented.Rather than calling it a game, Shelter unfolds into something closer to interactive art. The soundtrack is alluring and aptly sets the scene for a surpsiginly emotional (if short) adventure. The relationships you develop with your pups will evoke feelings from you in a way that only art can do.I would not say this game is quite worth its current price of $9.99, but if you happen to catch Shelther on sale, you will not regret the purchase.

I finished it after about 1 hour, but I plan to play it again in near future. It's not a game for the mainstream in any way, but also thats not what it was made for.I think just looking at the preview pictures will tell you rather you'd like it or not - that was the case for me.

I would be upset if I paid full price considering the length of the game, but I look forward to play the second one because it looks to have achivements (something this one doesn't have) which I believe means added length and challenges. :-D			"

												Wow~ I can really say its a really impressive game. Bad graphics doesn't mean its a bad game.

Although its a really simple game , I'd say woohh, it's really relaxing and can even make you feel ""feels"" 2) Great Soundtrack 3) Can actually change the way you would look at things. 4) Ability to train you in certian areas like responsibility, caring, leadership, etc... 5) Crying simulator Cons ~ 1) Unstable optimization 2) Not so detailed graphics (But still really relaxing) Should you buy it? - Definitly! It's a must play for everyone!! Just don't play this before an important event or else people would ask why do you look sad or even ask what's up with your eyes. :/			"

												Found this game visually appealing, and with a very good story behind it. Easy to get an emotional attachment to your babies, and then hate yourself if one dies. But You get to headbutt trees and kill foxes as well as other badger things.Definitely do wait to get this game in a steam sale though since I don't feel it has much replay value to it but, then again opinions differ. Overall: A great game that you should play at least once.			"

												First off, the art style of this game is breathtakingly beautiful. The soundtrack fits the scenary/scenario and can be very relaxing. The cubs are so cute and I really became attached to these kids. However, there is little to no instructions; this makes the death of one your cubs (0r all) 100% guaranteed. It can be frustrating because there are certain areas, such as rocks or unleveled ground, that is ""closed off"" to the player. I mean, seriously? A badger can't climb over a rock? Also, the gameplay is about an hour long and the last level is just...no. It was too confusing and the ending left you thinking, ""Wait, did it even end? Is that it?' For $1.49 (I bought it on sale), I recommend this game if you want to kill some time. I would NOT recommend this for it's full price though.			"

												This is a great game for someone looking for an artsy, emotional sort of experience. Playing as a mother badger was a stressful and enriching experience from a storyline perspective. I will say that the game is short, but the ending tends to stick with you.Controls can be a bit funny when having to feed the badger pups. You aren't always going to be able to feed the one you want, especially in the night-time portions of the game. Other than that, they follow you around quite nicely and don't get into too much trouble!I would certainly recommend this game to friends.			"

												This game is a cool concept, but remember it's just that - a concept. The music can be distractingly frenetic (I'm not sure if they're trying to procedurally generate it or it's just French), it's quite short, and ultimately it doesn't feel fully fleshed out. Which isn't to say there's nothing to like. It takes almost no time to feel genuinely protective of your cubs, and chaperoning them through the world is fun. And it has a satisfying ending, even if it is short.Finally, if you beat it, make sure to let the credits roll completely. You'll feel better.			"

I ""beat"" it in about an hour (not rushing through, though you can probably take up to 1.5 hours) and I am certainly left with a set of feels I didn't expect going into the experience. Not worth the full price, but for the $2.50 I spent (far less than than half of a movie ticket that would give me only slightly more than double the entertainment length) it was well worth it. Be aware, there is little to no replayability, but the conversations you can have about the game could go well on into the night.			"

												Shelter is a game with an interesting concept but deeply flawed implementation.  The game relies on you to build a bond with your progeny but never does anything to make you feel attached to them.  Because of this lack of attachment, the game breaks once you realize it’s easier to just let your children die and run to the next objective.  Combine this with twisting levels that are easy to get lost in and a playtime under two hours, it’s hard to recommend even when it’s on sale.			"

												A short yet beautiful adventure where your maternal/paternal instincts take over. It's a charming and short game about motherhood and trying to protect your young in a cold world. The game clocks in a little over an hour yet it doesn't overstay its welcome with its simplistic mechanics of feeding your young, trying to keep them together and keeping them from being devoured. The game is pretty simple but keeping your young alive is surprisingly difficult and over the course of your hour you'll find plenty of twists and turns and new mechanics to keep things free. You'll mostly be wandering around, trying to feed your children by either knocking down apples or even hunting small animals. There will even be times where you are met with more children than food and you have to choose who to feed (hungry children will fade and grow weaker and slower making them easy prey). Avoiding eagles, creatures of the night, trying to keep them calm when they run away scared and keeping them alive during natural disasters makes you grow attached to them. My only criticism is that for a game so short there are loading screens (which are quick) but load into very different areas of the forest. Such a short game would have been much better at providing a more seamless transition between the ""areas"" of the forest. All in all it's a great game.			"

												Shelter is a charming and quite moving game with a striking art style. It suffers from a number of minor bugs, and slightly awkward controls and camera, but nothing that significantly diminishes the overall experiences. That said, it's worth pointing out that the game has a playtime of only just over an hour and lacks the variety between playthroughs to merit many replays, so bear that in mind.I would recommend this game for anyone into more arty games, or who is looking for an emotionally powerful game with more gameplay and mechanics than you find in other genres like walking simulators. Further, this is a good example of a ""short and sweet"" game that won't waste your time, so if you're time poor and looking to fill an evening, this is a good choice. In addition, if you're considering whether to buy this or Shelter 2, I would say this is the superior experience and would recommend you try it (even if you think lynxes are cooler than badgers).

You harvest food, sneak around (There are birds that hunt you, and yes, they are frieghtening), and explore. The game sets a tone of bright and innocent in earlier levels, and becomes dark and depressing in later stages. I personally fell in love with the kin and really, REALLY, wanted them all to survive. But, this objective was diminished in one level where it seemed impossible to get through without one of the small badgers dying (leaving only a peep noise). This made me very angry as it seemed like a design choice, ruining my experiance. But maybe this is the devs teaching us something....You can't always have what you want, your heart WILL be broken and sometimes there is nothing you can do about it. Maybe im thinking about it too much. I did cry (like a little ♥♥♥♥♥) when I first finished the game and was a little disappointed about the ending (see previous points). But overall this game was a great experiance and I highly recommend it to everyone!!! 8.5/10			"

												This is a very short and cute game about you, a mother badger, that has to protect and feed her offspring. The game is very simple and straight forward. You can beat the game in less than an hour, but there is an extra feature called Nurture.  Which is a daily thing that you do in game. The game design and music is very fitting and I find it just adorable. I got the game on sale and feel it was worth the experience.			"

												This game very cleverly uses it's dialog-free narrative to make you genuinely care about your llittle badger family, culminating in a suprisingly rich story of life and death, the brutality and beauty of nature. This is not a fast-paced game, it's not ""high-octane"" or any other AAA tag-line, instead it's something a little rarer... Shelter braves to be different.You'd need a heart of stone not to feel the highs of parenthood and the lows of tragedy in Shelter. Check out Shelter 2 for the fox family. (coming soon!)			"

												Looked like an interesting game, and the concept is great - but the game itself was a real disappointment.  Controls and movement didn't feel very responsive and the gameplay wasn't very interesting.  I was hoping for a simulation game that felt immersive and interesting... in my opinion that is not this game.  This is more of a ""try to use stealth with  clunky unintuitive controls and not much depth"" game.  Others may disagree, but I'm generally pretty happy with most of the games I buy - or can at least usually find something that I can enjoy... not so much with this one.			"

												Definitely worth it for the 2 dollars I paid.I did emotionally become attached to my baby badgers as the game progressed, however there were some gameplay issues that detracted from the experience.I dislike it when levels force me to walk, rather than run. It just takes me out of the experience. Only one level did this though. The dangers of the environment are harsh, but realistically so. Nature is crazy after all.The only other thing was, there's no explanation as to how to do anything, but it's simple enough to figure out as you go. I guess that's a metaphor for life? Either way, it's a good game. I enjoyed it.Only 1/5 of my baby badgers survived. I am a terrible Badger mom.			"

												Definitely an “artsy” game. If you aren’t the type of person who sees games as another form of artistic expression, don’t bother with this. The graphics are a stylized, washed-out look and the gameplay is minimalistic, to put it generously. It seems extremely insubstantial for MSRP, and if I had paid that I’d feel cheated. However, 50% or more off and I’d be happy with the purchase.Just a note: developer, why did you pick the most evil animal on Earth for us to be sympathetic for? Maybe that was the cunning plan: to show those terrifying creatures from Farcry 4 to just be trying to survive…by biting people’s legs off. "

												A simple but immersive game where you play a mother badger trying to shepard five cubs through the merciless natural world, eating everything in sight to try and keep them alive. You will dread the darkness, fear the fire, and hurl invective skyward at those ****ing eagles. There's no real complex mechanics at work, and the fact that everything is pretty straightforward lends itself greatly to the immersive experience. There's no stopping to try and remember how to do something. You pretty much run forward and bite things. Or threaten to bite things. You're a badger, biting is kind of your thing.The only frustrating point I ran into was when the mother badger apparently bugged and wouldn't drop a piece of food. This created obvious eating-related problems for her cubs on that level... A cub had passed out from hunger and then been eaten in the darkness, so I guess she was hanging onto it to try and revive him, but it was too late for that. I guess the moral of that story is: don't dwell on the past, you've got hungry badgerlets to feed in the present.9/10 would learn valuable life lessons again			"

												I don't get what other people were seeing in this. I don't hate it, I just don't recommend it to others. Shelter is a game where you are a mother badger escorting 5 smaller badgers to a different part of the forest. But Oh No! There are foxes, hawks, fires, floods, and more along the journey. The game begins with only 4 cubs and a grey one that appears dead on the floor. Without tutorial, you're supposed to know that to proceed you need to feed the baby badger a root. This never comes up again and it feels needless. After that, you proceed to learn how to get food (which you already did), how to hide, how to bark, and why you should hide. The problem is that's about it. The entire game is basically the tutorial portion repeated a few times. You'll find yourself in several hawk chase scenes and they just don't feel tense after the first one because its just the same scenerio over and over. The hawk squaks ever time you walk out of the grass, regardless of where it's shadow is and you ""just"" make it every time. My other problem with this game is that for a baby escort game, there's a lot of times where you'll find yourself saying ""Why did my baby die this time?"" Additionally, the gamma here is horrendous. Everything looks like your screen's blacklight is malfunctioning, but there's no way to change the visual settings. On top of that, there's a number of graphical glitches, such as floating trees and the camera constantly clipping or otherwise being annoying. I didn't even feel particularly sad when my baby badgers died because at first I thought it was scripted and since I'm not controling them, I have no ability to stop them from getting ?eaten by an owl? or swooped up by a hawk. For that reason, I don't even understand the ""crying into a pillow"" meme that litters the positive review section.			"

												9/10 A little gem. Beautiful art, simple but well-designed game mechanics. The chief merit of this game is how it challenges the typical narrative frames within which most games operate to provide a truly compelling--emotionally compelling--gaming experience. Sounds silly, but as a mother badger, you get very emotionally invested in keeping your little cubs alive. I've done my fair share of ""escort quests"" in MMO's, but this--whether because of how utterly dependent the cubs are or how unstoppable some of the predators are--really stirs your protective instincts. Not sure whether non-parent players will experience the same thing. That moment when you look behind you and you only see four cubs where there were five a moment ago is truly disheartening. I confess I didn't do so well on my first play-through (which took less than an hour). So I tried again, armed with my knowledge of the maps and mechanics--and did a little better. The ending of this little narrative is powerful.The only thing that knocks this down to 9/10 is that it crashed on Mac (a QA misstep acknowledged by the studio), forcing me to replay almost an entire level.Hats off to Johannes Wadin and Might & Delight. I confess I was a little disappointed to see they have made a sequel. A major appeal of this game is how one-of-a-kind it is. I'm not sure what a sequel can add.			"

												This is a lovely game where you are a mother badger guiding her young. You have to keep them safe and provide food, a task that was quite difficult for me to manage. The visuals are what stand out for me, everything feels like a watercolor painting in terms of texture and I love the ambient feel of the game. I would reccomend this if you want to take a break from the usual, but still want a challenging expirience rather than a ""sit back and chill"" sort of expirience.			"

 What a great game Shelter is an emotional journey through the harsh forest as a mother badger. I absolutely loved it, and it taught me a thing or two about how hard it is for creatures in the wild to survive. Here are the positives: The artwork is beautifully simple, and adds to the atmosphere of the gameThe story keeps you interested with the different things that happen (I won't give too much away!)The music is intriguing and adds to the storyThe game makes you feel like you really are the mother badger, having to protect your cubs, and therefore pulls at some heartstrings throughout the story. And here are some negatives:The main story is relatively short, only lasting about one and a half hours if you are going slowly and appreciating all of the artwork. However, there is a second part of the game, Nurture, where you have to go back to the game every day for about 5 - 10 minutes to check on your cubs, so that keeps you coming back for more. In Nurture, alot of it is just running up and down the map to get to your cubs which is just holding down the shift key, which can get quite boring at times.But in conclusion, I would highly recommend this game and it is defintiely worth the money that you spend on it.

There were sad times and proud times, and the ending was such a twist!!I loved playing every bit of it and will continue to play it over again and again.I strongly recommend this game to anyone who loves the way of nature and enjoys emotional games!

												10/10 would badger my friends to play this!Shelter is a rather short game, with a cute story centering around just what nature is all about. The art and playstyle are very simple; there's nothing remotely difficult to this game, but every detail ties in to really invest your emotions into this badger family and everything they have to go through. Even the music is beautiful, giving just a small amount of unease to solidify that anything could happen during your trek through the forests.There is also a ""Nurture"" mode where you play for several minutes a day to feed and raise cubs, and the map size available to you gets bigger every few days. Just a cute little additional time-waster.			"

												This game is wonderful!, you get so immersed, and its so exciting!Any one considering to buy this game, DEFINITELY SHOULD, although the game last about an 1 hour and a half- 2 hours, there is all ways nurture mode, where you can feed and protect your cubs- without an ending, as it is endless i thinkBut this is my storyAlthough the first time i died. Basically, i was very happy- i had got to the last section, with 4 of my badgers healthy and happy, their names were Oscar, Jerry, Sam and John- I lost Joe to the waves. So i was feeding and feeding and feeding them. Then i was crossing between these two ridges. But then i heard the eagle scream, and the music came on. I was paralyzed with fear, and then the eagle took John. All my happiness went instantly. I tried to run to the closest bush, when i looked behind me to see Oscar being taken. I was filled with shock and terror- everything had changed so quickly!Eventually i gained the courage to go back, i ran into a bush- and sure enough, the eagle was there.I then spent an odd 6 minutes to find where to go. Then the music stopped, the eagle went, i sighed a sigh of relief.Then the eagle was yet again there again- BUT THERE WERE NO BUSHES AROUND!!!!!!!You can see how this can get very excitingIn went into i thin bush, the eagle was coming down and down, but i and my cubs were still alive. But a swoosh of an eagle pushed me out of the bush, then- CRUNCH- i was in the eagles arms.With mama dead, the little puny cubs had to defend themselves, i wonder what will happen to them.But the good news is that i can play stage 5 again, because a wonderful thing called save!

												This game is so good. It actually is very emotional, and i remember i picked it up when it just came out, and had probably only sold a few copies. You are a mother badger who takes care of her young, hoping to relocate them to a safer home. You'll encounter terrible weather, and harsh predators which will make your journey physically and emotionally challenging. The company continues to put out new shelter titles every year, and i strongly recommend purchasing all of them, if you want a very peaceful, relaxing game.			"

												*************POSSIBLE SPOILER************Shelter was a very beautiful and emotional game but it is short. The game doesn't need to be any longer than it is, the animations are a bit glitchy and sometimes there may be a graphical error but beyond that Shelter was amazing. The music in the game should also be acknowledged- it both helps translate the raw and guttural emotions of being a mother badger to the player as well as paint the scene for each stage. Though proceed with caution- the game is not so much about your survival; it is about taking care of these five little cubs. Each of them are almost constantly hungry, and even as they age and are less prone to hunger, as a mother badger- you (or at least I have felt this way) will still proceed to feed and protect them. ~~~~ VERY LIKELY TO BE A SPOILER ~~~~You feed and protect these, in your heart, still baby badgers until your final breath. The final stage was incredibly dramatic. Though they are now grown and capable of fending off for themselves, you still mother them and until that moment you are stripped away from them- they depend on you for their safety. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~So anyway, this is my first review. It's a short game, beautiful, touching, well executed and it has a very strong musical accompaniment. I'd suggest this game to anyone looking for a break from the normal gore and willing to step into a new kind of violence. A gracful  one that is likely to be very realistic with one that actually exists, just more descretely in our lives but painfully apparent through this game.			"

I'm a big fan of the graphics, and while it doesn't take a very long time to finish, it can be a little confusing when trying to get the hang of things. Though the story is very linear, it definitely had a strong impact on me and my experience. I guess you'll have to play it to find out.			"

Meander through the wonders and dangers of nature while caring for your young, finding them food and sheltering them from the varous perils that you face along the journey. Challenging, fun and relaxing. It is a story told without words and it's bittersweet. I love this game. Looking forward to playing Shelter 2 and other Might and Delight creations!			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Shelter is a game developed and published by Might and DelightThere is no questioning that Shelter is a work of art. It employs a graphics style all its own, the end result of which delivers at once a realistic and alien world. The natural environment is at once your friend and enemy, and you and your five badger cubs must make a truly hazadarous journey through itCan you provide enough food for each badger cub to survive? Can you guide them safely past the flying bird's shadow? Can you hope to navigate them all past the deadly rapids? When the forest is aflame, can you quickly discover the safest route? Everything is questioned when in natureShelter is a tense and emotional experience you should make time to play. The whole game isn't much longer than an hour or two in length, but that brief time spent is really something remarkable RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Right from the get go life and death are right in your face. You spend this (concise) game caring for your cubs but facing the harsh realities of the circle of life. It was very honest. It communicated a lot in a very short time. It left quite an impression and I reflected on it for a while afterwards.			"

												Shelter is a touching and unique experience, highly recommended to any animal lover. You will experience the beautiful and dangerous aspects of nature through the eyes of an animal. However, I bought it on sale (90% off) and I would not recommend to pay full price for it since it's a very short experience (a little more than 1 hour).			"

												First, I thought Corwallace was dead. He wasn't.That joy was soon stripped away from me when in the dead of night, we lost him.The 5 of us who survived carried on though rain, fire, and into spring.AND THEN DIMMY, MY FAVORITE, WAS EATEN BY A BIRD.Live on my sons. Carry on my legacy, Timmy, Jimmy, and Rimmy.I tried to be the best for you. I hope you understand.			"

												This game really makes you thinl about how a person or an animal etc. Always has it worse than you. at least one. A sad ending but the one you would want the than the one that could happen. this game makes you think about the fact that is nothing lasts forever... Great game I got it on sale-89% off. Really good deal only $1.09. But I can still see why someone would buy this game for $15.00. Great game, lasts about 80 minutes, but 80 minutes of time that is 100% worth it. Pick up this game and try it out for yourself.			"

												The control is very confusing. The game provides little to no instruction, I had to google it. The gameplay is okay. I lost 1 baby in chapter 1 after getting lost over and over again. My heart is broken.			"
