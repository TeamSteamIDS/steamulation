												If your a Homestar Runner fan, get this game. If your not a Homestar Runner fan, watch all the Strong Bad Emails (by the way there are 204 episodes of Strong Bad Emails), Everybody to the Limit, and this years april fools toon. THEN get this game. Every episode is like a really long interactive sbemail (Strong Bad Email) and I love it! If I were to choose my favorite though it would be a tie between Strong Badia the Free, and Dangeresque 3: The Criminal Projective. I hope very much they would make a Season 2. In Conclusion, this game was worth every penny out of my dad's credit card.			"

												Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive people is a ncie point and click game. Each episode is very unique. As an adventure game you may find yourself stuck at times. Other times I swore up and down I had done everything then I redid everything and it turned out I didn't. If you like the webseries Homestar runner there's a lot to love here. You learn a lot about the characters and they're each well represented and voiced.The games aren't exactly hard, but more on the average scale. Poking around for missed items and clues will sometimes yield a special item. I don't remember if something special happens when you collect them all but you might get an attaboy. The only collectible quest I really tried on was one with Teen Girl Sqaud because you could make your own TGS comic where you kill them all. They're also voiced.It's not really like Telltales' more recent efforts, it's closer to the Sam & Max series. That probably sums up whether you'll like this series.			"

												Am a little fifty fifty on this one, I personally didn't enjoy it that much although there was some fun moments. The game itself is not that bad, neat graphics nice audio simple gameplay it is exactly like the cartoon series homestar runner which I personally didn't watch. I found it more for kids than adults but at some moments it needed a little bit of head scratching to figure out what to do, I admire the creativity of the developers in some areas.I would definitely recommend this game if you're getting it for your child or you're a fan of homestar runner the cartoon series, its price in the sale is very good, other than that you need to be careful finding it childish and hating on it.

												Telltale Games joined forces with Videlectrix to use computers to make video games, and their collaboration brought us the coolest guy on the internet since 2000: the one and only STRONG BAD!(Kids, ask your parents who Strong Bad is!)But I digress: Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People captures everything from the Homestar Runner universe that we all know and love. Strong Bad checks his emails. He pesters everyone. He kicks The Cheat. He plays his Fun Machine. Coach Z has that weird accent. All that good stuff.The first episode has Strong Bad ruining Homestar's reputation, then having to undo all the damage. It's a good start to the game, with plenty of funny dialogue, decent puzzles, and of course, plenty of in-jokes everywhere. Not everyone may understand the jokes or references, but there are plenty of Homestar Runner cartoons on YouTube you can watch to get with it all. Telltale went all out to assure that the game would perfectly capture the look and feel of a H*R cartoon, and they didn't disappoint.Also, don't forget to make a Teen Girl Squad comic. Because this game is getting ready to look... SOOOO GOOOOOD!!!			"

												I'm not a Strong Bad fan especially (though I enjoy the flash games on the site), but having just finished Episode 1, I have to recommend this game. It's a pre-TWD Telltale episodic adventure, set in the wacky town of Homestar Runner. It's funny, the puzzles make sense, and it's overall a blast to play.			"

												As I have now actually completed all five episodes of Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People: Season 1, I can give the game a proper review instead of just saying that it's a cool game for attractive people, even though, you know, it kind of is. First of all, we'll get this out of the way: Unless you are a fan of the Homestar Runner universe, there is a probability that you won't enjoy this game. It makes endless references and jokes related to the series that you wouldn't understand unless you've seen some of the episodes in question. That isn't to say that you shouldn't buy it just because you might not understand some of the jokes though, either way this game is extremely funny and the humour is very dry, as you would expect from a game where you're controling Strong Bad. This is what you would expect from a typical Telltale Game, it's a (mostly) point and click adventure with clever and satisfying puzzle solving which ultimately turned out to be a lot of fun. The puzzles make sense, the controls are simple (though sometimes a little clunky) and the dialog is hilarious. The gameplay is relatively simple and easy to get into, some mini-games and particular inventory items help to break things up nicely so that it doesn't feel too repetitive. There are a total of five episodes for Season 1, all of which are relatively short but sweet, I'd estimate that they take around an average of 3 hours each to complete.I really enjoyed my time playing this, and while it may not be to the taste of a number of people, I defintiely recommend it to those of you with a good sense of humour, whether you are a fan of the Homestar Runner series or not, episodes 4 and 5 were particularly excellent and stood out the most to me among the bunch, especially in the humourous department. Lastly, the standard sale price is a little bit steep for the amount of gameplay that the game offers to you overall so I would recommend buying it while it's on sale. Either way, you'll get your share of laughs playing this game.			"

												Homestar Runner.com has been quiet for a long time but you can relive the everyday life of strong bad, homestar runner and all the other characters in this easy point and click adventure game.If you were a big fan of Monkey Island, Sam and Max or Day of the Tentacle, You'll well understand the gameplay and creative thinking required for this adventure. Your HUD is simple too, You have your inventory of strange random objects that you pick up along the way, There is some collectables along the way for those who wanna get that 100% completion rating of the game. And just your mouse pointer which helps you choose where to walk, and what to intereact with.Theres a lot of cut scenes and character interaction, So those who arent familar with the website or the characters, you will learn quickly the personalities of the cast in this game, There are some funny moments and some sneaky comments for the mature audience every now and then, Some dialog will have you laughing or smiling, But all of it will definately keep you entertained. During the course of the game, you're welcome to explore the area as it grows and even play some mini games. I had a lot of fun with creating my own teen girl squad comic, but other mini games exist too. And of course, There are going to be some cryptic puzzles that will have you frustrated, trying every object in your inventory on everything, twice or three times just to be sure. And you'll have puzzles which are clearly given away or hinted by conversation with NPCs. I bought this game recently, on my wishlist for a very long time because I didnt like the price but I ended up with like 5 episodes. Maybe I didnt read the store page correctly but I'd understand now why its 10 bucks, Im happy to play on and curious to see what happens next, It's highly colourful game and sticks well to the websites trademark look accompanied by it's fun music too...so if you're a fan of the website, Then the game is clearly a must, however if you're not familar with the site, as I mentioned earlier, You'll still enjoy this game and learn what the cast is all about. Ultimately, It's a point and click adventure and we haven't see a lot of these in a long time, but here's a good one.Get it. "

												This one is one of my favorite point-and-click adventure games. And it's made by Telltale Games and the guys behind the Homestar Runner website. You control the main character and main icon of the show Strong Bad as you destroy people's days, the Strong Bad way. 5 episodes are made, including the long awaited Dangeresque 3. Give it a try if you're into point-and-click adventure games and Homestar Runner cartoons.And for the PS3 users, I recommend you should play the entire season of this game for plenty of trophies and achievements.

												This is a way better game than those new ones Telltale makes nowadays. It's also the closest thing we can get to classic adventures. Let's be honest, if you're a homestar runner fan, you will be willing to buy this anyway, if you're not, i really recommened to look it up before buying this. Full of childish but very clever humour to be expected, so it's a treat for lighthearted people, kids and classic adventure enthusiasts. What are you waiting for?

												IF YOU DON'T LIKE HOMESTAR RUNNNER, DON'T BUY THIS GAME. But if you do by chance like homestar runner and advnture games then this game will fit in perfectly. Some say that the puzzles don't make any sense, but the source material doesn't make any sense either. So if you think about if a puzzle was an H*R cartoon then they seem to make perfect sense. So all in all it's just another masterfully crafted game by Tell tale games. (the system requirements are very lenient too, so if you're running an older PC like me than you're in luck. I mean hell, even the lappy could play this game!)			"

												Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, is a good game. Poker Night at the Inventory insipred me to check out this game. Though other reviews said to watch SBEMAILS first (Strong Bad Emails) and I did (on www.homestarrunner.com) and I enjoyed the humour and style on the show. I then bought the game mostly convinced that I would enjoy it...And so far (after the first episode) I have been enjoying it. It's funny, clever and creative. The characters and the way the fit into the story are good too. Strong Bad himself is very fun to play as! This game is great if you like Homestar Runner, SBEMAILS or any funny point & click game :)			"

												As an attractive people myself, I had always enjoyed watching the Homestar Runner web series and Strong Bad Emails when I was in school. Years ago when I heard they were making an actual real game that was to come out onto the PS3 I almost sh*t myself in anticipation for it. Sadly I never was able to get it, and never could for years to come... Thankfully it's on Steam, and Steam has Summer/Winter sales, which was when I purchased this game. But again at the time, I did not have a good computer and was not able to play it, so I forgot about it for a few years... It wasn't until I looked though my library to see if anything would catch my eye. Of course I saw this and instantly remembered that I NEED TO PLAY THIS F*CKING GAME!Having completed it, it's exactly what I was hoping for! It's a giant interactive Strong Bad Email! This game is filled with jokes and references to other SBEmails, and new jokes that keep within Homestar runners humor. If you are not a fan, I don't recommend this game. Go watch some of their animations on their website, if you enjoyed those, then consider buying this.Telltale Games knock it out of the park with their point and click gameplay that makes it great to have Strong Bad commenting on items in the world, and harassing the other characters. The puzzles are not that hard to figure out and the progression is good. Lots of little mini games to play and collectibles to get. It is just an overall fun experience!However, on one sad note. The PC version never got achievements, where as the PS3 version did. This being only a minor complaint, this means that if people just want to play it just for the jokes/experience, then they don't have to be a completionist and get everything, which again isn't that hard as you will get everything simply from interacting with everything.Pros:- It's a giant interactive Strong Bad Email.- Fits Homestar Runner cartoons to a tee.- Great looking graphics.- Superb interactions with items/characters.- Great Homestar Runner humor.- More fun and enjoyable than Telltale's Walking Dead games.Cons:- If you are not a fan of Homestar Runner, you may not like it.- It is a Telltale game, so some may not like that.- This is a cool game for attractive people only!- No Achievements.- No Steam Cards.

												Oh man, this entire series. I've probably been aware of the Homestar Runner cartoons for at least half my life now so there's already a mild degree of nostalgia here. And Telltale really delivers on the concept; the characters and writing all match well with the cartoons and it's just as funny as ever. I've always liked that comfy spot between ""kid humor"" and ""adult humor"" that they found, it doesn't show signs of either's stupidity but keeps the good parts of each, making it humor that basically anyone can enjoy. As for the game itself, then. It's a competent point-and-click adventure. The only real moon-logic puzzles are for the optional collectibles, while the main storyline is generally easy to progress with only mild experimentation, and usually the plot guides you in the right direction. Plus there's a hint system if you really get stuck, so the game should easily be completable on its own. I used a guide to look up collectibles but little else. It's certainly fun and clever about what you need to do. The minigames in each episode are also all pretty diverse and interesting; they all bear a degree of stylistic suck and aren't too terribly complex nor difficult but they're worth the 15-20 minutes I tended to spend on them, and a nice diversion from the puzzling and slower pace of the main game. For the episodes themselves; it's not really possible to buy them separate I think? But they're all pretty interesting and unique in their own way. The first episode is very straightforward and vanilla and a good introduction to the series. The second's theme is strong as well as inducing plenty an amusing moment, and also contains my favorite of all the minigames (and really the most content in general). The third is a bit weak on the first half but the second half returns to form (plus the music being played is just... special.) The fourth is more linear than the rest but has an entirely different atmosphere that basically necessitates this; it's probably the funniest out of all the episodes too. The fifth also has a strong theme and provides a satisfying finale for the season. Even if they really all have nothing at all to do with each other, since each episode is, like the cartoons, pretty much standalone.All in all though I'd highly recommend this for fans of the cartoons and still would consider it worth checking out even if you know nothing about Homestar Runner.

Sadly, the price is way too high for a game that's 5 years old. If you are willing to make an investment to play one of the last Homestar Runner adventures, I wouldn't doubt you for a moment.			"

												It's quite amazing with all the amount of stuff they were able to put into this. It feels like a long series of actual episodes put into a game which counts itself as five. The puzzel solving plus the point and click aspect makes this a great title. Most people probably have a problem with the $20.00 price, but considering the length that the first episode has during your first playthrough (times that by 5) it's worth the price. I recommend this to the people who grew up with Homestar and who love point and click games. It was made by TellTale, who made The Walking Dead games, so you gotta know it's good.			"

Product received for free
												Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People is a periodic graphic adventure based on the web series ""Homestar Runner"". Which is developed and distributed by Telltale Games with release date on 18 December 2008 (when the full package was released) and a Point & Click involving adventure and comedy.In the game control Strong Bad and over these five chapters live part of everyday life of the character and it can delve into and better understand who he is and his personality which I refer to all the characters, has very striking features.In addition to the typical gameplay mode, there is also between chapters games that are parodies of several classic games, which, depending on their age, will bring you a great nostalgia. In addition to games, there are collectibles that can be anything from clothes to certain diversified items to so extend your game and give you a little more challenge or at least a passing time to be done while in the middle of a mission / task or another.There is a way in game you can take pictures of some time and to bring a little more fun, there is an area that is a studio where you can use the clothes in the middle of the game and can choose a background to create personalized photos .Of the humor is present in the story itself, and unlike many of which can address more serious themes games, but end up spending mood by situations. For example Deponia briefly in which the story has to do with saving the main character of the planet and in the midst of this plot are emposta lines and fragments where there is a great mood. Despite the other episodes are completely focused more random for humor, as already said, however the second episode despite its dose of humor forced him seems to tend to a mood sarcastically calling attention to politics. Here the synopsis:Episode 2 -  “As the episode begins, The King of Town institutes an e-mail tax. Strong Bad is the most heavily affected. However, being unaware of the existence of the tax, he is put under house arrest (with an explosive collar around his neck), a predicament that leads him to unite the citizens to rise up against the authorities. Strong Bad then declares his own plot of land (an empty lot featuring a fence, a spare tire, and a graffiti'd stop sign, which Strong Bad has named ""Strong Badia"") an independent nation. The inspirational speech he gives to the citizens inspires them to create their own independent countries. In order to overthrow the King of Town, Strong Bad must work his way through the countries and unite Free Country USA once again under the Strong Badian flag. ”Things that caught my attention in particular:- The fact that it was made based on an animation directed to the web.- Minigames which diversifies the standard of play mode.- Masking of another character, both to hit picture as to interact in gameplay. Unfortunately use in gameplay is limited to restricted clothes.- Secondary tasks.Finally, Strong Bad's was a game that turned me surprising both for its humor, I came to doubt whether it was really good, as to their quality and why not say the mechanical part in innovation which made the gameplay much more fun and consistent . Deserving my positive note.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/ .Also you're welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.			"

It's funny, the puzzles are clever but make sense, it's fun, the story isn't terrible, and the voice acting is great (aside from some minor issues in episode 1).  HOWEVER:  It is FULL of homestar runner references, to the point where if you haven't watched most of it or don't like it, you probably won't enjoy the game.  The controls are a bit clunky at times, but other than that you can tell they put a good amount of time in making this game great.  If you like homestar runner, get this game.  It's a really solid point and click.  But if you just heard about this game through word of mouth, you may not enjoy it.			"

												Awesome point-and-click game from Telltale for all Hoemstar Runner fans. Every episode feels like a legitimate interactive Homestar Runner webtoon: all are well written, but puzzles and actions you have to complete take a surprisingly amount of thought and strategy. Not only does this hold up as a great Homestar Runner game, it holds up as a great point-and-click game in general.All five episodes combined took me about 12 hours to complete (the time record that's listed above this review is only for Episode 1), and I loved every minute of it. Pick this up, for $10 you won't regret it.			"

Even if you're usually bored by point and click adventure games, the writing is pretty much on par with a typical homestar runner animation. If you don't like or haven't experienced homestar runner, I'd probably pass on this (or go check out homestarrunner.com and see what you think of it).			"

												This is a $30 game; but it's worth it. I LOVE the way Matt Chapman plays Strong Bad (as well as most of the rest of the characters from HomeStarRunner.com). I even like the way Melissa ""Missy"" Palmer plays Marzipan. My Favorite Episode is Episode 5: 8-Bit is Enough. It's a Single-Player game; but you can still chat with friends as you play. I got through Episode 4: Dangeresque 3: The Criminal Projective last weekend. If you are not familiar with Strong Bad or HomestarRunner.com visit ""http://www.homestarrunner.com/"" today.

												Ah Homestar Runner, how you made the 00s an amazing time for internet shenanigans. If you aren't cool enough to remember it, Homestar Runner was an internet sensation 10+ years ago. A couple brothers and their friends wrote, animated, and voiced what I still consider some of the funniest stuff to ever come to Flash (yes, this was back when entire websites were based in Flash and Youtube was but a glimmer in its father's... ""eye""). The humor wasn't for everyone, but it had a totally obsessed following that I'm proud to still be part of.Anyways, this game (or series of episodic games, rather) is based in the amazing Homestar universe. You play as one of the best jackassy characters of all time: Strong Bad. It's a traditional Telltale-style point-and-click adventure series, and it rocks. Hard.... At least if you're a fan of the site. I have no idea what an outsider would think, but if you were a fan you will see so many awesome references your head will explode. The graphics, voiceovers, and writing are all spot-on with what you'd want from a Homestar game, and leaves you wanting more. Some say they thought the puzzles were a bit too easy at times, but I felt as though it hit a nice middle ground. Nothing too frustrating, but not boring either. Pretty much your standard Telltale-style adventure game. Quite frankly, the puzzles were a sideline to what the joy of this game is: running around and interacting with some of the best characters of all time!If you were a fan of Homestar Runner this is hands down a *must buy* for you! If you weren't, well, check out the site (it's still up) sometime. See if its humor is your style and if so, plunk down a few bucks and enjoy. You won't be disappointed!			"

												There are certain companies in the gaming world that dominate a specific genre of games. In TellTale's case, it would be point-and-click adventure games. These people know how to make a fantastic adventure game with wonderfully designed puzzes and great story execution.SBCG4AP is based off Homestar Runner, a long running and very entertaining flash cartoon website with a fantastic cast of diverse and easily recognizabe characters. As such, being a fan of Homestar Runner is definitely reccommended for full enjoyment of this game, otherwise you'll probably have no idea what's going on, and in the case of a few of the puzzles where a bit of knowledge about the characters really helps, you might find yourself having a lot of issues.As for the puzzles themselves, they seem vary in difficulty from episode to episode. I feel like episode 4 is the easiest, but I don't really know which episode I should consider the hardest. Puzzles in just one episode can also have varied difficulty, meaning they don't just increase in difficulty as the episode goes on. And since this is a Point-and-Click Adventure, that of course means that getting stuck will probably lead to the age old method of trying everything with everything. However, you can turn hints on if you have too much trouble, or if you want to hear additional funny dialogue, whichever works.The control is as simple as you would expect in a game like this, point to where you want to go, and click to move there. Hold the mouse to move faster, and while I know you can run, I'm not entirely sure how to get it to work, I think you double-click, but it doesn't always work. Moving to where you want to go can be a bit finicky though when you're on the grassy roundabout for a majority of the game's locations (Bubs' Concession Stand, The Stick, Strong Badia, The Cool Car, The Whale and the like). Your inventory is easy to find and navigate and talking to the other inhabitants of Free Country, USA is as simple as clicking on them and choosing an image from a little chat bubble for your response. Saving your game is easy and in general the game is very streamlined to make playing it simpler and removing a lot of needless menu navigation.In terms of the graphics, voice acting and sound, they're all pretty darn good. The character models look like the characters' 2D flash puppets were just taken and rendered into 3D. All of the locations that Homestar Runner fans recognize are here and accounted for, and there are even other references like the Geddup Noise, that painting of a demon holding a torch (why is he holding that torch?), and there's even a minigame in one episode where you can make a Teen Girl Squad comic. The voices are done by The Brothers Chaps and Missy themselves, and they deliver the characters just as they would in the cartoons. And the music is perfectly like the cartoons, and some are just taken directly from them (One for example is specifically taken from ""Strong Bad is in Jail Cartoon""). Essentially, they feel like you're playing an hour or so long Homestar Runner cartoon, and it's a joy from beginning to end.Overall, a fantastic buy for Point-and-Click enthusiasts, especially those who are fans of Homestar Runner, but you might be able to enjoy it just fine even if you aren't a fan.

												If you are a fan of the Homestar Runner cartoons, then this game is DEFINITELY for you! You play as the one and only Strong Bad, who you might know as the professional email checker hailing from Free Country USA! Across five episodes you will go on an incredible point-and-click adventure, solving puzzles, collecting items, and talking to people! In my opinion this game is awesome, and you should buy it. ALL of the characters from homestarrunner.com are included, like Larry Palaronchini, Stinkoman, and of course Trogdor the Burninator! You will also visit PLACES like The House of Strong, Bubs' Consession Stand, and Club Technochocolate!

												Well, I excitedly purchased this when it was little over £5 on sale, but let me say, DO NOT BUY! On my old PC, which I bought it on, I was running Windows 7. Every single episode refused to boot despite various fixes I looked up online. I saw no support from the community for Windows 10, so if you have Win 10 like I do now, I wouldn't risk spending your money. I imagine the game to be something of quality, however, having it not boot at all makes me not at all recommend it!			"

												I recently bought the ""Telltale games pack"" for $43 and i played this game first since I had seen the character, Strong bad, in Poker Night at the Inventory. I didn't understand much about the game since I hadn't read tyhe comics or whatever its from. I was confused about the whole down syndrome character with no arms and the other characters that were named after emotions with the word ""strong"" in front of them. This game seems good for someone who understands the characters and storyline but bad for someone who doesn't. Eh, maybe I'm wrong. I'm not attractive enough for this game,			"

												There is an inherent weakness in the point and click genre and that is that clicking a bunch of stuff in the right order is not that entertaining. However where the magic of the genre lies is when clicking a bunch of stuff in the right order propels an interesting, amusing story with entertaining and likeable characters. That is the key element that this game is lacking. I remember when various catchphrases from  the homestar runner website worked their way into the vernacular but I never found any entertainment value in the site so similarly I found little enjoyment in this game. One good thing about this game is that there are little side things to do away from the main plot. However they are all tedious as the rest of the game. So this game is one to avoid try playing Sam and Max, Back to the Future or Wallace and Gromit to see how to do point and click games properly.			"

												I generally find Homestar Runner somewhat amusing, and I have a particular soft spot for Strong Bad. Telltale Games kicked me in the soft spot.I should have read who the developer was. I might have known better. I've played Sam&Max Season 1 (as much as I could stand) and Wallace and Gromit Episode 1. They all share the telltale marks of a developer who should learn how adventure games work before churning out hundreds of them with random licensed properties attached.Mainly that puzzles in the game should be defined and concluded.If you like repeatedly touching every random facet of a pencil to a piece of paper because it always amuses you to discover the tip makes a mark, I recommend this and any other Telltale Games adventure.

												The trap of lazy and obtuse puzzle design is one that many developers fall into. Indulge me, if you will, and I will tell you a story.Long ago, in a land far, far away, I read Hamlet by Shakespeare. When I finished it late at night, I had the strange idea to look it up on steam. Lo and behold, a game existed that was based off of the infamous play for a very reasonable five bucks. It appeared to be a point-and-click adventure game, but that didn't matter to me. It was too odd, too coincidental, for me to pass up. It downloaded quickly, and I began an hour journey of puzzles with no clear answers, walkthroughs, and a very loose interpetation of Hamlet. This is what I have come to expect from point-and-click adventure games. Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People changes the formula to be less... awful. The puzzles in this  make sense.  I know, that's crazy.Alright, not all of them make sense, but most of them do. I can imagine it being hard to make puzzles that are difficult and coherent, but when it is the norm rather than the exception to have stupidly specific puzzle solutions in games, we've done something wrong. Point-and-click adventure games are notorious for having these sorts of puzzles, and that's because they miss something fundamental in making a puzzle: simplicity. Not simplicity in the answer or in the visual design (although that can help), but simplicity in the tools you are given. Think back to your favorite puzzle game. For a lot of you, it's probably Portal. Portal's central mechanic is deceptively simple; you shoot two portals, and walking into one brings you out of the other. But with that simple central mechanic comes the possibilty of twisting it into new shapes using physics and other, smaller tools and obstacles. Spacechem and Infinifactory are also great puzzle games, and their premise is simple as well. ""Make specific things with these tools,"" the game says to the player, but the creators stretch and mould what it is the player needs to make. This most important of concepts is never used in point-and-click adventure games, but it is in Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive people.There are some strangely specific puzzles, but most of them are pretty well done. Part of it is that there is no item combination. In most adventure games, the player is forced to combine everything in their inventory to find the solution to a problem, but Strong Bad eliminates that by removing that facet of gameplay. You just have stuff, and you can use it all with your environment. Many things only work in specific places, but those place also make sense. In Episode 2, for example, ypu get a lighter. Throughout the rest of the episode you can use that lighter on burnable objects. Makes sense, right? I'm glad to finally see a really good adventure game, but it  is  a Telltale game, and this is what they do best.Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People is fun and challengining, and I very much recommend it.

												I'll be as honest as I can be for this review.I love Homestar Runner. I have the action figures and Homsar Mug, I have drawn each and every character, I have grown to love all the characters, Ect. Ect...And I know pretty much 80% of the references in these episodes.And you NEED to know who Homestar Runner is and all of the references. Especially Strong Bad E-Mails...And because I'm such a huge fan, I think this game is great!! In my opinion, While not as good as Sam & Max, It still stays true to TellTale Games. And as an added bonus, It was written and voice acted by The Brothers Chaps and Missy Palmer, So it stays true to the Homestar Runner humor as well!The game has it's flaws. For example, You can give stumped very easily in places, And Strong Bad's hints that he says from time to time aren't very helpful, And you pretty much HAVE to know all the refrences. I mean, Episode 4 is a reference all together, And much more flaws. But the game is still worth checking out if you like a difficult pint and click. Maybe throw a little humor in there as well...

												I feel like this game series immediately lost a lot of its charm by going with 3D animations instead of basing it on the 2D art used for the Flash cartoons. The gameplay wouldn't have been affected, and where necessary it could've occasionally switched to a 3D sequence. Other than that, it's just not really as funny as the web cartoons. The dialogue for those is usually short and snappy, and here you get kind of mired in the necessary conversations for adventure game dialogue. A lot of the references to stuff from the web cartoons feel kind of tired. I've been playing it for a while now and after 10-15 minutes I just have to save my game and go do something else for a while.I will say the adventure game aspect of the game is pretty solid, it can get tricky without becoming frustrating. It's not a bad game series, but a little disappointing.			"

			Available now on PSN and PC/Mac! PSN: http://bit.ly/XI4xGU PC/Mac: http://bit.ly/WwQ2lD You may already know Strong Bad from his regular appearances answering emails and doling out not-so-useful...		

From the Telltale Games that brought you Sam & Max 1-5, and Videlectrix that made Trogdor: Let's Burninate Phonics, Trogdor & Rabbit Algebra comes Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People or SBCG4AP for short. It's got the Complete Cast from Homestarrunner.com (Plus the Lame Ones too!). You'll go to all the cool places they go in the Homestar Runner cartoons in 5 totally awesome monthly episodes after you Purchase them & download them for the PC, Nintendo Wii's WiiWare & the PlaySstation 3's PSN Store through your Internet Connection.In Episode 1:Strong Bad receives an email suggesting he ""beat the snot out of"" his long-time rival Homestar Runner. When he gets there, however, he discovers Homestar has entered the Free Country USA Tri-annual Race to the End of the Race & decides it would be even more fun to beat Homestar at his own game than to simply beat him up. He disguises himself as Homestar, keeps him distracted away from the race & loses the race. The resulting chaos turns Homestar into a loser, earns him a criminal record, and makes his girlfriend Marzipan break up with him. Though Strong Bad is initially proud of himself for ruining Homestar's life, these efforts backfire when Homestar moves into Strong Bad's house, believing him to be ""the only friend I've got"". In an attempt to get Homestar out of his house, Strong Bad must undo the harm he did to Homestar's life.In Episode 2:The King of Town institutes an email tax. Strong Bad is the most heavily affected. However, being unaware of the existence of the tax, he is put under house arrest (with an explosive collar around his neck), a predicament that leads him to unite the citizens to rise up against the authorities. Strong Bad then declares his own plot of land (an empty lot featuring a fence, a spare tire, and a graffiti'd stop sign, which Strong Bad has named ""Strong Badia"") an independent nation. The inspirational speech he gives to the citizens inspires them to create their own independent countries. In order to overthrow the King of Town, Strong Bad must work his way through the countries and unite Free Country USA once again under the Strong Badian flag.In Episode 3:Strong Bad's FunMachine (an Atari 2600-like video game system) suddenly breaks. Strong Bad does not have the money to get it fixed, however. In an attempt to get money, he organizes a Battle Royale of the Bands, complete with local bands and celebrity guest stars; the 80's hair band Limozeen. When this still does not cover the fee, Strong Bad is forced to compete with his own rock band and claim the cash prize.In Episode 4:Strong Bad has finally finished his long awaited film and invites his friends over to his basement for the film's premiere of Dangeresque 3. The player then assumes the role of Dangeresque, embracing the cliches and tropes of the action film genre, with the movie looking like a very low-budget film.In Episode 5:Strong Bad jumps off of the couch and hits the Trogdor arcade machine. The Trogdor arcade machine grows an arm, legs and wings and comes to life. Strong Sad claims that Strong Bad damaged the 8-Bit containment field and needs to order a replacement. Sadly, through an odd series of events, the containment field is broken, resulting in the world of videogames and the world of Free Country USA combining. Video Game Elements & Characters begin invading the real world, and vice versa. In the ensuing chaos, Trogdor escapes his game and ""Burninates"" Strong Badia. Strong Bad must defeat his fiery creation once and for all, by getting party members from other games to advance to the dungeon of the beast and restore balance between the two worlds. But there's just one problem, does anybody know how to kill a dragon?			"

												In what could possibly be the Chapman Brothers' magnus opus, Strong Bad bursts into the video game scene full of all the humour, visuals and style of the popular internet series. Though not without its faults, Telltale brings the Bad to life in its usual way: a point & click adventure game. Fans of Telltale's work or Homestar Runner will likely eat the game up. It isn't terribly hard, but it shouldn't have to be. Most of the charm comes from the characters and the world they inhabit, and in the end that's really what many of us are here for.			"

If yes, then you came to the right place! sorta...Long before the other pointy clicky type of popular web series with Home in it's name, or that Walking simulator that's about as amusing as watching paint dry,  there was the Homestar runner, terrific athlete and star of his own web series of pointy clicky type animations. And by ""star"" I mean co- star. Honestly, even calling Mr. Tights in the hallway a co-star is pushing it. Like, REALLY pushing it.The point here, Whatshisface, is that the folks over at TT did a collab with he guys that made That web series quite some times ago. It's full of that special heart healthy brand of clicky pointy action, mixed with the usual type of stuff You've come to excpect from both of them, for better or for worse. There's even games within the games! Lately ol Teetee's been slacking off with their newer releases in some respects, but this one pulls all the stops if you gotta get your strong dosage of bad. and by bad I mean good. The game is good. it was a joke. Laugh! On second thought, don't do that. I can't hear you anyway.			"

												From the time when Telltale were still doing adventures with more actual gameplay than making decisions and talking. Strong Bad is just weird, astonishingly peculiar, the world and characters are nothing like you ever seen. Sometimes it might be little childish with its humor, characters are super weird as well, most of them dont have hands, yet they move objects like they do and graphics are simplistic. All being said, it might be still fun game to experience if you like episodic adventures and unusual jokes.			"

			Available now on PSN and PC/Mac! PSN: http://bit.ly/XI4xGU PC/Mac: http://bit.ly/WwQ2lD You may already know Strong Bad from his regular appearances answering emails and doling out not-so-useful...		

From the Telltale Games that brought you Sam & Max 1-5, and Videlectrix that made Trogdor: Let's Burninate Phonics, Trogdor & Rabbit Algebra comes Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People or SBCG4AP for short. It's got the Complete Cast from Homestarrunner.com (Plus the Lame Ones too!). You'll go to all the cool places they go in the Homestar Runner cartoons in 5 totally awesome monthly episodes after you Purchase them & download them for the PC, Nintendo Wii's WiiWare & the PlaySstation 3's PSN Store through your Internet Connection.In Episode 1:Strong Bad receives an email suggesting he ""beat the snot out of"" his long-time rival Homestar Runner. When he gets there, however, he discovers Homestar has entered the Free Country USA Tri-annual Race to the End of the Race & decides it would be even more fun to beat Homestar at his own game than to simply beat him up. He disguises himself as Homestar, keeps him distracted away from the race & loses the race. The resulting chaos turns Homestar into a loser, earns him a criminal record, and makes his girlfriend Marzipan break up with him. Though Strong Bad is initially proud of himself for ruining Homestar's life, these efforts backfire when Homestar moves into Strong Bad's house, believing him to be ""the only friend I've got"". In an attempt to get Homestar out of his house, Strong Bad must undo the harm he did to Homestar's life.In Episode 2:The King of Town institutes an email tax. Strong Bad is the most heavily affected. However, being unaware of the existence of the tax, he is put under house arrest (with an explosive collar around his neck), a predicament that leads him to unite the citizens to rise up against the authorities. Strong Bad then declares his own plot of land (an empty lot featuring a fence, a spare tire, and a graffiti'd stop sign, which Strong Bad has named ""Strong Badia"") an independent nation. The inspirational speech he gives to the citizens inspires them to create their own independent countries. In order to overthrow the King of Town, Strong Bad must work his way through the countries and unite Free Country USA once again under the Strong Badian flag.In Episode 3:Strong Bad's FunMachine (an Atari 2600-like video game system) suddenly breaks. Strong Bad does not have the money to get it fixed, however. In an attempt to get money, he organizes a Battle Royale of the Bands, complete with local bands and celebrity guest stars; the 80's hair band Limozeen. When this still does not cover the fee, Strong Bad is forced to compete with his own rock band and claim the cash prize.In Episode 4:Strong Bad has finally finished his long awaited film and invites his friends over to his basement for the film's premiere of Dangeresque 3. The player then assumes the role of Dangeresque, embracing the cliches and tropes of the action film genre, with the movie looking like a very low-budget film.In Episode 5:Strong Bad jumps off of the couch and hits the Trogdor arcade machine. The Trogdor arcade machine grows an arm, legs and wings and comes to life. Strong Sad claims that Strong Bad damaged the 8-Bit containment field and needs to order a replacement. Sadly, through an odd series of events, the containment field is broken, resulting in the world of videogames and the world of Free Country USA combining. Video Game Elements & Characters begin invading the real world, and vice versa. In the ensuing chaos, Trogdor escapes his game and ""Burninates"" Strong Badia. Strong Bad must defeat his fiery creation once and for all, by getting party members from other games to advance to the dungeon of the beast and restore balance between the two worlds. But there's just one problem, does anybody know how to kill a dragon?			"

												I'll be as honest as I can be for this review.I love Homestar Runner. I have the action figures and Homsar Mug, I have drawn each and every character, I have grown to love all the characters, Ect. Ect...And I know pretty much 80% of the references in these episodes.And you NEED to know who Homestar Runner is and all of the references. Especially Strong Bad E-Mails...And because I'm such a huge fan, I think this game is great!! In my opinion, While not as good as Sam & Max, It still stays true to TellTale Games. And as an added bonus, It was written and voice acted by The Brothers Chaps and Missy Palmer, So it stays true to the Homestar Runner humor as well!The game has it's flaws. For example, You can give stumped very easily in places, And Strong Bad's hints that he says from time to time aren't very helpful, And you pretty much HAVE to know all the refrences. I mean, Episode 4 is a reference all together, And much more flaws. But the game is still worth checking out if you like a difficult pint and click. Maybe throw a little humor in there as well...

												I love the Homestar Runner webseries because of the creative character designs and laid-back world. SBCG4AP is an excellent point-and-click adventure game backed by the Brothers Chaps, with plenty of gags referencing the series, entertaining stories (best is Strong Badia the Free), and even Atari 2600-esque mini-games. Highly recommended for H*R fans.			"

												I NOMINATED THIS GAME FOR:THE “TEST OF TIME” AWARDWords cannot begin to describe the majesty of Homestar Runner. Stop whatever you're doing and buy this now, even if you haven't seen any of the source material. Buy all their merch while you're at it. And if that means you can't pay your rent this month, then do it anyway, because then you'd have played SBCGAP, and that's OK.			"

												Dear Strong Bad,So I played your game. It was funny, and well made. But I guess I'm not into this kind of walk around and click stuff type of puzzling so I got tired of it by the second episode. But I played all the way through, no worries.In short, I loved that it stayed true to Homestarrunner.com story and comedy, but the gameplay got boring for me pretty quick. Sinseriously, Scrolla Buttoonays.			"

												Each episode is an enjoyable way to spend and afternoon. They can be pretty simple as point-and-click adventures go, but it's got a good learning curve, with the puzzles getting more and more complex. In short, this is a cool game for attractive people.			"

												A brilliant Point and click adventure for both newer people and veterens alike. Plenty of brilliant humour for both kids and adults. I couldn't reccommend this more to anyone who wants to play Telltale or point and click adventure. 8/10, play it!			"

												Chances are if you're here you're probably already familiar with The Brothers Chaps, homestarrunner.com, and the lovely and strange denizens of Free Country, USA. Or at the very least you know about the awesome Strong Bad Emails, which became internet famous in the '00s.Anyway, what we have here is a standard, amusing, and very quirky point-and-click adventure.If you're familiar with the world, you'll notice quite a number of in-jokes.Nostalgia factor aside, I dig it.

												The game reminds me of the old Strong Bad Emails, so maybe I'm a bit biased but I do like it. Really not a fan of the point-and-click concept and sometimes it does send Strong Bad in a different direction or too far in one direction, but other than that, I enjoyed the game and am excited to start episode two.

												If you like Homestar Runner shorts you'll like this game, if not or you haven't heard of them you should probably move on. Same humor, same characters and voices; but its a big nostalgia trip chock full of references from the shorts. Definitely worth playing if you don't mind point and click adventures and are a fan of Homestar Runner.			"

												If you were and still are fan of Homestarrunner.com this game is for you. The $19.99 is worth every cent as you tranverse as Strong Bad through Free County, USA and go on fun adventures. Its kind of a open world area or at least tries to be very sucessfully, and the game is good at letting you decide with the ""Hint"" button system whether or not you want to go solo, or let the game hold your hand. I am disappointed that we don't have a 2nd Season, because I would like to have seen how much further in the Homestarrunner Verse the creators could have taken it. But I am content with the game we got.			"

												If you aren't a Homestar Runner fan, go watch the cartoons, then come back to this. It's a decent and fun adventure game, but a non-fan of the series wouldn't enjoy it as much. Shame they never made Season 2, and with Telltale moving to more mature games I doubt there ever will. The game runs unusually. I say this because my laptop uses more power running chrome than this game. It is 8 years old, and the game takes up almost no space. The audio quality is a bit crackly though, but even if you have a wood computer you should still be able to run this no problem			"

												It's a very basic point and click. Quite easy. Straightforward stuff. Basically, the only reason to play it is if you are fan of Homestar Runner. If you are in any aspect, it's absolutely a must-play. There's so many fun references and story points that will bring a big smile to your face. These days Homestar Runner updates are few and far between. This will satisfy that need if you miss them. It renders up to 1080p despite originally being a wiiware game, so no big deal.The 3-d rendering of the characters is relatively well done. Some look a bit odd in 3D, like homestar, due to their inherent design, but characters like Strong Bad and Marzipan actually translate very well and look almost perfect. It doesn't affect the ability to enjoy the game and character designs, if maybe a slight amount.As for which episode is the best, I'd say the first three are all equally enjoyable. The last 2 are very cool, and quite different from the other ones, but they feel a bit shorter and less cohesive, sort of like they tried to do too many things. I also had some glitchiness in episode 4 specifically, but not much else throughout.So, if you're a fan of the series, absolutely play it. Otherwise, I'd say either become a fan by watching stuff on the site before playing the game, or skip it.			"
