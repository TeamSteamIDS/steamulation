												So far the Deponia franchise is definitely keeping up appearances.I played and reviewed the first game in the series and honestly do not remember having one bad thing to say about it. I’m glad to be able to say that the same goes for its sequel.In the first review I said that with some point and click games it can be hard to follow the creators logic when it comes to item combination and puzzles, which more often than not, results in rummaging through a walkthrough at least once or twice and asking you’re self “how was I even supposed to get that?” but with these games it isn’t like that. It is consistently logically throughout the whole game and that definitely applies to Chaos on Deponia as well. Although I found this second game a little more challenging when it came to figuring out what to use with what, (it was either  a harder game or my brain was just refusing to work, which wouldn’t be surprising) I also found it quite a bit more humorous. The sense of humour in these games is a particular part about them that I enjoy the most. The main character is as egotistical yet loveable as ever and there’s some funny references in there that make you chuckle as you play through.Art wise, it is a beautiful as ever. Maybe even more so than last time, you can tell there was a bit of a leap in budget for the game when you switch from the first to the second. Same goes for audio, there is a huge difference when it comes to audio, it sounds a lot clearer and sharper than before, which is a nice addition to the game as a whole.They focus a little more on water rather than land in this one, and I really liked that. There were points during the game where I couldn’t help but just think to myself, “Wow, the graphics for the water look really good.”Of course, I have to quickly mention the chorus singers. What would the Deponia experience be without them? I love them, they are amazing. I look forward to every song between chapters.And lastly, the achievements which I seem to like enough to have played through this game 2 and a half times. (The half because I forgot one measly achievement on my second “achievement gathering” play through.) The achievements definitely aren’t as obvious as they were in the first one, at least that’s how it seemed to me. With the first game I managed to get most of the achievements on the first play through just from general curiosity. This one I managed to miss quite a lot, which even then, although I missed a lot more, it definitely wasn’t as hard as getting all the achievements for the first one. Anyone that has played the first one would know that there was one pesky achievement to try and get, the “Droggeljug” mode achievement. When I started Chaos on Deponia I crossed my fingers and hoped so hard that there wasn’t a similar achievement in this game, and I was in luck!All in all it is a really fun point and click game with a lot to offer. Any fan of the genre would enjoy this franchise. I have heard that a few people didn’t enjoy it because of the main characters stuck up and self-centred ways, and believe me, when I started the franchise I felt the same. But if you can get over that first hurdle in the first game, I promise you he really starts to grow on you as he progresses and grows as a character. I have yet to play the next one, and I have no doubt that it will tie up the franchise nicely.TL;DR : Logical item combinations, great humour, wonderful art, engaging story, an improvement audio/graphics wise from the first one, a great way to continue the series and just generally a great game for your point and click collection. Buy the series!For anyone interested, My Review for Deponia:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/214340/For anyone interested, My Review for Goodbye Deponia:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/241910 "

												Chaos on Deponia starts with a repeat of the first game’s tutorial. Deponia’s anti-hero, Rufus, immediately complains and points this out, making me feel that Rufus and I are on the same page. It’s a nice beginning but what follows is even better.The true opening of CoD is one of the most knee-slappingly funny and creative intros I’ve seen in an adventure game. It brilliantly plays upon the tropes of the genre and established fiction of Deponia. Rufus is brought into the home of an elderly couple, who bicker and talk about Rufus’ as the player kills their pet, breaks their plumbing, and burns their house down. If only all of CoD’s puzzles were so humorous and self-contained.I would actively steer clear of giving spoilers, but CoD would have to have some significant plot reveals and progression first. For a sequel to a game that ended on a cliffhanger, CoD’s plot goes absolutely nowhere. Correction: It goes backward. The plot of CoD mirrors that of the debut: Rufus has once again damaged Goal’s memory implants and must traverse a large city hub to solve puzzles and piece her back together. There is a twist, however. Goal has been split into three personalities: spunky, lady, and child. All of the puzzles in the city progress Rufus in convincing each side of Goal to merge together again. It’s a good concept but I often grew tired of navigating the same dialogue options with all three versions of Goal.If the opening city hub of Deponia made you fall to your knees, you’re going to faint when you enter CoD’s main city that is double, if not triple, in size. CoD is not for the novice adventurer, since there are always so many locations, people, and items to factor into a puzzle. This is not the game’s problem. Its problem is that it frequently does a poor job in directing the player and subtly dropping hints. Perhaps something is lost in translation from the game’s original German, but I often felt lost and frustrated. Grim Fandango has a similar structure but I always thought it was my fault upon discovering a solution. I either wasn’t paying attention or listening to dialogue close enough. This is rarely the case in CoD and considering the game’s large world, that’s unfortunate.The structure of CoD can be frustrating, but the puzzles themselves are often fun and just challenging enough. As with other Daedalic titles, you can always skip a puzzle. But why would you want to skip battling as a platypus? Not all of the game’s puzzles and minigames are great, but they are interesting and nicely tie into the story. You’ll occasionally come across one that will drive you nuts. I feel almost obligated to give the solution to what is one of the most obtuse puzzle solutions ever put in a game. It gives Psycho Mantis a run for his money, that’s for sure. I’ll just say this: Don’t count out the options screen in your puzzle-solving. I nearly went nuts, so you don’t have to.Where CoD fails as a sequel, it succeeds with flying colors as a stand-alone, comedic adventure. Curb your expectations and you’ll discover a great cast of characters that are much better written and voiced than anything else Daedalic has put out. From Rufus’ hard-to-please father to the deluded renegade leader, CoD strives on the strengths of its outlandish characters and gorgeous world. As unlikely as it sounds, CoD manages to look even better than the first title. Secret of Monkey Island-style close-up dialogue scenes add some much needed variety and personality to presentation, and the large city hub is fantastic, full of color and detail. The backdrops still lack animation, though.As disappointed as I am that CoD isn’t more progressive in its design or storytelling, it managed to win me over with its characters, dialog, and slapstick comedy. There are few revelations and twists in CoD, to the extent that I’d recommended it to those that haven’t played the first. Although I loved the comedy and characters of this entry, I miss the scale and sense of adventure that the original game contained. In contrast to the first game, Chaos on Deponia leaves me a little less excited for the next entry, but it also leaves me a little more satisfied with the adventure I just had. If you are up for a serious challenge and some hearty laughs, you won’t be disappointed.			"

												First, do noy play it before playing Deponia. This is the second game in a trilogy. This game is better in every aspect than the original Deponia. Better story, funnier, faster progression. If you liked the first one, this is a must buy. BTW, after you finish this one, get the third, the best in the series.			"

												Let me start off by saying that I am new to point-and-click games. I bought the Deponia trilogy when it went on sale for $14  on greenmangaming. Worth? I think so. I really liked the story because it has it's funny moments. But I suppose because I am new to this genre, I would often find myself stuck and wondering what do next. If it wasn't for online walkthroughs I would never have completed this game. But after completing it with much help, I'm glad I picked it up. It was fun, memorable, and something that I am not used to playing. I suppose trying something new was what made this game refreshing for me.  I would recommend it for that reason alone. Buy if on sale.			"

												Daedalic you've done it again. Chaos on Deponia is another sucessful installment of the Deponia series. What makes this game so good is the fact that they stay true to the style of the game, but are able to add enough layers to make it a great game on its own. It was another opening scene that grabbed my attention (getting the hammer). I was back on another crazy adventure with Ruuuuufus. The witty humor, amazing storyline, new great tunes, and the ever so amazing puzzles make for hours of enjoyment. To expound a bit more, the humor brought in funny stuff from the first game, but always had a fresh twist to it. The story was the same way. If you have watched the trailers you know that Rufus is trying to get off Deponia, but the way the story was written, you hardly remember that is the goal. I never felt like the game was trying to outdo the first one. So although this game is full of Chaos, it was actually planned out very well!""Huzzah, one more game to buy!""Check out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!			"

												My thoughts on Chaos on Deponia:Chaos on Deponia is the second part of the Deponia trilogy.Your mission is to get the beautiful Elysian woman Goal to regain her memories (which she lost because you dropped her off of a flying ship) and to stop the evil Organin from destroying your planet for their own selfish goals.Again you get to puzzle your way through the colorfully designed world of Deponia, leaving a path of chaos and destruction behind you. I seriously have no idea how an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ such as Rufus can be so enjoyable to watch and play for fourteen hours up to now and counting. :DThe puzzles in this game are (in my opinion) not as difficult as in the first game of the series, while the dialogues are even more entertaining than before. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed the first game or just likes puzzle games and/or games with a great sense of humor in general.			"

												10/10 If you played the first one,  I only need say ""Huzzah huzzah one more time"" The sequel to  carries on in the same vein. If you're new to the series. This is the middle part of a trilogy, you should start at the start or you'll totally make a mess of things like time and space, you might even destroy a world! (actually, Rufus being Rufus, you're likely to do all of those things anyway.)			"

HUZZAH ALL OVER AGAIN!Short Verdict: Slightly better than the previous game. Must-have for point-and-click fans. Nice humor, interesting story, great puzzles, unique characters, hours of fun!Overview: Chaos on Deponia is the second game in the adventure, point-and-click trilogy made by Daedelic. You control Rufus, a self-centered jerk who, more than anything, hates Deponia - some kind of a junkyard planet - and wishes to go to Elysium. Well, if you played the previous game,you know now he wants to save Deponia, too. The result is a game full of comedy, awkward moments packed with fun, and even romance.Pros: The interface is really great and easy to navigate The story is interesting, packed with good quality humor, and you'll probably have lots of fun in the way Good length for an adventure game The puzzles are really nice and sober--the game provides you not-too-obvious hints when you interact with the world and they've really hit the perfect mark in this aspect. Also, if you need additional in-game help, you can press space to see the hotspots, which is always good as an option. You probably won't need a guide, if you can deal with just the right amount of frustration that pushes you forward. Characters are really cool and fun. The main character is embarrassingly annoying, but that allows for some ""role play"", you can say, when you try to think like he would as you try to solve the puzzles. Great voice acting The 2D graphics are really amazing The BGM is really awesome--specially the Huzzah songs The cliffhanger for the next game is just perfect--it closes a chapter really well, but you'll want to know what happens nextCons: The game crashed a few times for me (probably 2 or 3), mostly after videos. But according to my experience, it never happens if you skip the Daedelic intro. I can't say it's a huge con, but the pacing of the game is a bit weird for me. At the beginning, you're thrown in a huge area to explore and you have to deal with a lot of tasks. After that, the game becomes a lot more linear. Seems like they rushed to finish the game a little bit.Bought on: Steam Store for R$ 4,99 (US$ 3.99 on the US store at the same time). If you don't have any of the games in the trilogy and think this game is for you, it might be a better idea to buy The Complete Journey (the full trilogy) instead.Verdict: If you're a fan of adventures and point-and-clicks, you most definitely have to check the Deponia series! It's precious. I'm not easy to please when it comes to humor and comedy, but Deponia just manages to do it better than all other games I've played (well, maybe except for Sam & Max, imnsho). Also, like I've said, the puzzles are really smart, the story is interesting, characters are unique, and basically everything you need in an adventure game is there. Don't miss it! But make sure you start with Deponia--don't skip to Chaos on Deponia, it won't make much sense.			"

												Despite giving the first Deponia game a tentative ""thumbs up"" I simply cannot recommend the second game in the trilogy. Chaos on Deponia could easily have been removed from the trilogy since it does almost nothing to further the plot of the series. It features some incredibly obtuse puzzles, and a huge number of locations to explore straight from the beginning, making it confusing to know where you should be going and what you should be doing.My main gripe with all the Deponia games (outside of the terrifically unlikable main character, Rufus) is the gratuitous amount of completely pointless, filler dialogue you have to slog through just to complete simple tasks. Nearly every character you meet will supply you with 6+ dialogue options which will each spawn at least 15 lines of completely inane banter that does absolutely nothing to further the story or even provide mild entertainment. This isn't quality dialogue, like in older LucasArts games, where you actually want to click every option. Even if you ignore most of the extraneous dialogue options, often just trying to accomplish tasks will result in Rufus droning on and on and on with his signature, humorless commentary. It doesn't help that his voice is about as fun to listen to as a nursery full of teething babies with diaper rash. By the end of the game I was skipping through most of the dialogue since it added zero value to the story.The only real point to play Chaos on Deponia is if you already own the trilogy and want to play the games in order. If not, don't bother and instead pick up an adventure game that's actually good, like one of the Special Edition Monkey Island games (which, despite people's insistence on comparing them to the Deponia series, are actually nothing alike, apart from sharing a genre - and that's a good thing).

												Chaos on Deponia continues the adventures of Rufus and Goal. The sequel has a lot of nicely done puzzles, an amazing soundtrack, and great character development. The humour is even better than in the first game, and it's basically impossible to laught at least once every 5 minutes.Gameplay: It's a Point and Click adventure game, you walk around the Floating Black Market, and need to do various asks by the big number of your friends (Or foes). They can sound simply, but you might have to do a lot of walking to do it. You collect items as you play, and you either have to give them to someone, combine it with another item, or put it somewhere. And as you play on, you have to solve puzzles which require a lot of thinking, but are really well made, and fun to solve. If you're very bad at puzzles, then don't worry. The game allows you to skip puzzles if you want. The gameplay gets a 10/10.Soundtrack: The soundtrack is really amazing, it fits with the locations you are currently in, and the instruments sound like the surroundings (Ex. You're near a lot of junk, and the music is done from pots being hit, etc.) And they executed it incredibly well. Another 10/10.Characters: You play as Rufus, which needs to save Deponia from being up by Cletus, and also find Goal and fix her Brain Implant which got split into three parts: Spunky Goal. Lady Goal, and Baby Goal. While you play, you need to make her every personality agree to go to the Doc, which can combine all of the personalities into one. You get a remote which switches between the three personalities, and you need to use it to your advantage. Rufus has apparently ""Changed"" But he's still the same, old, genius. He's extremely funny, he still makes a lot of mistakes, and still thinks Bozo is a pirate.8/10.The game is really incredible, and I extremely loved every single bit of it. If you loved the first game, definitely get this. You won't regret it.Final Game Rating: 8/10. I look forward to buying the third game.			"

 ""So much wonderful potential for a festive, all-consuming fire.""

Atmosphere & presentation: + Well-animated comic look with great attention to detail creates an interesting world. + Each track fits the feel of the situation it plays in. + Puzzle sections offer creative solutions. o Complex puzzles can be skipped. - The sometimes illogical item combinations can lead to a break in immersion. Characters & story: + Well done character development of protagonist and side characters+ Witty dialogues and unconventional conversation options.+ Amusing plot development based on a split personality.+ High quality voice acting.o Based on the German origin of the game, some of the jokes are lost in translation. Summary: Daedalic Entertainment successfully continues with Chaos on Deponia its crazy and fascinating trilogy. In comparison with the first part there have been some improvements regarding the character development of the protagonist and musical presentation.

												I really wanted to give this a thumbs up, and if there was a ""maybe"" vote, the game would definitely earn that, but as it is, I just can't recommend this game.There's still the humorous dialog and zany characters that we loved from the first game, but the second game throws them into a world of nigh-impossible-to-decipher puzzles. I found that too many situations required that special brand of adventure game guesswork – combining random objects, doing random things, or exhausting every single possible line of dialogue with every single character, just in the hope that the game would point me in the right direction. And don’t get me started on that one meta-puzzle – I should not ever have to go into a game’s options menu to solve a puzzle! In the end, I must have had to hit up a walkthrough on at least a half-dozen occasions, which is a half-dozen too many in my book.All in all, it’s not bad, but unless you enjoyed Deponia enough that you want to see how the character’s stories evolve, I wouldn’t bother.

Short version: 90%Chaos on Deponia is an excellent point ‘n’ click adventure with exceptional dialogues and character portrayal, but the puzzles sometimes reach old LucasArts levels.Long version:If Deponia’s role was to introduce players to a fun little point ‘n’ click series, Chaos on Deponia’s role is to throw everyone into the deep water. This game doesn’t kid around. The tone is more serious, and in some regards, darker: you are required to commit murder and animal abuse, just to name two of the morally questionable mandatory actions.The story puts a larger emphasis on Rufus and his interaction with Goal (or Goals, since she is three people now) and the other characters. This not only portrays his selfish personality, but also evolves it in a quite realistic way. The dialogues are, without doubt, the greatest strength of the game.The plot… not that much. The central issue of the planet’s destruction is shoved into the background to lead you in some wild goose chases. And when the story arc finally remembers it should lead somewhere, it suddenly abandons several smaller threads without explanation.Progressing can sometimes be a gargantuan task with intricate, several-step, whole gameworld-spanning puzzles based on typical adventure game logic. (How do you win at rock-paper-scissors? By destroying a pair of sunglasses to gain entrance to a submarine, of course!) The minigames are more forgiving, thankfully.Despite these setbacks, Chaos on Deponia is the highlight of the trilogy, and one of the best Daedalic games– worthy to be in the library of any point ’n’ click fan.

												NOTE: This is the same review for the other two games in the original Deponia trillogy aswell. I thought that as they are a continuation of the same story that they should stay together. What the game isThe Depnonia trillogy is a classic point and click game on a wold filled with garbage. In the trillogy, you assist the, at first forgettable/dislikeable, protagonist Rufus try to reach the floating paradise of Elysium. Over time, the originally forgettable Rufus uses his witty dialog to slowly get you on his side rooting for him on his quest.Pros+Amazing storyThe story, although only really played out during cut scenes to new areas, is deep in detail. It pulls you in, really pulling you into the world.+FunnyNot many games have blaitently funny dialog, but these games definatly do. Rufus has funny responses to other characters, his own acvtions, and stuff you try to have him do.+CharactersAll the characters seem fleshed out quite well. Each has a uniques personallity, displayes different emotions, and just act different. The variety is also pretty good.+EnviromentsMost enviroments are well detailed with other people and objects to bring the scene alive. In some cases, youll get people who are from other games showing up in the envirments aswell.+MusicThe music worked well with each area you would be exploring. Although mostly being simmilar themed, it all was different and interesting. Cons-Animations/MovementThe walking animation on Rufus, for me was a bit weird. He didnt really face where he was going and took odd paths to where he needed to go.-DurationSome areas seemed too short, while others were too long. It was an odd thing and may have just been the way I solved the puzzles in each area, but it struck me as odd how I could clear one area in ~30 min and another in 2+ hours.Final OpinionThe Deponia trillogy is an amazing set of games that brought back tthe nastolga of point and the point and click style. The quirky dialog was fun to hear and laugh at resonces. The story makes the narcissistic Rufus someone whos actions have you rooting or cying for the duration of his adventure. If you have some time free I can highly reccomend all the games in the Deponia trillogy and Deponia Doomsday.			"

												""Chaos on Deponia"" is the second point-and-click game in Deponia series. It features a goofy protagonist, Rufus. He still lives on a garbage filled planet Deponia, from which he always plans to escape. Rufus is a walking disaster. You can expect water to catch fire when Rufus is around. There is something about smart mouthed Rufus that reminds us of Guybrush Threepwood, classic point-and-click hero.PROS:- Pretty and colorful cartoon graphics.- Humour: edgy, sarcastic, sometimes dark.- Good voice acting.- Decent story: with love, deception, mystery and revolution.- Balanced difficulty.- Cool locations.- Interesting characters (Bozo, Toni, Goal, The Revolutionists).- Classic point-and-click feel.MEH:- You get to visit some locations quite often, which makes background music somewhat annoying.- Some animations are sort of lazy. But that's to be expected from an Indie game with limited budget.CONS:- Some puzzles are not so intuitive, you may require walkthrough (I had to use it about 4 times).If you enjoy classic adventure games, ""Chaos on Deponia"" is just for you. It's not a masterpiece, but is good and you won't regret spending 10 hours to complete it.GAMEPLAY 8/10GRAPHICS 8/10AUDIO 8/10STORY 8/10


I LOVE this game's style!

He still lives on a garbage filled planet Deponia, from which he always plans to escape. Rufus is a walking disaster. You can expect water to catch fire when Rufus is around. There is something about smart mouthed Rufus that reminds us of Guybrush Threepwood, classic point-and-click hero.PROS:- Pretty and colorful cartoon graphics.- Humour: edgy, sarcastic, sometimes dark.- Good voice acting.- Decent story: with love, deception, mystery and revolution.- Balanced difficulty.- Cool locations.- Interesting characters (Bozo, Toni, Goal, The Revolutionists).- Classic point-and-click feel.MEH:- You get to visit some locations quite often, which makes background music somewhat annoying.- Some animations are sort of lazy. But that's to be expected from an Indie game with limited budget.CONS:- Some puzzles are not so intuitive, you may require walkthrough (I had to use it about 4 times).If you enjoy classic adventure games, ""Chaos on Deponia"" is just for you. It's not a masterpiece, but is good and you won't regret spending 10 hours to complete it.GAMEPLAY 8/10GRAPHICS 8/10AUDIO 8/10STORY 8/10

												""Reckoning up the sum, the best was yet to come, for the end of part one seemed a little too coarse. To amend we'll send Rufus to attend a second chance for a decent happy-ending: a grand fling with dancing and booze and so forth...""To put it simply, if you liked Deponia, you'll certainly like Chaos on Deponia. Part of that's because it has just as much quality in its art, characters, story, music, puzzles, etc. The other part is because it more or less follows the same motions. Rufus solves an enclosed introductory puzzle, then builds a contraption involving rockets to launch himself into the sky, winds up crashing into a vehicle which contains Goal, both plummet to Deponia, you solve a handful of major problems by solving a ton of smaller ones in a large town area, then a smaller transitional act, and finally the twisty confrontation.And yet, despite featuring the same framework, the body is all-new. New faces, new locations, new puzzles. There's much to do and explore. So much of the world of Deponia to learn about, and a diverse and creative cast of characters to meet, all weird in their own ways.And oh my god, the voices are so much better. I mean, the majority of Deponia's voices weren't a problem, but the Organon's certainly were. Luckily, though the voices still have the same electronic filter, the volume has been turned down from ""standing beside a malfunctioning stage woofer"" to ""playing on a rusty seesaw"". I never liked Goal or Toni's voices much in Deponia, either, but unless I'm less of a cranky old voice snob than I used to be (unlikely - I'll be a voice snob 'til the very end!), the actresses have gotten a better hang of their characters, this time around. Goal, in particular, I thought sounded very nice. And she'd have to, considering the actress now had to keep up with three or four variations of the character (each of which sounds distinct, but intentionally similar enough to be the same character). Rufus does sometimes have lines that are delivered in ways that don't seem to match the situation at hand, and I definitely caught a flubbed line here or there (which the subtitles at least got right), but even still, his V.A. does a fine job with the other 98% of his lines.Weird translation problems do crop up from time to time, and they can have varying impacts. Chaos on Deponia was made by a German team, and it seems a little obvious here and there. For the mostpart it doesn't matter at all. On the whole, the English version of Chaos on Deponia shows an expansive understanding of the language. But there are some lines that just didn't make it through unscathed (at one point, a character asks, ""What? I'm pardoned?"" when he's supposed to say, ""What? He's pardoned?""), and some jokes seem weird in ways that suggest that they worked a lot better in their original language.On that note, I also want to mention that Poki's folky narrative songs are more... chaotic, this time around. Maybe that was a thematic choice, based on the title. But I'll be honest, those songs were one of my absolute favorite parts of Deponia. With maybe the exception of the third song, in this game they're much harder to follow. If it weren't for the subtitles, I wouldn't have a clue what he's saying half the time, with odd rhymes, lines with way too many words, and lines that end in the middles of words. I suppose this adds to the zaniness in a way, but I still preferred the old ones better.The puzzles are more imaginative than I had expected, even having played the first game. Where Deponia featured a borderline obsessive number of puzzles centered around washing things, the devs have put forth a much stronger effort to keep you one your toes, this time. There are some dips into moon logic territory, but even those are more to do with the problem presented (such as as a head-sized human nose sticking out of a wall as a security device), or with how extravagant the means to solving them are (the lengths Rufus goes to in order to recognize a cat door are astounding, and perhaps a little unfortunate depending on your affinity for cartoon wildlife), and maybe one or two where I wasn't sure what I was accomplishing until I had already accomplished it (ding-dong ditch comes to mind), rather than just a straight-up complete and utter lack of logic. Several puzzles are downright ingenious, though. One puzzle involving a secret knock is about as weirdly outside-the-box as it gets, and I love it in all of its fourth wall-breaking splendor.Daedalus has struck a good balance in the difficulty. It's not as though I never got stuck. I did. In fact, I got stuck on the follow-up to that knocking puzzle simply due to a confusing sound effect. You have multiple secrets knocks which, though they should all sound different, all use the same sound effect, which made it tough to figure out how I was meant to go about solving the problem. But the vast majority of them were a joy to solve, with the game giving you just the right amount of clues necessary to understand what you're doing, without being so simplistic as to make you feel like a toddler. And there are a number of segments which take chances and break out of the typical talk to people/use items mold. You'll play an interesting take on a fighting game, compete in the weirdest form of rock-paper-scissors that I have ever seen, and take advantage of a complicated loophole in fast food pricing, among other highlights.The puzzles are good, I like the puzzles. They're not 100% perfect but they're like 80-90% perfect. Boom, could have saved you two paragraphs of your time if I'd just written that first.I said it about Deponia, and I'll say it again about Chaos on Deponia: the game feels like a true evolution of the old SCUMM-based Lucasarts games. Not a copy, nor even an homage. But something which could have naturally formed from Lucasarts themselves in an alternate timeline. I mean this as a great compliment. If you can stand some translational oddities, you'll find that Chaos on Deponia is a beautiful - albeit junk-strewn - world filled with strange people and creative solutions for even more creative problems. I can easily recommend picking it up. Though I of course recommend picking up Deponia, first, if you haven't. Or the recently released Complete Journey which collects the whole trilogy. If you're a fan of silly, imaginative adventures like Day of the Tentacle or cartoony ones like Curse of Monkey Island, you're in for a treat with these.""HUZZAH, PUT BALLS TO THE WALL!""			"

												Some of it is pretty cool with the story being the main hook, but some of it is messed up like having to kill baby dolphins and turn them into cat food or making a dog's brain explode. It required a bunch of walking around and an even bigger bunch of patience. And Rufus... Oh, Rufus, don't you just want to strangle him? He is the most annoying asshat there is. But somehow you still want him to win. Innate masochism, maybe? Or are the other inhabitants of Deponia just so damn awesome (and they are), that you want to save them from being erradicated? Oh, right. A very important bit of this game, for me, is the artwork, which is lovely, though sometimes a little fuzzy (in close-ups). I like the design, the amount of details and the fact that despite this entire world of Deponia being garbage, it's still bright and colourful. If you haven't played the first part, don't start with this, it will make no sense.P.S: Whatever happened to that guy stuck in a robot?			"

												Buyer beware!Chaos on Deponia is a great game in a great series but it has been broken by its developers.I got halfway through it and then they released a patch which rendered all previous save games unplayable (random speech in a foreign language would play in a constant loop wherever you go). This was in 2013. Despite numerous, highly-populated threads on the Steam forums, Daedalic never fixed the bug.So eventually I started the game again, played all the way from the beginning back to where I left off, and started making progress again. Then, I don't know, but they must have released another patch. As of now, the game will boot up but it will crash whenever you try to start or continue from the main menu. Not even completely uninstalling and downloading again has fixed this problem.The only conclusion which can come from all of this is that Daedalic are fantastic game makers who are absolute imbeciles when it comes to the technical details of releasing and supporting their product. I've played Deponia 1 and half of 2, and I bought Deponia 3 in anticipation of completing the story. If you can get them to actually run then you will have a blast - all those other positive reviews are right on the money. Just pray that they never patch it because odds are good that it will ruin everything.			"

												One of the most brutal games out there. This game is Killer!Close to the Star Wars franchise, this game gives you the benefit of being the only person who might be able to rescue an whole planet made out of trash (hi Wall-E) - or at least escape the planet before it blows up...You (the hero) are known by the name Rufus ""Commander of Crazienesslessness"" and you have not much time left to get going.Enjoy this second memorable disaster of point&click adventure when it says ""To the moon, or wherever i can flee to escape my♥♥♥♥♥getting blown off!""10/10 Poki, I want your child!

												I'll try to review this game in list format.Good things:-voice acting-crazy and fun (crazy fun?) characters-creative and unusual item combos-lots of hidden jokesBad things-Rufus-the dolphin puzzle at the end is very frustrating-it's too short -(but then sadly many adventure games are) - took me approx. 9h- there are some graphics problems- the plot is funny, but its humor makes it convoluded- like the plot, the ending doesn't carry any weight, it's very forgettable- there are problems with some of the achievementsAll in all, I'd say that Chaos on Deponia is a solid game.It's not ideal, but it is fun to play and well worth getting.Btw if you ask around on the forum, you should be able to get a discount coupon easily.

												The fact that there are 55 reviews and none of them are negative yet speaks for itself; a must for any fan of the genre [that is point and clicks]This is a nice little gem of a game with great cutscenes, humor, some actually challenging puzzles (mostly all without being impossible) and a good story. I recommend you play the first game first so that you will understand the story better and get more attatched to the main characters. I got a good 12 hours of gameplay from this, start - finish.Bad points;- Being a german developer, there is a lot of content that hasnt been translated right. This is especially true for the first game, however this has definitely improved since the first game. It is not too hard to make sense of, but can be a little bit annoying if youre paying attention to it. For any fan of anime or subtitled foreign movies, you probably won't notice much, though.- One or two puzzles/'minigames' that required me to google or skip. They were either too hard/nonsenseical for me to feel like trial-and-erroring my way through, or (in one case) required an outside-of-the-box mindset that i'm ashamed to admit i didnt have at the time.Overall though, great game, highly reccomended for adventure game / point n click fans, you won't be dissapointed.

												Pros: - Storytelling and humourous writing is still on par first the first game.- The artwork, this time featuring entirely different locales (plus being able to travel), is great.- There's a nice little catching-up scene that's introduces that quackiness of the game and the mentality of the protagonist.- There's a scene where you can actually die! That was funny.Cons:- Rufus' personality became somewhat annoying this time around. I was hoping for some sort of character growth after the ending of the first game. Just really hard to imagine why Goal would take a liking to him.- Overall, the puzzles are a bit more convoluted this time around - poorly-explained minigames, and some non-sensical puzzles. And a cringing one involving dolphins.- Inventory was bugged (you have to scroll up to to bring down the inventory).- A buggy achievement.- Weird animation slowdown in Outside Doc's Workshop. Had to open the main menu then close or alt+tab to get rid of the slugginess.- A lot more noticeable subtitling mismatch and delayed sound effects.			"

												As far as point and click adventures go this is up there with the best of them... likened to the likes (?!) of Day Of the Tentacle, Secret Of Monkey Island & Beneath A Steel Sky, it has not only wacky ideas, zany items and cut sequences but some genuine funny moments.  With sub puzzles and mini games galore this game will keep you enthralled for hours if adventure games are your thing.  Highly recommened :)			"

												Chaos on Deponia is the 2nd game of the Deponia Trilogy.Pros: Same humor, great animation, beautiful background art, entertaining details hidden in many scenes, good voice acting, good soundtrack.  You can skip the puzzles.  You can double-click to fast travel through scenes.Cons: Puzzles are still completely wacky.  It sounds as if they changed voice actors for Rufus (english version).  That really bugged me for the first couple of hours.Summary: You should definitely play this game if you played the first one.			"

Every turn is a great twist and laughs. Even when the puzzles have you stumped you can't help but hit yourself for not figuring them out right away and laugh.

												This review is a little difficult. I didn't enjoy Chaos on Deponia as much as I enjoyed the first in the trilogy. I found certain characters, locations, songs, mechanics, and especially puzzles lacking. Or boring. Or pace-killers.On the other hand, of the things I did enjoy equally or greater, I really enjoyed them. To put things differently, Chaos on Deponia is wildly inconsistent but wildly enjoyable... for the most part.In my review for Deponia, I referred to a few puzzles being of the Sierra Online variety. Kudos to the developers for actually refererring to those particular games via a pop-up. Boos and hisses to the developers for deviating from -- what I felt -- a strong LucasArts feel and going a bit more Sierra. Hopefully the third game swings the pendulum back the other way.			"

												Great game.  I liked the story and the humor - just keep in mind that Rufus is a full-on moronic and selfish jerk (unlike Guybrush Threepwood who is simply a lovable fool) and is not meant to represent any sort of a roll model.  Not as bad as Simon was in Simon the Sorceror 2 though :)Anyway it was funny, with good voice acting and great art.  Some of the jokes lost a lot in translation (I assume they were puns in German, but translated word for word, which is just...), and it seems like a scene or two were skipped in the story so a couple minor details didn't quite make sense - but overall still very good.And the puzzles were far less obtuse than in the first game - I only had to use a walkthrough 2 or 3 times in Chaos on Deponia, compared to probably close to a dozen times in Deponia.  That one puzzle with the 4th wall breaking solution though ... not cool.Anyway, I'd recommend this one to anyone who played the first game and liked it :)			"

												Review for the whole saga.First of all, I don't really like point-and-click games, but for some reasons... I loved Deponia saga. Pros:Puzzles: In a lot of point-and-click you have to figure it out on your own, without hints, and so you should try to combine random items\click everywhere\etc... In Deponia you'll get tons of hints, in dialogues\descriptions\etc... you'll always find great hints.Awesome graphics Awesome musics Awesome voice acting Nice storyFUNNY ! Dialogues\puzzles\descriptions\even trying to use the wrong item, will make you laugh. The whole saga takes ~30h, it's never repetitive Platypuses RufusGreat inventory system Cons:Last chapter (Goodbye Deponia) it's a bit buggyI don't want to spoil so I'll just say that I'm REALLY REALLY REALLY disappointed with the ending...

												Care Spoilers. After a long time nearly 2 years i come from the epic Deponia now to part 2 and its still so epic like part 1. Its my Nr. 6 Daedalic Entertainment game (Edna Harvey Harvey New Eyes, Breakout, 1954 Alcatraz, Journey of a Roach, Deponia) and all 5 games was really amazing for me, dont expect wonders, but its feels a bit like old good Lucas Arts Adventures, sure nothing come on the exact level of quality) The graphic has still the charm, the sound are mid-class (not very good not annoying). So the dialogs are still some funny things and there are nice extra cameos if you play the achievements: Star Wars: I am NOT your FATHER (Luke, Vader, Rufus, Seagull) or there is a point someone go and catch it Tiger (Spider Man 2 with Tobey M.), there are many more like Achievement (the Dinos NOT THE MOTHER (Baby Sinclair to Father) but this dont know everyone

I give this game as a click and point fan and i think i couldnt be better (only longer) but i need 10 hours so more then double the time for part 1 i give 97 %, for many people it will be 82-92 % maybe if they dont hate point and click and dont expect to much.

												I assume you've already played Deponia, the first of the series, but it is not really necessary as you get a short summary of what had happened when the game begins. Daedalic decided to start this sequel in a way which left me feeling uneasy throughout the rest of the game (I really tried EVERYTHING! Please forgive me, John Thomas!)This part introduces so many new concepts and gives vast space for sophisticated character development. A pity that the protagonist decides NOT to learn anything from his experiences. But in all honesty, I can't imagine Rufus-da-dufus being a mature adult, so I guess he just grows in his own emotionally disconnected and reality-twisting way.But as much as I have trouble relating to the main character because of our issues (more often than not, I just want to slap him Tyrion-style), I do love me some ubiquitous innuendos. The plot gets better and better, proving that it is possible to combine careless humour and seemingly random songs with a much deeper story.For these reasons I will definitely play the next part!

												At first, I didn't think I would be able to make it all the way through a tedious point and click game. The humour is what changed my mind. It really is worthwhile. I was lucky enough to get this in a bundle with Blackguards, and some other games during the summer sale. I can't say for certain whether I would have been totally satisfied if I had paid full price. Don't think I'll be buying the other two until I can find them on sale however.Overall, it's a funny worthwhile story, reminiscent of the Freddie Fish and Pajama Sam games I loved as a kid, only with a slightly more (im)mature sense of humour. Would definitely recommend for anyone that is open to something a bit different.			"

												Way better than Deponia. It runs better (still not terribly well, but certainly much better), is longer, has better puzzles, writing, soundtrack, and seems bug-free in my playthroughs.With the exception of some slow-down on some of the action-heavy bits, some achievements with tremendously obscure requirements, and one puzzle that is dependent upon fiddling with the game settings as part of the solution (something I would have never thought to do), I have no real complaints about this excellent point-and-click adventure. Even the character(s) I didn't care about in the first game come across much better in the telling of this sequel.			"

												I don't play point-and-click adventure games. And I've finished not one, but three games in this series. This game has a story which reminds me of Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams books full of crazy nonsense jokes and absurdity while being colourful and well-drawn in its own cartoonish manner. The story itself is quite solid and I've been laughing throughout all three games.Don't get me wrong, all the bad things present in point-and-click adventures are present there, besides maybe pixelhunting since you can highlight objects you can click on. But everything else is still there. I've been using online guides to play this game and I assure, the sheer pleasure of all the nonsense in this game and the beauty of cartoonish art style outweight the negative elements of the genre I hate and I love Deponia, Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia.

AGAIN! sadly Chaos On Deponia still as some bugs to tarnish its image but as I thought the dialogues a bit thin in the first one here they were richer and more pertinant, funnier too! I laught event more often than playing Deponia 1! and I found the girlfriend-split personnality-thing interesting, it adds a clever mechanic to the gameplay (remembered me of managing 3 characters in Day Of The Tentacle). finally the ""playfield"" you get to explore in each stage of the game is open and pretty big, that was nice and the game felt even less linear that the first! good job on that!

												This is the second game in the Deponia series. Personally I enjoyed this one a lot, perhaps more than the first game. The main character is pretty selfish and doesn't care too much about what his actions do to others.. (there was a particularly cruel/funny bit involving baby dolphins.)  Still, I think he grew up a little compared to the first game. For one, he actually does seem to care whether or not his planet is destroyed.. so that is a step in the right direction.The puzzles come with a skip button if they are too hard.. there is some real nonsense solutions in this game.. including one that requires to you actually change your in-game sound options to solve.

												I generally enjoyed the first Deponia (I propose to rename the series ""Disapponia"") game, but the horrible pacing of the ending made me wary of getting this one.  It was on sale for $3 so I decided to go for it.  If the most favorable outcome were true, this game would have made up for the faults of the previous installment with better writing and a larger world.  Unfortunately, that is not what happened.  While the world may indeed be larger, my desire to explore it has been completely destroyed.In the hour that I played, every single line of dialogue was about how much of a fool Rufus is.  All realism has been thrown out and Rufus no longer behaves like a human.  The humor is predictable and the actual game seems less important on the developer's priorities than the bad jokes about the protagonist.I simply couldn't continue playing after the scene with the robotic dog because the writing was that bad.  The same voice recordings were recycled too many times throughout the dialogue and the puzzle was severly disappointing.  My favorite parts of the first game were the unconventional and devious puzzle solutions that weren't immediately obvious and helped me to relate to the character of Rufus.  This scene alone destroyed that as the solution to the puzzle was yet another joke about his inhuman stupidity.  Rufus went from a likable trickster to a complete clown who cannot hope to be passed off as a realistic character.This is very disappointing, as the world in which Deponia is set has the potential for a great experience and I was genuinely interested in where the story would go in this game.  Now I have no motivation to play any further because I just don't want to see whether the writing could possibly get any worse.In addition to the poor writing, this game also seems to have worse voice acting than the first and the animation just feels lazy.  The latter of these complaints was also a problem in the first Deponia game, but I was willing to overlook that for a well-made game overall with good art and effort put into other places.  Since this game obviously doesn't have the second part, the lack of believable animations only adds to my disappointment.  It's unfortunate that I will not be able to enjoy Deponia's wonderful art because of the horrible design of the game.I really have to wonder what this game's target audience is.  The humor is too banal and predictable to be enjoyed by an adult but the puzzles are too difficult to be figured out by a child.  I was under the impression that the first game was targeted to adults but I have trouble beleiving that could be true considering how immature this one is.My advice is that you do not invest in the Deponia series, as this really isn't worth anyone's time.  If you don't believe me, you should be able to come to an agreement quickly enough to still be eligible for a refund.  While the first game was a good experience for a $2 game on sale, this is overpriced even at its current $3.			"

It’s even better than the first game which comes as a great surprise to me. Dialogs are witty and smart yet funny and idiotic. Game constantly makes you think outside of the box to do things you normally wouldn’t think of in a million years. In my book there’s no bad side to this game, but there is still room for improvement. You just have to figure out the puzzles and keep on playing.

Lots of adventure and humour that were all appreciated (to some extent). I have to address some negative points tho.The puzzles didn't impress me. And that's a part of the game i usually look forward to. They just felt ""forced"" sometimes.The main character's witty remarks and plain stupidity grew on my nerves a bit as the time passed.Despite that i came to the end of the game happy for the experience and that's what a game should do. I have to recommend it to the fans of the genre because it's a game that shows a lot of work and quality and you will probably enjoy it.			"

												Chaos on Deponia is a worthy sequel to Deponia but feels quite a bit shorter. As far as classic point and click adventuring goes, there are really only 2 parts of the game. Still, the puzzles are generally high quality, and veterans should be able to make it through the game without needing a walkthrough. The humor from the first game is still there and is at least amusing most of the time.With the exception of one puzzle (SPOILER ALERT) that requires you to change game settings to solve (END SPOILER ALERT) I didn't find anything unfair. The animation is still great as is the voice acting. I am not at all a fun of the slurring musical number between acts, but that's a small quibble. A good sucessor if you liked the first.			"

												Excellent, funny, point and click puzzle adventure.Great sequel. For story continuity, I recommend playing the first before starting this one.Great stylised graphics, good sound and voice, hilarious script.Very simple and easy controls and game play, the silly intro teaches you all you need to know to get right into the story. And if you have already played the first recently, you will know exactly what to expect.Throughout, the characters and descriptions provide good (but not too obvious) clues to help you move forward and complete the various puzzles. Some of the puzzles are a little more obscure in this episode, which I feel helps keep it fresh.Very well put together and nicely balanced. Good length.100% is easy enough with a little help from the community.Recommended for chimps not chumps.			"

												Same characters from part 1... Same humour (yep - different words BUT it is still ""Rufus humour"")...And most important = it's just too hard... story usualy have not any logic. So if you cant read the mind of developers - you cant ""solve"" it.  + stupid mathematical riddles. Yep - you can ""skip"" mathematical puzzles... you can use guides-walkthroug... but in point-and-click games - it will kill all fun.If you want good P.A.C. game - better take ""Night of the rabbit"" or ""The book of unwritten tales"" 1-2 part.

												This game is probably the weakest of the trilogy - but that's not to say it isn't good. It's still hilarious, still fun and it still has a good story. There were two problems, in my opinion:1. The puzzles were sometimes too obscure. While this game certainly improved on some aspects of the first game (most of the time I actually had some idea of what I was doing, and some sense of progress, whereas in the first one I tended to get stuck much more often) - it still suffers a bit from being a little too hard in places. I'm not saying that I want it to be easy - no thanks - but this game is so big and sprawling that it sometimes got very confusing as to where I needed to go next. (on the other hand, it did improve quite a lot on the first game. Some new mechanics were pretty good).2. Parts of it do feel a bit like filler. The actual story part of the game is extremely stretched out (you spend the majority of the game trying to convince all three goals to agree to have surgery. Basically the whole of the Black Market was devoted to this one puzzle, and it's a big place). It was fun, but it was slow going. It set up a lot of important stuff for the third game, obviously, but not a lot happened in this one compared to the others.But, still, it was a good game, like the others. I love this universe, the characters, the humour. In this game, it was especially the humour, being a bit more lacking in story and character development than the others. Overall, it was fun, and important as a setup for the third one, which I think is easily the best. Obviously, if you're playing the trilogy, you can't miss this one - you probably won't even be reading the reviews for the second game if you've played the first - even so, I'm going to give it an 8/10 for anyone who might be reading.

												Note: This analysis attempts to address in a subtle way so much about this as about the first game and nothing is mentioned in it can be considered spoiler (at least not something that will discourage you from playing after reading).Deponia franchise games despite having a story as a backdrop. The real focus has always been the comic side, usually using sarcastic answers as a way to pass the mood. Since the offenses despite the way it is interpreted by the situation itself, end up becoming something funny that also serves as a way to take the possible tension of the situation. Chaos on Deponia game is a point and click adventure genre mixed with humor and a moderate dose of puzzles, created and distributed by Daedalic Entertainment.Its main objective is to save Deponia ( ""Deponie"" means ""landfill"" in German), known as the planet trash that which Rufus, the main character, wants much to see far and try numerous times to escape, until one of those times Rufus eventually you find goal and is exactly at this point that that his personal goal ends up becoming a much bigger goal. What Rufus ever wanted was to leave this place and go to Elysium (This is the word, by the way, used to designate a paradise by the ancient Greeks), and this time the situation comes fully expected, perhaps more than usual to be precise, and gets involved in an accident which ends up passed out across Goal. As I had said what was particular goal has grown and developed in a way that soon Rufus was seeing on a mission to save Deponia from total destruction.In the first version of the game it happened in the small town of Kuvaq and its development is now happening in the Black Market Floating Red Sea Rust, with more characters to interact and more local exploitable.About Goal, she barely had a share in the previous game however this time the game almost revolves around her and their personalities, which were fragmented by a new drop caused by Rufus. Thus by means of a remote control can change between 3 figures, each with unique situations and dialogue:- Lady Goal, intelligent, educated and snobbish.- Spunky Goal, aggressive and rude.- Baby Goal, naive and childish.The visual cartoonized the game is really lovely however the colors are less vivid than the first, it serves to pass the climate change. The game has a more tense atmosphere, the beautiful Kuvaq garbage mountains now give way to scenarios that much convey the feeling of decadence in which the planet is but the beginning seemed to be denied or perhaps a lack of acceptance of truth.Things that caught my attention in particular:- Visual landscape quality and the level of detail- Each character has unique personalities and are well explored, both by their attitudes as the dialogues.- The moments ""musical"" excel the songs of the game.To conclude, I believe that this is a great acquisition, but obviously I do not mean only this title after all this is a continuity and a real experience is required to play from Deponia to Goodbye Deponia. The entire assembly has just finally forming a work that has an incredible brightness.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/ .Also you're welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.

												Chaos on Deponia mostly has the same pros and cons as the first Deponia game. If you liked the original Deponia game, you'll probably like this one, but it is definitely not an improvement. I would say Chaos on Deponia is worse because the story seems to mostly tread water, not advancing things much, if at all.Pros:+ Light-hearted game with a good (although childish) sense of humorCons:- Extraordinarily convoluted, contrived problems to solve- Some of the solutions to the puzzles are frustratingly nonsensical- Deponia is an episodic series, and this game feels like the devs were just padding it out to be a trilogy. Essentially nothing happens in this game, and it leaves you almost where you were at the end of the first game. I feel like I wasted my time.			"

												While this was a fun point and click adventure and I can recommend it when the whole trilogy is on sale (each of the games individually is fairly short with limited replayability and not really worth the full price). This has happened several times so if you're interested, wait until it's on sale again (or the price drops significantly).Unfortunately, this game is quite buggy (not quite as bad as the first game which still has some game breaking bugs), but several of the minigames were completely broken (at least the skip button worked, complete with the untranslated German text). I also did not appreciate some of the puzzle solutions, it painted Rufus as being a much more sadistic character than simply the clueless idiot that he is otherwise.While this isn't an issue with just this game but rather the point and click genre as a whole, many of the puzzles have completely illogical (but usually at least still entertaining) solutions, so unless you enjoy lots of trial and error, I highly recommend finding a good guide to maximize your enjoyment of the game.

												I want to like the Deponia games. They feel like they could be like Monkey Island. Their humor gets so close, and the animation is pretty good. I really, really want to like these games. Unfortunately, the utterly unlikable protagonist never improves in the slightest and spoils everything about the experience.			"

												Okay I really liked the first deponia but this one.... I've lost it at the gondola part. Having to watch Bozo and the weapon manufacturer fight 20 times over and having to hear to same horrible junkcrab song 20 times then having to go back and forth over and over just to figure out the exact order of actions was just the last straw. I've spent a pretty good amount of hours in that game and I'm still in the first town (which happens to be the half point in the game... yes you spend more than half the game in the same town)So far, the whole story can be summarised in one line : You're in the black market and have to find ways to make all 3 or Goal's personalities accept a brain surgery.There's NO STORY. The whole point of the game is to live a story (since you know, point and click games pretty much have no gameplay) but there's none. It's LONG and not rewarding one bit. You keep on going around the same town, talk to the same people, do the same things over and the story doesn't move on one bit. I'm frustrated, I want to like this game because it's pretty well made but it's just SO DAMN BORING.Yes, that's it, it's long, tedious and boring.EDIT : This is my personal experience and feeling. No need to tell me how much you liked this game and that I'm therefore wrong, because not only is this a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ argument but if I cared for that I'd just read a well written positive review instead.

I used a walkthrough in the first game but at least the first had a few areas I could figure out on my own. Still, a great series but now that its over, I don't understand why they didn't just release a game that includes all three parts as one whole game. Sounds like a bs way to make extra money but whatever. Buying the daedilic pack at 90% off was the best for this anyway. On to Goodbye Deponia!			"

												This is absolutely my favorite point and click adventure game. Usually, you'll find that point and clicks are pretty nostalgic.. but this game is certainly far from that. It's funny, stupid, and can be a bit crude at times. I also just love the main character. If you don't have this in your library, you need to get it. It doesn't matter if you don't usually play point and click adventures - you'll love it for the style itself.This is also much better than the previous one in the series. - and it's probably my favorite out of all of them.

												This is the second installment in the Deponia trilogy. You will need to have played the first game for this one to make any sense, as it picks up exactly where the first one leaves off.The gameplay is traditional point-and-click adventuring, which means an abundance of item-based puzzles along with the occasional skippable mini-game. It also includes standard control shortcuts such as double-clicking on arrows for instant movement, left-clicking to speed through dialogue, and ESC to skip scenes entirely.Your character is Rufus, a sorry excuse for a human being if ever there was one, and your goal is to help him ""save the world"" by dealing with his brain-malfunctioning cliche of a companion, driving his friends to drink, and being at the top of PETA's most-hated list.The game is significantly longer than the first, and involves multiple new locations to explore (i.e. wreak mayhem upon).Some of the things I liked:- There is a good amount of humor in the dialogue, lyrics, and situations that occur.- Many of the puzzles were intuitive enough to not need a walkthrough, but clever enough to not be boring.- The side characters (Doc, Bozo, etc.) were cool, and imho more interesting than the main characters.- The overall plot was solid, and included some twists and depth that I definitely wasn't expecting.- Platypuses.Some of the things that bothered me:- The pacing felt off. The start of the game is bogged down with cut-scenes, heavy dialogue, and one-room puzzles, and then the game dumps you out into a larger non-linear sandbox to explore. The juxtaposition is jarring and slightly uncomfortable. I think the first game was more successful in making the exploration feel natural.- In order to get all of the achievements, you need to play two particularly obnoxious mini-games without skipping them. One is a quick-reflexes fighting game, and the other is a corner-the-enemy strategy game. Both are tedious, and are completely outside of the normal skill set for this genre. Neither are in any way ""fun."" - Rufus is pretty unlikeable, and tbh, Goal isn't much better. They tried to give her a larger role with actual character development, but it's marred by the fact that her dialogue and actions are internally inconsistent. Even with the craziness of the main plot device, it still doesn't make sense that she would randomly forget to take key pieces of information into account, or that she would flip-flop between loving you and hating you at the drop of a hat, or that she continues to be a walking stereotype who is affected by the plot rather than driving it. There were moments of awesomeness with her character, but she really needed an overall editor.- Was the animal cruelty really necessary?Overall, it is a solid adventure game with a dark sense of humor and a full cast of non-heroes. If you liked the first game in the series and said ""I want more of that, only with less moral fiber and more Goal"", then you will absolutely love this installment. I give it 7.5 platypuses out of 10.			"

Very fun, I recommand all three.Love that at some point in the trilogie you get to play multiple characters at the same time, and your actions have a repercautions on you other parts. Loved it!!!At some point you really have to think hard, but it's worth every minute of play time. And I will play them again, because the story is so fun. ** The trilogie is composed of : Deponia, Chaos on Deponia and Goodbye Deponia			"

												Chaos on Deponia is a continuation to Deponia, and is definitely just as good as the first game if not even better. I've found this game to be more difficult than the first because at some point in the game you'll be given the freedom to travel to different places instead of being stuck in one place, which adds a whole new dimension of difficulty to the puzzle mechanics. Although there are some iffy moments where I was forced to refer to a walkthrough for help because some of the solutions are just too out-of-the-box, the additional challenge adds a certain charm to the game and it definitely keeps me entertained enough to play through the whole game in one day. The story is still great and I do feel that there are definitely more interesting dialogues between MC and the people around him.This game has earned a solid recommendation from me to anyone who has played the first game and enjoyed it, and if you haven't, then I'd also recommend the first game to those looking for good puzzles and good story in a game.

												My journey on Deponia started with this second part of the trilogy. After some first hesitating steps in this world where I regretted my purchase for some minutes because I thought this kind of game would just not fit me, I simply fell in love with the whole gameplay and its setting. The storyline itself is, well, just like the first part, very Rufus-ly. But that's what you expect, isn't it? :DThe puzzles vary in their difficulty, but even the harder ones can be solved with (sometimes a lot of) endurance and paying close attention to the scenary as to what the characters say.Also, I enjoy the soundtrack (especially the introduction as the transitions between every ""chapter"" of the story are very lovely and I get excited every time I hear their melody :D).Maybe I'm a little too positive about everything because of my little crush here, but I'm sure that when you enjoy point-and-click -games and have a sense for dark humour, you're gonna love this one!

I used a walkthrough in the first game but at least the first had a few areas I could figure out on my own. Still, a great series but now that its over, I don't understand why they didn't just release a game that includes all three parts as one whole game. Sounds like a bs way to make extra money but whatever. Buying the daedilic pack at 90% off was the best for this anyway. On to Goodbye Deponia!			"

												This is the second installment in the Deponia trilogy. You will need to have played the first game for this one to make any sense, as it picks up exactly where the first one leaves off.The gameplay is traditional point-and-click adventuring, which means an abundance of item-based puzzles along with the occasional skippable mini-game. It also includes standard control shortcuts such as double-clicking on arrows for instant movement, left-clicking to speed through dialogue, and ESC to skip scenes entirely.Your character is Rufus, a sorry excuse for a human being if ever there was one, and your goal is to help him ""save the world"" by dealing with his brain-malfunctioning cliche of a companion, driving his friends to drink, and being at the top of PETA's most-hated list.The game is significantly longer than the first, and involves multiple new locations to explore (i.e. wreak mayhem upon).Some of the things I liked:- There is a good amount of humor in the dialogue, lyrics, and situations that occur.- Many of the puzzles were intuitive enough to not need a walkthrough, but clever enough to not be boring.- The side characters (Doc, Bozo, etc.) were cool, and imho more interesting than the main characters.- The overall plot was solid, and included some twists and depth that I definitely wasn't expecting.- Platypuses.Some of the things that bothered me:- The pacing felt off. The start of the game is bogged down with cut-scenes, heavy dialogue, and one-room puzzles, and then the game dumps you out into a larger non-linear sandbox to explore. The juxtaposition is jarring and slightly uncomfortable. I think the first game was more successful in making the exploration feel natural.- In order to get all of the achievements, you need to play two particularly obnoxious mini-games without skipping them. One is a quick-reflexes fighting game, and the other is a corner-the-enemy strategy game. Both are tedious, and are completely outside of the normal skill set for this genre. Neither are in any way ""fun."" - Rufus is pretty unlikeable, and tbh, Goal isn't much better. They tried to give her a larger role with actual character development, but it's marred by the fact that her dialogue and actions are internally inconsistent. Even with the craziness of the main plot device, it still doesn't make sense that she would randomly forget to take key pieces of information into account, or that she would flip-flop between loving you and hating you at the drop of a hat, or that she continues to be a walking stereotype who is affected by the plot rather than driving it. There were moments of awesomeness with her character, but she really needed an overall editor.- Was the animal cruelty really necessary?Overall, it is a solid adventure game with a dark sense of humor and a full cast of non-heroes. If you liked the first game in the series and said ""I want more of that, only with less moral fiber and more Goal"", then you will absolutely love this installment. I give it 7.5 platypuses out of 10.			"

But I'd like to second what the others have been saying in their reviews; be sure to play the first Deponia game before jumping unto this one.If you can, you might as well play the other Daedalic games, too - for the easter eggs here and there. Those games are good titles themselves.Nothing to lose here, especially if you're into Point & Click games.There's also Goal, of course. :D "

												Thoroughly enjoying my first jaunt into the colourful world of Deponia I looked forward to continuing my adventure with the notoriously ill fated Rufus and I am happy to say I was not disappointed.Following Rufus, Doc and Bozo to the Floating Black Market you must seek out new tools, allies and solutions to problems (most likely caused by Rufus) to further your journey to Elysium.New vibrant environments encapsulate the second game in the series filled with wacky new characters and even more bizarre and destructive ways to overcome the hurdles placed in your path, as with the previous title the UI is easy to use and solutions are easy to find due in no small part to other completionists of the game creating guides for the community as well as nearly all minigames having the option to be skipped if to be found to difficult.If you enjoyed the first Deponia and couldn't help but laugh at Rufus' attempts to realise his dreams and leave Deponia behind him then you will not be disappointed at the sequel and am confident that the third will be just as enjoyable.

												This series is so good and this game in the Deponia crown is just as much of a gem as the others. As an adult I enjoyed the humour but I found it tame enough to also be appropriate for children old enough to play this game. The cartoon style graphics are very cool to me and I enjoy the animation of the characters as their stories unfold. Character wise it is rare to see an underdog like Rufus who is so flawed be so lovedable at the same time. These characters are fullt formed and unique in an age when many video game characters are cookie cutter, partial, and static characters.			"

												After playing the first instalment of Deponia, I had quite a few criticisms, mostly about the characters and storyline. However, despite these flaws, I did enjoy the game and so I couldn't resist continuing on to the next chapter. I much preferred the puzzles in this chapter, although I'm not sure if it's because I was now used to the way the game ""thinks"" and thus found it easier. I liked many of the game mechanics and was able to play most of the game without any walkthrough. Again, however, some of the puzzles were quite obscure, or just out of reach so that when I did look up the solution, I either thought ""What? How was I supposed to figure that out?"" or ""Argh, I basically did that!"". Still, I appreciated a lot of the scenes and in particular the different places to explore. The humour is still great, and some of the new characters added some depth to familiar scenarios. As with the first instalment, I still think there was too much dialogue in some places. I also still have major issues with the representation of the female characters in this game, in particular the way Goal is objectified not just by Rufus's creepy possessive pursuit of her as a prize or trophy, but also in the game mechanics. There are also a couple of cutscenes that were just unnecessarily vulgar and borderline predatory. Goal is a great character, and I love the additional dynamism her character got in this chapter, which made it even more of a shame to see her remain as an object to be ogled and played with. Blech. Overall, it's still a good game, though I wouldn't pay full price for it. I got both Deponia and Chaos on Deponia in the sale and I'm very happy about that. I wouldn't pay more than €10/$10 for either chapter. If you can get the whole lot on sale, even better.			"

												While this was a fun point and click adventure and I can recommend it when the whole trilogy is on sale (each of the games individually is fairly short with limited replayability and not really worth the full price). This has happened several times so if you're interested, wait until it's on sale again (or the price drops significantly).Unfortunately, this game is quite buggy (not quite as bad as the first game which still has some game breaking bugs), but several of the minigames were completely broken (at least the skip button worked, complete with the untranslated German text). I also did not appreciate some of the puzzle solutions, it painted Rufus as being a much more sadistic character than simply the clueless idiot that he is otherwise.While this isn't an issue with just this game but rather the point and click genre as a whole, many of the puzzles have completely illogical (but usually at least still entertaining) solutions, so unless you enjoy lots of trial and error, I highly recommend finding a good guide to maximize your enjoyment of the game.

												I bought this game at full price as sort of a penance for previous crimes to other publishers, but that didn't cloud my views of this game. I had kind of enjoyed the first game, and so I was hoping this game would be almost as good...?~It started out OK. The city you spend most of your time in is nice, lots of scenery, people to talk to, etc. But I found it quite easy to get stuck and remain stuck. Some of the puzzles just don't make a whole lot of sense without the walkthrough. For example: you cannot get to one part of the map without a bowl of peanuts that you shove into a mechanical nose. Sense made? Me neither. Worse, you spend the vast majority of the game in THAT CITY. Hardly anywhere else. That makes for a VERY slow game. Overall this is the slowest game of the series. As if Rufus couldn't be more of a selfish dirtbag, the plotpoint of the first part of the game basically just cements the parts of his character I do not like: his complete selfishness and idiocy. Who gets the cheaper supplies and the lolly when it's a matter of restoring someone with the equivalence of brain damage to good health? Ugh. I hate Rufus. The worst part about this is that you need this game to make sense of the last part of the series, even though it's by far the worst part of it. Only get it at full price if you MUST watch the last part, and can't wait for a sale.			"

												Many enjoyed the second game in the series more than the first, but I'm only sort of on that boat. Many things are improved, mostly gameplay-wise, but a smaller amount is drastically deteriorated. A widespread complaint of the series is that the protagonist is a massive jerk, and not a likable jerk, but a jerk-jerk. After playing the first game, I had strongly disagreed, but slowly as more unfolds that complaint does gain far more plausabilty. I had looked toward seeing the imaginative plot develop story-wise after my time playing the first game, and unfortunately it had definitely not met those expectations. Still, it comes somewhat recommended, and it nonetheless remains an enjoyable entry to the point-and-click genre trilogy.			"

The acting, artwork, and music are all AAA/world-class.  As with any play-once/interactive fiction game, I recommend it at deep (75%+) discount. "

Now, granted, Chaos on Deponia is a lot longer than then the first but it's almost an exact copy, same kind of puzzels, same kind of game play and the same kind of Game. I'm putting it bluntly because I want to get the review done for Choas on Deponia at least.It has points that are going for it but it has more going against it.I recommend it if you like a rinse and repeat of a good game that somehow got worse with sequels. like every game does however over time and not in the span of a few years			"

												The second of the series. Honestly these additions (chapters?) should have just been a massive expansion, very little of the gameplay was changed as far as I can tell. Not a bad thing, just an observation since the story does continue directly where it left off.I actually disliked this one the most out of the series mainly because it revolved around a single location with sectors. This meant a LOT of retracing steps and moving back and forth. It became tiring and made some of the puzzles mundane or nonsensical because you're basically re-using the same stuff over and over again.The story was still solid here though, and the voice acting had improved significantly. Characters had deeper and more bizarre personalities. Overall if you liked the first one then play this one so you'll understand the third.			"

												This review is, part and parcel, the same as my review of the first Deponia. Its a fun, indepth world to explore with more interesting puzzles to solve and characters to talk to; finally with a story that rackets up where the first one left off and deals you with plot twists you did not see coming.Its a longer game than the first one, But it feels a slightly more enclosed world, the majoriy of the game is inside a ramshackle maritime city, The Floating Blackmarket. But because of the world and story its no less detailed and fansinating.I think the one thing that weared thin was the main character, Rufus. I was hoping for him to start to grow out of his immature, unintelligent self-delusioned nature; go beyond being an unbearable underdog and become a sort of an unlikable anti-hero. But Rufus' accute Aspergers doesn't do enough to dampen the enjoyment had in Choas in Deponia....Goodbye Deponia; the conclusion of the trilogy will come out this coming August. I'm anticipating a clever, over the top ending of the series. I look forward.			"

												Chaos on Deponia can be a dickish game. To get past a puzzle, you actually had to go into the menu options, and turn down the music volume. Really, something in the game's options, was the solution to the puzzle. First in a point-and-click for me. But, that's the charm of Deponia. You REALLY have to think out of the ordinary to get through this game, and enjoy all the dialogue. And you will enjoy it.			"

												Chaos on Deponia starts right after the end of first part of Deponian trilogy following Rufus' new attempts to get to Elysium. It lets you explore a new part of Deponia (though it is rather small) and introduces a bunch of new colorful characters (O, Donna, your dim-witted giggles melt my heart!).     Like previous game, Chaos on Deponia looks absolutely fantastic and is really funny. But also like previous game it contains a lot of bugs, most of which are the same as in the original Deponia. They are not game breaking (though some Steam achievements do not work), but it really saddens me to see that Daedalic still doesn't care to fix them.    Overall it is fun game but besides game bugs it contains some other drawbacks. It is really short and ends abruptly only to tell you to wait for the third part to see the end of the story. Some people will find various jokes offensive because of animal cruelty and the main protagonist is still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ which makes it really hard to sympathize and root for him.     But in the end, Chaos on Deponia is really funny quest with great characters, amazing graphics and interesting story.			"

												Highly recommended if you enjoy the classic adventure games from back in the 90's. However, some of the puzzles are infuriatingly nonsensical, while others are better balanced. The story is good, the voice acting is great, the graphics (2D cartoons) are very crisp and the music is nice.  The animation could do with some polish, but it's a definite improvement from the first game.			"

												Great game. Sadly, I was unable to complete the game without a walkthough. PROS1. Interesting CharactersYou want to laugh at and hate Rufus, the anti-hero. The 3 personalities of Goal, Lady, Spunky and Baby, are quite interesting to talk to. 2. ArtworkI like how they drew Deponia. Even though it was just cartoon drawings, I appreciated the design of the junk world.3. CreativityTorpedo dolpins, teleporters with genetic fusion, iced cavemen, ridiculous lightning rods, playpus bataka, the ""all natural"" dark god chef, quantum time travel, soya soldiers, etc. It's just so many innovative things. Were the soya soldiers from Girlgeniusonline?CONS1. Impossible PuzzlesSometimes, some of the puzzles are just impossible to solve. E.g. Liepold and turning off the music setting volume. Who would know what to do?2. Need a WalkthroughI got all the way to hatching the playtypuses before I needed the walkthrough.NEUTRAL1. Oddly Inserted Morbid Moral ScenesKilling baby dolphins for tuna and causing junk crabs to murder the nice gondolier seem like an odd way to portray a hero.SUGGESTIONS1. HintsMaybe some hints as to when certain things are important might save on the time wasting trying a trial and error. Sadly, I am not competent enough to complete the game without a walkthrough.

												The direct sequel to Deponia brings more of the same, but better in almost every way.The smallest of goals are still accomplished by fulfilling task, upon task, upon task, but it just seems more fun this time around. This is in part because the story advances much faster than in the previous game. Or at least more happens, anyway. There are a lot more puzzles in this game, and that is either a good or bad thing, based on if you find this these kinds of puzzles enjoyable. All-in-all, another good point-and-click adventure for those who are fans of the genre.6.5/10 ""Okay to Good"" "

												A game with a great setting. I managed the game without a walkthrough, but don't feel bad if you need one. The strength of this game is not in the puzzles, it's not the protagonist either, though YMMV. The setting is great, the side characters are funny. The main character is a horrible egotistical jerk that does horrible things. Worse YOU have to make him do these things. Some of these are really stupid, some illogical, many unethical.Actually this game has a lot of bad points, but still ended up enjoyable. I think it's mainly the setting and the side characters.One puzzle I'm going to gripe about, since it was the one that took me quite literally HOURS to solve. To get the swordfish protected by a motion sensor, you have to cut the power so it's dark. This makes NO SENSE AT ALL, since motion sensors are made to detect motion in the dark. They generally work better in dim light than in bright light. Oh and don't tell me you cut power to the motion sensor itself. No anti-theft measure should be without backup power, and when you grab the fish, there's no wires at all. "

												Back with Rufus in a second installment and hoping that he's had a bit of character developement after the events of the first game. Unfortunately this is not the case, as shown wonderfully in the beginning sequence. Despite the optimism of Rufus' new friends, he is just as bad as ever.I actually enjoyed the second game on the whole. Although, I'm not sure if it really stands well on it's own. There's a lot of back story in this segment and new gorgeous locations to explore, but not much in the way of plot. The puzzles are still fun, but I have to admit, I needed to look up a walkthrough for a couple of the more obscure ones, and the floating black market is great. I especially loved the robot in the gadget store and the platypus 'poet'.Unfortunately there are some cons. Goal's brain implant becomes damaged and her personality is split into 3 people and they seem to be baby, snobby ♥♥♥♥♥ and angry ♥♥♥♥♥ :\ ,also, the only other person who is seen to have a brain implant is also a woman, I'm not sure what Daedalic are trying to say with that. At the end of the game it's even suggested that a Goal with only one personality is better than a fully functional Goal, as she's easier to deal with and doesn't have her usual issues or naivety (at least it is the 'bad' guy who say this and not Rufus who argues against this, +1 for Rufus).Rufus is still an awful person.

												Awesome artwork and music as expected, no complaints about that. About 1/4 in the game I had to turn off the volume because the in-game character couldn't remember a knocking rythm. The third wall has been broken down since the first game and it looks as if Deponia 2 is going to break the whole house. I wonder what will happen in the third game...The story is still continuing like it was in the first game - Rufus *trying to escape Deponia (*note the trying).  The plot does have some parts that are confusing and annoying like Rufus buying the bad type of cartridges for Goal's brain and then it's split into 3 parts and then he has to seduce every part of Goal to proceed with the story (uugghh... come on). Maybe the story is being stretched too long?? The second part of the series has more difficult minigames and you can't even skip some.. I had troubles with the Platypys Bataka (couldn't see where Goal was looking), but after a series of serious ragequits I got past that and continued on with the story. Overall the game is quite fun and interesting. The series is maybe meant for a bit more open-minded people with good memories (not me). Just like in any Point-and-Click games, you need to remember the clues. Play the full game in one go or in a few days. I recommend Deponia 2 to anyone who has played the first game (seriously play the first game!!).			"

												It seems Deadelic heard the complaints about Rufus being too much of a jerk in the first instalment, so they made sure almost every other character in the second game was a jerk too.They also managed to make an ending that could conceivably be considered better than the one in the first game, mostly because it just made a lot of mystery and player is wondering what's going on in third part of Deponia.I liked the platypus theme. Platypuses are cool.My vote: 9/10			"

												Wonderfully made art for a kinda empty sequel. It has its funny slapstick moments, but I have trouble remembering most of the plot in favor of my boredom of wondering around. Granted, the player wonders around in a beautiful world, but Rufus takes his damned time walking anywhere, and one finds themself traversing the island five times before finding a solution that Rufus turns into another problem. As a result, I don't want to look at it again.I halfheartedly recommend this game if it is on sale along with the rest of the trilogy, for the sake of finishing a story. If you're not interested in Rufus' journey after Deponia, this won't get any better.All in all, it's ok.			"

												4.5 - Play Deponia first then keep the magic aliveImproved characters, more polished animations, better jokes and a more conflicted and paradoxical main character make this installment better than the last. The plot takes on a much more sinister and pressing twist than the first game as the tension on Deponia escalates and the desperate protragonist is caught between keeping the love of his life and his saving his home plant in a fiendish catch 22. However the writing is exceptional, with a few brilliant laugh out loud moments and it keeps things pretty light throughout. I can't wait to get my hands on the final installment!			"

Humor is sometimes fun, sometimes a bit childish.

For some of  achievements I recommend reading a guide, because you actually have to fail some puzzles multiple times to get them.			"

												The middle child of the disfunctional family that is the Deponia Saga.Not as good as the first one, certainly better than the third one, but overall a huge drag and a disappointment. Would not recommend it, at all. The only valid reason to play this game is either because you were actually lured to play the first one (Alas, me) and now you hate not knowing how does the story continue (Let me save you some trouble. Like♥♥♥♥♥♥ or because you're a glutton for punishment.If the first one was littered with nonsensical puzzles, this one cranks it up a notch, and spreads the puzzles so thin and with so many obscure and self-conscious jokes it just comes out and sad.But, oh well.

While it does not seem that much longer than the first game, there are far more areas and that could be confusing for beginners.+ Fairly large system of maps to explore for a point and click adventure.+ Lore and atmosphere of Deponia are interesting.+ Rufus, although occasionally annoying, continued to grow on me.+ / - Full of slapstick humor, which can be a bit dull for me at times.- Puzzles can still seem a bit nonsensical, like in the first game.- No empowering/well-developed female characters.

												It's simple really - if you enjoyed the first Deponia you have a real treat awaiting. This ""round two"" in this exquisite universe features challenges and puzzles that offer the same difficulty and rewardness as found in it's predecessor. A new, interesting story and the continuation of Rufus's ""plans"" to get to Elysium and to stop Deponia from getting destroyed are well worth your money and time (took me about 10 hours to complete).

												I stopped playing as I derped and didn't save my game before my computer actually crashed it, so don't let my little hours (currently) change your opinion. This point and click game I am enjoying heaps! It so far is just as good as the first one and I love the humour in it. I do recommend the whole Deponia series it's an awesome game with a funny story and the main character is the biggest laugh.			"

												I gave the first game a recommend, and I'm not really sure why--I suppose because it was the first Daedalic title I ever played. Especially after playing The Night of the Rabbit, though, I felt particularly put off by Rufus's character more than anything else. It feels like so much ""bumbling idiot nevertheless gets the hot chick"" trope, except Rufus is if Guybrush Threepwood had a LOT more misogyny... not to mention the (otherwise interesting) core gimmick of //nonconsensually// remote-controlling Goal (which seems like a flagrant ""Woman as Trophy"" name there). I'd feel better if it turns out she's fully a robot/cyborg vs. a woman with a brain implant for what reason, but I haven't looked up spoilers to find out without playing part 3. What Goal sees in Rufus despite her awareness of how terrible a person he is doesn't make sense--sort of caring about Deponia not getting exploded + wanting all of her back together vs. splintered doesn't = great relationship material worth forgiving the physical violence he's brought upon her (ESPECIALLY when he totally meant to do it).What bothers me is this is otherwise a great game in terms of art (adorablest kitties!) and execution. The puzzles are a bit... forced, though--I'd be fine with fourth-wall-breaking *optional* puzzles, or if the story centered around fourth-wall-breaking, but I find it jarring to [light spoiler] have to exit gameplay to solve a central puzzle [/light spoiler], and I know the ""humour"" of the series is slapsticky, but it's frustrating basically having to be a bad guy to be the good guy (killing multiple animals as a ""joke"" puzzle solution).Yeah, I know nobody really reads these reviews, but I found my experience strongly disagreeable! I could honestly only reverse my ""not recommend"" if you get this super cheap and/or you want to support Daedalic making stuff (hopefully more like The Night of the Rabbit).tl;dr version: At least Rufus isn't Sadwick, but The Whispered World's cutscenes were more amazing?

												I'm a fan of all point click, mystery, puzzle rpg, adventure, fantasy, comedy, and even kids version adventure games.  Many of the genre's are combined together.  This one reminded me of a good combo pre-purchase. ...Boy, was I wrong!  This game found a way to combine most of those genres, and succeeded at being the worst version in every category.  Not to mention the extremely irksome dialogue by the even more annoying idiotic protagonist (if that is even what you should call him).  Highly uncreative, and the only pro I can think of is, the pretty cool cartoon art for the characters.  I feel bad that actors worked so hard to put this written garbage together.  How can someone not be annoyed by playing an annoying idiotic character with boring, non-funny humor that goes on and on and on and on. I tried so hard to give this game a chance.  Nothing ever happened.  It was so boring, unsatisfying. I actually became angry playing the further I went.  I think even 3-5 year old kids should find this mindless and unchallenging.  If this game were free, it's really not worth the space in your harddrive... But maybe that is just me.  Maybe you'll see it differenltly.  All I'm saying, is if I could go into a time machine right now... I'de probably first go back and tell myself not to purchase this game, then I'de go further back secondly, to save Jesus from crucifiction.(The hours that you see on here are not even hours of play... I had fallen asleep with the game on).			"

												- I was rather annoyed with non-logical solutions for some mini-puzzles, the ""marketplace music"" puzzle with absurd resolution (was stuck there for 3-4(!) hours until I have used the walktrough) and the ""fight"", where one needs to be quick and precise with controls (clicking). Additionally, the ending is weak as it was based on few conversations and phrase choices, opposed to locating and combining items with elements of conversation.+The start and the middle of the game are your ""classical"" Deponia with their colourful surroundings and characters, plenty of action and humour. =Unfortunately, I am more inclined to say that I would not recommend this game.

Posted: January 23, 2016
												The second of a three part series where Daedalic takes on Monkey Island and should be looked at as part of the series.  This is the weakest episode in the series.  If you played and enjoyed the first game, you will enjoy this one.  If not, you can stop here and not bother continuing.  If you are starting the series fresh you should pick up the first one.As a part of Daedalic's Monkey Island-like humor series, the jokes are in there, and they are numerous.  Again, I can't say anything here is any better than the other two games.  Translation problems factor in and some of the humor will leave you confused, as it did in the other two games.  Some of the humor is unintentional because of the aforesaid translation.  Some of them, a few of the less funny sexist jokes, the Scandinavian guy, that part where you ----- -- baby dolphins ---- ----, did not leave me insulted so much as wondering how the writers could have believed I would think that funny.  Perhaps this is just me not entirely getting the German sense of humor or me just calling out tasteless as I see it.The pace of the story has slowed down a lot.  A large chunk of the game involves character development for Goal.  Rufus changes little from the first game and any hopes  you may have that he is really a decent person are taken outside and shot several times.  Any character development he receives follows the direction of writer's butt monkey and someone the player wishes something bad would happen to.  Fortunately, you do become attached to the colorful cast of side characters and part of the enjoyment of playing the game involves seeing who's life Rufus will ruin next.The gameplay shows Daedalic's polish to the adventure gaming genre which leave you wondering why nobody else tried some of the changes they made.  As an example, the inventory can be brought up and down with a hotkey on your mouse wheel.  Details are well drawn and animated, with your attention going to things you should pay attention to so you don't have to do the mouse search across a background for that one object.  There are keyboard shortcuts and a highlight button to show all the intractable objects.  Things like this keep me playing Daedalic's games even through parts I don't enjoy.The puzzles are more complicated than they were in the first game.  If you don't like being in an area with a large bloated zone with several puzzles dropped in your lap at the same time, working on all of them at the same time, that is the entire first - and largest - part of the game.  Nothing drove me to frustration and any problems could be solved by thinking about them for a while, but there is a large area to cover and a lot of things to tinker with in order to figure out what you need to do.There are a few stand out moments, the first puzzle you solve, teaching you how to apply several gameplay basics, after you go through the basic tutorial was hilarious.  Hilarious enough for me to restart and replay it a few times.  The second moment was when I had to go and change the game's options to solve a puzzle.Your mileage may vary for a lot of this game but I'd still call it the weakest episode in the series where Daedalic tries to correct some of the problems made in Deponia and end up creating new mistakes.  If you are not into Daedalic's adventure games or adventure gaming in general this is one you can skip.  If you are into the Deponia series and really enjoyed the first game enough to continue the story then, by all means, pick this one up.			"

												Chaos on Deponia is a good point-and-click adventure.  The puzzles are challenging and the narration is comedy gold.  I still can't understand what the narrator is singing between Acts, but I think that might be part of the joke.Some of the puzzle clues are obtuse and frustrating initially, but the solutions always seem so obvious in retrospect.  I like a game that forces me to think about things in new ways.			"

												I think it's best to leave at the end of the first entry in the series.  Much of the interesting ideas the series presents have been explored, the characters have grown, the world is saved and there's a bittersweet note that provides some great texture and complexity.But mostly, it's the main character Rufus.  Throughout the first game he becomes more and more insufferable.  It's endearing at first, but near the end it starts to become exhausting.  By the start of this sequel, he gets to the point of being completely intolerable.  He abandons any growth he might have attained in the first game, and devolves to even more of a jackaninny than he ever was.  While it's obvious they're trying to channel Guybrush Threepwood, it crosses some hard to define line at some point where it's just not funny anymore.  Perhaps it's when he causes even more irreversable brain damage to the woman he claims to love (in addition to the damage he'd done previously) for a lollypop.			"

Posted: June 19, 2016
												Where to start...So far in my experience all Daedalic games are horrendously buggy, and with many of those bugs extending to being unable to get achievements, or unable to even beat the game! (Edna & Harvey: The Breakout comes to mind for the latter one)Sometimes you never know if you're unable to progress due to a bug that prevents certain items going into the inventory, or if it's just a horrible case of Guide-Dang-It.Rufus is 100% just someone's failed attempt at making their own lovable Guybrush Threepwood clone and failed miserably. Instead of being a loveable rapscallion he comes off as an annoying know-it-all jerk & idiotic kleptomaniac.This is evident by the occasional Monkey Island references they throw into their games.The music for the series gets TERRIBLY ANNOYING after the first couple of minutes of hearing it.TONS of animal cruelty. TONS! :CThe coding gets pretty sloppy in certain areas, like getting the new secret knock code and the new knock plays at the same time as the person giving it to you saying something. Also choppy audio files with abrupt starts and finishes breaks the immersion.---Some of the jokes are pretty funny though. Like the ""itchy trigger finger"" for a goon being from an allergic reaction to nickel.			"

												Chaos on Deponia (2nd of 3 planned parts) is kinda funnier then part 1.""Goal"", the girl from Elysium is awaked but her mind chip (a chip in her brain) is splitted in 3 parts.A noble, a agressive and a childish one.You can control her and change her chip almost everytime which gives you many funny situations and much harder puzzles. Well, you even have to turn off the XXXX XXXXX for solve a puzzle!!! XDIn part 2 you learn more about Elysium and why it exist. Goal is engaged with a guy called Cletus which kinda looks like Rufus. (Strange) But Cletus is not what he pretends or maybe is he? Rufus is again very funny and sappy sympathetic. His goofy facial expression tells you everything.Somehow i had 1 or 2 lag locations which seems to be exceptions. The Game is 100% handpainted and made in Germany.Can't wait for last part. :) 8/10			"

												Chaos on Deponia (unfortunately) still follows Rufus - my most hated main character in any game series - treading unnecessary grounds between the series' first and third instalment. The plot this time around is more or less exactly the same as in Deponia: Rufus attempts to get to Elysium, hurts Goal in the process, saves Goal, then they both arrive at some sort of 'emotional finale'. The only actual tie-in with the overall story is the ridiculously unlikely romance between the two leads. There was plenty of opportunities to allow for some character development to take place here, but the developers must have thought Rufus is perfect the way he is. I doubt I am alone in thinking otherwise.The comedy found within is more miss than hit, usually revolving around racial and gender stereotypes, slapstick, and Rufus' narcissism. Characters you meet are one-dimensional walking punchlines, only they lack actual punchlines. Often, Rufus will be painted in a good light while characters opposing him - specifically women - are seen as ♥♥♥♥♥y obstructions in a great man's journey. When that fails, crude humour comes into play in the form of dead baby animals and belittling of others. I picture the developers staring longingly through the windows of residence Monkey Island, soaking in the rain while contemplating ringing the door bell and asking for worthwhile ideas. A shame they instead resorted to the trash bin. That being said, if you are a fan of point-and-click games, you should definitely consider giving it a shot. The gameplay is good fun, the art is gorgeous, and the English voice actors usually play their roles very well. The enjoyable musical numbers separating chapters are still present, but it's now even more painfully obvious they struggled to fit the lyrics to the songs. Sadly, all of this is not enough to warrant anything other than a red thumb.In summary: If you find it appealing to control the bane of human existence sort of bumble from one mildly logical puzzle to the next while listening to him comment on his surrounds with punchable smugness for 8-9 hours, then by all means give this a try. I can promise if you did not like the first game, you won't find anything here to make you want to see trilogy's inevitable end.			"

												Really sweet gameplay and expands upon (but doesn't needlessly complicate) the system of the first two by introducing the three-main-characters-with-seperate-inventories gimmick - really fun! But unfortunately I feel like most of the game you are dealing with this new mechanic instead of getting to do fun little mini-puzzles like in the first two - there are some of course but it feels like less, and they are much easier.The story really falls flat in the middle of act two - whereas the first two entries in this series seem to have a pretty coherent plot, the plot tapers off into something...weird...and...existential? I also totally hated the ending.All in all its a really fun adventure game and if you played the first two you kind of owe it to yourself to finish it off - its not BAD, per se, its just not what I wanted. Perhaps I'll feel different if they ever continue the franchise but for now I'm spent.			"

But I will never recommend this game.

												They dropped the ball.Deponia, the original, was varied as far as point-and-click adventure games go. There were many areas to explore. There was a good sense of progression. Maybe, there were a few puzzles in there that were a tad too cryptic, but you know, it was a memorable game simply because of how it all felt when it was over.Choas on Deponia is memorable for the same reason, but this time, it doesn't feel good.It feels painful.Excrutiatingly painful.The first part of this game takes place within a large port-town that is, admittadely well-drawn and beautiful to look at, but yet again, large. Huge. Just right off the bat, you're forced to just figure things out, and that's alright in a game that's designed better, but here, anything and everything could be the ONE object you're supposed to interact with. That's just a bit too much to deal with, esspecially when the objects blend in with the background.So this one part here at the beginning sounds, you know, pretty annoying, but at LEAST it's short, right?No.I swear, this first part of the game goes on for at least four to five hours. Four to five hours of just pixel-clicking things to see if they do anything, walking, looking around, scratching your head, and going on GameFAQs.I don't remember the first game being like that. I remember it being fun and fair, not this overly-slow, cryptic trudge through samey diners, alleys, and laboratories.And what happened to Rufus? I thought he went through a huge character arc in the last one, learning his overt flaws and blatant vulerabilities? Wasn't there this big thing about how he actually was his enemy's greatest admirer only proving his rapid insults to be numbing hypocrisies, almost like he was subtley deconstructing his own personality indirectly? I thought the whole point of him ""acting"" cool was only to bottle up his true feelings of inferiority to the upper-class Elysiums that he so wanted to be a part of? It was only until the end where he realized that a change is needed for him to be in the right. He realized that the person he should be admiring the entire time should actually be the everyday, caring people that he surrounds himself with, including his own true love which he is determined to find once more and correct himself in her eyes. It will only be then when he can live without the shadow of his own pathetic whining ego crying in the deepest recesses of his mi-PFFFFFFFT. NAH. JUST MAKE HIM ACT LIKE A JERK AGAIN!WHO NEEDS THAT PESKY CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT?! AM I RIGHT?! WE'LL GET THERE IN PART 3!			"

												Do not make fun of war. You deal with different guys this time. It is not Germany of Afghanistan. George, your troops will be torn into pieces here. 250'000 of elite Iraqi soldiers are here. They will destroy everything they want, they can cross the whole desert in an hour and blow all your destroyers, journalists, diplomats. George you are a cowboy! Stop now! Forget it! Hide bullets in the warehouses away. And forget your daddy. We had one dumbass, he had revenged for his brother and the whole Glory Russian Empire crashed. And another weirdo who had revenged for his grandfather the USSR collapsed after that. And you will repeat these mistakes. Leave your father alone. He has finished his work already. Think about the future of the States, it is collapsing, young people flee from your country. Nobody wants to live in the States, NO ONE! It is a second-hand goods' store. Dollar, dollar, dollar! This is dirty green paper. Soulless! No composers, you have no writers. The whole World listens to Chaikovsky and Dostoevsky. Festivals, sport! Only in Russia. Russia here and Iraq. People love their president here and you are despised. Despised! Your predecessor — Clinton. He had his pants unzipped right in his office! Its all ♥♥♥♥ed up when some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the president's cabinet does a blow-job to mr. President. Is it what the USA is all about? Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥shall long. What are you doing out there? Monica! Nothing else metters — president, war, Middle East!♥♥♥♥♥♥suckers all around, handjobbers, ♥♥♥♥♥♥s! George! Watch any cowboy movie look how many dead bodies, blood. Murders here, murders there. Here… I'm talking to you from HERE! Look at the sky — it's Baghdad! Baghdad is not Berlin, is not Kabul. You will never win there as we know local people, we know this president. He is the only one on Earth who tells you to ♥♥♥♥ off. The only one! All others are too afraid in front of you, they stay in the line to bow low before you. And he is the only one who sits there for 11 years. For 11 years he's been resisting you! And you with your ""powerful"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥ economy, your million soldier army, your fleet and missiles can do nothing. You drop bombs daily, you kill children, while the Iraqi soldiers are ready to fight. You are afraid to send your troops there. And you have been afraid for 11 years, your papa had also feared. The apple never falls far from the tree. You will never win there! This will be your fatal fiasco. Napoleon has lost the Waterloo, Hitler has lost the battle for Berlin and you will lose Baghdad. Baghdad is your tomb. You hear me, George — damn cowboy? You need back to Texas, to your ranch. Drive around your empty lands in Jeep and start learning spanish. And New-York will have spoken russian already. We will send another 10 million of Russians to the States and will elect our own President for the US. And you, George, will get a good cell in the Butirka prison. Do you get me? George, you will never be victorious here. All Arabs and Muslims of the world, the whole eastern Europe, Moscow is against you. Moscow doesn't want this war and our President has clearly told you^ do not fire at Baghdad. Let's better blow up Tbilissi together or Baku, or other cities. We will find other targets on the Earth. The Earth is so large — we can sink Australia into the oceans depths if you like. Alright! Wanna see our missiles? Our weapons now… at night our scientists will change gravitation field of the Earth a little bit and your country will be under the water. 24 hours and your whole country will be under the water of the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Think about who you are playing with? Think! You forgot what Bonapart's end, Hitler's end was, all others? You will make a historical mistake, your father won't be grateful to you, forget him, your daddy. Your generals tell you not to start war. Still it is not too late! Today is just the 21th of June 1941! But if tomorrow morning you send your fighters to Baghdad it will be your own tomb, you will die in this war. And no one will bury you as you hit the whole country, the whole humanity. 6 billions people do not want this war to happen SIX! SIX BILLION. You ignorant, do you know how to count? One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six billion. Whole planet is against you. You are the only one who wants war and this♥♥♥♥♥♥— Condoleezza Rice.

												Review by Games Fiends http://gamesfiends.com/pc/chaos-on-deponia-pc-review/Point and click adventure games run through my blood more than I’d normally care to admit. As a young kid I’d watch my stepmum tackle the Monkey Island games on the Amiga… taking great delight in the wonderful world and atmosphere they portrayed and chuckling at the fantastic humour. As I grew older, I would play other fine examples of this genre such as Full Throttle and Broken Sword. Most recently, the genre has been re-ignited thanks to TellTale Games Sam and Max franchise and of course The Walking Dead.Chaos On Deponia establishes itself firmly in the same vein as the hallowed Monkey Island games in both tone, atmosphere and complexity of the challenges laid out before you. It doesn’t just offer an entertaining diversion for a few hours, it envelopes you in a light, bright and brilliantly realised world that is a breath of fresh air in an age of mottled brown first person shooters.Chaos On Deponia is the second game in a trilogy which first started with August 2012′s Deponia. You play Rufus, an inhabitant of a junk world where the upper classes reside high in floating cities whilst the rest of the population slum it on the garbage filled lands and seas. Your character is an arrogant inventor of ridiculous contraptions and contrivances that occasionally (through luck more than anything else) work. The recap of the first game is a little scattershot and I felt I only picked up the detail once I’d played through a fair few hours of the second game.That all said, it’s a testament to how much I enjoyed Chaos On Deponia that despite not having played the first title, I have purchased it from Steam and will be making sure I have the third title on order as soon as it comes out.Firstly, the gameplay provides an engaging cerebral workout where common sense, experimentation and eureka moments all help you to move through the traditional point and click puzzle solving challenges. There is a nice mix of both delightfully obvious things you’ll need to do, some that require a bit more thought and others which are downright baffling, but once the solution is laid bare, never feels obtuse or illogical. The game starts off with a very enjoyable opening sequence where you cause a comical series of misfortunes to a poor bird as you go about the simple challenge of trying to pick up a hammer. This was a hilarious opener to Chaos On Deponia and sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the game.Shortly after you are thrust into one of the junkyard port towns where the game really opens up. Sometimes it can be a little difficult to remember exactly what you are doing (or need to do) but that’s also a good testament to how open the gameplay is. Traipsing through the town with its cast of colourful and eclectic characters was one of the many pleasant reminders of the earlier Monkey Island games. Mini-games are neatly interspersed throughout the levels and add an extra layer of gameplay, however these can be skipped over if they prove too much of a challenge which is ideal for those who are more interested in absorbing the world and the storyline rather than spending lots of time trying to work out a puzzle sequence.Even during the moments where I became really stuck I never got too frustrated thanks to the ability to double click from one screen to the next, which avoids having to watch your character walk from one side of the screen to the other all the time. This means that you can traverse the game areas quite quickly. Even long periods of travelling back and forth whilst you try and work out a solution to a problem never becomes patience shatteringly painful. Chaos On Deponia, despite being the second title in the trilogy, takes great care to welcome even newcomers of the series to both the game world and even the genre itself. Promising a rewarding challenge for those that want it, and as little pain as possible for those that don’t.Graphically the game features some of the richest artwork I’ve seen in a long time. A wide colour palette and fine details adorn each screen, making progress a joyful delight as you get to admire the wonderful artistry and inhabiting characters. Having a Germanic background, the art style itself is a very abstract mix of European oddness. Some characters look like they wouldn’t be out of place in Bellville Rendez-vous, whilst others have the more conventional appearance of a Saturday morning kids cartoon character. The Deponian world is realised as a series of townships, buildings and interiors that have been constructed from recycled junk, which is reflected by the background artwork and the attention to detail. At no point do you feel like anything has been rushed in the production of this videogame series. Each screen is unique and has had the same level of care and attention lavished on it as the last.The characters are wonderfully drawn, and although the animation isn’t fluid I didn’t find that particularly bothersome. The lack of voice syncing was a bit of a distraction during the moments where you see the characters up close during the cutscenes, and it’s only here where the artistic quality take a minor dip as they appear to be blown up from the normal character models that you control rather than original standalone artwork.Underpinning the wonderful visuals is an equally bright and whimsical score that’s enjoyable and never too repetitious. The vocal work on the whole is largely excellent, with the dialogue not suffering as a result of the translation over from German to English. Some of the more over-excited moments of line delivery from Rufus does make the performance less convincing and slightly theatrical, the opening recap from the first game being a prime example of this. But otherwise the eccentric cast of characters are all given a unique voice with great delivery and comedic timing.Chaos On Deponia should be an essential purchase for Monkey Island fans. A definite purchase for point and click adventure fans, and a recommended purchase for anyone else. The beautifully drawn world serves up curious but loveable characters. An entertaining story is glossed with many amusing moments. The gameplay is infused with brain wracking puzzles that challenge but don’t frustrate. The Deponia series may not resuscitate the point and click genre into mainstream popularity unlike The Walking Dead, but it serves as a strong reminder as to how good they were in the 90s heyday and how great they can be again.8.5/10			"

												I bought this before I'd gotten around to playing the first, assuming I'd get to it later.  This was a mistake.  Below are my thougts on the first.  From what I've read, the second and third installments don't improve, and in some ways are worse.I wanted to like this one.  The art is stylish and charming, and the premise is interesting.  However the main character was utterly unlikeable, the puzzles (mostly) poorly designed, the voice acting mediocre at best, and the humour falls flat (not to mention being fairly sexist a lot of the time).Steer clear.

												This and the first game were fairly interesting. The puzzle were a little conveluted but it had a nice atmosphere and I wanted to know more about Deponia. Unfortunately, the character of Rufus became unbearably anoying. I understand that he is not bright but I drew the line at having my choice of action be negated for story purposes. The whole thing just wore thin.character: Rufus you have to do thisRufus: egotystical remarkRufus screws thing up with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ invention or puzzle solvingplotI did not get invested with the characters and by the end I just wanted deponia to be blown up.

												What a sexist game. Broke my hear, beautifuI art, cutes story (with political and social matter), I was really in love with it when I first played it but .....I got the trilogy but in Chaos on Deponia I just stopped, it was really anoying, how Goal is objectified, mutered, always in weak position, depending on men to save her, when she is in many ways the key to save Deponia. And it gets worse, they make it with the intention to make us laugh about it.			"

												Absolutely fantastic! The first Deponia game was great, and this one topped that! The puzzles were fantastically challenging, and the dialogue was just as funny (if not even more hilarious) than last time. The artwork in this game is beautiful! The artwork was obviously designed for much larger screens than the first game, and the backgrounds are beautifully detailed with all kinds of amazing... well, mostly garbage, BUT that's the beautiful part of Deponia! So much work is put into these beautifully drawn backgrounds, and the animations are very well drawn too.Truely another wonderful game by Daedelic. One thing though, if you have a problem with double entendres, then you probably won't like the humor of this game. I, however, LOVE double entendres, and thus loved the game's humor!

												In my opinion this game is the hardest of the series. The logic used throughout the deponia games is pretty odd which is most bewildering in Chaos on Deponia because the difficulty ramps up, meaning the logic gets more messed up. It is because of the extra challenge that the puzzles and humor in this game are possibly the best of the trilogy. Overall if you're interested enough to be reading reviews for this game, and assuming you played the first Deponia, I highly recommend you continue this adventure.			"

Even better than the first game it carrys on in much the same way. However if you didn't like the gameplay/humor of the first deponia I can't say its any different.One of the things I hate about point and click games is half of em require you to spend half your time in a walkthrough to figure out that your supposed to add a straw and a pickle to make a key or whatever.Deponia has puzzles which you can actually figure out and make sense conceptually. You can play thorugh the game without ever touching a walkthough which I liked.I recomend the armageddon bundle whenever its on sale (cause even though the whisperd world is♥♥♥♥♥♥and the art of edna and harvey is lacking I'm pretty happy with all the other titles I've played through)			"

												The second part of the amazing Deponia series of point and click games. This game gives you a similar amount of challenges as its previous part and can make you very angry with the moments that make little to no sense where after you check in a guide what you're supposed to do, it turns out that the solution was plain irrational. For example, where Rufus can't get the secret knock right because of the music he heard in the previous location, you're supposed to... turn the BGM off in the settings menu. This is probably the most ridiculous thing I've stumbled upon in a point and click game.Despite some things I might not like about it, it still is an awesome game and one of the best in its genre.

												Chaos on Deponia continues the story of Deponia. The game brings nothing new to the genre, however it has great and funny characters, nice riddles, okay mini games and a fantastic atmosphere once you get passed the first puzzle to get off the Floating Black Market. The first riddle is fustrating and almost made me want to stop playing. Regardless, I am glad that I pushed through it. The second half of the game was allot of fun and became quite enjoyable. The puzzles are allot harder in this one than the first. Overall, I am glad I continued the story but I will admit, the first one was more fun. The puzzles are tough enough that you probably won't figure them out right away, but they're not so tough that they'll stump you for days at a time, either. It's guaranteed to provide you with a few good belly laughs, plus some genuine brain teasers as well. In the end, the attention to detail in the action design, the richness of the puzzles, the colorful nature of the setting and its characters- all those elements have enchanted us while you play through on to the third act.

Overall:  It's a good point and click adventure.  I absolutely recommend if it's on sale.  Whether you want to pay full price is up to how much of a point and click enthusiast you are.Story: This Deponia has a much faster start, and I must admit I've never had so much fun getting a hammer.  Many point and click adventures have degrees of moon logic where a nonsensical combination of items and actions somehow solves the problem, but Deponia makes it somehow seem almost rational in hindsight.  Rufus often made me simultaneously gasp in horror and laugh at some of the stunts he pulled on his fellow Deponians.Gameplay:  It has a moderate amount of pixel hunting.  Some of the scenes are extremely cluttered and can make finding the one thing needed difficult.  The majority of puzzles aren't terribly hard to figure out, though some of them require patient trial and error or a quick google search.			"

												Huzzah! If you enjoyed the first game in this series; you'll certainly enjoy this one.  This sequel really does build upon the previous game and continues to build up for its sequel.  With more puzzels, more quirky lines and characters, more story, and of course more Rufus, this game brough everything i wanted in the sequel.  Im now very excited to delve into the finale of the trilogy and see what will happen to Rufus and Crew on their home of Deponia.			"

												In my opinion this game is the hardest of the series. The logic used throughout the deponia games is pretty odd which is most bewildering in Chaos on Deponia because the difficulty ramps up, meaning the logic gets more messed up. It is because of the extra challenge that the puzzles and humor in this game are possibly the best of the trilogy. Overall if you're interested enough to be reading reviews for this game, and assuming you played the first Deponia, I highly recommend you continue this adventure.			"

												The story of a lovable and selfish idiot living on a world that has be reduced to a scrap heap.The writing is funny and the story is good. I find it hard to write too much about this game without spoiling it, so I will just finish off by saying, that this is a good adventure game that really is worth your time.ps. John Walker is a vindictive fool.			"

												It's in the start a little bit more childish than the first game, it isn't believable at all the part about collecting platypuses, but after all that it became more fun to play, the plot thickens and everything goes allright fun a lot of fun adventures from there onwards. You can play only the first two games of the Deponia series and everything fits nicely, but don't bother with the third game, it dropped the ball pretty badly In various ways (the third is not this one, this one is one I can recommend)			"

												Great game so far! Love this game, it has really good cartoony type graphics, some really nice animations. The story is amazing. Let me just give a quick summary:The game takes place in Silentia, a dream fantasy world of a young, sad circus clown named Sadwick. The story starts as he wakes up in his travelling circus trailer after having experienced a recurring nightmare, where he sees the world falling apart.Sadwick wanders off to a nearby forest and meets Bobby, a Chaski, messenger of the King. Bobby is heading to Corona, the royal floating castle, to deliver a powerful artefact, the Whispering Stone, to the king. He claims the end of the world is near and that the land is already breaking apart and the Asgil, a hideous horde of underground creatures, are surrounding Corona. He tells Sadwick he has been unsuccessfully seeking an oracle named Shana who may have advice on shortening his trip, and asks Sadwick to help find her. Sadwick believes she could interpret his nightmares and convinces Bobby to give him the Whispering Stone to activate a secret passage that could lead him to Shana. Shortly after Bobby gets scared away and disappears in what Sadwick believes was an Asgil attack. Sadwick manages to locate Shana and finds out that his destiny is to destroy the world.Shana directs Sadwick to a nearby island to find mysterious Kalida who eventually takes him near Corona. There Sadwick manages to listen in to the plans of Asgil leader Loucaux but gets captured and thrown in a jail cell. After successfully escaping, he manages to board a flying train to Corona, where he meets Bobby again who tells him that he is too late and the king has locked himself in his quarters. After exploring the castle, Sadwick finds a model of a planetary system linked to the flow of space-and-time itself. He meets the royal astronomer who tells him that the Whispering Stone represents the planet Silentia in the model of 5 planets and that he must repair the system to restore the balance and activate the fountain of the Water of Life to wake the king who has fallen ill.Upon repairing the mechanism, a blue sphere from Sadwick's nightmares appears saying that Sadwick is inevitably ending the world. Trying to prevent that, Sadwick jams the planetary system's mechanism stopping time itself and breaking all of the world into pieces. The Asgil occupy what is left of the castle, but Sadwick manages to trick Loucaux and reactivates the planetary mechanism again, restoring the cadence of time. He escapes and arrives at the king's quarters, where he instead finds familiar settings and a large mirror. Upon looking into the mirror, another boy drags him into a room with two opposite mirrors. The boy explains that in reality Sadwick is this boy lying in a coma in a hospital while the blue sphere is his father reading him stories. Sadwick then breaks the mirror he came from and wakes up in the real world.Amazing game! Great Story! Love this story ^^^			"

												Click-adventures are back. If you can handle the (sometimes intentional) lack of logic in the puzzles (there's a key for hotspots so it's not all bad) and the annoying main character (who'll grow on you) this is an ok game. Had some trouble to get it to work in a window.			"

												I have never enjoyed a game so much while liking the main protagonist so little. Rufus brings chaos and ill-crafted plans with him everywhere he goes, wreaking havoc on the lives of all those around him. This point & click puzzle game was challenging at points, while offering the option to skip some of the more involved mini-games if you are not so inclined to puzzle over them. There are a few places in which the puzzles stumped me even after giving it a lot of thought, but for the most part, the solutions to most of the puzzles and minigames were logical enough to be solved with just some time (and occasionally some trial and error).The comedy in this series can sometimes be a bit edgier, and maybe even a bit questionable in a few places, but the game play and storyline is overall highly entertaining and rewarding.

												I wrote a full review, then I hit the wrong key and it was gone, so here's the executive summary.- Rufus is still a selfish jerk with a tiny buttery core. I like him more, probably because of how Deponia ended.- The bit with the market and the password at the door was grotesque to say the least, but at least I know that this was a deliberate attempt at being as far out as possible. If you spend more than 5 minutes on it, just check a walkthrough because if you don't get it immediately, you'll never get it.- The whole chips and remote deal was genious. Very nice indeed.- The Resistance bit was probably a bit rushed and underexplored. Quite a stark change of pace, not sure such steep a climb was necessary.- I played it all in one go, it took me 13 hours. Best 13 hours in a very long time.Highly recommended. Five stars. AAA. Go.

												Ok, compared to the first game:— jokes became even better;— storyline logic got murdered;— puzzles are ok, didn't need a solution once, although there is one especially interesting, heh ;)A pity about story, but damn, that humour is just too good to miss out on it. Worth buying.			"

												If you came here expecting a good sequel to Deponia, you might as well throw yourself off of (spoiler) AN ORGANON BLAST TOWER.  This is not a game for following a story, this is a game for hardcore Daedelic fans, people who enjoy obfuscative puzzles, or just enjoy watching Rufus♥♥♥♥♥♥around for ~12 hours of your life.  Funny, challenging, and (probably) more charming than Rufus, this adventure is not for the faint of heart.			"
