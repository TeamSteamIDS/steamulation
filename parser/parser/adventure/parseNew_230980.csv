												There seem to be a lot of pretentious reviews for this game on the internet, which really put me off. Despite my criticisms, the dev gave me a copy through twitter. Stripped of the pretty words others seem to lavish on it, it’s basically a platformy puzzler you play at your own pace which you’ll either hate, grow bored of quickly, or love. There is nothing innately pretentious about the game itself which makes me wonder why indie game reviewers try so hard.In Starseed Pilgrim, you collect “seeds” to build block formations to explore your central hub and unlock other pilgrims. To collect seeds, you must venture into a place where the darkness of space is actively devouring everything. The darkness of space, if you jump into it, inverts the playing field, making those solid blocks into empty space and vice versa. You want to collect seeds and keys in order to get back home and use them. You can’t grow anything in the darkness of space so thought must be invested beforehand.The game largely leaves you to your own devices, so you’re free to explore whatever you can reach. Different coloured seeds grow into different shapes and sometimes do special things, like provide seeds in the darkness of space or allow you to jump higher. Certain levels have rules. It’s up to you to figure out what does what but nothing is so obtuse that it’s impossible.If you find peace in repetition and enjoy setting your own goals, I’d say buy this game, otherwise you won’t get much out of it. And on the front of accessibility, the game has colour blind mode on by default and supports scaling. I was appreciative of both.			"

												In Starseed Pilgrim, the first thing you learn is that you can break blocks and plant seeds. You are then set upon a large, earthy block suspended in white void and expected to use your fresh and limited knowledge of this universe so far to explore away from your starting point. Different seeds grow at different speeds, shapes, directions, and wonderful sounds. You plant away and start to climb, sure without being sure that there must be something else in this vast emptiness besides yourself.There is a challenge to the exploration, discovery, and successful return home – enough that even with the game's insistence on minimal to absent guidance, you'll want to make it at least once.However, it is after surmounting this first hurdle that I no longer felt compelled to play, because the more I saw of Starseed Pilgrim, the more I recognized it as a solid proof of concept rather than a complete and satisfying game. Allow me to explain.The blocks, the seeds, and the void are simple components: easily understood with some trial and error. These same elements, however, are also samey to a fault and become bland with overexposure. While the simplicity of the core mechanic is both visually and sonically polished, the simplicity of the game that contains it is lonely and boring; it feels incomplete. You will make your way from base block to base block with practiced efficiency, but there is less and less of a reason for you to do so. Exploration continues to reveal more of the same, as if the game had something against variety in design.I have heard that, with some doing, you can indeed find the novel experiences that I expected as the rewards for my progress. I'm afraid that I just don't have the patience. I enjoy exploration for exploration's sake, but when a game tells me nothing and shows me even less, should I really be expected to keep at it?			"

												Starseed Pilgrim is the kind of game where I can't give it a negative review, because it means I don't, ""get it,"" and at the same time, I can't give it a positive review, because its author(s) were so pre-occupied tripping over itself in attempts to be thought-provoking, they seem to have forgotten to include... content. There's symbolism and artistic metaphor, but they're so vague and caved-in under so much repeatition that few, if any, players can actually give them even a minimal identity. There's straightforward gameplay with puzzles to be solved and rewards to be had, but the biggest puzzle is solved the instant the player has planted a seed of each color for the first time and collected a key. The rewards for success are nebulous and consist mostly of being faced with the same puzzle again, while the penalty for failure is also being faced with the same puzzle again. It's essentially entertainment for art-game snobs, who want a reason to laugh at the riff-raff that don't appreciate it the ""right"" way, and for defeatists who are only comfortable playing in a world where all their actions are doomed to begin with. Certainly, people other than the above mentioned types can enjoy Starseed Pilgrim, but the intentional kind of enjoyment this game produces isn't about trial and error puzzle-play (like House of Dead Ninjas), exploration of a metaphor-strewn environment (like The Path), or even some combination of the two (such as Limbo). Basically, this goes into the same category as ""Vinnie Vole's Existentialist Nightmare.""			"

												This game is amazing!  I'll warn you, it can be pretty hit or miss, but if it's a hit, it's a unique experience that you don't want to deprive yourself!  I wish I could tell you all about it, but I can't.  I can tell you plenty of things its like, but I can't really describe it except for in the very abstract.  And my abstract description is that it is a game about learning.  There is little in the way of obvious instruction.  It's up to you to figure it out.  When I first looked at screenshots, I saw random squares in patterns that were aesthetically pleasing.  Now I look at them and see order.  I see several levels of order.  To tell you more about the game would be to rob you of the experience of transitioning from seeing order to seeing chaos as you play this game.As for things its like, I would say it is like...* Learning a new language* Getting lost in a maze, and that joy when you finally find your way out* David Bowie's song, ""Moss Garden""* Discovering that the world is round, firsthand* The NES game, Wario's Woods* Your first kiss* The ""Aha!"" moment that you get when figuring out a puzzle* The 11th Hour, by Graeme BaseIf you play this game, I can't promise you you'll love it.  It is the sort of game that resonate with some people, but will just not be everyone's cup of tea.  What I can tell you is that if it resonates with you, you will REALLY enjoy it, and might find it the most worthwhile game you've bought in a long time.			"

												I'm ok with the arty-ness of the game. I've played my fair share of games with ambiguous floating meaningful text.The game has an interesting idea for a puzzle and interesting variations on tsaid puzzles. BUT the game is too random for it to be fun or completable. Completing a ""level"" to bring seeds back to the ""overworld"" to explore is fine.Getting to the challenges in each level is bloody impossible. Here's why:- After the first 1-3 seeds, the seeds you get are entirely random. Only restriction to this keeps you from getting the same seed twice in a row.- How 2 of the 6 seeds grow is semi random. That's a third of what you have to work with and PLENTY enough to mess up your best laid plans.- Where the keys AND THE ALTERNATE EXIT FOR THE CHALLENGES spawn is completely random. This is the clincher. There is no way you can even BEGIN to formulate a stratagy if you don't know where you're going. You can only do the same basic thing over and over hoping you pointed yourself in the right direction. That is insanity.Having only one of those randomized would make the game challenging but doable. But Starseed Pilgrim has all three and the end result is tedious, annoying, frustrating, and just not fun.			"

												I gave it an hour, I read up on other reviews, and I'm sorry, but this game just doesn't have much going on, and if you ""have to experience it for yourself"", then I'd remind you that you can say the same thing, but start your sentence with: ""Man, that porta-potty is terrible, but really, you have to....."" yeah. That.If someone can give me a compelling reason to continue meandering through a bland game that urges you to think strategically about placement of pseudo-random adjustments to your environment, while having limited time to think about it, for the reward of: umm, doing it more? Perhaps I could be convinced to try it again. But it's not likely.			"

												You know games like Rogue Legacy or One-Way Heroics or other (usually procedurally-generated) titles where you lose but make progress to assist you in making it to ""the end""? Okay, this is that, but incredibly abstract and with no explanations given.A lot of people recommend going into this blind. I'm gonna break this down into two tiers of review: one that's incredibly minimalist and gives away as little as possible, and one that'll be more detailed for the curious who give no heed about spoilers.THE BRIEF REVIEW: Game only uses a few keys total. Plant seeds which grow in different ways/have seperate effects based on their color (or shape, if you have colorblind mode on). Your enjoyment will greatly hinge upon how much you want to experiment with this process until you figure basics out. Hint: grow upwards, grow outwards, and remember you can delete blocks beside/below you.THE SPOILING REVIEW: Seriously, stop reading probably.Okay anyway.The game gets a little repetitive as you try to 'grow' Green blocks because they have block seeds in them. Your journeys into the resetting world(s - plural, you need to explore to find new ones) will be based on reaching a black speck in the void to get a key, so you can get inside the structure you've grown, grab the seeds, and use the gate at the bottom to make it 'home' with your haul. Use those to grow out the permanent structure, and find new places/some worldbuilding text.Do this for a while, blindly seeking out the next area with whatever construction you create. That's the game, and as far as I can tell, it does not change. I cheated and looked around to see if I had anything new coming and went ""I think I'm good here"" a few worlds in. Not bad, but decide for yourself if this seems like your bag, spoiler-haver.			"

												Starseed Pilgrim is a quirky puzzle action game. It starts out being quite obscure with its rules, and the process of discovering them (without outside help) is both frustrating and rewarding. I should note here that discussion about the game has grossly overstated the way that reading about the game before playing it will ruin your experience. ALL good games are better if you discover what's in the game from inside the game, rather than from outside of it. Starseed Pilgrim isn't special in this regard. It's just got weird rules. Pretty much all puzzle games do. It's the weird miscellaneous genre. Anway...Sooner or later you find that randomness holds significant sway in this world, and accumulating resources increases your chances of success. So after you get a grasp of the initially mysterious mechanics, luck and grinding play a large role.The game's structure is an interesting effort toward combining a system of 'endless' randomly-generated puzzle-action (like Tetris, Panel de Pon, and Puyo Puyo) with crafted puzzle-platformer challenges (like Loderunner, Lup Salad, or Braid). This mixture could be improved by aiming more toward the side of crafted stages. It could do with more of a sense of progression. The unchanging atmosphere is austere, thanks to minimal low-res pixel art graphics, and ambient music with chords as sound effects. There are rhymes written in the background of the hub world, which tell a whimsical tale about an environmental space disaster or something.The game's strength is in that feeling of mastery through discovery as you uncover its rules. I recommend it for that, despite the weak payoff of optimising and employing your grinding strategy.			"

-Quick Review-Starseed Pilgrim is an Indie Puzzle game developed by Droqen and released in 2013. The most important feature of Starseed Pilgrim is that you figure out how to progress through the puzzles yourself, if you're looking for some basic tips I will reveal some in the rest of my review. (Nothing game changing, just the stuff you'll figure out for yourself. I'll use spoiler tags though.)-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There really isn't a story in Starseed Pilgrim, if there is any type of story it's each time you change characters... or character suits? Personally stories drive me to complete the game because I want to know how the game ends and what happens at the end... so in Starseed Pilgrim I didn't have that motivation.Gameplay: The mechanics in Starseed Pilgrim are the winning factor... well to be more specific it's learning how to work with the mechanics,  You're basically a space farmer... “space” being that white void surrounding the small patch of land you plant on. And “Farmer” being you plan different seeds that do different things, one you can harvest to get seeds (the mechanic I needed to look up a guide to figure out), some grow tall, some grow big, some grown out, some let you jump higher, etc.The problem sets in after you've figured out the mechanics... Unfortunately since the story isn't driving the game, I felt like I was repeatedly rubbing my face against a cheese grader trying to grind the game out to get seeds to build my way to the next island platform.While initially it was fun and exciting to see an island off in the distance, the reward for getting to one was last luster at best.Achievements: There are no steam achievements for Starseed Pilgrim. It's quite possible sometime achievements could be added to the game... which would then force achievers like myself to completely finish the game... on the on the bright side I'd get that ""motivation"" to complete the game that I was talking about.Price: Starseed Pilgrim is priced at $6.00, while I won't say the price is unreasonable, I like to spend an hour on a game for every dollar I spend.Conclusion: In conclusion; the Story wasn't really existent. the Gameplay was fun to learn, but after learning there was nothing else to drive the game forward for me. There are no Steam Achievements. The price was fair. I recommend this game to people who enjoy figuring out puzzles mostly on their own, I feel like this is a certain flavor of game that you either love or don't care for.			"

												Starseed Pilgrim manages to be about so many things, and conveys all of that meaning through the simple act of playing, discovering, and exploring.  The writing is beautiful, but what really hits me is when I realize the game is about x... and then after a while I realize it's really about y... and then I discover z, which totally changes my previous perception of the game.  It's a never-ending process (at least, I haven't reached the end, yet) that manages to be consistently surprising, challenging, and thought-provoking.  Highly recommended.			"

												A quick overview:+ Unique and interesting puzzle mechanics+ Nice sound design- Making progress requires a lot of trial and error- Some elements of the game will literally have you just waiting in order to progress- Random elements in the game can impede your progress and make planning your moves useless.- It's very easy to accidentally undo progressI was planning on finally playing and beating every game in my library. This game made me give up on the beating every game part. As you may have gathered from the overview, the game is kinda fun and novel at first, but once the novelty wears off what's left is a game that is tedious to play and provides no motivation for completing it.The game places you on top of a square of dirt blocks in an almost completely empty space. You are given seeds that can be planted into blocks to grow more blocks and thus allow you to navigate the space. Different kinds of seeds grow different kind of block formations. Your goal is to use the seeds to navigate the gameworld in search of keys and other levels. In theory these mechanics could be used to make interesting puzzles. However to call this a puzzle game is a bit of an exaggeration. Some of the seeds grow random formations of blocks and the seeds available to you are random as well.  This causes you to have to rely on luck and trial and error more than any actual puzzle solving. It is possible to end up with block formations that make it impossible to progress or simply run out of seeds before you reach your goal. When this happens you'll have to start the level all over. On top of that in every level a black void starts to slowly consume your blocks, placing a restraint on the amount of time you have to plan ahead. To worsen this time restraint some of the seeds grow their block formations very slowly. Often you are simply just standing around waiting for blocks to grow. All of this makes navigating the world very tedious and time consuming. The game also only provides a small view of the world and doesn't provide any indication of where to go resulting in alot of wasted time navigating blank space.The game also doesn't provide any reward for making progress. There is no story, no new gameplay elements, no new environments or events. Just more of the same. I looked up the ending on youtube and decided it was just not worth the time investment.In conclusion I'd recommend this game only if you are interested in trying novel games with unique gameplay mechanics, just for novelty's sake.

Arcade games of this calibur can be hard to discover. Well worth the low price. The ambiant music fills out the open/empty world and isolated sensation. Seems easy at first but you gotta know what you're doing if you want to 'finish' the game, which i have yet to accomplish. At the start I found it confusing but it doesn't take long to get the hang of it. Give it a go and enjoy yourself.			"

												Starseed Pilgrim is a game that is all about figuring things out. Upon starting the game up for the first time you're thrown right into the game with not a single instruction on how to proceed--no menus, no starting screen, no tutorials...straight into the thick of it you go! I want to stop short of calling Starseed Pilgrim a block based sandbox game, but the basic gameplay mechanic is about ""growing"" blocks so you can travel around the gameworld. To this extent the game is focused on exploration and growth, opposed to more classical examples of sandbox games where the emphasis is on the destrution and reconstruction of the game world. In Starseed Pilgrim the player instead must use their resources to reach new levels within the hub world. Each of these levels is similar in design, yet each offers a unique twist on the mechanics of gameplay. The goal is the same in each however, exit the level naturally with as many ""seeds"" as you can, allowing you to continue to grow pathways in your hub world.Since Starseed Pilgrim is all about figuring things out on your own, I'm afraid to say too much. What I am confident in saying is that I'm having a lot of fun with Starseed Pilgrim, the fusion of exploration and a zen-like puzzle/building style of gameplay make it a very enjoyable game to just sit back, relax, and enjoy. My initial impression of the game was a bit hazy as I played through the ""figure-things-out-for-yourself"" phase, but once I got through the first hour I became quite hooked with game--it quickly turned into something I wanted to play all the time. It's not for everyone, true enough, but for those who find the concept interested will undoubtedly feel it a rewarding game to play. It's simple in nature, but can offer complexity to those who wish to master it. Don't stop playing too early, as it's never clear what you need to do to win. If you're looking for something a little different with a little price, take a look at Starseed Pilgrim!			"

												Indie developers pride themselves on breaking our expectations of game mechanics by flat-out doing things differently. Sometimes it works, too. However, there are occasions when the function of design contribute to the value and purpose of the subject. Instructions are integrated with the level design and after several sessions I was able to make just the barest sense of them.Experimental games have limited credence with me. Structure has its benefits, and so do clear instructions. Released in 2013 on the now thriving Indie scene available on Steam, Starseed Pilgrim is an exercise in minimalist presentation and resource management. In this game you are a ‘symphonic gardener’, but so help me I wasn’t able to determine what the tools were, much less how they functioned beyond movement and block removal/placement.The entire game is presented in a single screen with visual and audio indicators of your degree of success. Our nameless, 8-pixel tall caretaker is constantly pursued by an ink-black space that results in a reset of your garden when caught. A numeric counter of–your hearts, as it turns out–ticks down to zero over a fixed period of time, and your only hope is to grow more and collect them… I think.Logic puzzles are a hobby of mine, but only when they make sense. Crazy, right? A legend of your inventory and their attributes would have improved my understanding greatly… not to mention more accurately phrased goals and consequences.I have over the years enjoyed a few artistic interactive experiences in the past, and that’s usually all they are. If you’re feeling rebellious and anxious with mainstream, this is your bag – or, garden. For my entertainment, too much pruning of useful information took place here.What’s fun: Discovery of unique mechanics is fascinating. Graphics and audio are refreshingly simple.What’s not: Ironically, graphics and audio communicate function and mechanic far better than the handful of words that appear during play.Recommendation: Know your mark before you buy. This is an information-sparse puzzler with perplexing logic. If this style of play interests you, it’s worth every bit the asking price.This review is featured with others at Thousandhour Gaming http;//thousandhour.nudgeworksdesign.com/ .			"

												The initial lure of this game is the sense of wonder and curiousity. It's so simple at a glance. Surely it's like the other puzzle games; a mystery upon the surface, but a series of sensical conclusions once you get beneath the ephemeral introduction (which serves as both the opening lines to the story and your tutorial). Upon diving into the deep end (for one cannotbe thrown), you find that you truly are an explorer in a vast unknown.There are no hints. There are no suggestions. You will fail and you will learn. For every step forward, you will make one (or two) back. Just as you have that 'ah-ha!' moment, you will encounter another wall to be scaled. Just as you think you have the very next solution, you will realize you forgot something.Dive into Starseed Pilgrim, approach it like something wholly new. You are a pilgrim. You are an adventurer. Keep your eyes open: nothing should be ignored, even if you've seen it a dozen times before. And when you -- inevitably -- fail, pick yourself back up and try again.			"

												The Description and the screenshots do not do this game justice. Starseed Pilgrim is the best game for exploration and experimentation in a simple manner. At first it seemed as though I had missed the point until I had experimented with the ""seeds"" and realized there is much more to this than what can be shown through videos and screens. Now I'll admit that I didn't research the game before playing so I went into it blind and I feel that helped immerse me into the game more. If you're looking for a game that will suprise you and challenge you, here is Starseed Pilgrim.However keep in mind there are little to no instructions but you really wont need any. You'll start and with the minimal controls there are you'll soon learn how to expand your world and escape the spreading darkness.			"

												I loathe this game. I got taken in by the lavish praise it received when it was first released. The graphics are meh, the sound is okay, the control-reaction isn't great, and the gameplay is grindy and aggravatingly luck-based.To date, this is by far my greatest buyer-remorse Steam purchase.

												There seems to be an atmosphere of mystery surrounding this game, but I think that hinders talking about the game at all.  People should talk about this game, it's pretty neat.Your first hour or so will be spent learning how the seeds work, how best to use them, and discovering exactly how to make progress.  Your next 5 or 6 hours will be spent gradually exploring what's there to explore.  Then, if you so choose, there are another 10 or so hours preparing to defeat the challenge stages.The gameplay focuses around the attributes of the different block types, and how best to use them to stay ahead of the black.  It's not just about how they grow, but how the black grows through the blocks.  Also, spoilers: you need to grow pink blocks and break them to replenish your seeds.  That's supposed to be clear immediately but people still miss it.			"

												Not sure what to make of this one.I like unusual titles that deviate from the mainstream but starseed pilgrim didn't really keep me invested. Probably because it's just another minimalist indie-platformer with floating meaningful text that we've all seen before. At this point this trope is just so tiring and predictable it's almost a parody.Beyond the lazy presentation the gameplay is frustrating. In theory the ideas are ok and I enjoy exploring at my own pace but most of the plants you sow grow in semi-random patterns, making it almost impossible to apply any kind of strategy and after a while I felt like I was constantly moving in circles. There's no sense of progression and you have no incentive to keep going because even if you were to progress you would still end up at an identical-looking place to the one before. Maybe that's the point, you can't escape the evergrowing darkness. If the intention of the developer was to inspire existential dread than they surely succeeded.As for the ""symphonic"" garden in the description: it makes some tiny blips when it grows. I hate to be nitpicky but selling basic auditory feedback as a feature is just silly and borderline pretentious.			"

												Beneath the artsy veneer is a well-designed and complex emergent platformer.  The mechanics are straightforward and quickly discovered, with minimal (though satisfying) variation as the game progresses.  And yet, the endgame demands a mastery of these mechanics which combines split-second precision with frantic fore-planning.Thematic elements draw a lot of ire, and perhaps rightly so in the early game, where they may obscure the depth of the core platforming mechanics.  As the game progresses, these elements grow into a pleasant ambience which complements rather than obscures.The ending is one of the most fantastic I've ever encountered, where mechanics and thematic elements come together unexpectedly to produce a truly unique experience, a disruption of the sense of attachment and satisfaction accumulated over the course of ""mastering"" the game.(At slight risk of spoilers, the reward of Starseed Pilgrim is the journey of learning how it works.  If you prefer a cutscene and a pat on the back after pillaging a game for achievements, you'll hate it.  Go play something with a progress bar.)			"

												People say ""You need to experience this game for yourself."" They behave in an obtuse manner, as if there is some grand secret there, something that is wonderous that is just hidden away.They're lying. There isn't anything here.The game is garbage. You plant seeds. They grow. There are some mechanics related to them - the pink seeds can be harvested for more seeds. The bush sprouts heart flowers which can be collected when you go into the void. The orange block's growth is dependent on whether it has space to grow horizontally. The red one explodes outwards in blocks and will throw you into the void if you stand too close.Your goal is to get to the void star blocks - not the one on the bottom, but ones which are off isolated on far edges of the screen. These turn into keys when you step into them, but unless you have brought your blocks up adjacent to it, you'll have no way out.Once you grab your key, you can go back to the start and go back into the main world, where you can plant seeds and grow to reach other areas with bits of esoteric poetry hanging in the sky.There's a hidden block with three little stars in it which spawns a three keyhole exit. Bringing three keys to it will let you unlock some secret levels which can then be navigated to completion.There are a number of levels in the game, and they all LOOK the same, but are functionally slightly different. The void doesn't absorb you in some. You can't destroy blocks in others. The list goes on.The way they describe it, it seems like an unlocking, unfolding type game, but it isn't. It is just the very basic growing mechanics which the game is obtuse about. That's the limit of the discoveries in the game.It is boring. And it is a waste of time.			"

												In my opinion, excessive RNG battles does not equate to welcome difficulty.  In this game, you are given a random sequence of seeds that will grow in a completely random way.  Yes, there are ways you can abet the enemy of randomness by planting them strategically, but unlike something like Tetris, where the player's strategy and direct control ultimately allows them to conquer the RNG, this game turns up the randomness times 10, and when the RNG beats you, it beats you HARD by throwing a wrench in your plans that you can't do anything about.  Imagine if Tetris occasionally gave you an awkward shape that has 20 squares in it.The discourse around this game will scoff at you and tell you that you just aren't artsy/smart enough, and you should go back to playing your easy games like CoD and AC, you non-progressive little pleb.  I think this is just an unfortunate legacy from older players whose nascent years were the 80s and 90s, when publishers had to convince us that excessive trial-and-error punishment and RNG-derived difficulty were good things.  If you are fine with (or enjoy) such game design, then you will actually find a really neat puzzle game underneath these things that I hate.I definitely would have given this a thumbs up if it weren't for how punishing the RNG is, because the concept of the puzzle itself is fun, discovering the mechanics was fun, and the aesthetics were cool.  It definitely isn't worth 6 dollars in my eyes (good thing I got it in a bundle), but I could universally recommend it more if it were around a dollar.			"

												This is a devious little puzzle game.  You are trapped and must find your way home.  But to do so, you must plant and harvest seeds to grow different types of paths.  And if that isn't tricky enough, you must also collect keys to open doors when the world inverts, shifting from light and color to dark and filled with stars.The clues to what you need to do are subtle.  So subtle that some people might not get them at first.  They appear as poems written on the walls of the level.  But even without the poems, the longer you play the more you figure out.There are two types of seeds that are very important.  Pink seeds grow pink paths and when you harvest the pink blocks, you gain more seeds to grow more paths.  However, the pink seeds grow very slowly.  Green grass seeds sprout areas that have hearts in them.  When the world inverts those hearts will turn into stars, which you can harvest to use for seeds back in the main world.  Each type of seed creates a different type of path with different properties.Getting to the first two levels is easy.  The third level requires collecting three keys and going through a door locked by three keys - which aren't all that easy to find.The music is interesting, as each seed grows with a different tune, making for changing sounds throughout the game.If you like devious spacial-awareness puzzles, I recommend spending time to try to figure this one out.

												Starseed Pilgrim is a very unique game. Most of the fun comes from experimenting with the different colored blocks and figuring out what everything in the game world means. Nothing is explained when you first start, but the game doesn't penalize you at all and lets you explore the mechanics as you teach yourself how to play and develop your own strategies for succeeding. In the simplest explanation, you place differently colored blocks to try to get more differently colored blocks and grow your tower while escaping the spreading darkness. Each colored block behaves differently, so the engagement comes from figuring out how to optimize your block placement to get as far as you can.I don't think Starseed Pilgrim will keep you coming back for too long, but it's the kind of unique game you should try for a little while to see what works and what doesn't. I would recommend if you're interested in abstract indie titles or if you're a game designer looking for more unique study material.			"

												I just finished the game. All in all, an incredibly satisfying experience.The game is famous for being secretive, for requiring the player to figure out the rules of the game as he/she goes along. I understand that this turns a lot of people off, but the player who perseveres will find that the game is never needlessly opaque about how to proceed. A player with a curious mind and an observant eye will have little difficulty figuring out how to reach the end.However, actually getting to the end is a difficult task requiring platforming agility, resourcefulness and an intimate knowledge of the game's mechanics: especially the growth patterns of the seeds (which careful observation will reveal contain much less randomness than what it might look like at first glance).

												UPDATE: In time I see what a strong impression Starseed Pilgrim has left on me, recalling it now and again. Mechanically it's brilliant. I originally gave this game a negative review, but I've since come to reevaluate what the notion of a worthy game playing experience is. My initial reaction, after 6 hours played, was that I had wasted most of those hours on repetition, with no further revelations after those of the initial couple hours playtime. New players should take up Starseed Pilgrim without the expectation of the great puzzle leading anywhere special. Instead, solve the puzzle, play with the mechanics for a couple of hours, explore and enjoy the lonely ambience. Then put the game aside. It doesn't have to be any more than that, not at this price. Enjoy the experience.----Exploration, discovery, mystery, wonder, suprise. Just some of the brand of adjectives that seemingly every review of this game coos. And true enough, the game does have that. For the first couple of hours I was glued to the screen while I solved the metapuzzle that is Starseed Pilgrim. The puzzle is to understand the game's mechanics, and wonderful and clever mechanics they are.  The problem: the game does nothing afterwards. In the solving of the mechanics, you've already seen all of what the game has to offer. Those nouns above comprise about 10% of your playtime, The rest: repetition. With its involving atmosphere and great use of sound, as well as said mechanics, I was expecting Starseed Pilgrim to evolve into a masterpiece. What a shame.			"

SSP is a game that you can immerse yourself in for hours, if you are the type of person who always wants to know what is next, what is coming. The boundaries of the game change as you play it, in a way that few other games allow. You discover the game in playing it, and I would recommend doing so before people start talking about it, because as a game about discovery spoilers kinda suck.Big name developers are saying that this is a game which could change the perception of what a game is, and that's mighty praise. Others are calling it game of the year (obviously not in a triple-A sort of way). If you go to the dev's site, you can get SSP in a bundle of 4 of the games for $10, and you will get a steam code, and I'd say this is even more worth it; it's a pretty wide array of games and game styles.

												I don't see what the big deal is, frankly. Sure, abstract puzzle game is abstract, but I got bored shortly after figuring out what all the various cubes do, some of which are frustratingly detrimental to your attempts to outrun the blackness that consumes everything. I tried building outwards and upwards, but the game doesn't incentivize... anything, really. Just monotonous, RNG-based attempts to try to farm cubes back up to try to build far out for... some reason, until the blackness eats the cube you're standing on and you have to start over.It doesn't really evoke the wonders of exploration in the way, say, Antichamber does, which is also artsy, but continuously confronting you with new and novel things and making you wonder what's around the next corner. This game appears to be one vast expanse of jack squat. It feels to me like a test model for a game's systems, but then they forgot to put the actual game in.			"

												I finally know what the hell I'm doing in this. You plant seeds and they come out as blocks. You use the blocks to get to a star. When you go in the star, it's a key, you then travel through the blocks back to the start on the way collecting hearts. But the hearts are seeds. Still with me? The star that turned into a key is needed to exit the level and to get back to the hub world. In the hub world you use your left over seeds and hearts that turned out to be seeds to plant more blocks. You use the blocks to get to the next level. Repeat above steps.You will fail a lot.It's weird and cool.			"

It's neat, that for sure can be said, but I don't think there's anything more special about figuring this game out as compared to any other game. It's just that all other games are tutorialized out the♥♥♥♥♥ This game demonstrates that a minimal tutorial is good enough and that figuring out the mechanics of a game are fun enough. Which is pretty fair really.Think about playing half life. The game tells you ""this is how you shoot."" Everything else is basically just you finding new guns and using them on things and finding out what you like and how to handle things.			"

												This is one of those games you have to be in the right state for, you really have to be ready to think outside of your comfort zone.A bit similar to when you first learn to play Dwarf Fortress, or explore the world of Journey or when you start to think with portals, the fun in this is mostly just figuring out WHAT your supposed to do, rather than how you do it. I don't really get that this game is 'art' in the traditional sense, but I will say if you're interested in a few hours of exploration and a few new ideas on how game mechanics can influence the 'feel' of a game, I would almost certainly recommend.

												Starseed Pilgrim is a tough game to review.On one hand, it's handling and execution is absolutely superb. The art is fantastic, the mechanics sound, and the sound design flawless. The game is without a doubt a wonderful experience.But on the other, it's not an experience for everyone. With very little introduction, the game can be jarring. The game's centered around a planting mechanic, where you gather individual seeds from heartblocks, and plant them to make larger formations. There are two worlds: home, where you can grow plants at your leisure, and the other worlds, where you collect more seeds and escape darkness while attempting to create a safe path home. I don't wish to give anything more away, but the game never goes beyond this. Like the game Proteus, there is no actual end goal, outside of exploration, but given your ability to fail and back yourself in a corner, the game can lose its charm quickly if you're not the patient or contemplative type.This being said, the game never ceased to intrigue and surprise me. I've enjoyed my time with it, and while it might be a while til I play it again, I have every intention to come back and continue exploring. This journey may not be for everyone, but it is a journey well worth taking.			"

												Starseed Pilgrim is a minimalistic but beautiful, secretive puzzle. It challenges the player to keep searching the allegedly endless space for answers.The gameplay is intuitive but is layed out implicitly. Learning by doing - experiencing how the environment reacts to actions is a steady part of the progression and the core of this game. And with every seed you, the pilgrim, plant, you close on to a final, yet unknown goal.I recommend this very relaxing, engaging and interesting experience not as a game but as an experiment to dive into and learn from.Try it!

For me, it took quite a while to get into, and I originally just thought it was just another frustrating platformer. However, once I began to dig into the game, it became one of my favorites. I cannot stop thinking about it. In my opinion, Starseed Pilgrim is one of the most beautiful games ever made.			"

												This game is okay as part of a bundle. I would not buy it for six bucks. For some reason every review hypes this game to hell and back and I honestly cannot see why. I guess it is supposed to be some kind of puzzle game? It really isn't that good, and the reviewers who heaped praise upon this game like it was better than sex must be buddies with the guy who made this game or something. Don't get me wrong, it's not a TERRIBLE game once you figure out what to do (it's not that hard to figure it out) but at the same time it isn't this awesome wonderous experience either. I dunno maybe I just don't get it? Once I figured out how to play and what was going on, I completely lost interest. (it is too random to be fair and it basically comes down to chance mostly.) I can't say I recommend this game for more than a dollar though. It just isn't that worth it. It looks and feels like the game was made in about a week. I can't endorse paying more than a dollar for that little amount of effort put into making a game.			"

												Starseed Pilgrim is really weird.  I still have no ide what it's about and I've been playing it for a long time, and now I own it on Steam, so yeah, even more time spent playing it.  Essentially you play as this astronaut looking guy as he plant seeds that make structures that open up new worlds where you continue to do those same actions.  It is very sparse, not very much sound, and bizarrely haunting.  It's one of those games where you start playing and you just have to let things happen, try new things and discover for yourself.  In some respects it is extremely frustrating, in others it's highly rewarding.  That may sound vague, but the game itself is rather vague and confusing.  I don't know if it's worth 5.99, (if you're interested in it, pick it up during a Steam Sale,) but I enjoy it a lot, and can lose myself in Starseed Pilgrim for hours at a time.			"

You can pick up on the patterns of what each seed type does, but until you do the thing you're supposed to do, you don't know what that thing is. You could mess around in this for hours and not figure it out, or happen to do the right thing in 5 minutes and move on with your life.

												Starseed Pilgrim is a search for understanding in an empty world. if I were you I would give it 60 minutes of just you and the game before passing any kind of judgment. the epiphany where you realize how the painfully simple mechanics - worlds, hearts, keys, and seeds - really interact is something I haven't felt in a game in a really long time. infinity seems to stretch on in all directions, but one colour, one ghost, one stanza at a time, as pilgrim you will find things worth reaching. death follows at a constant, casual pace, gobbling through block after block of your maturing seeds. doesn't care about how good you are at it - in fact much like it's protagonist, it is just a game in search of understanding from you, the player.

												This is a logic game about inducing the rules and figuring out the world.  It's about discovery.This is a game that makes you earn your success because this is a game that forces the player to learn.  It asks something of the player, and it doesn't bait him with pretty graphics to keep him entertained.  It will spit out those who come in without any interest in figuring it out.For those who complain about lack of tutorial, this game is about writing the tutorial in your head.  A tutorial would defeat half of the purpose of the game.This is one of the very rare games that asks the player to first find the problem that he then has to solve.  There are very few of these games that simply drop the player in a box and respect his intelligence enough to allow him to teach himself the rules.It's all about discovery through creative thinking and a lot of trial and error.I'm 15 hours in to this game and the revelations haven't stopped coming.  There are seemingly unachievable goals -- tasks that are nearly equal in difficulty to Spelunkys challenges.  And meanwhile, there are deepening mysteries that the game doesn't confront me with but allows to sneak in to my mind.I can't get enough.  The perfect discovery game.Many people will be put off.  This game is hard.  It uses something very rarely seen in games of any kind, and that's inductive reasoning.Deduction is a common mechanic, but successfully pulling off induction is a very rare and special thing.			"

												Starseed Pilgrim is about discovery, to an extent which I have never seen before.  It is a masterpiece.The game does not tell you what its mechanics are, what your goal is, or what the narrative is - at least, not directly.  Instead, it sets you free to discover whatever you can.  Fortunately, you cannot lose, so every step, every success, and every failure, lets you learn something new that will bring you closer to answering the questions you have.  If the idea of iteratively poking at an arcane puzzle appeals to you, you will likely love this game.However, if you consider yourself impatient, it may not be for you.  Starseed Pilgrim requires patience, as its discoveries take time to unravel bit by bit.  If you don't like failing, that also might mean it's not for you.  While the game isn't brutally difficult, you will definitely ""fail"" many times.  Failing is an important part of its learning, as is being able to pick yourself up and try again.There's not much more I can say about the game, as going deeper into the mechanics would spoil some of the discovery - the very crux of the experience!  If you've read this and aren't put off, I heartily recommend that you give Starseed Pilgrim a try.  You may fall in love with it as I have.  But even if you don't, I can guarantee that it will be unlike anything you've ever played before; that in itself might be worth the price of admission. :)			"

He will not like this game, as it just gives you the controls and then drops you into the wilderness. But frankly, if you are the type of person who buys games for a novel experience, simply to try something you have never seen before, you are going to find something cool here, that gives you a full 2D world to colour and explore, and where learning how to play through experimentation is a lot of the fun.That guy was a wiener anyway.

												I've played enough of this game to have figured out the core mechanics, and therefore (for this game at least) its core concept. Let's start with that this game doesn't explain itself, except by telling you the controls. The rest is up to you, as the player, to figure out for yourself. If you don't like burrowing into a game, experimenting in trial-and-error, than do not get this game. You'll probably be left bewildred, confused or frustrated.If on the other hand, you don't mind this at all (or don't mind grabbing to 'cheat' by looking up the core mechanics in a guide or something), than figuring out the game's mechanics is going the be the primary pleasure for the first hours of so. You'll learn about planting seeds, the growing black squares in the screen shots and about the characteristics of each individual 'plant' (the collored blocks). You'll have to be observant. But once you have figured out all the characteristics, you've gotten the first achievement for this game.The second part of this game, is using that knowledge to further explore the world. I did this a bit, and i got bored with it. I didn't have the feeling that there was an actual point to this ""Starseed Pilgrim Part 2"". I just couldn't find a proper goal. Nor am I able to find on the internet with some quick searches if there even is any. Maybe it's proceduraly generated to be of infinite size and therefore cannot be 'completed' or won? As such, I've lost my will to continue spending precious time on this game, as I've started to perceive it as a time sink.As such, I cannot automatically endorse this game, nor immediately recommend it. If you are a very curious person, and like the figure out game mechanics, than you can at least play the game for ""Part 1"" and feel good about yourself once you did. And maybe you are curious to find out if the game is more than, that it appeared to be to me, a game-concept... euhmm.... game?			"

A love it or hate it game.I spent about half an hour in Starseed Pilgrim learning the basics with minimal information about the game going into it. I then spent another half hour reading about it on the web and watching a Let's Play of it. In particular I wanted to know if it was worth the time investment to patiently put the game mechanics I'd learned to use in order to discover the depths of Starseed Pilgrim's world. My conclusion: No, it's not.Obscurity in a game can be a good thing. However, it's bad when a game is so heavily shrouded in mystery that the player has no idea what to expect, or even if anything can be expected at all. Without being given some reason to care, I just couldn't find enough interest to push on into this strange world.			"

When I loaded it and moved around, I instantly closed it and reopened it again becuase I thought something was wrong and that someones publisher, affiliated graphics card company and third party Steam wannabe where going to throw lawyers at everyone within suing distance for not getting their due but this hasn't happened as far as I know.

												I'm so happy I got this game on a bundle. If I paid anything more than 1 USD I'd be feeling a crushing buyers remorse right now.Well, In short you're a little explorer in a pixelated world.You can walk around and dig blocks that are below or in front of you. In the same way you can use seeds to make blocks grow in some determined patterns (orange seeds will always make some blocks quickly grow in a line, pink seeds will always make blocks slowly grow upwards and so on). You can use those blocks to reach new places in the big white void and possibly collect some keys and seeds along the way.Everytime you die you lose all your progress in the exploration world, but you get some seeds to plant in your own ""home"".And that's it.There's nothing more to it.Most people will grow tired of it in 1 or 2 hours (that's how long you waste until you realise there's nothing else to do in the whole game).Definitely not worth the full price.Actually I wouldn't buy it even if it were on sale.

Cryptic notes scrawled on the back of fast food wrappers is your only clue. You awaken to find yourself in a flash mob where everyone's dressed as zombies. It's embarrasing. You awaken to find yourself at a high school wrestling event. Thankfully that one passes fast. You awaken to find yourself strung out on caffeine and sugar, it's 4AM.. OR IS IT???The only joy to be found in this game is that once you finally learn the rules and see the grand puzzle spread out ahead, you quickly realize what a chore it will be to actually see brought to a conclusion. Farming seeds so you can inch a little farther into the void. Hopefully in the right direction. Boring. At that point you've invested only maybe an hour or two of your life, and can uninstall it with minimal regrets.Learning the mechanics was fun, I will admit that. But applying them was not.			"

												I think this is one of those game you like or you don't. What answers I found during my very short time were enough to suggest that they would not provide a sufficient reward for my efforts. Worth a shot I think if the description peaks your interest but I can't recommend it personally.			"

												I live and breathe ""too deep for you"" games. I gave this game a chance. I put on my diving gear. Somehow, it's *still* too deep for me (in the sarcastic way).I appreciate the short pieces of poetry (unlike some other negative reviewers), but the cool and mysterious opening doesn't seem to ever be capitalized upon. It takes far too long (30 minutes at least) to make any progress in the game, and I don't think my experience was benefited at all by the game not teaching me how to play. Compare this to a game like Super Metroid, which is vague in service of the story and still finds a way to explain gameplay in non-traditional ways.To be fair, I didn't finish it. I unlocked two additional styles of play, which despite being the easiest to unlock, were some of the most boring unlockables (compared to a list of unlockables that I saw). I'd put *something* interesting up front to keep the player interested. As it is, it's a pretty boring game that doesn't explain itself. Maybe this is because if they did explain it to the player, the player would immediately notice its simplicity.			"

												People who play this game and expect the most amazing game ever don't understand puzzle games. Tetris didn't had a great plot twist too if I remember correctly. Think of Starseed Pilgrim as a new genre of puzzle video game, it's not made for everyone since you need to use your noggin a lot to be able to solve this puzzle.My main nitpick with this game is how hard it is to collect 3 keys and get to the 3 keys door (compared to simply go back to the single key door) and the difficulty curve is just mind blowing when you actually get there... no explination... good luck solving this one kid.I recomend watching other players videos after playing this game for a little while. No need to keep repeating the same mistakes over and over once you've made it to the first 3 key door.			"

												I do think the game is good. The core mechanics are great and if you put some the time in learning the game it's probably great fun for a good 7 hours or so. It's just that it clearly isn't finished. It looks more like a early acces than a actual game. You could probably make this in a month or so, There is no options menu, there are no rebindable keys, there are no resolution options and the game looks and feels very empty. As it is now i don't think you should buy it just for the fact that the delevoper clearly didn't put enough effort in it to make it a 6 euro game. But if you still consider buying it here are some pros and cons.Buy if you:+If Like finding out the game for self+If you have the patience to learn a game that doens't teach you anything itself.+If you don't care for a option menu and rebindable keys+If like puzzle games +If you think games like Proteus are artDon't buy if you:-Get frustrated easely -Don't like the fact that the developer didn't put enough time in th game-Think that games like Proteus and such are pretentious-If you don't like bland bare-bones ""new-age"" game graphicsConclusion:The mechanics itself are good .But the game needs work and it's clearly not ready for a full release.The game looks and feels empty but mabye that's what they were going for. In the end I really think I think it's your personnal opinion wether it's worth the money because even thought it's kind of bare-bones what has bin done has bin done well.

												I understand that the point of Starseed Pilgrim is to question a lot of stuff, but seriously, does anyone really know how this game works?So you spawn, and you run towards these heart blocks and mine them, and you get different blocks which all place differently. Pretty soon, you're left without any heart blocks and a bunch of different colored blocks. If you mine the colored blocks, they're gone, and you dont get to place any more. Examples being, a green block places just one block, a yellow/gold block places 5 or 6 straight up, etc.)I think a tutorial on how to manage the blocks is in order. A voluntary tutorial, like if you're stuck for 30 seconds or something, a ""press ""G"" to start the tutorial"" box pops up and you have the choice whether or not to click ""G"".Just avoid it unless its less than 50 cents. At least you can fall asleep to the soundtrack.			"

												A flawed puzzler.Starseed pilgrim is 2D platforming game about manipulating seeds. The aim of the game is to plant seeds (which each grow into different structures) in order to reach the exit. The music is quite nice. The controls are decent. The plot revolves around you trying to defeat the darkness (which is trying to envelope the world).The main problem I have with this game is the lack of tutorials. Immediately when your given the seeds to plant, your not told what each one of them does. You have to instead use trial and error to learn how to use each seed. Another problem is that the exit in each level is randomised, so you won't know exactly where to go most of the time. This is further hindered by the fact that the seeds you get are also randomised, so you have to waste time figuring how to use your seeds and where the exit is which can be frustrating. Finally, there isn't enough insentive to keep playing, with no reward or sense of achievement, which means the game gets boring fast.If you really, really like puzzle games with no real sense of achievement and diffcult to grasp then maybe get this game, else spend your money elsewhere.

												It's one odd game. You are thrown into the game without any guidance and you have to discover the game. I discovered a bit, I understood how the blocks acted, I got my first key, but then I was greeted by the same level? It confused me a bit, but then I thought that maybe I have to get to another key or something like that. Well, I didn't succeed, but it got boring for me although I'm more than sure that this game goes on and on and it has an end. The problem is that it is just a bit too basic.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												Starseed Pilgrim really is a game you need to expierience for yourself, but that doesn't make for a good review so I'll go into a bit more detail. It's the kind of game that gives you virtually no direction, it just throws you in and expects you to experiment. That kind of game isn't for everyone, but if it sounds like your cup of tea, you'll probably enjoy it. The initial confusion does a wonderful job of promoting the themes of exploration and discovery that are at the core of the game. The gameplay itself is very basic: plant blocks that do different things to escape the growing darkness. As you slowly grow your garden of blocks and explore the world, the game reveals that there's more than just your little slice of sky. As for what is out there... well, you'll have to find out for yourself.			"

												(Originally posted March 17 2014)Today I played through my favorite game from last year, Starseed Pilgram. I've been meaning to replay this for a while, but when the game's developer, Droqen, was a guest on one of my favorite gaming podcasts the other day (Video Games Hot Dog), I knew that now was the time…What makes this game so great? Primarily, it's the lack of tutorial, or any instruction beyond the very basic controls. That's it—no explanation of your objective (or if there even IS an objective), or how to achieve it. But if you can resist the temptation to look up an explanation on the web, the experience of figuring out the game's systems for yourself is irreplaceable, and it is forever YOURS.That being said, this is still a fun and challenging game to replay, even without that initial experience of discovery. The music is procedural and relaxing, and the game's mechanics change enough as you play so that you are required to keep changing your strategy. This will probably not be the last time I play this game, which is quite rare.			"

												This game uses being mysterious as an excuse for a flimsy story and to withold explanation. The lack of explanation combined with a gameplay that is in large part driven by random numbers and a time limit all serves to pad out a game that without it would be over in roughly 30-45 minutes.This game would probably be great for people who like roguelikes where you can fail regardless of skill and planning.But to me it feels cheap and poorly made.

Starseed Pilgrim makes a hell of a first impression.This game feels like a work of someone who thought that the thing artistic, experimental games lack are harshness, repetition, grinding and lethal fall damage.It manages to be simultaneously tedious and punishing, pressuring and sluggish.It feels like an attempt to illustrate Do It Again Stupid[www.shamusyoung.com] design.It feels like an embodiment of a polar opposite of all nice little touches developers put into games, like straight tunnel after hard puzzle in VVVVVV, ammo restores accounting for bullets missing from magazine in Firefall and ability to finish normal mode and play NG+ on the same save slot in Defender's Quest.The contrast between the vibe I got from Steam page blurbs, trailer and how it actually plays feels like a trolling attempt.I admit, I have played it only for a short time - Steam says it was about 40 minutes. I know some games require time to get going - and I really tried to get into it. I tried to reach the first goal, after many failures reached it and the firstI like artistic games. I LOVE games about discovering their mechanics. I like roguelikes. This game was recommended to me by a person I'm a fan of, which should have coloured my outlook.Between playing it and writing this review, I even went on an hour-long walk.And still, the only feeling I have toward this game is burning hatred.A sentiment that almost feels mutual.

												If Home was the reason I hate indie games, Starseed Pilgrim is the reason I love them.This game challenged my preconceived notion that a game could either be really pretentious and artsy or deeply mechanically engaging--not both, and it hooked me immediately. Haunting atmosphere, challenging dynamic puzzles, and some really great subtle strategic planning all feature prominently here.The game is also a very interesting experiment in not giving the player much at all to go on. You're expected to be curious enough to try and figure out what any given thing does on its own. Because of that, once things do start clicking it's a very satisfying feeling, and every little revelation is a bit of a rush.This game is fantastic, and a steal at only $6, especially if you like any sort of puzzling or exploration-based games.

												Half-formed in ideas and at the same time feels unfinished even in the small amount of content that it is providing. The idea of figuring out how to accomplish tasks with no direction just using the tools of the game itself is actually cool but it really is lost in the random nature and poor implementation of this game. First off the game has no options for video, audio, or controls. I don't expect it to be scalable to large screens but an ability to map controls would've been nice but the fact that you can't mute the audio is very annoying for a puzzle title that is largely based on multiple retrials. I had to turn it down in the system settings to be able to listen to my own music/podcasts. That's one of the main reasons it feels like an unfinished game. Most flash games let you at least mute the volume. Anyway, let's delve into the game itself.(this gives away the tricks) You are some kind of spaceman-person in this game who gets seeds when you enter a level outside of the hub. The seeds do different things that always end up building blocks to extend the ground and reach a star block. Both a block at the beginning and the star block contaminate the other blocks, blackening them and that spreads, if a black block is touched you go to an opposite world where the everything but the blocks you walk on are solid and the star turns into a key that unlocks a ""door"" at the black block back at the beginning so you go through at the star block and exit back at the beginning.(this gives away more) The bright green seed makes bright green blocks that have hearts in them, when you go back to the minus world after getting the key the hearts are collectible and turn into seeds when you go back to the hub. You plant the seeds at the hub and go up to find spaceman-holograms that have cryptic sayings above them and more levels.That's all I've found that this is. Which is not enough of a game to me and progression is largely based on the random nature of the seeds you're given and the way the seeds grow the ground blocks, both of these things can make an entire entry into a level pointless because you might get a bunch of good seeds at the beginning and then at the end you only get the dark green seeds that in later levels mean you lose because you can't dig them up in later levels to allow yourself to progress.Also, you can complete a level and not get to the exit or collect a heart in time and then it just quits out the level and you lose because it's always good to make you randomly lose for no forseeable reason and again wasted time. It's also possible to enter at the star and completely miss contact with the key because it doesn't take up a whole block and then the entire time spent is wasted because the hitbox of the key is small for some unknown reason.If it was easier I wouldn't have liked the game better but I wouldn't have disliked it enough to write this review in the negative. It was a small cheap game that became more unlikable the more I played because there was nothing there but more of the same except with even more limited options to arbitrarily make it harder instead of having variable gameplay.I don't like feeling like my time is wasted. When the only thing I did wrong was miss the hitbox of a key when dropping into the minus world and I lose 5 minutes of my time for no real reason other than the key's hitbox is small or I got a bad order of seeds then it's not a game I would recommend to anyone and would, in this case, actively discourage it for that feeling of loss that comes coupling puzzles with random chance.

												I felt compelled to write a review mainly because I didn't like or hate the game first starting out, and I really wish there was an option to make a review ""Conditional"", because your liking or hating of this game will depend greatly on your appreciation of the genre and aesthetic, along with the price attached.To start, if you don't like puzzle platformers or obscure indie games, don't even bother with this. Avoiding any descriptions that'll sound like an art gamer's musings, the narrative of the game bounces between vague and understated. The mechanics are simple, though the overall objective is one that will require guesswork to figure out, and even when you've passed the first level, it's still unclear exactly what you're building towards. Success is rewarding, and failure seems often. The feeling of being cheated by game mechanics can sometimes happen early on, but once you start understanding how different seeds work and what things get you ""killed"", this feeling diminishes. The uniqueness of the game is intriguing enough that I've returned to it a few times since owning it, picking away at the game's shell in short bursts. It's an easy game to start, toy around with, and leave alone for a while.This leads me to my final point, and a reason why I lean towards not recommending buying Starseed Pilgrim. Put simply, the price. Though six dollars is a modest amount compared to most indie games on Steam, this price just doesn't feel justified to me. I aquired the game from a recent Humble Bundle, where I received numerous other games for about the same price as this game by itself. Knowing that there are other games of equal or lesser price that have a more apparent value-yield going in, I can't recommend this as a safe buy. As said before, the game's narrative is obscure and doesn't offer direction, much less a sense of depth that would make you compelled to dig deeper for greater lengths of time. It's a unique and clever way to spend a few minutes casually teasing your brain with ways to accomplish the game's simple objective, but that's an experience that's worth less than six dollars. If you can pick the game up for half that, I'd say it's definitely worth the gamble, but only if you're one to enjoy puzzle platformers.			"

												In concept, I really wanted to like this game. It's a cool idea and it has a lot of potential to be a really neat game that would be super fun to play, but it has a few glaring problems that mean I just can't recommend it at all.First and most visibly, there is no manual, or instructions, and people seem to think it's cute that you have to figure this game out yourself. That'd be fine if it were less complicated, but it's actually a pretty intricate game with complex mechanics to it that are VERY frustrating not to know at first. I put this game down for a long time, having given up on it or just assuming it was broken, then only recently found some kind soul had written up a very good description of the game's mechanics. I ended up still disliking it, for the reasons below, but I felt I needed to mention up front that if people can't figure out how to play your game, THAT IS A PROBLEM WITH YOUR GAME. It just is. The cutesy mystery crap around how to play this game is just obnoxious. If all your game has to offer is the mystery of how to play it, that's pretty pathetic.Moving on. The lack of gamepad support makes this game awkward to play, to say the least. There are no settings, so you can't adjust the key bindings, so basically unless you happen to love the key bindings it comes with (arrow keys with ""up"" as jump), you're just screwed. Gamepad support isn't hard to implement these days, and this game feels like an incomplete project without it.Speaking of the lack of settings, there is only one supported resolution in this game: too damn low if you have anything approaching a modern computer. It's not as big of a deal as the other problems I had, but this is definitely an issue when the window is utterly lilliputian in size. So the playfield size is infinite, but your window into it is non-negotiably small, and there's no full-screen setting.I can't ever get back the minutes I've wasted trying to play this game. Don't waste yours too.			"

No progression is ever made.  Nothing is ever explained.I'm all for games with no goal, like Sims and SimCity and so on.  I'm also for the occasionally cryptic game where you try to figure stuff out, like Terreria, or Gone Home.But, two problems with this game: Play is seemingly random, and the colored boxes don't have different enough textures for the colorblind.OH AND NOTHING IS EXPLAINED. EVER.ALL ON A TINY, TINY PLAYFIELD.Looking through the forums, there are two types of players: Those that ""get it"" but won't shed any light on anything for fear of spoiling it for the rest fo us, and those that don't get it, are seeking help, and are denied any information.I can't recommend this game at all.  SOMETHING of some instruction, a goal, any smidgen of an idea of what the heck is going on would be helpful.  Alas, it's a very artistic journey through frustration and annoyance.  If you're going to base a game on frustration and annoyance, at least make it fun and visually interesting, like Octodad.			"

												Well this game suuuucks.Okay, so its ""artsy"", which in this case means ""doesn't explain squat"", so you'll really need to look online just to even figure out what you have to do. Once you get past that, it's all about putting down RNG blocks to make a path to things you can't see yet. The puzzle aspect is in figuring out what each block does, which takes about 5 minutes. It has levels, and they are all the same. So... yeah. Rubbish.			"

												Sorry, not going to waste my time on a game like this.  Just not for me.  Doesn't tell you anything about what the heck you are supposed to do.  Look I get it, games like Call of Duty hold your hand through the whole game, but I think the flip side can also be true.  Some games can be overly obtuse and secretive, not helping you at all.  For me, I think there should be a middle ground.  So if Call of Duty is on the extreme hand holding side of games, this game is on the other extreme.			"

												I can't give this a recommendation. Spent the better part of like 2 hours playing this game and it felt like grinding. Supposed to be a puzzle platformer but offers no difficulty or reward. Everything is pretty much self interpreted and the goal seems almost worthless. Sounds kind of mean saying such things about a game I never and will probably never (future tense) beat but this game requires the skill just slightly above watching paint dry.			"

												The sounds and visuals are nice, but that doesn't make up for the rest of the design. The game doesn't show clear goals & doesn't try to teach the player aside from cryptic hints. Although some game mechanics are taught, the goals & how to achieve them are not. I don't even know why I should be playing or care about playing.			"

												Starseed Pilgrim requires patience. First, the player must discover the control scheme and, soon after, interpret the arcane interface. Second, in the existential vein of game design, the player must determine their purpose and chart the course of their journey. If that journey involves discovering the story and reaching the end of the game, then the next step is to develop the skills needed to outrun the encroaching darkness and satisfy the requirements of the 'challenge levels' in the game. If by this late point in the game you understand the control scheme, GUI, have mastered control of your seeds and have discovered that there is, indeed, a story and challenge like levels, then take a moment to step back and realize that this is a game not about gardening, but colonialism.You are escaping from an encroaching darkness, but by upsetting the already existing balance of the new world, you bring that same terrible fate upon a place that would have been better off without your existence. Your constructs, your plants, may seem beautiful, but they are merely decorations, fleeting attempts at meaning and growth which simply provide a foothold for the darkness.With that alone, you should be able to predict the end of this game and the overall message Starseed Pilgrim conveys. What is the historical outcome of pilgrims, fleeing from persecution and slaughter?Pilgrims bring the same darkness with them and, regardless of their noble intentions, spread the same disease they tried to escape. In Starseed Pilgrim, if you can somehow initiate yourself into the esoteric knowledge base required to play and enjoy, then you will not be rewarded further. Knowledge, in this game, is its own reward, and once that has been gained, then the remaining game is very much the equivalent of the Baby-Saving minigame in Stanley Parable: a tedious grind that does indeed become more potent in meaning with time, but spending the required time and effort (and at the time of this review, $5.99) to reach that false 'nirvana' results in self-destruction. Recommended to those who would appreciate Starseed Pilgrim as a piece of fascinating artwork, the kind of person who wants games to travel the route of James Joyce into oft-inaccessible academia. Definitely not recommended to those looking for a fun romp in an indie game: go play Terraria or Minecraft instead.			"

												This game got me back into gaming for it's minimalism game design. I can't but help but compare it to Tetris. In both you're constantly buidling yourself out of puzzle death. This is one of those games you'll start to dream about because it's mesmirizing, challenging, and creative. I loved this game. While the later stages are very strange and the story is simply vague, the game mechanics are brilliant. This is not an easy game. I died a ton of times yet I came back for more. The one downside is that you can sort of master this game. In the later stages I was frankly a little bit bored because I managed to sort out the best way of building without a sweat. However, learning how to master this game WITHOUT any sort of hand-holding or tutorial is the best way to play this game. I really hope they make a sequel, especially with online multiplayer.			"

												This game does have a goal, and it does have an ending. Unlocking all of the levels is not the ending, there is much more to it. If you have not gotten to the third phase, you haven't even scratched the surface of what this game is.This is a platformer where you grow platforms by planting seeds. Each seed grows in a unique, slightly random way. Each level has the same basic objective with slightly different rules. Figuring out those rules and the objective requires some logical thinking and some trial and error. Actually accomplishing the objective requires strategy, utilizing your seeds in the most effective way possible, and planning far ahead to how your actions during the first phase will affect your options in the second and third phases.

												For people who are interested in game design, Starseed Pilgrim is a very interesting game to study. The player is dropped into the game world with little, if any, instructions or hints. They must experiment with the mechanics to discover their behaviour and relationships.While players looking for a fun, familiar puzzle game won't find it here, players willing to dig deeper and figure out how the game works for themselves will be rewarded. Once past the initial confusion, the game's minimalist approach is refreshing. Each new discovery or ""aha"" moment is totally worth it, because you will have earned it by yourself.			"
