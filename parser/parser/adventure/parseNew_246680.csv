												Secrets of Rætikon is as gorgeous and ethereal as it is tedious and poorly designed.It’s a game about exploration and discovery, hampered by convoluted level designs and the inexcusable absence of any sort of map. It’s a game of peaceful puzzle solving and nonlinear exploration disrupted by annoyingly persistent enemies, and no means of attack to ward them off. More than anything though it’s a game of false allegations of an overarching mystery, that in the end is nothing more than a horrendously incomprehensible and random moment, preceded by an unnecessarily grotesque event that quite frankly made me sick.At it’s core, Rætikon is constructed like a large fetch quest collectathon, requiring you to explore levels in order to collect scattered shards which can then be used to power up ancient machinery. These machines exist both in opening new pathways for you, and in presenting you with larger shards which must then be brought back to a sort of hub and deposited into the sockets of yet another large machine.Though it had the potential to be an enjoyably open experience, allowing you to freely traverse the world as you hunt for these shards and machines, Rætikon idiotically forces you to spend an aggravating amount of time back tracking through levels in order to return to the hub. This could have been avoided with a better connected world, but with only two paths into the hub, you’re required to haul your luggage through numerous screens over and over again. This is made even more frustrating do to the inevitable games of keep away you get into with other animals, which can sometimes make the simple act of getting from one side of the screen to the other almost painful in how aggressive the other creatures are.This all adds up to make Secrets of Rætikon an absolute chore to get through. It’s a gorgeous game, with some incredible origami-like artwork, a fantastically ambient soundtrack and great sense of atmosphere, but it’s all brought down by some horrible design decisions that sour the entire experience. When you finally get to the end it only makes matters worse, with a disturbing and baffling turn of events that sells home the point that the designers seemed to have little idea where they were going with their game, nor a clue how to get there.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												I just played 2006 seconds of SECRETS of RÆTIKON and felt the urge to share this review.I just bought the game mainly because I like the aestethics and because the devs are from the town I live, but other than that I had no expectations, especially since the game is still early access. I also haven´t read previews so far, so I was relativley unbiased.This first hour was a real joy! The controls are very intuitive and after a few minutes you get what the game is about without much explaination. But very soon I came in contact with the first few highlights in form of the curious animal life. I don´t want to spoil too much but there was this particular situation where I, a bird, cleared the entrance of a cave in a wood while being chased by some wildcat and after being rewarded with an artifact that sat on top of a deers antlers, I had to chase the deer while still being harrassed by the cat. It resulted in tricking the cat away for a moment so I could grab onto the deers♥♥♥♥♥ pulling it to a dead end so I could wrestle away the artifact. Shortly after this I experienced one of the best situations in a 2D game I experienced so far, when I had to get away with another artifact but the trees just wouldn´t let me ( I don´t want to spoil it for anybody, but it is awesome)Long story short, I can already fully recommend the game, because only one hour into it, it was somehow already worth its money. I am very much looking forward to continue tomorrow and have a look at that editor some day. Go for it, it will make you feel good :DAnd yes, there is a stat for how many seconds you already played (besides the stats how many other animals I ACCIDENTALLY! killed) "

												Secrets Of Rætikon is a beautifully rendered game, it's all very colorful. It's hard to explain it gameplay wise. But you're a bird and you have to find artifacts that are scattered all over the world. You might say that it's a Metroidvania game but it's not. You won't gain any skills or abilities and all places are freely accessible. The goal is mainly to survive, while finding these artifacts. There are several types of 'enemies' and not all of them will attack you on the spot. Some of them will try to grab you or your artifact and others will just leave you alone because they're lower on the food chain. You can go faster by flapping your wings and you can even dive to increase your speed. The controls are unusual but work very good.There's no map system in the game so you have to find everything by scouting the areas carefully. This can be hard, but fortunately the game is only a few hours (3-4) long so the world isn't that big.I really enjoyed playing the game, but one thing that bothered me was the fact that you can't continue the game once you finish it. So make sure you do everything before dropping that last artifact, unless you want to play through it again, of course.There's always room for improvement and Secrets Of Rætikon is no different. But despite its shortcomings I had a great time playing in this magical and very stylish world.[Rating: 84/100]			"

 Story ReviewPlummeting down at sonic speeds towards the ground and saving myself from becoming a splattering heap of blood, my first moments of this new and strange world were quite horrifying. It  was strange that despite my near death experience I couldn’t help but feel that these lands felt promising in being a tranquil place to live the rest of my life. Unsure of what was to become of me…The world looked incredibly strange, full of triangle shaped forms, from the trees,caves and sculptures down to the animals themselves. Unsure of my surroundings I had to familiarize myself with what would be useful. Finding red triangles I noticed made me healthier while the blue triangles when gathered enough saved my life.  Funny how these items were of similar shape and resemblance to my environment. Forming together a sort of harmony. Further traversing the lands I noticed that inserting the triangles I found, into the towers would make them activate. I noticed how they would shine - like they were calling for me to pull the levers. What I found interesting the most was the golden triangles that seemed important though I was somewhat awestruck and confused of their purpose of being held within these contraptions. I realized later that I could insert these gold triangles into a machine that revealed a prison of animals. I was determined to free them from their cages once I have found the rest.Before I knew it I was altering the land by lifting rocks out of passages and solving puzzles to unlock paths. The place became more and more dynamic the more time I spent on interacting with the environment, shaping the terrain to a degree sort of speak though albeit a small degree.The journey seemed difficult but I learned some new tricks as I explored, though there were some issues in actually using these tricks…Calling out to find objects hidden within the world elluded me If i was carrying anything of significant importance. One time for example the black triangle I was carrying around was being indicated when I called out to objects, I didn’t notice this at first and was wondering why my senses seemed to freak out and rotate so much. Making me somewhat - dumbfounded at my own foolishness. I had to abandon the object in order to properly search around for the treasures of the world. Going around and around was pretty tiring, having to see the same environments several times again since the point of interest was in the middle of the forest. Especially when enemies got in the way and stole my triangles it was rather annoying having to fight them for it - I tried my best not to kill them though. I progressed slowly closer and closer to my goal of collecting all the gold triangles to activate whatever the giant machine did until there was only one left.Finding the last gold triangle - quite frankly has given me far more trouble than I bargained for. I looked around the world several times backtracking here and there, in order to find whatever I missed that could lead me to it. Constantly trying to avoid danger while looking for news ones I couldn’t help feel that what I was doing was a fruitless labor. The statues I rebuilt to their former glory might have helped me navigate through the forests - however being able to find that last piece was still a pipe dream. I was simply losing my mind at this point and picking fights with the local birds that have long annoyed me since the beginning, slaughtering them left and right to never see them again. Eventually what would happen is a land of lifelessness and void of any creatures, my madness for created by the lust of the last gold triangle got the better of me. Now barren in this world where I live I looked up at the sun and attempted to suicide, being thrown down by the strong winds I decided to take a dive into the water latched onto a rock and allow myself to suffocate - until my very being was taken from this world.ConclusionThe world looked pleasing, unique and interesting to explore. Outside of the eye candy though laid a series of bad game design choices concerning navigation. The restrictions put on you from really ascending to great heights - to the frustration of having to backtrack constantly back to the hub. There is a lot of potential this game had if it were to erase the backtracking by making the activation of the mechanisms trigger the cages instead of the triangles but the over-focus on this element lead to the game’s downfall of making it into a tedious chore.

												Secrets of Rætikon is one of the few games where you play as an 'realistic' animal in a 2d metroidvania like world. After the game started I was smoothly flying around and enjoying the relaxing atmosphere in a world with a nice Сubism art style.  The game explained simply is; find collectables to get other collectables to finish the game. Which sounds stupid but while you do this you will encounter many obstacles and enemies. Also there are other things to explore which can add to the story of  Rætikon. Sometimes you really have to think about your movement so you can get to that certain area. I liked that in this game I sometimes felt sad because I had to kill other animals or plants to get health. I have to say that I didn't enjoy  Rætikon to it's fullest because on my laptop I played some parts without sounds. Which really reduces the feeling of being in nature. I have to say I didn't really like the ending. But I think that may had something to do with the  studio having to rush that part. Because this game didn't and still doesn't get that much attention. What I respect the dev's for: They kept on going to finish the game, because they know that these kind of games are missing in this industry.  The only positive side of the game not being popular is that you really have to find everything out by yourself. Workshop community:Dead. No support at all.Short:A nice relaxing game where you explore around flying as a bird.			"

But after playing through it, All I really can say is...This Game Is Frikin' Awesome!  -A Single Player Campaign where you get to fly like a bird and explore the Amazing world.-Fun game play!-Great 2D Adventure, Fully interactive physical world.-Beautiful Art style.-Puzzles are intuitive and unique.-Solid Controls. It's a great game. 8.5/10			"

												This game has very satisfying flying and controls and the puzzles are intuitive, and unique. There is also something to be said about the emotions this game sparked in me, which range from laughing obnoxiously loud to feeling super depressed because I accidentally killed a little critter. I think it has somthing to do with the animals and the minimalistic approach to the graphics (which are absolutely beautiful). It really is a thinking mans game. It task you with collecting silver pieces for the ""machines"". It's simple yet enthralling. Simply getting past an opposing animal can be done in various ways. If you want to fight grab a spiked branch and hit him with it. Want to set up a secenario in which another poor creature gets caught up in a battle to the death so you can continue untouched? So many options and functions are in play. The games physics are so very real and fun. There is so much mystery about the story and the Runes and what is actually going on in the Alps. I am very ready to find out what that is. For an Alpha that I bought For 7 or so bucks I'd have to say I am in love with this game. I cannot wait to see what the Steam community has to bring to this game as well. The game also comes with all the developers tools to make this game. So if you feel the need to rework things or submit your own idea's you can. What an awesome and refreshing approach from an indiDev. Keep your eye on this game closely. Throw down the 10$ (or less if it's on sell) and thank me later.-Casey			"

												This game ranks as one of the biggest disappoints of my life and disturbed four people that represent three generations of gamers. Good job Broken Rules!  We all need therapy now! As you can see from the screenshots, Raetikon is visually stunning, with gorgeous graphical design and an engrossing world.  It plays like a simple Metroidvania type game that relies on puzzle elements.  Areas are gated off behind a ""collect the bits"" mechanic, but everything is so pretty, you don't even mind.  The creature designs are origami given life.  You play as a weird bird with shoes, that controls very much like the arcade game Joust, which works very well and seems fluid.  The game dumps you right into the action, leaving you to figure things out, which is refreshing with all the hand holding these days.  The story is pieced together by collecting runes to decipher ancient tablets, a gimmick that my kids and mother both enjoyed as they worked together to crack the code.  It's not a necessary thing to accomplish to beat the game, but a nice side diversion.  The music is also suitably haunting.  Sounds good so far, and it is.  We enjoyed the laid back pacing that I would liken to the exploration of Proteus or Journey.  Some have complained of the difficulty, but I had no issues, and only died once, in the bramble maze while being reckless.  And there's two major issues with this short little game.  BUG.  I have seen on forums where the developer promised to fix this over a year ago and guess what?  They didn't.  It's still there.  If you open the areas in an order that the developers did not intend, the game becomes impossible to complete the traditional way.  You get to a point where you are short three gold slivers to progress, and they simply do NOT exist if you mistakenly tackled the areas in the wrong order.  This happened to me and the only way past it is through ANOTHER BUG that allows you to access the end areas by an obscure method.  We wandered around for almost two hours backtracking, thinking that we were just missing a few slivers.  It was triple checked, so I hit the internet and found mention of this bug on a forum.  None of this was repaired as promised, so do NOT leave the area above the evil tree for last or you will have problems.  FINALLY... it's the ending.  It IS memorable, you can't take that away from it, but does it ever kill a bit of your soul and leave a bad taste in your mouth.  You go from heroic hope to stupid and evil.  SPOILERS!!!...........it seems through the whole adventure of Secrets of Raetikon that you are trying to save animals in cages.  Yet at the end, you find out that you kill them and use their blood/essence to power a primitive game of Pong.  After the credits, it dumps you into free roaming mode.  The real horror is here, for not only did you murder the caged animals, but EVERY SINGLE animal on the planet.  Everything is dead.  Everything.  So your stupid bird could play Pong.  It's depressing and senseless.  We had talked about how fun it would be to just go back and replay it but that's not happening now.  Your journey seems pointless, tainted and corrupted.  Raetikon leaves a black splotch on your heart and a dead feeling in your soul.  My kids were disturbed, and my mother was so messed up she watched several Let's Plays on youtube just to see other rections and if there's another ending.... the answer is NO.  No other endings.  You can't change it.  Therefore, I have a hard time recommending it, even though it's this lovely, wonderful game up until the end.  If you don't mind absurdly bad endings and would like a game that combines Castlevania:SOTN, Journey, Proteus and Joust together, then give this a shot.  Personally, I doubt we will ever play it again.  We discovered the Secrets of Raetikon afterall...The secret was... the ending sucks.			"

												This game came so very close to actually being good. As has been noted in many reviews, the repetitive nature of the game is definitely a flaw, although if you're good at finding the shortcuts, hauling back the keystones from the altars isn't too bad.What really breaks the game for me, though, is the enemies. Some of them aren't too bad, just occasionally pestering you, but the damned lynxes and buzzards are nightmares. They're absurdly aggressive, and do pretty substantial amounts of damage, and very much get in your way when you're trying to get around or solve puzzles. I got six keystones back to the central area before I just couldn't take it anymore. I just wasn't having fun.The sad thing is, this could easily be solved by just taking out the enemies. Honestly, you wouldn't even have to take them out completely. Just make an easy mode with no enemies (and perhaps reduced damage from thorns) so people can actually enjoy the game instead of tearing out their hair in frustration over the unrelenting onslaught from the enemies.Like I said, the game is almost good. If the repetitiveness doesn't bother you too much and you can deal with the incredibly obnoxious enemies, I'd honestly recommend the game very highly. It's got good visual and sound design, the gameplay is solid, and there's some good, fun exploration and puzzle solving to be had. I just can't stomach the downsides enough to keep playing.			"

												Secrets of Raetikon is a beautiful game: the environment is gorgeous, the music creates a beautiful atmosphere.  However, this game is only for those ""hardcore"" gamers.  If you don't like spending a lot of time solving a puzzle only to have your precious prize stolen, or having to contstanly worry about a health bar, because literally everything is trying to kill you, or if you don't like dying frequently, and if you don't have tons of time like an 80s kid to play - this game is not for you.if you like those things, great.

												For now, this is a first impression review. I will update this if I am able to finish the game or new and relevant info presents itself.First off, this game is beautiful. For what it is, I cant think of a more artisitic presentation. Really, really pleasing to look at.So, what is the game? hehehe...that is actually a good question. You are a bird, flying around, finding translations to the symbols that are seemingly used to present the story that defines the world. I have found ten so far I believe, so 16 to go (although I doubt I will need all 16 to translate the story). You are also unlocking aspects of the world, wich so far have been represented by releasing new animals into the environment. I have unlocked four of these so far, with another 6 or so to go. Each is a cage on a very large structure which you pick up pyramid pieces for and return to it to unlock said animal cages. The pyramid pieces are found by repairing other structures around the map, which you do by collecting and assembling the broken pieces of statues (so far) or by collecting other smaller pyramid pieces which you can, when you have collected enough, unlock the other buildings which then open up new map sections that hold the main pyramid pieces. While you are doing all this, other birds and as you progress, other predatory creatures such as the lynx that you have released back into the wild, will attack you and each other, steal the pyramid pieces, and generally mess with you. You can fight back, which takes the form of dive bombing them, picking them up and dropping them from heights, causing the environment to hurt them (such as causing rock slides), and so on. You also have to contend with the winds, thorns, and other natural obstacles. You can regain health by uprooting small trees, saplings, and also by killing other critters.anyway, so far, I have found all this to be quite interesting and yet marginally confusing all at once. You are pretty much left on your own to figure all this out, which is fine. The one real impediment however is a lack of an actual map so as to figure out where you are and how to get back to where you possibly might need to be. No map equals a lot of unnecessary flying around at times, trying to find your way back to the big building to unlock the next cage, and presumably later, even more wandering around tring to read all the statues that hold the runes you need to translate in order to actually read the storyline, lol. I really would have liked to have seen a map or mini map included with this game. That said, I am still enjoying the game and intend to continue on, but man....please ALWAYS put maps in games that require a lot of travel back and forth through a lot of different sections!!!Oh...btw...this is a 2D metroidvania style scroller (the gameplay isnt metroidvania however, lol).

												This game is, in a word, frustrating. This is a game that can't quite decide what it wants to be. On one hand, its an exploratory world with puzzles and secrets to uncover.  On the other hand, it's an RPG with fetch quests, trials, obstacles and things trying to kill you.   These two halves do not mesh as well as they should and the mechanics that would be forgivable in a pure exploration game do not hold up for a battle-less RPG.Boiled down to it's core, the game play is find the glowing bits, collect them all, feed them to a machine and then activate the machine which either gives you a different glowy bit to bring back the big machine in the middle, or helps you open a door to go through to continue the cycle.   This on it's own, isn't bad. Standard RPG/puzzle quest.  But the controls do not have the proper fine tune to allow the player to actually accomplish these goals easily.   After activating one machine by a door, it dropped down a battering ram that it took me a good 15 minutes to get to actually hit the door in a way that actually broke it down.  Another section involved a maze of thorns that you had to fly against the wind to navigate.  Flap wrong and you're thrown into the waiting thorns much like a ping pong ball and it's near impossible to recover without being thrown into another bed of thorns.    In another, after successfully activating a machine, I was presented with another challenge, having to get a glowing bit from a running stag.  Due to the limitations of the controls and the flaky flapping mechanic, I eventually just gave up as I was never able to get my character to do anything that got it even close to the runner. The visuals of the game are pretty impressive. Stylized, but not in a way that comes off as pretentious.  If it weren't for the aggressive birds, excessive thorns and fighting against the controls to try and get from place to place, it would be a very nice, laid back exploratory game, which the ambient sounds and lack of any narrative present it as.  But at it's heart, this game more comes off as a frustrating, non linear puzzle platformer who's mechanics just can't hold up to what the player needs to do.  Perhaps with a game pad or under windows, it would work better, but I have neither of those things to test it with, and the graphics and atmosphere alone are not enough to make up for the high level of frustration this brings.

												The game has great graphics and atmosphere, but there are awful bugs (I got trapped in geometry five times in two hours, once so badly I had to restart the game entirely). The controls are not responsive (and there are points in the game where you really need them to be), and while the storyline is compelling, it just can't overcome the repetition and annoyances that crop up (like having to wrestle a shard from a magpie and squirrels almost every. single. time. you get one). In short? It could be really good. It's not. It's frustrating, and there's just not enough rewards to overcome that.			"

												You know those Hollywood comedy movie trailers? All the good jokes  end up in the trailer, very often making the movie seem interesting. Then you go about watching it and realize there's not much meat on those bones. The whole movie can fit in those 5 minutes of trailer footage and nothing would be lost. Secrets of Rætikon is like that - screenshots and videos oversell it. It's a visually charming game, yes, in which you get to fly through a forest filled with wildlife and mysteries. And that's pretty much it. Downsides list is a bit more extensive than that. Let's start with the name - ""æ"", seriously? How do I even type that, let alone read it? Nevermind, let's go further. In SoR, you'll learn that forest animals are quite the racist scumbags. Nothing would unite a falcon, a crow and a lynx better than a killing campaign against an orange bird (= the player). And they're quite persistent about it, to the point where trying to move an object from screen to screen often becomes a Sisyphus's task.The exploration part of the game is somewhat hindered by a lack of map or any other kind of orientation tool. This becomes most obvious near the end of the game - if you lack one item to finish the game, it may take you quite a while to find it. SoR is on the short site - it provides around two hours of gameplay, unless of course, you miss that one item, in which case the time might easily double.Endgame sequence is one of the most wtf moments you'll ever witness by finishing a game, and not in a good way. After a gruesome scene that makes all your effort either seem in vain or just plain disturbing,  you get to play a dull dull dull match of pong and see a ""game over"" screen even if you win it. What?Whoever is the visual artist of the game, please run to another studio while you can.			"

												The premise for a good game, trapped in a mediocre one. Rather disappointed in this game, all things considered. The entire design of the game is just... flawed. You have to find things in the game world with no indication of where they are and no map to look at when you're not sure where else is left to check, so you can end up running around in circles because you have no clue where you need to be. When you find the relics you need, you have to bring each. and. every. one. back to one room. This involves carrying them across multiple decent-sized screens, with other wild animals chasing you and trying to steal the relic from you, at which point they toss it between each other in an attempt to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, err, I mean, keep it away from you. What does this tedious slog accomplish? It's not more than a frustration builder. Not even ""hard"", just frustrating. There's also instances where you have to attempt to solve a puzzle with an animal attacking you (and no effective way to fend it off) which usually results in tanking damage to get what needs to be done, done. The game's save system is bare-bones, to the point where it can only hold one fixed state, so everything you do is permanent and it's possible to glitch in the terrain or otherwise make the game nigh-unwinnable in various ways. Fortunately, the game is short (a few hours, max, and only some 6-7 major screens, with a few subscreens). Which is for the better, since any bigger and it'd be impossibly frustrating.I like the premise though. The main character controls well, the environment is pretty, the music relaxing. The language, not so much, I would've preferred an auto-translate for any runes you'd found, I couldn't be bothered to translate myself. The ending's also not great. To spoil it, spec ops: the line, bird edition. That's not really an explicit spoiler, but ehh. The game's story isn't exactly the focus here, as far as I can tell. Overall, I wanted to enjoy this game, but there's just... not a lot to enjoy.			"

												Secrets Of Raetikon is an indie gem.This game is all about atmosphere.You play as a bird in a dreamlike mountain landscape, and you need to find some kind of orbs, and activate some ancient ""Ruins"".Some obstacles will be in your way, like some other animals or terrain formations.The best part of the game is how if feels.You are immersed in a relaxing, dreamy and magical world, where the sound gently keeps you company.This game feels like poetry, it talks to the heart.I highly recommend this game, but only if you can appreciate these type of games, which tend to feel more like art (even though this one actually has a smooth gameplay)			"

												Freaking fantastic. With its beautiful vector graphics, fitting music and sound it casted a spell over me. This is one of these little gems you can find between mediocre AAA titles and greenlight-shovelware.The bad thing is, it didn't lasted very long. Around 3 hours for a full playthrough with a not so fantastic ending.But still, it is a fantastic game and it's absolutely worth your money.			"

												Secrets of Raetikon is a beautiful game, with great art design and a peaceful soundtrack, makes for a really nice atmosphere. But sadly, even if the gameplay isn't awful, it starts getting really frustrating, and quite frankly, boring towards the end. The level design is convoluted, there's no map, and the game forces you to backtrack through most of the game, all of that while dodging the extremely annoying enemies trying to hurt you and stealing the object you have to carry through most of the levels, and you have to do all of that like five times, each one of them with more levels to backtrack through and more enemies than the one before it. And all of this culminates in a rather dissappointing ending, which is just an epilepsy inducing light show and a game of Pong. Not a minigame with the same mechanics as Pong, instead the screen turns black, and the arcade game just starts playing. When you win, it says ""Game Over"", shows you your score and the credits start rolling. I have no idea if that's supposed to mean something.It's not the worst game I've ever played, not even close. I'd even recommend checking it out if you got it for free or in a bundle as I did, but what I can not recommend is paying 10€ for a 2 hour game that ends up being frustrating and doesn't even manage to make sense.

												In 2013 Anti-chamber burst on the scene in Janurary taking my GOTY immediately (and it stuck!). It took a little longer, and there've been some other competators (Creeper World III, being the front runner, though I think it's a '13 game as well), but I can safely say Raetikon is my GOTY for 2014.It's an absolute joy to play. It's visually stunning, and generally manages to stay managable and not overwhelming. The envrionment speaks in beautiful ways as you move through it. The viewpoint is just the right closeness, it leaves you feeling lost as you explore, but once you learn the paths it doesn't feel clausterphobic. Secrets everywhere, but they're not unfairly hidden (ala The Swapper). And the movement, oh the movement. Soaring, diving, frantically attempting to escape other birds (who are bullies, btw). Finally, the combat. Yes it's there, it's amazing. It's brutal. It's viceral. It's wild. And you'll be elated when you figure it out yourself.All these elements combine into one of the best games I've ever play. It's under priced, and worth every money grubbing penny.As an aside, I haven't decided if I prefer Mouse or Controller play, but so far I'm sticking to the controller as it's slightly tighter.			"

												I am quite addicted to the game. This is the kind of game with such a beautiful, immersive world that you find yourself thinking about it even after you’ve stopped playing. I remember laying in bed trying to fall asleep, thinking about where the last shard could be because I had seemed to overlook one somewhere in my exploration. The skills you get as a bird are easy enough to master and the true challenge lies in interacting with the environment and wildlife. The challenge is just hard enough to keep you grasping and trying again when you fail, but not so hard that you get discouraged. This is a fine line to walk and Secrets of Raetikon walks it well.Here's a more long-winded version of my review: http://orttimusprimetime.com/game-review/secrets-of-raetikon-review/ "

												One of the reviews I read before starting this game mentioned annoyance at the lack of a world map. This is a fair complaint. Although the world is basically linear, it is still somewhat confusing and possible to get lost. Nevertheless, if you can find your way around the grocery store, you'll probably be okay here. I also find it important to mention to not take this game too seriously. It is what it is, and exploring and getting lost are part of the package. Tell yourself you'll enjoy it, and you probably will!			"

												To be honest, i'm pretty much neutral about this game. I like it, great astetics and concept, but I feel like the one thing that really makes it a rotten egg is the protagonist. They're too underpowered, and you haft to do some things over and over again if you even want to do it.  All you can lift into the air is the animals, and they never like you. On top of that, the special-looking blue triangles are pretty much useless. It's only a rez @ the spot you died, when you can just fly back to where you were. Pretty animation, though. As I said earlier, none of the animals like you, pretty much everyone wants to bar your way except for the little red and yellow birds. You can't even fight back most of the time, unless you throw them into thorns. Being able to hatch birds dosen't help at all; the buzzards still attack you and the magpies still take your stuff.In conclusion, I feel that for most people, this game will eventually send them into a rampage and they'd quit, saying it's too hard. Add some allies or strengthen the protagonist and it might make a decent game, but until then, it's not worth the 10 bucks, unless you like looking at the pretty stuff.			"

												Secrets of Raetikon looks like it had an amazing potential to be a very very good game. However, if, just like me, you got charmed by the trailer and the graphics, then you might be deceived as well.The enemies in this game are the most frustrating ones i've seen in a long time. They chase you non-stop and always make sure to get in your way at every single level. When you catch the triangle thing from them, the second after, they can steal it back, not giving you any chances of running away and having to go back and forth until you flee faster than them.Speaking of back and forth ; the amount of times you have to go back to the first stage and get back to the level you were to bring a weird triangle is incredibly frustrating. there is no warp or anything so you always have to do the stages all over in order to proceed to the next one.There is also an alphabet in the game, in which you have to find all the letters to undestand the runes. I personnally didn't enjoy it, as it just complicates the game more and doesn't give me the motivation to go through every single rune to try to discover what they are saying. Some of them doesn't even say anything important, which adds even more frustration. On top of that, all the birds wants you dead for no particular reason.Despise the amazing graphics and soundtracks, I unfortunately cannot recommend this game.			"

												Glad I got this on sale. As others have already noted, the main problems here are tedium and frustration. It's a shame because this game could have been much more than it is. It looks great and the general movement mechanics are a lot of fun, but the actual game itself (what you are trying to accomplish) is equal parts boring and infuriating to actually do.The tedium/boredom in traveling back and forth depositing items into a thing I could forgive because when you do make progress in this game, it really feels exciting and intriguing. My biggest issue were the magpies/squirrels/anything that can steal from you types of enemies. I literally could not get across a single screen without having my stupid triangle thing stolen 50+ times by enemies that absolutely never give up the chase. Sometimes they'd steal it within one second of me getting it back! It became an absurd, unfun challenge just to move a triangle thing a little ways.SoR could have been much better with less aggressive enemies that know when to give up the chase or possibly even no enemies at all. As it stands, I just don't want to play it anymore, and I didn't even get an hour in.			"

												I took about 2 hours to beat the game, and the majority of the time the game was fine. Good art, decent music, okay gameplay. However, the ending was terrible. I don't mean that it didn't sit well with me or anything. I mean it was about 30 seconds of seizure, a literal game of Pong (seriously, youtube this if you think I'm using the word ""literal"" incorrectly), and then credits roll. The ending was so bad that I wish I had those 2 hours of my life back.I got this game as part of a bundle, and am very glad I didn't pay anywhere near full price for it. I can recommend anyone interested in the game do the same and to stop before the final shrine turn-in.			"

												So, now we know what 3 years of hard work and belief can give the world, because that's how long the team BR took to bring this beautiful example of gameplay to the public forum. Indie developers have sometimes been accused to bringing horrible and generic titles to us with only one or two unique mechanisms, however, these guys have gone much much further. They've created a story, a whole slew of mechanisms to carry the player through the journey, and to allow the traveller, you, to discover in your own time and manner, what has happened, how to change it, and ultimately, how nature itself can surprise us.It's a stark contrast from their previous title AYIM (And Yet It Moves), which incidentally if you don't have, why not? - but it's clear this is another fine string to the teams collective bow. And I defy anyone to play the game, swoop through this extremely stylised landscape, and not feel that sense of pure enjoyment and freedom, especially and the grind of dealing with reality away from the game.What a way to start 2014. Game on. ^_^ "

												You play as a bird that well, in my flying capabilities at least, does not  know how to fly very well! I run into rocks, dive bomb into the ground, and wind up accidentally murdering poor bunnies. I haven’t gotten far enough to honestly even know the goal of the game quite yet, though it describes itself as an adventure game so I imagine the goal will be to just make it to the end. The mechanics of the game are quite interesting, and at the moment make for some amusing, if not sometimes frustrating, game play. I can honestly say that I am looking forward to playing more of the game and seeing where Broken Rules takes it.Here's a video to show the first minutes of gameplay in the earl access stage.

												Secrets of Rætikon is a somewhat visually interesting game without much lore or depth of gameplay to it.  Or rather, it might be better to say that the lore is hard to keep in mind when it is there (and is confusing anyway) and the gameplay is just a tad bit wonky enough to be offputting.The gameplay loop is more or less: As a bird, explore > find shards > use shards to get crystal > carry crystal back to the start of the game.  This can be a little frustrating due to a lack of map, and the game often has aircurrents and 'invisible' ceilings (just max elevation for your bird to fly) so you cant always expect to be able to take straightforward paths.  Exploration can reward you with an anagram cypher so you can read various runes around the game world on obelisks, but its not really easy to do so because its not automatically translated for you, hence why I said the lore is hard to keep in mind.  Its a lot of mental effort to try to guess out letters without the whole codex.  Finding shards is more or less easy, but the crystal carrying can be a different matter.  The other animals in the world will attack you or steal the crystal from you as you try to carry it back and make you have to chase them down to get it back.  This just feels frustrating and like your time is being wasted, it isn't fun.  The controls are passable, but I never felt like they were amazing and executing the needed moves to chase down elusive enemies or avoid attacks can be a pain.  Gameplay just never felt good.  I only kept playing because I had started playing and presumably was progressing towards finishing.Lore wise?  Was hard to keep in mind when I played the game, but I really can't say I remembered any of it.  I got all but one or two of the needed crystals to roll the credits then just gave up on the game.  I looked up the ending on youtube and it feels like a bit of a rediculous jab by the way of the developer.  Sure it can be interesting to have a joke on the expense of the player but if the other party can't figure out the joke and you dont explain it to them then its not funny or 'deep.'  I just sort of shrug my shoulders at this part, there wasn't enough of a story to be meaningful.I wouldn't recommend it.			"

All your doing is just repeating the same things over and over again, just in different places. Beautiful different places. The game really died with as the story was basically non-existent and was really hard to follow the parts they force fed to you. I think it's a ok game, borderline bad. You definetely don't want to pick this up at $11, do it when it's on a 70% sale. That's the only condition I'll say it's ok (just barely ok) to buy the game.			"

												Basically, this is a exploration-collector game with a few enemies and interesting puzzles.Pros:+ It is really easy to learn how to fly properly, at least in a controller. It's smooth, responsive and simple.+ Most of the text is written in another alphabet (still english though), and you have to collect letter by letter to know the meaning of each one (which is fun and cool). It seems hard at first, but the symbols are somewhat alike the normal alphabet, so in the end you'll be reading it without rellying as much to the side notes with the meaning of each letter.+ At first, some enemies are a little hard to avoid but all of them are ""counterable"", so it shouldn't be much of a problem if you try some different things.+ The world is gorgeous, the sound fx are amazing and even though you flap a lot, it doesn't feel repetitive (aside from the ""sing/call"" button, which is kind of annoying. Useful, but annoying sometimes)+ The ending is a piece of art if you read most of the runes. Some people don't get (at all) the ending because they didn't care enough to read the runes.+ The map is short enough to memorize it, but big enough to glamour your eyes. It doesn't have a map, but it doesn't really need one.Cons:-  In a controller, you have to press RB and LB  to grab and dive respectivelly, but because you have to grab for long periods of time, it'd be better if it were in the RT button as it is easied and more comfortable to push. (and you can't change it in-game)-  It's a little hard to understand the lore as a whole if you're lazy to decode and read every single rune in the game, but at least it's simple enough to grasp the idea behind it.

												Full post: http://www.cublikefoot.com/video/secrets-of-raetikon-first-impressions/Secrets of Rætikon is a unique, atmospheric game. You play as a bird with a simple goal: collect slivers to progress the game. The game's environment is made up of various triangles, including the animals and such. Triangles everywhere. This was an interesting style, I've never seen anything like it and I really enjoyed it The controls were very intuitive, easy to understand. The puzzles were also quite simple, from what I've played.The game is still in early access, so it's certainly not finished (and I experience a few crashes while playing the game), but it has a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to the full version!

*note: this review was made within a few days of the game being released for early access. Some things will definitely be different in the future.*Firstly, this is unlike any early access game I've played. It's actually playable!The basic premise behind this game is the following: you're a bird. You're looking for singing rocks that, when you do find one, everything (read: EVERYTHING) wants to mess you up.That is, as far as I can tell, the point of the game. But the funny thing is, this unexplained goal is something I want to achieve when playing. Everything about this game makes me want to play, even when I don't know why.The very well done flying mechanics feel intuitive and, even on the keyboard, I found myself soaring around relatively quickly. The entire atmosphere and art style feel like a children's book mixed with cave paintings mixed with origami. If that doesn't sound awesome, then stop reading right now.The music (note: I am a composer, so my music opinion is much more in depth) is a happier sounding minimalism. Basically expect lots of repetition, constant looping ostinatos and continuous percussion that tend to stick out of the mix. Initially, I was put off by the music to be honest. Minimalism isn't really my thing and hearing the same 4 second melody over and over and over? Well, I was beginning to consider switching off the sound after a while...But it gradually grew on me, especially when I got further into the world. It starts to really come into its own when you meet the more interesting animals. So, I'm passing the music, but would much prefer something more than what's currently available.Speaking of audio, I did notice repetitive sound effects, so I'm hoping the creators decide to invest in more than the handful of rock cracking sounds they have! I also dislike the wind sound that accompanies a dash. That would work a lot better as a speed activation, rather than a button activated sound effect.So, the tl:dr version:PROS:Beautiful artstyleWonderful atmosphereVery polished controls and engineWorld is intriguingCONS:Music can get repetitive and dull over time. Did grow on me though.Sound effects are obviously few and far between/need to be changed in placesNow, the big question is: is it worth it?I would definitely say yes. There's a decent amount to go with already, and it's still early access. If the creators keep it updated and improve upon it, then the answer will be:OH GOD YES!Looking forward to the future of Rætikon.			"

												Secrets of Raetikon isn't a fantastic game, but it's a pretty game with an interesting no-hand-holding free-form aesthetic. You get to fly around in the world they created and figure out what you want to do. There's isn't choice: you do the things that progress the ""story"" or you don't. But how you interact with the creatures in the world (or more specifically, how you exact your revenge on them) is the story you create. The closest exception is the end. I didn't like the ending very much, but maybe I would have liked it more if I'd just walked away earlier.The game has encrypted messages that probably convey more of the story. I didn't read many of them. By the end of the game I could read them like a child learns to read and that was an interesting experience, but I didn't desire to go around and find every one. In some ways, I feel like that's the key to the Raetikon experience: you don't need to do everything; you can just spend some time finding out the Secrets of Raetikon.			"

												This game is very aesthetically pleasing, all of the colors look well together, and the ambiance is just beautiful, all in all an immersing gameplay that doesn't drown you with overdone, too strong audios or visuals, which is a welcome change, there isn't much tutorial, and it lets you figure it out on your own, this is both good and bad, I loved that the directions on how to play were simple and straightforward, and gave you the first piece of the puzzle but beyond that for the first hour of play or so I felt a little lost and disoriented, maybe some guide arrows back to the main gate/puzzle thing would be nice, when you have in your talons one of the keys. Fighting or avoiding enemies is challenging and inventive, where the only way to hurt the enemies is to run them into a hazard, or bring one to them, there are lots of secret areas, and runes to find and decode, which is an added fun little bonus for those of you who like to do that, and it doesn't appear to be required, all in all this game tickles the mind and is innovative and inventive, a very quirky casual game, easily one of my favorites, 4/5			"

												Fun little game. I've enjoyed going into it knowing nothing and figuring stuff out. However, the game becomes a bit of a drag really quickly. If it were any longer, it would be outright annoying.The game is a great arcade bird flight simulator, and a glorified collectathon, but who doesn't like collecting shiny things?Other than that, great little game to provide you entertainment for one evening.

												A stunning game with highly original art, game design, and beautiful music. A very relaxing game, it does not really get very hard, and even though it does give you a challenge at certain times, it is never enough to get frustrating. The game is about finding and releasing ancient artifacts that are placed in machines spread around the forests and mountains, hidden in caves and old ruins.It's a relatively open world, ready for exploring at your leisure. I love how there is little in way of a tutorial and you are free to interact with the physics and animals of the world. For instance place a male rabbit with a female rabbit and little rabbits appear, giving you a little bonus as well :)The feeling and physics of the flying is amazing and feels very lifelike - you can float along on wind currents and flap your wings for speed, swoop and dive.Highly recommended for anyone looking for an original game experience that is unlike anything else out there!

												I enjoyed most of Secrets of Raetikon.The game is visually appealing.It is challenging at times but over all fairly relaxing to play.It is strange and interesting in ways that motivated me to play it through to the end.The reason I can't recommend it is because it is let down by 2 major features.The game has obelisks all over the place that are covered in runes.You collect runes as you explore the game which get added to a translation guide.Even when you have found all the runes, the translation guide never gets applied to the obelisks, leaving you to manually transcribe the messages.I personally found this to be frustrating and time consuming.The ending of the game is traumatic and disappointing.Without wanting to spoil what actually happens, the game has a sinister feeling as you play which leads up to a climax that I hoped would be meaningful.Instead the ending was sudden and unlike anything else in the game.Like a point was trying to be made and the devs ran out of money or were told to change the ending at the last minunte.

												Secrets of Rætikon is a flight-based puzzle platformer with a gorgeous low-poly aesthetic, nimble controls, and some excellent and imaginative setpieces. It's hampered a bit by technical issues, punishing item-collection requirements, and -- depending on your point of view -- how the final section of the game works. I'll talk more on that later with a spoiler warning.You control a bird-like creature trying to activate a large machine with an unknown purpose. You explore several large forest and cave environments to collect the energy you need. Along the way, you'll encounter by a variety of flora and fauna, some peaceful, some hostile, and find runes that expand the lore of the world once you translate them. The translation element was really impressive to me, and seemed to embody the philosophy of the game: a high level of trust for the player to intuit and understand what was necessary without explicit hints or hand-holding. This sort of thing is a high-wire act in puzzle-platformers or adventure games, rarely tried since the early 90s. Done wrong, it's baffling and arbitrary, and leads to players getting lost and failing to understand quirks of the game's mechanics that aren't explained. Done well, it gives an immense satisfaction that you had a creative idea and it actually worked. I had several of these moments playing Rætikon. Translating the runes isn't automatic even as you pick up the letters, and your bird character has to cling to the rune stone while you're trying to decipher what it says, still able to be attacked (or drown if the rune is underwater). Similarly, some machines and environmental challenges are presented with no clues about what they're for or how to interact with and navigate them. I was careful to keep track of artifacts I found, where I had left them, and where they might be necessary, and the game rewarded me for it in a way I wasn't expecting. Trusting the player to bring their A-game and be patient and resourceful enough to figure it out is a huge risk, likely to alienate a lot of players, but the rewards are similarly big in a way that's hard to quantify.The game unfortunately has some the technical issues common in indie development, like objects getting lost behind foreground elements (most indicate the presence with an outline, but not all), or the player character getting stuck under heavy objects or inside level geometry (uncommon, but it can happen). There's only one auto-save and no manual save system. Every single sliver is required to finish the game, although you have a button that will indicate where nearby ones are. Hostile animals are difficult to actually fight off as you don't have an attack button, but you can grab them or use the environment to damage and kill them (I actually like how the ability to attack is almost accidental, an indirect result of the grabbing mechanic). The environments are almost too large, some taking a long time to traverse empty space or backtrack many screens carrying different objects when you're not sure where they go.Overall, I appreciated the approach of this game and had a lot of fun playing it. There's one caveat, which is hard to explain without spoiling anything, so avoid this if you don't want to risk it.Secrets of Rætikon's story and aesthetic aren't what they appear to be, exactly -- there's a tonal shift toward the end that (in keeping with its gameplay approach) isn't explicitly hinted at by much of what comes before it. How you respond to where the developers chose to go depends on how invested you were in what the game appeared to be up to that point. A number of people in other reviews were very unhappy with where it goes. My personal feelings were that it didn't ruin the experience and in a way I appreciated the unexpected boldness of it. I don't think it was cheap, but I wasn't emotionally invested in the world the game took place in the way some other gamers might be. It was a genuinely shocking moment, to assume you were doing one thing and be totally blindsided at the last moment by what you were actually doing. That said, I'd 100% understand someone having a viscerally negative reaction to how this game ends. I recommend this game with the caveat that the endgame may sour the experience for you, depending on your point of view and what you wanted out of it. Hope that helps! "

												A beautiful, but far to frustrating game. The controls are very poor and cannot be changed, making it extremely difficult to traverse some areas, especially when in tunnels lined with thorns. This is worsened by enemies that are constantly getting in your way, either killing you or carrying off things you need to progress. The poor controls and opposing currents of wind make it hard to chase or avoid them, especially since the wind does not affect them at all. Worse still, there is no way to attack the enemies yourself, but instead you have to try to get them to kill each other, or use thorn-covered plants to hurt them. These plants also hurt you. I do not advise buying this game.			"

												Secrets of Raetikon is a beautiful game!  It's a game that you should dive into without much knowledge of it and explore on your own. At first, it's confusing to pick up the story but if you pay attention to all the details and read what's given, you'll start to follow along!  It's amazing to explore and find the story of the game.  What you thought of Secrets of Raetikon in the beginning might change and blow your mind with the twist of an ending :3  What I loved about this game too was that the puzzles given didn't hold your hand through it.  Though sometimes aggrivating, finishing the puzzle was rewarding because you had to think on your own and come up with your own ideas on how to solve it because there's not just one way to do it!  It's a truly unique game, and one that I personally have not experienced yet. I loved it and I highly recommend it for someone who's looking for a beautiful and challenging adventure.			"

Ah well,at least I got a few theories :DThe only downside, like the reviews before me, the ending,Tip: Do not hatch the red-yellow-and-black eggs till after the ending :DAnd Apparently I have an immortal lynx that have been underwater for..well.. you'd be dead if you were underwater that long, after the ending there was still that Lynx underwater,I helped it back up to land, and it was alive :D			"

												[Some spoilers ahead]This little game is a nice journey. It's an exploration game with a bit of action. The assembly of such gfx/music (one is a slow down version of a ""the fith element"" melody) and gameplay makes this game unique-ish. Unfortunately, I did discover some game mechanics when I finished the game while I decided to have a look at the steam achievements. The breeding, predator/prey law,  well... I missed them totally. Some of them are insane: finish the game without being hurt is crazy, coze the movement/flapping of the bird will make it extremely hard, namely, you will need luck, a lot.I managed to block an underwater rune with rocks... (unable to remove them to read it).The ending is controversial: killing animals for their blood in order to power what seems a machine, is a bit too much for me. And I'm not a vegetarian person. And why pong??The game is big enough to discourage to start again to unlock more achievements and to discover what the hell are the 2 unused triangles. I was not able to find a place where they would fit. I really did spend a lot of time looking for forgotten places in the entire world. Well... did not look hard enough... hint of the location not ""strong"" enough?One bad point though: the game require the linux closed source radeon driver for full rendering. Games can be closed source, but platform (here GNU/Linux)  and middleware should be open (GNU lesser GPL license protection for middleware code).			"

												I have to say, this game is absolutely beautiful.Definitely one for the controller though, as it feels more intuitive to fly about.Flying around, you have to collect various 'ningis' to fill a machine to progress. On your free flight around this wonderful world, you happen across various animals. And you can choose to help or not, or even try to find a way past them. The crow seems to like attacking you when you're near a machine, just HOW are you going to get rid of him?? Well, there was that rock, I could try and squish him..Do you try and fight, try and use world objects, use another animal to your advantage?? It's your call. I'm still trying to figure out the rune table, but again, this will prove fun more than frustration, and it's all part of the learning curve of playing this game.The physics are well rounded (grabbing a heavy rock slows you down etc etc) and the ability to just mess about  is wonderfully delightful. Even though I've played less than an hour, this is going to be one of those games I can quite happily come back to again and again.I'll have to have a bash at the editor, which is a really nice touch from Broken Rules. Not many game companies give you this option to mess about with their game.End opinion?Worth £6.00? oh hell yeah. Game play? Very smooth, graphically beautiful open worldRecommend this? Absolutely "

												Obviously it's very pretty. A sort of 2.5D collect-a-thon platformer, without the jumping puzzles. Far from perfect, but would still recommend. The controls are very simple, but very ropey and imprecise. The narrative is non-existant. Quite why you're doing anything, or what exactly it is you've got to do at times is unclear. The game is action-focused, in that you're constantly doing everything you can to avoid action. Three hours long but ends very abruptly. A map is sorely needed.In short, everything is kind of okay, but can lead to intense frustration. I would not recommend it as a method to relax. Only buy if you're already a relaxed person, because the controls and enemies will likely annoy you.7/10, would recommend, but probably won't play again			"

The environment isn't that much of an eco system like in the description, rather than enemys and neutral animals around you. I got it as part or an Humble Bundle. I would suggest max. 4$ as a good price, 10$ are far too much for 2 hours of gameplay with no chance of getting new modes or new content.			"

												An amazingly beautiful and frustrating game. Once you get the hang of it, it is not so bad, but at first you feel like calling it defenseless bird simulator. You are given little to no instruction as to how to actually play the game and are left to figure many of the goals and interworkings yourself. This quality is one I found to be both irritating and rewarding.The difficulties in the game are both technical (controling the character) and tactical as you are actually required to think from time to time to play it. The good news is that when you find yourself yelling at the screen, you have some stunning artwork to calm you down.I enjoyed playing this game quite a lot, despite my frustrations. It was, however, a little short. I finished two play throughs and all of the reasonable achievements in about 12 hours. I understand it is an indie game, so I cannot reasonably judge it on length. An expansion or addendum would be nice though.A few bugs (I think). I never found bees or bats in the game, but they are listed in the stats as things you can kill. Also, there are other stats in that same listing that never seem to change no matter what I do. I could have missed something entirely, or there are bugs. Looking at some of the videos of this game posted by others on the internet, I am given to thinking there have been updates that changed the game enough that certain things may no longer apply to it.Lastly, I may have had more technical difficulties than your average given that I did not play with a controller, just my keyboard.

												Pretty good. I like the art style a lot, and the flying controls were quite enjoyable. I think the ""combat"", if you could call it that, was a little out of place, and the fact that by default the grab button is the right bumper button is a little uncomfortable, but overall it was pretty nice. I quite liked the tonal shift right at the end, too, good job.			"

												I love how beautiful this game is. I want to continue playing it, but I have found that the controls for the game are unintuitive enough that I basically have to start over everytime. That's a bummer. The puzzles are fun, even if you do want to mow down the squirrels with a machine gun after a while. Perhaps I am just obtuse and others were better at remembering the controls. To those people, this game was probably more fun.			"

												Secrets of Rætikon is a side-scrolling open world exploration game set in the mountains of the Alps. You play as a bird whose aim is to collect parts of an ancient machine and unlock the mysteries surrounding it.Secrets of Rætikon is currently available on Steam’s Early Access system. This generally means the game is still in development and can be anything from a barely playable early build to a nearly finished game. Secrets of Rætikon fits in somewhere closer to the latter, it is playable until the last chapter which is not complete, but it will be before launch which is expected in a few months time. There are some bugs and unfinished level designs but you should not have any major issues.The game starts with no story or introduction which immediately gives you that mysterious feeling. The story is told throughout the game via rune stones which need to be deciphered. A simple tutorial gets you underway and introduces you to the mechanics of the game.  A game controller is recommended, though you can use a keyboard if you wish. As you are a bird, you fly around the game with some spot on flight controls, they feel very responsive and comfortable to use with a controller. Your bird can glide at a normal speed, flap its wings to give a speed increase and for a fast burst of speed you can dive. Finally, you can interact with the scenery by holding it with your claws, you can pull or push, and even lift if the object is not too heavy.The graphic style is probably the first aspect of the game that you notice. It is a 2D side-scrolling game with polygon style graphics which is very striking. The background shows the mountainous ranges in the distance through to dense forest, caves and more. The foreground changes style to reflect the game areas, outside in the windy mountains, maze like forests, dark cave systems and mysterious temple like areas. The definition of the areas made up from the polygons are immediately recognisable and wonderful to look at. The audio is more subtle with short pieces of soft tones which work well, sounds effects are sparse and could do with some more work.The population of Rætikon is quite varied, from cute bunnies and butterflies through to not so friendly foes such as blackbirds and wolves. You have no form of attack, but you can use the surrounding scenery to run and hide, avoid or attack, the choice is cleverly up to you. If you choose the latter you can for example pull up thorny plant roots, fly around with them in tow and use them to defend against enemies. Alternatively, you can wait next to a thorny bush as an enemy flies towards you and dash away at the last second, resulting in a satisfying messy end for the foe. There are more devious ways to avoid death but I will leave them for you to work out.The game world is open and you are free to explore a good chunk of it from the start. There are some puzzles which need to be solved to progress, usually to access an area containing a machine shard of which there are six. These are unlocked with Slivers which are found throughout the game. Once unlocked, you will often find a fairly simple puzzle such as rebuilding a broken statue with pieces found in the surrounding area. Completion of the puzzle rewards you a shard which you need to take back to the main machine. Beware, the shard is sought after and the local population may chase after you, resulting in a friendly convoy of butterflies or a nerve-racking chase by blackbirds which if they manage to grab the shard will fly around with it until you manage to get it back off them!Secrets of Rætikon is great fun to play, the pace of the game is for the most part very relaxing and it is enhanced by the open world exploration which allows you to fly around at your leisure and enjoy the scenery if you wish to. The interaction with the scenery and wildlife is enjoyable, just try not to kill those poor innocent bunnies by throwing rocks at them ;) There are a few bugs and unfinished parts of the game but keep in mind this is Early Access and the weekly updates contain a good number of changes and improvements. If you enjoy exploration, solving puzzles and mysteries set in an very atmospheric world this is a game you should not miss out on. Highly recommended!Review originally posted on http://www.gamergeddon.com/ "

												It reminds me very much of ""Okami"", but this is easier to pick up and play. Also you can soar, explore and experiment more freely and it is also a perfect harmony between relaxing but not too calm soundtrack and great art + game design. A really neat combination that works. Visually this game is simply beautiful and at the same time it has life in it almost everywhere - - pretty much like ""Another World"" did, then it came out. All in all it's an amazing game and experience at the same time. Also, probably one of the best choises based on quality/price factor.			"

												This game started out so good. I was getting ready to have a nice relaxing atmospheric run like Dear Esther but more proactive. It showed some really pretty art and I dropped to the ground and messed around with the controls collecting stuff and poking at the wildlife and enjoying the sights.Then it all went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Not only is there no map or fast travel - something which immediately becomes obvious and a big problem when you make your first shard since you have to make a return trip every time you make it and they get longer as the game goes on - but there is also no reliable way to defend yourself. I understand the whole thing about being a non-predatorial bird creature but come on. In nature any bird that can lift animals can pretty efficiently dive bomb them to the ground. Here it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Much like the ""weapons"" and dropping heavy objects on things.Enemies are not similarly handicapped by any means, they will relentlessly and brutally attack you. Some of them will outright grab you and stop you from moving while mauling you with no means of escape. Apparently the enemies I experienced were the nerfed ones. One can only imagine how they were on initial release.Now one could easily say ""meh, I can handle that."" and be absolutely correct. However the biggest issue is that (at least in my playthrough) there is a bug in the positioning of slivers - the things that you build shards with - that make one in particular get placed behind a background object. Making it unreachable without editing your save files. Which is what I did as detailed here so that I could complete the game.Wasn't really worth it in the end though. I normally have a policy of not spoiling in reviews even using spoiler tags, but here it's so pointless I might as well say it. Your reward is a pong game. That's it. This occurs after you smash animals that are in the machine's cages for a blood sacrifice. I don't know if either of those things were an attempt to be ""edgy"" or philosophical but they failed in both respects. Making it just seem silly.			"

												Beautiful piece of art. Secrets of Rætikon can be both relaxing and frustrating (in a good way). The music is very unique and calming. One of my favourite aspects is that they nailed being a bird; the flight motion is perfect, the prey/predator interaction is amazing, and not being constrained by walking (in fact, you can't walk) is refreshing. This game is well worth the money, even at regular price. Works best with a controller, as the flight is meant to be smooth and circular.			"

												A beautiful, gorgeous exploration game. You fly around as a little bird in a world full of dangers: the ferocious lynx, charging hawks, buzzards that will snatch you up and thrust you into deadly thistles. And the meat and potatoes of the game is - exploring. Pulling aside boulders to find out what is behind, collecting mysterious glowing artifacts, and finding out how to avoid or destroy your enemies. Because you don't really have an 'attack' per se, you have to use more creative options to bypass foes. You can utilize thermals (air currents) to pick up incredible speed, suddenly dive mid-air to escape the talons of a foe, or out-wit your opponent and carry him to his doom beneath a rolling rock. Everything in the game reeks of mystery and intrigue, not to mention being /beautifully/ designed in fascinating designs of geometrical components.Best things in the game: interesting twist on combat, visuals, absorbing mini-puzzles (none very difficult so far), visuals, wonderful sense of atmosphere and believable ecology, great motivation for exploring, and -- did I mention visuals?Drawbacks: Some of the pursuits can get frustrating (e.g. when a 'magpie' bird steals something important you have to chase it around, the fact that it seems to be faster than you can get annoying). One of the resource/collectible tracks seems very disappointing (I won't explain - it's kind of a spoiler). I'm struggling to find negative things to say!			"

												I enjoyed this game, but came away from it with a bit of a bad aftertaste. Flying about and exploring was engaging, and getting some of the shards back to the central hub had me swearing at birds and trees alike - in a good way, mind you. There were definetely things to like here, enough to justify the five dollars I spent on it during a sale.That said, I found myself wishing there were more to explore; more proper secrets to uncover. That, and the game doesn't really do much with it's world; I think the biggest example is the fox tribe. Sure, you can find your way into the obscure location of the den and meet a tribe of foxes, but nothing really comes of the encounter. They just kind of...leave. They're a setpiece, and not much else.There's backstory here to find, but no real story to explain the gameplay, which perhaps helps to explain why the ending is so unsatisfying. I'm not even sure what it was properly trying to say. I suspended my disbelief and honestly invested into the world for a few hours, and didn't really feel like I got anything back for the experience. If nothing else, this game has shown me a bad ending can really sour the experience.Still, the game got me to swear at birds, so it certainly did something right.			"

ContextSecrets of Rætikon is a very unique looking exploration/(light)metroid-vania game in which you control a bird, and have a bigger mission to accomplish, and a cryptic backstory to uncover.It's an interesting game, and I enjoyed a whole lot of it. However, it has a few bugs. That would not be a problem -- except for the fact that these are game-breaking bugs. I haven't been able to finish the game because of it. These bugs are more common than you would think, and many of the threads in the Community Hub are actually asking for help to solve them. As far as I can see, too many people need to tweak the game files in order to finish the game, if at all...Tith this whole preface, expect this to be a biased review. I spent probably 30% of my time with this game very frustrating, and trying to overcome bugs. It's ultimately why I don't recommend this game.PresentationThe game looks amazing!The main attraction, for me, is how they've done colors. The game is very geometrical, mostly full of triangle, with each one of them having a different shade.I can't explain it very well, but look at the screenshots! The bigger animals are really well done, considering they're a bunch of triangles. The smaller animals are a bit weaker, and the birds' flying animations can be a bit awkward. Still, nothing too wrong!However, there's a big problem that comes from this.Hitboxes and limits are completely off.When you see a wall, it's a lie. The real wall is probably inside the rock, somewhere. It feels wrong to fly through part of the walls. Not sure why they didn't limit the levels properly (maybe to give it a sense of 3D?), but it didn't work for me, at all.There are some very big foreground objects.They cover up your vision and it's annoying.Alright, moving on to the music and sound-effects. One quick problem is that it doesn't save your volume options when you exit the game. So, if you need to balance the audio, feel free to do it every single time...Now, on to the actual topic. The music is a strange aspect of this game. The game is very nature and life inspired, so I was expecting some more folk-y music. Instead, it's a strange, more modern ambient music. I don't know. It doesn't really seem to fit, most of the time -- although, it certainly does fit when you meet the more complex structures. It makes the world feel a bit more alien, and the music certainly helps with that.The sound-effects, were almost spot-on! There's a huge contribution of the wild-life present in the game to the atmosphere. You'll be constantly listening to birds chirping, chittering from the rabbits, foxes, etc. When you're flying, the wind also intensifies. Overall, it all comes together and creates a very immersive atmosphere! It's impressive. Structure and MechanicsThis game is openworld and almost maze-like, at this. A cool thing that it does, though, is that the world is circular -- if you go right as much as you can, you'll eventually find yourself where you started. The downside is that it doesn't really serve as a handy shortcut, except in very specific circumstances. Still, it's a nice addition.Other than that, you have an hub area where there are several missing shards. Your main motivation is to find those shards, and see what happens.  When I said it's a light metroid-vania, was because you need to open up some areas and find your way around. Unfortunately, there isn't much in terms of power-progression. There is one power-up, but it's optional, and revealed itself incredibly useless -- its main possible advantages were actually disabled. What it ended up being was a very fun way of causing chaos. Fun for a few minutes, then it becomes just a mess.Anyway... The game has several gates, that require slivers to open. The shards just the same. These slivers are simply spread around to world, and you'll collect them by normally exploring -- in the best case scenario. The worst-case scenarios are game-breaking and I'll mention them later.Then, you can also collect other kinds of slivers -- blue ones. These work almost like Demon Souls' souls, in a very superficial way. If you collect X of them, you'll get a life. When you die, you'll lose a life, but respawn where you died. Otherwise, you'll drop the blue slivers you have, and go back to the Hub area. You can get those back. Their whole purpose is as lives, but the whole lives-system seems a bit directionless. The interesting thing, though, is how you collect these. There are eggs and nests spread around the world. If you drop an egg into a nest (without breaking it), a bird will be born, and drop a few of these blue slivers. Otherwise, you can also get it by reading runes spread throughout. These runes are written in english, but the characters are highly stylized, almost in code.You can collect these symbols (which are often well hidden) to be able to decode these messages easier. It's NOT needed, however. With a little effort, you can decode them yourself!I think this covers the basics.Stregnths and WeaknessesThe best aspect of this game, to me, is how alive it feels. Animals interact with each other, and also with you! Some are aggressive, some a more passive, but there's always some kind of interaction. You can also bait them into attacking into other, and even kill them, if they're making your life too difficult. Especially when you're carrying the shards, everything becomes attracted to you, and every animals steals your shard! You then have to run after them and get it back. I can imagine it being frustrating, but I found it really cool!Now, a mixed bag - the backstory. It's presented simply through the rune-stones. And these are strange and hard to read. They also have different writters. So, in a way, you get invested and interested in the world it presents. In another way, it's all done through such incoherent methods that it's very hard to follow. Maybe if you replay it, but otherwise... You're unlikely to retain most of it, which is really unfortunate.Also, you can't simply ""collect"" these runestones to read them later. If you want, you'll need to re-run through the whole areas separately. It's... too inconvenient, honestly. In regards to this, I think it's a very cool idea. However, it's too disjointed for me to enjoy it.Now, for the huge problems - physics.These feel so out of place. A lot of it is carrying or moving stones. Couple this with unclear hitboxes and what you get is yourself trapped between rocks and the wall. Off you go, then, altering the game's files to reset your position (the game could easily account for this with a reset button, but there isn't even that! It's a known issue, with half of the gamepad unused...).Then, you can carry vital items between zones. In the beginning of the game, it's easy to see one and try to bring it to the hub area -- didn't work, drop it somewhere. Later, you realize what it was for! Eureka! ... Well, where is it, now? Go around and around looking for it, praying that it's not behind foreground! It's very annoying, when you start.Then, the biggest problem. Slivers are exactly counted for you to finish the game. Not one too many. However: 1. They can spawn inside walls and be impossible to get without tweaking the files;2. Some gates consume more than they're supposed to;3. You can drop them easily (and lose them);4. Deaths can somehow lower your number -- this was my problem. It's a bug. One that had supposedly been fixed. Well, tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ I was 1 sliver short. One tiny shard of 100+. If all of these are KNOWN issues why couldn't they just add a few more for safety purposes? It's such an easy solutions... ConclusionI'm out of characters. BEWARE -- buy at your own risk! "

												the game is fantastic, good music, very colorful.You will enjoy it for sure.You can access any area in the game at anytime, the objective is to collect artifacts around the world.You dont need to get skills or level up anything.It's an easy going puzzle game where you just need to survive.8/10Cons: You need to backtrack to the hub every time you finish a puzzle to activate a cage.But still a very good game.

												This game is awful.  I can't imagine how the developers but so much apparent effort into such a crap game.  The art and music evoke a joyous mood but the game play is tedious, frustrating and completely out of place.  The game seems like it wants you to have fun exploring and reading tidbits of lore, but then it has irritating enemies and traps that add nothing to the game except drain the fun out of it.  Flying in circles trying to time dives and flaps perfectly to grab useless doodads isn't fun either.  This dev team should have signed up to make the art for someone else's better game instead.			"

												Some stories are helped by a lack of elaboration. Without the whole picture, the audience can hold on to their sense of wonder and use what they do know to speculate in the blanks. Secrets of Raetikon has no such story. It somehow manages to provide those details the audience would normally speculate over without any of the overarching context that should have proceeded it. The runestones scattered around Raetikon begging to be translated but lacking any real depth and the ending that comes out of nowhere and leads to the same place are hints that there was an attempt to add in this context, but sadly, they both miss that mark considerably. Be that as it may, there is a robust and easy to use editing tool which is fully integrated into the game itself. One would think that with such a uniquely beautiful world that is an absolute joy to explore, players would leap at the chance to correct such a damning flaw. But with only four items in the game's Workshop, it seems most, myself included, just let the opportunity pass on by. And it's a shame because the design of world itself is genuinely wonderful. Every part of it is gorgeous and exists independent of the player. The other creatures will gladly attack each other just as readily as they would the player and nothing seems to be artificially constructed for the player to interact with. The entire ecosystem feels authentic and organic. If that's the only game you're interested in playing, ignore my lack of a recommendation because you'll find a game worth your time here. But if you're looking for a conclusion, catharsis, or some sense of reason to the world presented to you and your actions in it, please look elsewhere.			"

												8/10 - BEAUTIFUL, MYSTERIOUS AND SURPRISING!This was an impulse buy for me and it did not disappoint. The game involves playing as a small birdman, and you flap around an open 2D world trying to find golden shards and bring them back to a ""machine"". Along the way there are plenty of physics puzzles and even the combat is physics based. Predator birds will try to knock you out of the sky but you can defeat them with the environment by either grabbing and throwing them into a thorny bush, grabbing a thorny vine and swinging it into them, or dropping a boulder on their head. It really lets you use your brain to figure out a good tactic and experiment.As far as exploration goes the game doesn't disappoint. There are hidden caves everywhere and a few secrets to find that aren't required to complete the game. Along the way you'll find hidden ""runes"" which will allow you to decipher engraved stones. The messages tend to not be that important and are quite cryptic, but finding al the runes will land you with an achievement anyway. The game clocks in at around 2-3 hours so the world isn't huge by any means, but they've managed to pack quite a lot to explore into it. I would have liked the game to be longer but i reckon the gameplay would have become quite stale eventually.The visuals are stunning and the soundtrack works well. This is a very solid game that drives the player with it's sense of mystery and discovery. Unfortunately while the message at the end of the game was one i enjoyed seeing, it wasn't that well written and left a lot of people confused and feelign unfulfilled, myself included. Only after Googling it i understood what was going on. Despite that though the journey itself is a lot of fun and i urge you to grab a copy .			"

												It is an intresting game, you play a bird just your everyday bird. You can fly, as one would expect so that adds some nice bits to the gameplay as your movment is not limited by height though there is a limit to how high you may fly before being sent back down to earth. You spend most of your time flying around exploring the game and it has a fun art style, while the music is not memorable it stays at a nice slow pace and never offends. Challenge is low but you can die from birds of prey, the rather nimble lynx and various harzards like water and brambles. The fun of the game is exploring the world so if you like that this is a good game for you, the ending makes no sense but maybe I just didnt read enough the game's lore which is done with runes that you collect so you can read the writting on stones scatterd through out the game. Gameplay is ok you can pick up stuff and thorw it around so that adds some fun pyschics based action, and if you get a secret you can become god bird destroyer of life. Overall game was fun,I would buy it at $5.00 if it goes on sale again.			"

												SHORT VERSION:Short and beautiful game, but everything else is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥You must have STRONG NERVERS to play it, that's pretty much it.SPOILERS FURTHER DOWN Some key points:* The game spend no time for the basis.   Exagerated version: they tell you: ""A"" to flap, ""Rb"" to grab, ""Lb"" to dive and have fun!   You don't know what to do, why you do it, who/what thing you are ? spirit? forest savior? assh*le of the forest? thief? random flappy guy?    Just to be clearer, I don't mind the missing explaination why/where/what/who in the begining, but even at the end of the game, you just don't know. The game leaves you without any key of comprehension.* The flight is special at least.  You play a bird. You can flap your wings with the action button.  What I was expecting: You keep your current speed before the action, and get a boost after the action.  What the game does: You stopped in air before the action, and restart flying at after, slightly faster than before.  Every. single. time.  And to keep the optimum speed, you press that buttons at least 3 times in a second. Result: you move forward, you stop, you move, you stop, you move, you stop. That's stupid and really annoying. When you have to fly a long distance, the camera is like shaking because of those to two actions.* The enemy in this game are freeking ninjas.  They can reach you from far and but you can't.  Lynx often hide themselves, as you just fly by the area, you are taken down by them, even if they were outside of the screen. * So crucial feedbacks are missing.  You can dive in the water in the game. My reaction: ok, that's cool.  You can almost dive/swim in it for quite a long time. My reaction: ok, that's something I wasn't expecting, but cool.  Suddenly, as you are swimming/diving, you get hurt, but your health bar doesn't shrink/reduce.  Possibilities:    - You are attacked by something you don't know and don't see.    - You are sinking.  The fact is you are indeed sinking somehow, but there's no air/breath bar, neither another user feedback.  At this point, you should think that I'm stupid, that's obvious.  I tell you: no. Because I'm swimming for one minute long, nothing shows me I'm doing something wrong or something bad will append.* The best adjective about the end of the game is ""random"".			"

												If you're up for a quickie, this is the exploration game for you.The vanilla adventure takes a promising 2-3 hours. The content can be extended/changed with some workshop mods that make the game significantly easier or head-bangingly more difficult; it's something to keep in mind if you're looking for a game that can fit your needs.The main question is, how good are those 2-3 hours of content?The lack of any map at all will certainly frustrate some, even if it's done in one comfortable sitting. Thankfully, the game is not confusing and having to remember where to go next won't/shouldn't be an issue.It's unfortunately backed with some backtracking and some animals that will attempt to ruin your work or outright kill you. You can kill them using the environment, but it will take some effort.The environment can trap you if you're not careful. This is in combination with auto-save, so restarts might be a possibility.The sound and level designs are fantastic. You will feel an urge to explore them, run through the trees as you desire, looking for secrets and such, it's well deserving of exploration. There were no noticeable glitches.There are a few, side-track things you can do to occupy your time such as hatching animals for your own benefit or killing the rowdier animals. Also, runes and deciphering.The ending will leave your opinions going... ""back and forth"" I should say.Should you buy this?If you like being thrust into worlds and having to figure out the story for yourself, then absolutely. Otherwise, if you're not much for exploration games, games with little/no text, have a phobia of birds, or don't like puzzles, this isn't for you. Three stars out of five.			"

												This is something I would have made as a tech demo in university.That's all the praise it's getting from me:it has a defined aesthetic (that many find apealing but was more uncomfortable for me).It has the elements of gameplay needed to show proof of conceptIt shows that that it has character interactions and physicsIt has a full set of sounds including background sound effectsNone of this makes it a complete or enjoyable experience.The gameplay is tedious and artificaly elongated with travel time (which you have to be active for and so conscious of every damn flap of your birdmans wings). The puzzles are not at all puzzles, simply fetch quests that some times require you to put together simple jigsaw pieces in the same damned pattern every time. There is no meaningful narrative or plot to the world your in. The so called eco-system is a sham, all it is the choice to spawn creatures in the world or not to, the creatures interact with each other in the most basic of fashions which is simply to kill or be killed. And seeing as your on the menu you might as well not bother.The worst part is the end. I'm not a completionist, but I need closure, so after my hour or so of repetitive tasks I went and got my closure by looking up the ending. It is the most artificaly ""Artsie"", up its own♥♥♥♥♥♥ending I have seen in a long time, so much so that I was glad that I had only wasted one hour on playing this ""artistic statement"".This is someones bloated university project that has no direction, no goal, no meaningful content, its just flashy and serves to illustrate that they can make all the technical systems that went into its construction.Congratulations, now you can use this to show investors and put your obvious creative talent to good use making an actual game.

												The art and sound on this game are extremely well done.  The bird AI though is brutal and unforgiving. Sometimes you're stuck in an area with birds and they're trying to ruin your day. I think this is one of the most frustrating games I've played in a long time.The puzzles are pretty good and the secrets are well hidden It's interesting the developer chose not to give a map and it makes the game much more difficult. I ended up memorizing the map because it's not that big bit I personally would have enjoyed a map.It's very short so if you stick with it you'll make it as I did. I think they could have left the weird part of the ending out and it would have been fine.  Were the developers trying to make a really hard game or did they run out of time and now it is a hard game? I don't recommend this game unless you're looking for something very difficult with no help.

												As I am only 1 hour into the game when I type this review, I must say that this game is beautiful, very stylized.BUTThe game is kinda a weird mix betweena) an exploration game where you explore the game and admire the beauty of your surroundings ; andb a rpg where you have to collect items(shards) to progress and enemies to hurt you in different areasI have a frustrating time trying to manuever between the enemies while trying to progress thru an area since the controls are unusual. And there's no map. No map in an exploration game is just frustrating and time consuming to track back where you have been thru....unless thats the point of not inserting a map is for you to track back areas in which case I don't like it.By all means, this is not a bad game and I think I would still finish the game and get the achievements. The game as i mentioned is beautiful and the game is wonderful to explore.Overall, its an ok game and I would recommend getting it if you're into puzzle and exploration games.(EDIT)As of 2 hours, I can say that this game is as i mentioned, but there's just too much bugs everywhere. Again, recommended to puzzle/exploration gamers, but if u dunno anything about computer setups and inside game modification stuff, only play it IF ITS IN A BUNDLE OR SALE.			"

												This is one of those hit or miss games.  The main reason I disliked it was because it gives the impression of being a casual indie game with unqiue and pleasant graphics and minimal content, but then creates an open world that albeit eventually connects together still provides a very tedious and boring gameplay for retrieving items back to the beginning.Interesting runes and peaceful scenery don't cut it.  I wish either they'd put in more abilities and content, or made exploration less tedious.			"

												The tutorial area plays like Knytt with flying, getting you ready for a peaceful exploration game with a focus on beautiful environments and a relaxing soundtrack. The second area introduces eagles/hawks which either grab your character and divebomb you into spikes or zoom towards you to directly cause damage. There is no way to fight them, so your only option is to madly tap the A button to flap your pathetic wings away.The worst part, though, comes in when you collect the second core and are on your way back to the central area. Remember those peaceful squirrels and semi-peaceful magpie-like birds you saw on your way in? They're a trap. The magpies/squirrels can grab the core away from you, are faster than you unless you really mash that A button, and will actually toss it to each other to keep it out of your reach.That's right. This peaceful, Knytt-like game is actually a vile game of keep-away, where you're the short, stubby kid. Oh, and the music becomes grating after only a few minutes.Just go play some Knytt, Minecraft, or any other exploration game. This isn't worth your time.			"

												IF YOU HAVE A GAMING LAPTOP: You can ignore everything I say and buy the game.Okay, the game seems great. From what I've heard, it is. If you have a desktop, you can MAYBE ALMOST play it. I am running on a non-gaming laptop. And it's a moderately good non-gaming laptop. I can run Garry's mod with nine pages of add-ons and no lag, or Warframe as speedy as anything. However, you try running this game (you would think its graphics would not cause much lag) on the lowest graphics setting, only the bare minimum amount of processes going, on high performance, and the game CRASHES when I try to press a button on the MAIN ****ING MENU! Minecraft is better optimized than this! I bought it for nine dollars, and the game can't even run properly, so it's not even worth that. I know it's early access, but... really?One word: OPTIMIZEI sincerely want to play this game, since it seems REALLY cool. But, I can't. So, please optimize this game so I can play it. I recommend you buy this game if you have a desktop or a gaming laptop (but remember, I can't play it yet, so I have as much knowledge on this game as the trailers and description give). But if you have a regular laptop, NOOOOOO...Also, on startup, there's a weird dialogue box that says something about missing visuals. Just fyi for the devs. (Fixed)			"

												To be perfectly fair/upfront: I haven't played much. That said, so far it's kind of frustrating and boring.

												The original text was published on Kanobu on 17.04.2016.Triangular sun floats above the straight geometrical line of the horizon. You can “jump” above it, but the gravity will pull you back shortly. A vulture floating in an airflow carries its prey. Somewhere below spruces swing in the wind, bobcats hunt the jays, mysterious altars await their time, giant foxes sleep in their lair, and cryptic runestones emit blue light. And everything is made out of triangles. Previous game of Broken Rules studio celebrated torn paper aesthetic; Secrets of Rætikon echoes it trying hard to look like an origami composition.This is Ecco the Dolphin which has been drained, but preserved the iconic arc jump when you try to go up above the skyline. As a bird which literally felt from the sky will have to find a way yourself through the mountains, lakes and underground temples. A short tutorial will familiarize you with basics of controls and key items — yellow glowing shards. Flapping the wings and finding beneficial airflows is a pure joy. An ability to clutch anything is a surprisingly powerful way to interact with the world. You can pick up a stone or a running rabbit with the same ease (if you’re agile enough to catch it). A torn out sprout will regenerate your health, a rock falling from above will crush anything it falls on. If you’re observant enough you’ll find more complex interactions on your way. Bringing an egg laying on the ground back to the nest will make it hatch, and the nestling will throw about blue spheres. What do you need them for? Oh, that’s another small secret which are numerous in the game. Hidden passages, runic writings, ciphers and keys — the world is compact but bursting with content.No help will come from anywhere, nothing to rely on besides yourself, your memory and attention to detail. The majority of obstacles only seem hard. Take a pause, wait and observe and a solution will come. Lure a lynx to the moose which has a key item stuck in his horns, pick up a stone to dive deeper on the pond — right actions are logical and evident, like the game world itself. Below the surface though there is another layer, not physical, but mythological in nature.The tales or rets, an ancient tribe inhabited Alps long time ago isn’t exactly a key to what’s happening on the screen. It’s an optional vignette, a reward for the patient player. You can finish the game paying no attention to the messages on the runestones, and then the giant foxes will remain just an exercise in design. The statues that you’ll assemble from the broken pieces will stay nothing but a method to open a new path. But aren’t you curious about what they actually mean?Forest inhabitants live their own lives paying little to no attention to the player who in their eyes is just another harmless and insignificant part of the world.Secrets of Rætikon doesn’t follow the path of usual expansiveness of metroidvanias. Instead the game sticks to the bare minimum that would be sufficient for a compact, tight and intense adventure. The number of shards in the game’s world is the exact amount that you need to activate all the altars. Seven resulting fragments will be used to start the mechanism at the center of the labyrinth. The world will collapse and transform into an unbreakable circle leaving you dumbfounded. Initially developers planned to make a trilogy out of the concept, but the concept was scrapped. So it’s an open finale which you can interpret freely.			"

												Well I think that this is a pretty good game. The graphics are beautiful and just the whole idea of the game is just very creative. The controls are very simple and effective. The gameplay is very free, and fun. There is of course a story but you are free to just do your own little things alongside it. There is never really any need to rush. It is a very simple game. There are no levels, or stats but every now and then, there are enemies guarding certain spot that you need to kind of find your way around. You basically fly around as a bird and collect these artifacts to put in one big temple and discover all these hidden passage ways with beautiful animations and... well i'll let you find out the rest for yourself.P.S.If you do not like slow, simple, creative, free, or non action games, do not get this game!Rating: 7.5/10			"

												The lack of means to defend yourself is frustrating, returning the triangle keys (or whatever one might refer to them as) is tedious as hell and no, there's no map screen even though the game desperately needs one.I was willing to overlook these failures as the art, music and controls stand strong. Like, really strong.That was until a key item for progress -- a bird totem head piece -- inexplicably fell and vanished into some unknown part of forest terrain, forever making completion of the game impossible.That Secrets of Raekiton was an Early Access title only adds further insult the matter. There is no reason, no excuse for such a commonly experienced, game-breaking bug to have made into the final release, completely unrecognized by the game's developer.In short: a complete and utter waste of nearly-tapped potential.

												Even though I enjoyed the visuals and concept of this game to a big extend, I can't recommend the game as a whole. The exploration is neat, but the world is too small. The little puzzles are fun to discover, but don't really go in depth either. The game relies on finding triangles, to turn into a bigger triangles and carry that triangle to the beginning of the game. The other animals act like annoyances in these segments. Especially when there's a flock of birds that steal and toss around the triangle like middle school bullies.3 hours is also a bit short, considering how slowly I played through it, and I even got lost for a while to find the final triangle. After that I witnessed the ending, which was a big non-sequitor instead of something that tied the world together.			"

												I thought that name would have some deeper meaning behind it and it somewhat does. It's based on the Roman province of Raetia, which used to be located right where I live and in fact the name is still widely used and synonymous with our people. And the game is in fact set in the alps, so there's little confusion as to what is meant. However I'm not sure what the secret that lies here should be because as far as I can tell there isn't one.I'd like to say that Secrets Of Raetikon is basically a cousin to FEZ, a highly stylized game with beautiful scenery and a gorgeous aesthetic built around collecting small pieces to either advance to the next area or form larger pieces that you need to collect as well to make the ending happen. But the reason I say it's only a cousin and not brother to FEZ is because it's nowhere near as good as FEZ. It's not a bad game per se, all the elements are there and work perfectly fine but what made FEZ interesting to me was the immense creativity put into building this world that seemed so utterly, soul-crushingly lonely in spite of the fact that the whole game looks absolutely awe-inspiring. Secrets Of Raetikon tries to do similar things with the what I title ""alien alphabet"", though in this case they're just variations on runes, but it just seems like less effort went into building this world as opposed to FEZ. The game lets you collect runes throughout the game in order to decrypt a variety of messages in the game but A) I never needed to collect the runes because I for one can actually read a couple of variants of Futhark (runic alphabet) and even if you can't, most letters are made similar enough to the modern Latin alphabet that you shouldn't have much trouble deciphering the messages (I had all the letters of the first message decrypted instantly and only needed to wait for other messages to see how the other runes looked to deduce what they stood for) and B) the messages are entirely pointless. They try to paint this ethereal picture of what is happening in the game but unfortunately, there's no story or plot to be found in this game. Again if I may return to FEZ, yes if you just play the game, collect all the cubes and get to the end, you're none the wiser, but that game is chock full of clues as to what this world is about, even though the first messages of that game delivered by the golden cube were a silly joke form Phil Fish, but you had to actually decrypt an entire alien language with no hints given, as well as a numeric system that isn't easily translatable to arabic numbers. Not to mention all the other secrets and absolutely insane puzzles that game features. Secrets Of Raetikon by comparison basically has one puzzle you have to solve about 4 times in the whole game, which is collecting pieces of broken statues and putting them back together in order to unlock something. And it just occurred to me that I haven't even talked about the gameplay yet. You play as a bird and fly around the levels and explore every last corner of the map because there are a variety of hidden sections masked as rock where you can actually fly through, so yeah, the secrets in this game are basically just hidden in plain sight with no thought required. However unlike FEZ, this game actually has other creatures, meaning different animals and not all of them are friendly. To defend yourself from them, you can pick up basically anything, including enemies, so you have ways of dispatching them by picking them up and throwing them into spikes or picking up thorny plants and smacking enemies with them. It's not that easy and it can get annoying at times because whenever you pick up one of the shards you need to bring back to the machine at the hub, all of the animals suddenly go berserk and want to take the shard away from you.Another problem is the fact that this game makes you backtrack an enormous amount because the machine isn't located at the center of the world so every time you unlock a new area you can't go there directly from the hub, no the world is basically laid out in linear order from left to right like any regular side-scroller, so to get back from one part, you have to traverse all the previous levels to get back and the lack of a map-screen makes it hard at times to remember where you've already been and if you forgot to do something in one place it can take a while to remember where you have to go to get back to a certain place. Of the 3 hours it took me to beat this game, at least a quarter of that went into running back and forth and looking for level exits. Another problem I have is with the ending so spoiler alert:When you bring back shards to the machine, it unveils that it basically consists of cages with animals trapped inside them - the same type of animals you find in the whole game in fact. By the end, you have 7 cages filled with 7 animals and the game makes you kill all the trapped animals since their blood powers the machine, which is grim enough. But once you do and the machine powers up it just zooms into the machine, then the screen imitates an old CRT monitor and you're treated to a version of Pong. And once you lose, it tells you your score at Pong and rolls the credits. There's no closure to this here and once you go back into the game, all the animals have died in the place where they last were so you can now fly through a world filled with corpses. There are also two optional shards you can collect but one of them can only be found at the very end when you already almost beat the game, so I'm not sure why they included it. Maybe there's another secret hidden somewhere but once you collect those two you get a special power whereby you can suck everything in the world towards you. Don't know why and I'm not inclined to go back and investigate any more because in the end, I had limited fun with this game.Like I said, the overall aesthetic of the game is magnificent, but the final execution simply leaves a lot to be desired. I'm usually the guy who likes these artsy pretentious games because they offer something different but in this case I'm really not satisfied with the result. And of course, and I know I sound like a broken record, but $10 for a 3 hour game where you really don't get to do much is simply too expensive. I bought the game somewhere else and paid less than that but I simply cannot recommend this game at full price for what it offers. Which is a shame because I was really looking forward to playing this when I saw gameplay trailers and screenshots.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but while it has some very strong elements, it also has a lot of game breakingly weak ones.On the positive side, it's obviously gorgeous; one of the biggest things the game has going for it is the environment, which is vibrant, beautiful and mysterious: it takes place in a natural setting populated by various animals and occasional relics from what seems to be a lost civilization (complete with coded messages to decipher).  You can interact with the many wild creatures in the game in various ways; some may attack you - others simply follow you, or alternatively run away from you.  But most importantly, if left to themselves they run around seemingly going about their lives, making the world feel very alive, and not centered on the player, as in many video game worlds.However, I found the gameplay to be primarily frustrating.  The main goal of the game is to pick up all of the little magic yellow bits that are floating throughout the world.  Once you've gotten enough, you can use them to open doors to new areas or unlock one of the seven odd, musical machine pieces, which you need to put into a large machine that you find near the beginning of the game.  Furthermore, while the map is fairly complicated (there are many little tunnels and secret paths), it is also fairly linear on a larger scale.  And you are not provided with a map of any kind, or teleportation, and dying brings you back to the beginning.  You can see where this is going.  I found this game to be pretty difficult (I've heard that the keyboard controls don't work as well as a controller, so maybe that's why), and I died frequently.  I spent by far the majority of my time trekking back and forth between one end of the map and the other.  However, even if you don't die ever, you need to go all the way back to the beginning each time you pick up a new musical machine piece, and then trek all the way back out.  That is basically the whole game; walking down a path, picking up a piece, walking back, putting it in.  Repeat (except the next piece is further away).  Additional gameplay comes from (a) environment exploration, which granted, is very nice, (b) wildlife attacking you, and (c) things trying to grab the musical machine pieces from you.  The latter I found to be extremely annoying, and often so difficult to overcome that I gave up for days or months at a time.  In the end, I actually never got the final musical machine piece back to the machine, and ended up watching the ending on youtube instead.Which brings me to the ending.  I won't say what it is, but I will say that it was bad.  The premise of the ending was interesting (after I read what the premise was according to the game makers, because the ending did not convey it at all).  Some elements of the ending were very striking.  But all together, it did not convey it's message and it was confusing as hell.  You really weren't sure if it was over, or if there was something else you were supposed to do to get an ending that made sense, or what.Another major shortcoming is that it is possible to back yourself into a corner.  First, it is possible to spend your magic yellow bits in such a way that you won't have enough to open one of the later doors (I think this may be a ""bug"" that they fixed).  Second, there is a way to get through a certain type of difficult terrain later in the game (don't want to spoil it), but if you drop your tools while doing so, you can get stranded... and there is literally no way to get out, other than editing your save file manually.  This is not like a niche problem either, like this is something you probably will do at least once when you play the game.Overall, this game is lovely, and the exploration part is strong, but gameplay and quality of life features are lacking.

												Got one of the crystals I need to proceed, A bird flew into me and took the crystal. I grabbed the bird (with the crystal) and flew into the next area and the crystal dissapeared. It's not back where I found it or anywhere on the way. Nice art style, poor execution. Camera is really jerky and there's a lot of lag issues from time to time.			"

												Nice graphic design and sound design. Unfortunately, both combat and puzzling is a little frustrating. The atmosphere of the game makes it worth to continue though - interest piqued by the cryptic stone tablets  littering the forest, you want to know what the Secrets really entail in the end...... Unfortunately, the ending is not only non-explanatory, it is completely non sequitur, and one of the most dissatisfactory video game endings I have ever played through to.			"

												This game had incredibly beautiful landscapes and interesting mechanics and was up to a point, inviting to play, even relaxing for a short period. Sadly that is where the few good points about this game end. The seizure warning/flashes warning is incredibly easy to miss, so please be careful if that is an issue for you. Without a controller, it would be extremely difficult to play, and it had no colour blind options which made it almost impossible to find all the ""runes"" which then need you translate things manually. I am not sure what the creators of this game were aiming for regarding the story, but the outcome is incredibly bleak and not well executed. After spending hours playing through its beautiful landscapes, I deliberately delayed the end so I could decode the runes in an attempt to understand the actions of my bird. It felt like there was supposed to be a meaning behind it all. However I was left feeling incredibly cheated, there is no grand explanation or even a simple message to this game, and the ending felt thrown together. It was like watching Neon Genisis Evangelion or Donnie Darko as a grown up and realising that it isn't at all profound. While I think the designers were attempting to make something meaningful, they have sadly produced something pretty, depressing and not very enjoyable. If you want to play something attractive and don't mind gruesome and morbid endings, go for it. However playing this game is like putting Fern Gully in a blender fair warning!			"

												This is game has the potential to be great. From what I've heard, this is the first of 3 planned chapters, so I do hope that they're successful enough to release the next 2. The flying is perfect, the physics are functional, the art style is beautiful, and the minimalist story is intruiging.However, there are some issues. Firstly is the lack of map. For such complex and somewhat confusing level design, the lack of a  Metroid-style map is absurd. Secondly is the lack of combat options and the surprisingly unforgiving nature of the game. Why is there a healthbar? Why is there death? It can be exceedingly frustrating to be mobbed by a band of mockingbirds 5 or 6 screens in while you're carrying a crystal, only to find yourself restarting at the very first screen. I personally recommend a certain mod, Gentle Raetikon, which you can find on the workshop. It goes a long way to addressing that issue in particular. The third and final problem is the ending. I don't want to spoil anything, but it sucks big time. I can understand it if it's part of a larger set of games, but pong? really?.TL;DR it's a game I recommend playing, but it needs Gentle Raetikon installed, and it can be very frustrating due to its lack of map and terrible ending			"

												If anything, this game is ABSOLUTELY beautiful and stunning from the environment to each characters you find in exploring each areas. Although it gets progressively irritating as you try to get through completing the main task to find animals that you found adorable in the first place had suddenly became a whole nest of menace. Throughout some comments I've read up about the amount of disappointment in the ending from some players, I do think that they do get the emotional response out from me just effectively and the beauty of the game makes it up for the entirety of this game (grammar A+).Absolutely beautiful, as long as you don't mind getting 1 pong, because I did.

												A beautiful platformer where you play a bird and collect items. It is short (about 2-3 hours) but sweet.   The games is additionally a platform for creating your own levels or games, as it comes with an editor to do so.  But as far as the game itself is concerned it is pretty fun. Only complaint is the nature of the goals in the game are repetitive and also there is no world map, which forces you to memorize the world layout. All that said, its worth trying.			"

												This game has a lot going for it. The art is brilliant, the gameplay is intuitive, the concept is exciting. I played for about a half hour when I first got it, but when I went back the game would not open. After a couple of uninstalls and reinstalls and attempts to follow instructions on the forums, I realized that, since it ran the first time but not again, my changes to the settings were the problem (even those that were supposed fixes). Resetting and running on the base settings solved everything.The exploration and puzzle aspects of the game are great. But the mythology feels really tacked-on. Simple hints are available in the pdf manual, but not in the game (e.g. collecting 100 blue orbs gets you a life. extra lives mean you don't spawn back to the center point.). By the second shard, I was completely bored by the fetch-and-carry aspect, especially with persistant enemies which are faster than you but that you cannot fight off. This in concert with what I have heard of the ending make this one game that I wouldn't recommend. There are definitely cool things about this game, but I honestly think they are outweighed. "

												This is a game reminiscent of old school NES games, with modern day visuals. There are some hints, so you are not completely lost at what to do, but most of this game is about discovering what you are able to do and what you need to do. I feel like I need to draw a map while playing this game, though, because I have no idea where I am going. I also played for what I felt was a long time and I was getting kind of bored. If you are interested in just being thrown into a game, having no idea what to do, and just figuring it out as you go, then this game is pretty good. I was having fun, until it got annoying and frustrating to do what I needed to do. Some people enjoy when games are frustrating, but I do not.			"

Raetikon is a short, beautiful, subtly (and dramatically) poignant statement of a game.It is entertaining, but will not deliver any overt sense of accomplishment, even upon completion. I think although maybe a hair off in execution, that is wonderful, but know that your reward will be a series of thoughts and feelings rather than a shot of dopamine and a pat on the back for rescuing the princess or stopping the communists.It's similar to Fez in the sense that you're dropped into a world and hinted into completing a quest of collecting things to unlock other things in order to collect more things, all the while exploring and wondering what exactly you're doing, why, and to what end.The gameplay however, is unique. You're a bird(man?) and in essence all you can really do is traverse the environment and manipulate it the way a bird would. You flap and fly and dive, and you can grab things to pull or lift or turn them. If you encounter an unfriendly bird, there's no special power with which to thwart it, no aiming and hitting A to attack. If you'd like that bird dead, you'll need to manage to grab it, hold onto it, and fly in a fashion that manages to hurl it into the ground or some hazardous object. Again and again. Plus, animals you kill stay dead, there is no respawning (except for you.) There's something about the difficulty and lack of abstraction of the combat system that really adds to the game's point and feel. Beyond bird on bird crime, you might manipulate the populations of the different areas by returning eggs to their nest to hatch or bringing a pairs of rabbits together, providing additional targets and an advantage for yourself.Beyond mechanics, exploration is the real name of the game, and it is wonderful to explore. The art is quite cool, the system of animals interacting is fun to observe (and/or disrupt,) plus plenty of fun nooks and hidden passages to find, though none overly difficult. There is no map in the game, but not having one to refer to does a good job of forcing you to focus on your surroundings. The world is also small enough that you'll be able to sort it out in your head with time.Speaking of time, you're looking at a 2 - 3 hour game, unless you hit a major snag or bug of some sort. A good romp through the world, ending before the mechanics get stale. The game isn’t particularly difficult, though there are a couple tricky segments. It's probably good for a second playthrough, given some of the things you might discover towards the end of your first, but there is no 'new game+' in the strict sense.It’s worth noting that you really ought to play with a controller, and the game can still glitch. The developer is pretty proactive, however, and frequently will personally fix your glitched save file if you bring it up in the forums or email them. I wound up editing my own save file due to a glitch, but was actually able to do so fairly easily and am none too put off by it, though your mileage may vary.Overall, I think it’s quite the game, and would recommend it, particularly if it’s on sale. If you are looking for an otherwise traditional indie eyecandy platformer, this might not be your cup of tea, but if you have an open mind about games and think you might enjoy flapping around a brightly colored origami ecosystem, you’ll be in for a treat.

												This unconventional free-flying 2D action/puzzle/exploration indie game has quite a few good things going for it with the occasional flaw but overall a worthwhile experience.The good:1. Astoundingly beautiful, both still and in motion. Both the visuals and sound effects are excellent, the music was very fitting but did not particularly strike me as being memorable.2. Smooth flying and generally peaceful exploratory gameplay with the occasional bit of stress when there's a fight you need to waggle out of (you cannot directly attack opponents but need to time grabbing them and/or environment objects to disable them) - there's a caveat mentioned in the bad below.3. Interesting puzzles and setting, the story is not explained in depth but enough is said to build your own interpretationThe bad:1. There are some rare bugs involving getting stuck in the environment. You can literally fly almost anywhere there is even a small crack so sometimes you can get stuck but thankfully there is a simple workaround described in the community guides here. This also works for a case I encountered where I had insufficient shards and could not progress as there were no more available in the areas accessible to me (the game was expecting a different completion order) but I got around the problem with said fix.2. The ending is both shocking and lackluster, this was supposed to be a trilogy but insufficient sales killed off the sequels so the end here was rushed to a closure. Ignoring this, the mystery of the rest of the game is worth experiencing.This is a game for people loving nature, exploration and a good (if somewhat vague) mystery. Sure, it may seem short but at the price it's worth going for.			"

												I thought that name would have some deeper meaning behind it and it somewhat does. It's based on the Roman province of Raetia, which used to be located right where I live and in fact the name is still widely used and synonymous with our people. And the game is in fact set in the alps, so there's little confusion as to what is meant. However I'm not sure what the secret that lies here should be because as far as I can tell there isn't one.I'd like to say that Secrets Of Raetikon is basically a cousin to FEZ, a highly stylized game with beautiful scenery and a gorgeous aesthetic built around collecting small pieces to either advance to the next area or form larger pieces that you need to collect as well to make the ending happen. But the reason I say it's only a cousin and not brother to FEZ is because it's nowhere near as good as FEZ. It's not a bad game per se, all the elements are there and work perfectly fine but what made FEZ interesting to me was the immense creativity put into building this world that seemed so utterly, soul-crushingly lonely in spite of the fact that the whole game looks absolutely awe-inspiring. Secrets Of Raetikon tries to do similar things with the what I title ""alien alphabet"", though in this case they're just variations on runes, but it just seems like less effort went into building this world as opposed to FEZ. The game lets you collect runes throughout the game in order to decrypt a variety of messages in the game but A) I never needed to collect the runes because I for one can actually read a couple of variants of Futhark (runic alphabet) and even if you can't, most letters are made similar enough to the modern Latin alphabet that you shouldn't have much trouble deciphering the messages (I had all the letters of the first message decrypted instantly and only needed to wait for other messages to see how the other runes looked to deduce what they stood for) and B) the messages are entirely pointless. They try to paint this ethereal picture of what is happening in the game but unfortunately, there's no story or plot to be found in this game. Again if I may return to FEZ, yes if you just play the game, collect all the cubes and get to the end, you're none the wiser, but that game is chock full of clues as to what this world is about, even though the first messages of that game delivered by the golden cube were a silly joke form Phil Fish, but you had to actually decrypt an entire alien language with no hints given, as well as a numeric system that isn't easily translatable to arabic numbers. Not to mention all the other secrets and absolutely insane puzzles that game features. Secrets Of Raetikon by comparison basically has one puzzle you have to solve about 4 times in the whole game, which is collecting pieces of broken statues and putting them back together in order to unlock something. And it just occurred to me that I haven't even talked about the gameplay yet. You play as a bird and fly around the levels and explore every last corner of the map because there are a variety of hidden sections masked as rock where you can actually fly through, so yeah, the secrets in this game are basically just hidden in plain sight with no thought required. However unlike FEZ, this game actually has other creatures, meaning different animals and not all of them are friendly. To defend yourself from them, you can pick up basically anything, including enemies, so you have ways of dispatching them by picking them up and throwing them into spikes or picking up thorny plants and smacking enemies with them. It's not that easy and it can get annoying at times because whenever you pick up one of the shards you need to bring back to the machine at the hub, all of the animals suddenly go berserk and want to take the shard away from you.Another problem is the fact that this game makes you backtrack an enormous amount because the machine isn't located at the center of the world so every time you unlock a new area you can't go there directly from the hub, no the world is basically laid out in linear order from left to right like any regular side-scroller, so to get back from one part, you have to traverse all the previous levels to get back and the lack of a map-screen makes it hard at times to remember where you've already been and if you forgot to do something in one place it can take a while to remember where you have to go to get back to a certain place. Of the 3 hours it took me to beat this game, at least a quarter of that went into running back and forth and looking for level exits. Another problem I have is with the ending so spoiler alert:When you bring back shards to the machine, it unveils that it basically consists of cages with animals trapped inside them - the same type of animals you find in the whole game in fact. By the end, you have 7 cages filled with 7 animals and the game makes you kill all the trapped animals since their blood powers the machine, which is grim enough. But once you do and the machine powers up it just zooms into the machine, then the screen imitates an old CRT monitor and you're treated to a version of Pong. And once you lose, it tells you your score at Pong and rolls the credits. There's no closure to this here and once you go back into the game, all the animals have died in the place where they last were so you can now fly through a world filled with corpses. There are also two optional shards you can collect but one of them can only be found at the very end when you already almost beat the game, so I'm not sure why they included it. Maybe there's another secret hidden somewhere but once you collect those two you get a special power whereby you can suck everything in the world towards you. Don't know why and I'm not inclined to go back and investigate any more because in the end, I had limited fun with this game.Like I said, the overall aesthetic of the game is magnificent, but the final execution simply leaves a lot to be desired. I'm usually the guy who likes these artsy pretentious games because they offer something different but in this case I'm really not satisfied with the result. And of course, and I know I sound like a broken record, but $10 for a 3 hour game where you really don't get to do much is simply too expensive. I bought the game somewhere else and paid less than that but I simply cannot recommend this game at full price for what it offers. Which is a shame because I was really looking forward to playing this when I saw gameplay trailers and screenshots.			"

Raetikon is a short, beautiful, subtly (and dramatically) poignant statement of a game.It is entertaining, but will not deliver any overt sense of accomplishment, even upon completion. I think although maybe a hair off in execution, that is wonderful, but know that your reward will be a series of thoughts and feelings rather than a shot of dopamine and a pat on the back for rescuing the princess or stopping the communists.It's similar to Fez in the sense that you're dropped into a world and hinted into completing a quest of collecting things to unlock other things in order to collect more things, all the while exploring and wondering what exactly you're doing, why, and to what end.The gameplay however, is unique. You're a bird(man?) and in essence all you can really do is traverse the environment and manipulate it the way a bird would. You flap and fly and dive, and you can grab things to pull or lift or turn them. If you encounter an unfriendly bird, there's no special power with which to thwart it, no aiming and hitting A to attack. If you'd like that bird dead, you'll need to manage to grab it, hold onto it, and fly in a fashion that manages to hurl it into the ground or some hazardous object. Again and again. Plus, animals you kill stay dead, there is no respawning (except for you.) There's something about the difficulty and lack of abstraction of the combat system that really adds to the game's point and feel. Beyond bird on bird crime, you might manipulate the populations of the different areas by returning eggs to their nest to hatch or bringing a pairs of rabbits together, providing additional targets and an advantage for yourself.Beyond mechanics, exploration is the real name of the game, and it is wonderful to explore. The art is quite cool, the system of animals interacting is fun to observe (and/or disrupt,) plus plenty of fun nooks and hidden passages to find, though none overly difficult. There is no map in the game, but not having one to refer to does a good job of forcing you to focus on your surroundings. The world is also small enough that you'll be able to sort it out in your head with time.Speaking of time, you're looking at a 2 - 3 hour game, unless you hit a major snag or bug of some sort. A good romp through the world, ending before the mechanics get stale. The game isn’t particularly difficult, though there are a couple tricky segments. It's probably good for a second playthrough, given some of the things you might discover towards the end of your first, but there is no 'new game+' in the strict sense.It’s worth noting that you really ought to play with a controller, and the game can still glitch. The developer is pretty proactive, however, and frequently will personally fix your glitched save file if you bring it up in the forums or email them. I wound up editing my own save file due to a glitch, but was actually able to do so fairly easily and am none too put off by it, though your mileage may vary.Overall, I think it’s quite the game, and would recommend it, particularly if it’s on sale. If you are looking for an otherwise traditional indie eyecandy platformer, this might not be your cup of tea, but if you have an open mind about games and think you might enjoy flapping around a brightly colored origami ecosystem, you’ll be in for a treat.

												Some time after I got this game I had the chance to play it as it should be played, on big screen with a controller. It is beautiful but it is also annoying after the first two hours. The ending is a bit of anticlimactic also (and it almost broke my screen). I really don't know if I should recommend it, so I will go with no, having in mind that I am a huge ""And Yet It Moves"" fan and I had big expectations.			"

												The origami-type artwork in this game is really something different and I've gotta say it alone makes me recommend the game. I've never seen anything like it and I don't think I'll ever forget it. The game itself is a fun thing to pour 4 or 5 hours into. It's very short and once you beat it there's really no reason to go back and play in the world any longer. The enemies could definitely be very frustrating to deal with since there is no attack button, but that just means you have to think of more creative ways to deal with them. Overall this was a relaxing and peaceful puzzle game and I really loved coming across the different animals. I would advise not playing it all in one sitting or you'll probably become too focused on how frustrating the lack of map can be rather than the beauty and fun of the exploration.			"

												Originally, I was unable to play Secrets of Raetikon because my old computer was ridiculously slow. After upgrading and moving all my games over, it played fine.The first thing is the art. Secrets of Raetikon is a gorgeously different game, with elements that bring you back to the ""good days"" of gaming. I personally had no trouble with the game mechanics. I rarely found it difficult or frustrating to move around in the game. Others have complained that the birds stealing cores from you made the game unplayable; I disagree. I thought it was a fun challenge that was not overly difficult. And yes; the ending is messed up.I enjoyed this game. I found it entertaining and a good way to spend a day.			"

												Secrets of Rætikon is almost a good game.  The art style is absolutely gorgeous.  It really gives a good sense of some hidden fallen world that has been overrun by nature.  Additionally the core feeling of flight was nailed down perfectly.  Just being able to fly around and pick things up is actually quite a joy.  Being able to fly around the areas and explore the little nooks and crannies that have little secrets hidden in them is really fun.Then there is the rest of the game.  The core gameplay loop is that you go around and collect little gems.  You then find a machine that you put the gems in.  When you’ve put enough gems in the machine it then gives you a bigger gem that you need to drag back to the central hub and put it into a great machine.  While doing this, every single animal tries to steal the item away from you and prevent you from putting it into the machine.  This would probably be somewhat tolerable, except that there is really only one path connecting all of these machines so instead of the big machine acting as say a hub that then links you to different areas, you end up going through the same areas over and over in excessive backtracking that wears on you and becomes monotonous after a while.There is a backstory written on little rune stones that are located throughout the world, but the runes are somewhat obnoxious to read.  They are just written in a strange font and so you have to go around and collect items that tell you which character is which English character.  When you read the rune stones though all it does is put up the font conversions on the side of the screen so you still have to manually go through and look up the letters to figure out what was written.  It becomes very annoying after a while especially because most of the rune stones don’t have anything very interesting to say.Lastly there is the ending.  Without spoiling it, I will say that the game ends on a pretty forced message that makes you question why the developers even decided to make this game in the first place if that was their point, because obviously they don’t respect you playing it.  Though even then that might just be what I think that they are trying to say because the execution is pretty poor.Which I guess is the best way to describe Secrets of Rætikon.  Some good ideas.  A few executed very well, but the majority executed quite poorly into a wholly unsatisfying experience.			"

												The way that your character is completely helpless against various enemies, and the fact that they can easily deal damage to you over and over and over again while health restores are non-renewable, made the game too hard for my poor reflexes.Getting beaten into ground by enemies was made worse by the ""you're low on health"" sound that starts playing when you drop to 50% health, which would be pretty much excessive in any kind of game.Despite other interesting elements (interesting and intuitive control scheme, beautiful graphics and relaxing music), getting thoroughly stomped by enemies I can't reasonably ever beat made me lose any interest in the game after 50 minutes.

												I really wanted to like this game; it's so beautiful and has some great exploration moments, but the focus on combat and the super-aggressive animals pretty much ruin it for me. I feel like it tries to be two very different games at the same time—an exploration game and a physics-based combat game—and I wish it was just one or the other.Second, even as an exploration game, it fails in that the language you are supposed to ""decode"" is LAUGHABLY EASY TO READ without collecting any of the ""glyphs"" that are supposed to ""enable"" you to read it. Very disappointing. I guess they were afraid to make that part of the game challenging, but they thought tons of annoyingly hard combat was fine?? I mean, I don't want to be rude to the developers, but I seriously do not understand the choice here. Either it's an enciphered writing system or it's not...you can't really have it both ways.Go play FEZ instead :pAlso, I agree with this review: https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/246680/ "

It sometimes was really difficult and in the beginning I felt a bit left alone because I didn't know what to do at all.It's too bad that the end of the game was really bad. I looked around for alternative ends and comments that may help. I know now what the intention for this end was, but I don't like that I didn't have another chance or that I didn't knew beforehand what I was doing exactly there...

												NOTE: If you end up not purchasing this title, I encourage you to read the last spoilered-out part of this review, which deals with the, in my opinion, worthy and relevant message of the game.The game begins with your bird-character falling from the sky into a gorgeusly rendered forest. Apart from a few tutorial messages explaining the controls, you aren't told anything about what you're expected to do. You will soon find out that you are supposed to collect slivers, which you can turn into crystals at shrines, and then bring the crystals back to your base. During your journey you can collect runes that will help you translate ancient tablets (although it is quite easy to translate them even without getting the runes).  It looks like everything is in place to make this an enjoyable exploration-based experience.And then you start encountering enemies, who promptly show you who is the boss in this forest. Unlike you they have reliable attacks and can move around much more gracefully. Your character has no reliable way of fighting (you can try dropping stuff on your enemies or luring/dragging them into thorns). Evasion won't work 100% of time either, since you seem to have a much clumsier ""flight model"" than your adversaries, who will often be coming at you from several angles and are about as fast as you (not to mention that you will often be carrying objects, which slow you down considerably). The biggest problems by far are the magpies, who will try to snatch away the crystals you're carrying. It's a nightmare to get the crystal back from them, and to get out of their range before they steal it again truly requires the stars to align. The developer recommends using a controller for this game, but even while using one, I was fuming with anger and frustration. I can't imagine playing this game on a keyboard. The levels seem to be designed with maximum frustration in mind as well, with wind and other obstacles getting into your way just when you need every bit of speed you can muster. It doesn't help that you will have to deal with the same challenges everytime you're backtracking home with a crystal, which makes the game extremely tedious.About halfway through the game I've started thinking about what snarky review I was going to write. I came up with: ""Pros: Will make you go out into the woods; Cons: in order to horribly maim and murder woodland creatures and burn it all down."" Then came the ending, in which you kill all the animals in the world and use their life force to power a game of Pong. I guess it was designed to make the player feel shocked or ashamed, but it just ended up being cathartic, because the damned magpies and lynxes had it coming. I felt a bit sorry for the foxes, they were super chill.Fortunately, I wasn't furious enough with the woodland creatures to miss the message of the game. The people complaining about the brutality and ""senselessness"" of the ending  have actually missed it in the most ironically hilarious of ways. See, the animals in real world don't deserve to die nowhere near as much as the vermin in this game, yet we still ravage the Earth and their habitats in order to produce equipment and energy for such banal things like playing videogames. While this probably won't stop me from playing videogames, it also applies to many other human activites, which may seem insignificant by themselves, but cumulatively definitely have an impact on our environment – do we really NEED to burn candles, have fireworks, race cars, etc., when we know what effects it has? It's just a shame that the game nurtures your hatred toward the virtual animals to such a degree that you will more likely be pumping your fists in triumph, rather than contemplating what had just transpired.

												If anything, this game is ABSOLUTELY beautiful and stunning from the environment to each characters you find in exploring each areas. Although it gets progressively irritating as you try to get through completing the main task to find animals that you found adorable in the first place had suddenly became a whole nest of menace. Throughout some comments I've read up about the amount of disappointment in the ending from some players, I do think that they do get the emotional response out from me just effectively and the beauty of the game makes it up for the entirety of this game (grammar A+).Absolutely beautiful, as long as you don't mind getting 1 pong, because I did.

												I write this review with mixed emotions. Raetikon is a beautiful game with a slightly tedious but vibrant world. The art, sound and music are top notch and the game mechanics are simple in a fun way. After flying back and forth completing your fetch quest, you are rewarded with... the ending... which I'm so conflicted about. Reading the forums, the devs basically want you to think about the impact of humanity on nature and question your own morality on whether killing in one context any more justified than another. The problem though is that there is no context what-so-ever to the overall goal of the game and the runes which you can translate don't explain any lore reasoning. There is also a pacifist achievement which flies in the face of that message. The execution was done extremely poorly and the credits sequence is a slap to the face on top of a kick to the balls. I can only recommend this game for the art and would avoid any future games by this developer if they think this is the way to write a story.			"

												The exploration and flight are pretty fun, but several of the animals are highly agressive and your lack of combat options make this more frustrating than challenging. Also, it's fairly easy to mismanage your crystal shards and reach a point where you can't progress without backtracking to the tutorial area and finding a hidden passage that has no indication exists.The biggest issue is the ending, which doesn't make sense within the context of the game. SPOILER: You murder a bunch of caged animals then you play pong. Forum posts from the dev seem to indicate that the ending does have a message you're supposed to reflect on, but the abruptness and confusion of it just left me cold.			"

												You can't see around you. You can't steer easily. You can't move quickly without mashing constantly. The enemies come from offscreen at lightning speed to grab you and drag you away. Avoiding them is not fun. Getting caught by them is not fun. The controls are not intuitive and cannot be changed. (q to grab, s to chirp, e to dive, w to spew silver)  Collecting items isn't fun. Ferrying objects from place to place is not fun. What you can fly through and what you crash into isn't clear and sometimes purposefully obtuse. What you can move and what you can break is not clear. There is no map. In the tutorial I was taught (very unclearly) what activating a tower would do. After the tutorial I activated a tower but it didn't do what I was taught towers do. I have no idea what activating that tower did. An arrow pointing to where go next is not a subsitute for game design that shows what to do next by making sense, or level design, or lighting, or curiousity. Items can be carried around and dropped where they will never be found again. I hope they aren't vital. Wind will blow through solid objects. The game is 2d and yet crashes on startup on my laptop. I am not surprised to hear other reviews say you will have to backtrack constantly to carry one object at a time to the same location over and over again.			"

												While the art is gorgeous and the controls are nice and responsive, the lack of clear direction was more than a little frustrating at times, and only ten minutes in (at the end of the tutorial section) I found what is either a game breaking bug or a part so obtuse it looked like a game breaking bug, I can't say for sure. Either way, it's obvious to me this game lacks a lot of polish and play testing. Even if my bug wasn't actually a bug, the game still has issues that made it hard to enjoy. One moment in the tutorial needed almost perfect control to get right - a big ask for players at the very start of the game - and a lot things were very poorly explained, or not explained at all. Some mystery is fine, but when I genuinely can't tell if the game is broken or just confusing, that's a problem.I really wanted to like this game - it's beautiful, and the flying controls are solid and very satisfying - but the actual game part of this game doesn't seem very well made.
