												Unlike all the ""Buckle yo pants"" Reviews that are funny but useless to a guy who dont know this gameThis review will be different and aim for the game itself hopefully you'll read First i wanted to say i considered myself so lucky because i was able to join the beta test, honestly i wouldnt have been able to wait the games full release.This is a 4 Player online platformer that has a great mechanism in controls and really addictive and easy to pick up on.The game has 2 Player Co-op Adventure mode, Or 4 In Arena mode.Adventure mode can either be normal or INSANE ( insane mode, is one death mode basically)The game can be pretty brutal in some stages with insane mode.Arena mode Targets 2v2 team and has a lot of great endless fun modesCapture the Fla... Horse .. its called capture the horse which is same as CTF but a horse that looks like a piece of walking candy, and even more funOr Basketball which is my personal favorite and its something you wont play just once : )And a lot more Modes from soul catcher ( Kill and get their souls) To ""Grab the gold""  9 Different fun modes.The mechanism of the game makes it possible to do a great teamwork in adventure mode.You can pick up your friend and throw him or he just simply jumps on your head to reach a high place and then lifts you up to join him, or use a weapon to blast your friend to a certain places, and just be creative with what you wanna do :).A huge selection of weapons and faces, ( You can make your own face and put it in game folder for everyone to see)the game is basically Get the (Certain number) of Gems in each level and reach the end in the best time ( And the hidden yarn ball ) Gems buys you Faces, Yarn balls buys Weapons.WITH! the ability to Trade them in-game or in steam trading system, or even sell them on steam market.Which is a good feature because you cant buy a certain thing you just buy and the outcome is random.Each weapon is different and has a different use and great ways to make combos with.You can either play good to finish, play dirty team killing, or see who can reach the end first.Some levels however relies on teamwork cant afford to be selfish there.With this ADORABLE looking graphics and soundtracks fun can never end, They made it even more fun by making Level Editor to make your own levels/playlists of levels, arenas or whatever the hell you want to make.Steam workshop was definitely a great feature for the steam version.THIS Game has the FUNNIEST STORY I have ever seen in a video game, Every Cut scene you will be a FOOL to skip it because its just ... too .. funny and perfect with that amazing narrator.its sad that they asked that no one posts a review or livestream or a video while on beta, but everyone did anyway .... and so i tried to make this review as resourceful as possible, so people would actually get a clue of what this game is if they never heard of it before or was wondering about it.This game is worth every penny, watch some youtube commentary videos on its gameplay and decide for yourself :)A Few updates.they keep adding some special faces you can get by finishing every once and a while so its cooland for summer sales people are wondering if the game is worth playing just for singleplayer yes , i have maybe 20 hours stored only singleplayer playing this wonderful game alone is also fun and the levels changes when you play singleplayer to be set to solo mode ( Makes it possible to do everything solo ) and in multiplayer they are set for double so you need someone else to help you finish the level or you can also use the weapons to do it alone if you're good enough with them.So yeah its pretty much fun singleplayer grinding for faces and achievements is always fun : )hopefully you'll make the right choice and buy this and make sure you have friends to play with its more fun that way			"

												You know that point when you are mentally exhausted or slaphappy or a teenager?  That's usually when you want shut your brain off and play something amusing and stupid.  If you can find a buddy in a similar state, play this game together.   The trick to enjoying this game is to not take it seriously.  Learn to enjoy killing and being killed.  If you can pull that off, you will laugh until you cry.  Play for about an hour or so and then quit.  Come back another day when you both are out of it again.  Then just repeat this cycle.If you don't enjoy poop jokes, stay away.  If blowing youself up again and again makes you smile, this is the game for you.			"

												Once upon a time, in the land of Colorado,I was very bored, in fact I was just staring at my own shadow.That was until, my friend named DT,Said he had found the perfect game for me.""It's called BattleBlock Theater"" he said as if he was the creatorAnd I replied, ""Eh, I'll look at it later.""Soon later came, and I said with a sigh,""Let's get this over with so I can finish my pie.""After watching the two trailers, my mind was blown!Buying this game, I shall not postpone.I clicked the ""Buy Game"" button on the internet,and I zoomed through the PayPal process which is actually quite intricate.I waited for nothing and immediately installed,An adventure that assured I would soon be enthralled.Soon enough it was done, and I double-clicked on its name,Waiting impatiently for my brand new game.And just like that I was playing away!Staring deeply into my monitor's display.I was jumping, punching, and boating through any kind of weather,And best of all, me and DT were doing it together.So, I urge you to get out your money,And pay for this game whose humor is funny.I promise you, if you buy this you will not be disappointAs this game is amazing to no defined point.

												Amazing game. I honestly wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was, despite being a good fan of Castle Crashers.  The videos of it didn't look too terribly interesting, but lemme tell ya. This is definitely a game worth picking up. This game actually has much smoother framerate than the previous The Behemoth release on steam, Castle Crashers. It runs without a hitch, and without a framerate cap.I thought the voice acting of one of my personal vocal heroes was top-notch. (Definitely left a ""stamp""... Dohohohoho...) The jokes were often corny, but it was tightly written in kind of a ""I know this writing is bad, so I might as well go all out"" kind of way. Makes it feel very light-hearted which is much appreciated in this barrage of ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ another gray Call of Gooby.""The controls feel very tight, although I do actually find the combat to be rather clunky. However the combat isn't as important as the platforming aspects, which are top notch. The variation of weapons are also a plus. Speaking of variation, I have a lot of work ahead of me if I want to unlock all of those heads hahaha.The music fit the game nicely, and while it doesn't stand out, it is the perfect ambiance I need to push through and play in a ""zenned out"" state.I recommend this game to everyone who is into platformers. It's such a great game and you should not pass it up.			"

												Ok lets just start by saying that i love ""CASTLE CRASHER'S"" and even though this is by the same developer (The Behemoth) its not much like that game at all.Now when i say this i mean in a good way,even though castle crasher's is really good this is better and the sense of humour this game has is second to none.Let's get down to the brass tacs of the game,the graphic's really do this game justice and at time's its like having a leading role in a cartoon show with the cut scene's being nothing short of briliant and they had me in stitches,rolling round on the floor in absolute agony (the last cut scene in game is the best and the song that goes with it is pure comedy gold-reminded me of something i would hear ""MONTY PYTHON"" sing).SPOILER ALERT**IF YOU HAVENT GOT TO THE END YET AND DONT WANT TO SPOIL IT DONT WATCH THE FOLLOWING VIDEO**SPOILER ALERTBattleBlock Theater - Ending with Final Song! - YouTube

			This week marks the 10th anniversary of The Behemoth, so they're in turn reoffering the mascot chicken head prisoner. If you haven't already got him, simply load up BBT to score that awesome...		

The gameplay itself consists of taking on various level's (as you open up new part's of the prison---""SORRY THEATER"") and whilst doing so trying to collect all the green gem's and also the ball's of wool (this game does have cat's in so naturally ball's of wool-trust me it goes along with how nutty this game is),now you dont need to collect all of them in the level to get past it,no you just need to find three of them and then the lock opens and the exit is clear.But that is part of the fun of playing the game as you try to find all the gem's and ball's of wool to get that A++ rating for that level.As you progress through the game the challenge's on the level's get tougher and you end up having to pull of jump's and move's that have to be spot on for you to progress,now this doesnt matter on the normal level's but on the timed ones can cause you some absolute ""SCREAM OUT"" moments of pure frustration (honestly i didnt get like that-OH YES YOU DID-NO I DIDNT-YES YOU DID-OK I DID ALRIGHT),but this all add's to the charm of the game as you have that ""one last go"" moment which can last you for hours (trust me i KNOW).The sound in game is one of the highlight's also,and the narrator is one of the funniest thing's i have ever heard in a game in a long time (dare i say i will remember him as much as the narrator from BASTION) and the thing's he say's (his constant ""OH DEAR"" and other comment's as you die are hillarious) and the song's he sing's will stay with you for quite some time.BattleBlock Theater Development: Narration by Will Stamper ...

			http://www.battleblocktheater.com | Here is behind-the-scenes footage, shot in 2012 during the development of BattleBlock Theater, showing the recording sessions in the Whisper Room.		

Now the gem's you earn and the ball's of wool you find are used in game as currency for the thing's you will eventually find yourself buying.Gem's purchase head's and some of these are great and have had a lot of thought and some seem to be just after thought's,but trust me that ""POKEMON"" bug will grab you and you will find yourself wanting to ""GOTTA GET THEM ALL"" (see just like pokemon),the ball's of wool you trade to the cats (WELL THAT FIT'S DUH) for more weapon's and these all seem to play out slightly differently from the boomerang to the grenade they all work slightly differently than the last one did.Having finished the solo version of the game (and the later level's get really challenging-especially the timed one's),i moved on to the multiplayer side of the game.Now this seems to play out just like the solo game and that's what i thought until i realised that without the other person to back me up i would get no where (in some game's like this it doesnt really matter about working together but here it does).BattleBlock Theater - 4 player coop -

			This is some footage from the BattleBlock Theater beta testing, the following gameplay was played with a keyboard a 3 Xbox controllers. This isn't the full game, its only a beta.		

You see in co-op the challenge's are actually aimed at there being more than one player and try to play it solo and you will die and fail straight away.I will be playing it more in co-op now i have finished the solo game and find that this actually does add longevity to what is allready (in this reviewers opinion) a top notch and well developed piece of entertainment.Will you want to play this game,well answer the 2 following question's and you'll know.1 - Do you like game's to have a wicked sense of humour and consist of laugh out moment's ??2 - Are you prepared to loose hour's of your life as the bug grabs you and you must A++ that level no matter what ???If you answer yes to both then buy this fantastic game straight away and if not buy it anyway and trust me you will never and i mean ""NEVER"" regret it.(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEOS PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS AND ARE THEIRS BY COPYRIGHT)			"

												This game is, to put it simple: Hilarious.The story is told by Stamper, if anyone knows him, a guy with a great narrator voice as shown in the game. During the game he will pretty much tell you what is going on and what you shouldn't do: Dieing mostly.In cutscenes he will progress the story and tell you all kinds of things in a fun fashion.The gameplay is nothing that spectaculair but still really good. It's a puzzle platformer as much as it can be a platformer. In 2D, you will run, jump, ride and slide across blocks of various elements, collecting gems to open the exit. The difficulty progression is steady and with the amount of levels, the final ones will/can be really frustrating but certainly do-able.The music is happy and upbeat as the game itself and with the great visual style, jokes and voice-acting, I believe this is certainly a game looking into.Additionally, it has multiplayer, so you can even go nuts with your friends in existing or self-made levels!

												The Behemoth’s 2D platformer BattleBlock Theater is full of quirky humor (like in Castle Crashers which is also a Behemoth game).This game is not only for platformer-lovers. It's for all who like great entertainment, for gamers who love to play alone, for those who love to play coop, for the creative people and level builders, for the achievement hunters, the item collectors and people who want to own others! Humor:I really enjoyed the opening monologue and all the other little movies between some levels. You will also hear funny comments when you are playing. How to describe the jokes? I would say it’s a mix out of poop jokes with pop-culture references. About some jokes you will laugh and about other jokes you will raise your eyebrow. In harder levels when you are frustrated because you die so often the speaker also makes some taunting statements which motivate you or make you wanna find him and kill him. :o10/10Sound:Narrator: The narrator talks clearly and with a great accent. I’ve understood everything and my english isn’t the best. So he did his job very well! ^^Music: The songs are always convenient and make a funny, peaceful atmosphere. Settings: You can change the volume PLUS how much you want to hear from the talker.10/10Graphic:The game has an amazing quality of animation. Even too the characters have a simple design it’s still cute and clearly what they represent. It animates you to collect more characters in a curious, partial addicted way. And there are so many character styles to collect that everyone will fall in love with one! If you don’t get your favorite with your green diamonds you can also swap with other players.10/10Gameplay:You have so many possibilities and different game modes that you don’t know with what you should start. lol Seriously if you really want to do everything in the game with a perfect result you can spend aplenty of your time there. For example there is a storymode (playable on normal and insane difficulty) for singleplayer and a bit different one for coop where you have to throw your partner to some places or to pull him up. Sometimes you just have to jump on his head to reach a gem and sometimes you have to shoot him somewhere… which is really funny especially when your mate dies cause of an accident (stupidly). xD You can play features and levels made by other players. PLUS you also can create OWN LEVELS… There are no limits!Besides you can play with 2-4 players in the arena (choose a fast game or a special game mode). Some modes you can play versus other players: Capture the Horse (it’s like capture the flag in other games e. g. “Booster Trooper”), basketball, teamdeathmatch, soulcatcher and so on!In all game modes you can get ‘Gems’ and ‘Yarn balls’. With Gems you can buy faces, with yarn balls weapons. The weapons all make different stuff (e. g. freezing someone into an ice-cube) and different damage or they just blow the enemy away. There are also different ways to make combos with. So you can evolve your own tactic.For so many possibilities and no lags in multiplayer I give:10/10Tradesystem:You can see all your items (faces, weapons, gems, yarn balls…) in your INVENTORY in Steam. So you can make your trade in-game or with the steam trading system. Means even when you are out of the game you can send someone a trade offer about which items you want to swap. You can also sell some of the items (those which are marketable) or buy some of them. So also those who have no luck with the drops in the game can reach on every way what they want.That’s just awesome!10/10Conclusion:I am totally in love with this game and I highly recommend it! ♥			"

												BattleBlock Theater is an awesome, raging, hilarious, and strategic game. It is loads of fun and has a lot of levels. +Pros+Can get some cool heads+Cool design+Nice music+Can't finish in an hour or two+Multiplayer+Many game-modes+TWO ways to play the story+Nice weapons+Can trade with other players while In-Game-Cons-Last Act is extremely hard! (but is possible to beat) (this isn't really a con because who would want to play a game that was easy?)-Have to have an internet connection most of the time to save data-It gets kinda hard to get gems, not really hard just a little, very littleAchievementsAchievements are not hard(most of them). Also if you are having trouble there are tons of guides that can help you with one or all of them. There is one achievement that you can only get if you play with a friend/player who has it. BugsThere are no current bugs that I know of or have had any problems with. BattleBlock Theater also has full controller compatibility, or you could use your keyboard. The game runs extremely well on low end computers and PCs. Overall the game is super fun and is definitely worth its price. I hope you decide to buy it and have loads of fun playing it!			"

												FANTASTIC narrator, brilliant humor and writing, mediocre puzzle game. Many of the puzzles become way too tedious towards the end, especially the timed ones, and during the last level I got so bored I no longer wanted to finish it. The cutscenes are worth the asking price alone, so I still recommend this.			"

												BattleBlock Theater is an updated port of the XBLA version released on Xbox 360 in early 2013. The ""Steam version"" (as it likes to call itself) adds a wealth of Steamworks features, possibly the most of any game released so far, as well as a few gameplay and visual tweaks. These Steamworks features include Workshop for creating, sharing and downloading user-created levels, Inventory support for item trading, online multiplayer and SteamOS support just to name a few.The game comes from The Behemoth, who you may remember as being credited with Alien Hominid (as far as I am aware, the first example of a Newgrounds Flash game making a leap to a commercial gaming console) and more recently with Castle Crashers. Two well-received games under their belt and you’ll be happy to know that you can count BattleBlock Theater as their third.You control a miniature Pillsbury Doughboy lookalike, who along with his friends have crashed their “Friend-Ship” onto a mysterious island. Taken prisoner by a legion of insane cats inside a derelict theatre, you are made to run the various obstacle courses (formed of various blocks) and collect gems as you go, purely for their amusement.During the story mode, your goal is to run through 2D platforming stages, collecting any gems and balls of yarn you see as you go. Not only do these collectables contribute to your overall ranking and score for a stage, you can also spend them in the theatre gift shop. Spending gems will free your captive friends (and allow you to play as them) and the yarn, which is usually the trickiest item to find, can be spent on new weapons. Fitting with the crazy theme the game has going for it, weapons range from guns that fire top-hats, to marching frog dancers that explode. Both weapons and unlocked characters can be traded either in-game or through Steam’s own trading system.Your character comes equipped with the standard platforming skills. They can perform double-jumps, duck and slide to avoid unpleasant things happening to their head and a basic set of melee attacks for the odd occasion where a villainous feline blocks your path. As you progress, the stages become increasingly difficult and complex. The blocks you run and jump over may help you get from start to finish, but not all of them are helpful. Block with spikes, blocks of water (you can’t swim!) and even blocks that fire lazer beams will become more and more numerous as you advance through the 8 chapters the game offers, with 13 stages in each.The puzzles also increase in their level of dastardliness, requiring some extra precise jumps, timings for triggering certain switches that can open new paths or create bridges and some time-trial stages where time is certainly not on your side.The story is narrated by the absolutely wonderful voice of Will Stamper who manages to synergise his unique energy with the quirky and slightly demented theme the game has on display perfectly. Add to this that the majority of the spoken dialogue is exceptionally funny, it works wonders to break up the monotony of what would otherwise be a rather mundane platformer.The graphics are vivid and colourful, the animations fluid and adorable, capturing The Behemoth’s trademark style that is in itself a thumbs-up to the Flash games of yesteryear. Despite the trailer claiming near infinite FPS and resolution support (made in satire of the “PC master race” mostly), the game is locked to 60FPS and does not scale to non-standard resolutions such as ultra-widescreen displays… I am also guessing you shouldn’t take the “Oculus Rift support” seriously either.The audio mixes bouncy sound effects with a great soundtrack, with Will Stamper lending his vocals to a couple of the song “lyrics” for added hilarity. These are usually limited to the ends of chapters and bonus stages, so as not to overdo it.The campaign alone is rather lengthy, but being able to replay stages to get a better ranking, find missing treasures and unlock more goodies really adds to the replayability. To top it all off, there are plenty of great user-created levels to download and a comprehensive level editing suite included, as well as a special event list of downloadable levels released every Friday with a unique unlockable friend as a reward. There are also a heap of multiplayer modes, both competitive and co-op for up to 4 players. These range from classic “king of the hill” and “capture the flag” modes, to races and even basketball. Some fiddling with your firewall may be required to get the multiplayer working, though.BattleBlock Theater delivers a fantastic package of content that is both highly polished, well-paced and with enough variety to keep you coming back even when the main game is done and dusted. With its delightful audio/visual aesthetic and solid controls on both gamepad and keyboard, this is a platformer that anyone can enjoy.Pros:~Great presentation and consistently funny~Amazing value for the price~Well-balanced difficulty, suitable for all skill levels~Incredible number of Steam features supported~Developers still actively supporting the gameCons:~Multiplayer connectivity can be fiddly on certain routers and firewalls~Can’t rebind controller buttons (can rebind keyboard keys, though)			"

												You can kill other people with exploding frogs.11/10Serious review below, also posted verbatim on a sparse tumblr site[k3grs.tumblr.com] with a few accompanying images.---------As I type this, it is just past noon on June the 1st, 2014, and I’ve miraculously somehow managed to wipe my save data. It’s a real shame as I had played and finished the whole of Normal Mode story, and was exactly halfway through Insane Mode story. That data wipe has given me time to pause and think as I write this review.========================================================BattleBlock Theater is The Behemoth’s 3rd game release, and 2nd game (after Castle Crashers) to be released on Steam.The premise of the game is simple - you and your friends, including a certain Hatty Hattington, are shipwrecked on an island where there is a theater run by cats. Hatty is captured and forced…erm, bewitched…no wait, mind-controlled…you get the point…to become the theater in-charge, while you, along with 200+ prisoners, have to perform in the theater’s wide array of dazzling, death-defying, plays.The game is a fast-paced and frantic platformer. Comparisons to other platformers like Super Meat Boy become rather inevitable - both gradually introduce new tricks and mechanics, both have speed goals for each level, and both can get incredibly challenging.However, the similarities end there. For starters, as already mentioned above, BattleBlock Theater has at least 200 playable characters. Unlike SMB, all of them are purely aesthetic. However, it is rather fun for collectors to accumulate every single prisoner that is available. I’ve developed a rather fond attachment towards Aquarius and now use him regularly.Secondly, your character is able to utilise weapons to fight off enemy cat guards (fattened up for the Steam version! I find they look better too) that you will encounter in the levels. If my troll review did not already make it clear, my favourite is the FrogBomb - a moving proximity bomb that explodes when an enemy is near. Other weapons range from normal (Grenade) to outlandish (“Forceball”). Very varied and interesting types.Rather interestingly, all your BattleBlock Theater inventory is integrated with the Steam inventory. You can trade off your heads, weapons, gems and yarn (the last 2 being the currencies you spend) with other people, or sell off/buy the first two types in the Marketplace. A great way to earn some extra Steam wallet credit by selling off your spare weapons, AND a cut of every sale that takes place goes to The Behemoth too! :)Besides the solo story mode where you have to save Hatty, there is also multiplayer. While playing online, you can choose to play the co-op story or just smackdown random people in random arena modes.The game runs VERY well on my computer - the cutesy 2D hand-drawn art and animation is buttery smooth, I found no instance of lag whatsoever. Kudos to Dan Paladin, he has illustrated yet another hit. Sound effects and music are also rather soothing and energetic in equal measure. (The song that plays during the Finale in each stage is called Buckle Your Pants, composed by Newgrounds moderator Will Stamper, and is the source of all the “Buckle Your Pants” reviews on Steam - it made me feel that that was an over-used joke as a result.)Ohhhhh, but Stamper’s role in the game is not just that. Oh no. His main role in the game is as the voice of the Narrator, who tells the story and also acts as commentator in each of the games levels, giving (occasionally snarky) remarks whenever you die, or collect gems, or yarns, or…a whole bunch of stuff.Overall, this game is stunningly brilliant for such an indie development studio, I’d really recommend getting it if you can.When to buyWorth full price definitely, highest it's been discounted is 90% off (though not recently).9/10========================================================I hereby concluded the review on June 20, 2014, the start of the Steam Summer Sale, and by then I had already made enough funds from selling prisoner heads and immediately blow it on Castle Crashers. Now THAT is awesome.			"

												It took years for developer The Behemoth to put the finishing touches on its latest platforming masterpiece, and it’s easy to see why. While it would have been easy to simply rig up a basic menu and some customisation options to string all the levels together, The Behemoth has carefully crafted an outrageously humorous and addicting experience that will keep us entertained its next project is unleashed on the world.It’s not only surprising that BattleBlock Theater has a story that is more than an intro cutscene, but it’s surprising just how funny it manages to be at the same time. It's juvenile, but it's funny.The game's story follows Hatty Hattington who is shipwrecked on a mysterious island with hundreds of his close friends. Hatty is then taken captive by the island’s feline natives, and brainwashed to become their leader as his friends are forced to participate in deadly theater performances.This rather bizarre setup paves way for the hundreds of levels, which make up the majority of the game. Each level plays out on a theater stage, with catlike silhouettes creeping in the foreground, standing in for a ‘virtual’ audience.It’s ironic given how creative the setup is that the actual gameplay is simple, but what BattleBlock Theater might lack in novel mechanics and flashy gameplay is made up for with tight controls and excellent level design. Every level is laid out on what is essentially a grid, with various block types making up the floors and walls you maneuver your little avatar on.However, levels aren’t as simple as racing towards a finish line or taking out a certain number of enemies.Weapons, along with a standard repertoire of punches and kicks, can be used to defeat enemies, but to be honest, the fighting system never felt as tight as the platforming did.BattleBlock Theater wouldn’t feel right if you weren’t able to tackle the game with a friend by your side, and The Behemoth hasn’t forgotten its Castle Crashers roots. Playing the campaign solo works perfectly fine, but BattleBlock was designed with co-op in mind, and it shows.BattleBlock Theater feels like it was designed for the child that still lives inside me. It’s juvenile, colourful, and silly. But more importantly, it achieves everything it set out to do, with a near masterful level of execution. The addictive multiplayer and excellent level creation tools are just the icing on the cake.			"

												Where do I start. First things first, this game is HILARIOUS. I can't believe how much I laughed at the music, the presentation, and the jokes. There is so much fun to be had here. Customization is plentyful, you can collect various heads for your character, ranging from skulls, triangles, kings, and so much more. You can play with friends and create your own levels. It supports main game multiplayer co-op, two people couch coop, and you can also make your own stages, which is very fleshed out and extremely straightfoward.The main game is a puzzle platformer. You will probably fail a great deal. The stages are seperated and you can go back at any time. It will grade you on how many collectables you have obtained, if you died, and how fast you completed the stage. You can pick this up and play anytime for a short burst of fun.The music and graphics are stylized, bright colors and intresting charecters are abound. The music is a bit like a musical, where it describes what is going on with the story with humor and wit that I have not experienced in many games. Overall, there is nothing I'd change.I would give this game a 9/10. It is an experience you shouldn't overlook. It is likewise avaliable on console.			"

PROS:+ cool single player gameplay+ awesome(!) co-op gameplay+ nice art style+ plenty of jokes+ MANY unlockable character heads+ unlockable weapons+ user created levels and areasCONS:- some timed levels- you will get angry A LOT- stress from this game may shorten your lifeComment:I already played Castle Crashers from Behemoth and I liked that game so I went into this one hoping for the same. And I can happily say this game is heaps of fun! However, it is also heaps of rage. You will try to beat those levels over and over and over again. Some because they are timed, others for the best level grade. My advice is to get a gamepad for that because, while keyboard gameplay is okay, it hurts your fingers a lot more. There are 8 areas and each has 9 standard levels, 2 timed boss levels and 3 timed encore levels. You can even find some secrets levels. You can unlock some new weapons (for yarn) and character faces (for gems) along the way to finish each area. The story is funny and will entertain you with narration and videos. Playing alone is nice but where the game really shines is co-op play. The levels are somewhat changed in co-op to emphasize on teamwork of both players. The game is NOT easy, it will make you angry/frustrated a lot, escpecially in co-op play. I played this mostly with my sister and our stress levels were through the roof. After you are done with the base game there are TONS of user-created levels to play. They are of various quality but most are fun. I did not like arena matches that much but it is up to your preference. Overall a great quirky game for anyone who likes platformers!			"

												Great platformer. Fun addictive, the level design will want to make you keep playing as it is never repetetive. As the story goes on it does get harder and harder but never seemed to make me rage often. The story takes around ten hours to complete. Then there is the dozen modes available in the arena, I have tried out a few and so far versing the A.I probably isn't nearly as good as co-op. Almost forgot, the animation is great, most PC's should have no problem with running this game. I felt there was a good flow between levels, the art is also spot on. Overall a great clever game definitely worth the price.			"

												Genre - Cartoon Puzzle/ActionThis is by the same team who bought us Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers. The latter being a game I enjoyed massively with a few friends, get this on Steam if you haven't already and you get a knight's head! There is loads of humour mainly bought by the announcer and cut-scenes. The game is split into various levels involving blocks (as the name suggests) that do different things. You need to run around fight/dodge bad guys and navigate these block correctly. If you die you are simply teleported to the last chcekpoint. The difficulty comes in collecting all the gems or in some of the timed levels. There is multiplayer available but being a sad loner I am enjoying it in single player. You collect random heads and weapons and trading is allowed for those colletors amongst us. I am guessing the re-playability will come with getting ALL the gems/heads/weapons and the multiplayer element. Now I am just looking forward to what Behemoth are working on next.			"

												Every Summer Sale I find a gem that I wasn't expecting or even looking for. There's always one game that comes along super cheap and it sucks me in and I play it more than any other game I bought during the sale. We're only on day 4 of the Summer Sale for 2014 and I'm confident in saying that Battleblock Theater is that game!  It's great!  If you've played Castle Crashers, you're already familiar with the art style and humore.  They're a blast, natch.  For Battleblock, they've done away with the click fest hack and slash style and given us a platformer fest that's full of mayhem and puzzles!  The controls are super responsive, the game is challenging without being punishing and provides a ton of laughs with the narration and other sight gags packed in. This game's great!  If you're debating it at $3.75 in the summer sale, or any other sale for that matter?  Go for it!  Hell, I'd be happy even if I'd paid $15 for it.  Thanks again Mr. Noseybonk for the gift!			"

												*unnecessary buckle your pants joke*Battleblock Theater, a 2D platformer game made by the same guys of Alien Omid and Castle Crashers. The perfect platformer. And let me tell you why.The art style is perfect, as usually. Way more improved then Castle Crashers one, so a better thing on an awesome thing its a ""uber-awesome thing"", right?  Dan Paladin Ladies and gentlemen.The controls are superbe: you can totally feel the character in your hand, and you will move it in the way you want it to. Of course, if you don't own a controller, well, that can be a problem, since the keyboard mapping its not much confortable.The music its glorious: I could stand 5 minute in the title screen just to listen to that sick tunes. Each level haves randomized songs, except the boss section and the finale. Add these songs are great, but sadly you will hear them a lot, so it might get a little annoying after a while.The narrator is Stamper. If you know his works, there is no need to add anything else about this section. His voice can cure tumors. (But not cancer, for that you need to call Kevan Brighting)The game itself its just grand; you'll find 8 chapters, each one haves 9 levels and a boss section + 3 encore levels. They go to easy to hard really smoothly and never feels unfair to you. Well, if you don't count ONE encore level.Yes, I'm talking about the last Encore level. That was probably the most unfair thing I've played in my life. If you're willing to complete it, God helps you. Still, it's an optional level, fortunatly, so it doesen't remove point to the final score.I really don't know what to say about the story, just because there isn't much to say about it without spoiling it, so I leave you that to find out by yourself.However, there is a problem with this game: Furbottom's Feature community maps. Each Friday the Devs pick up one community map pack and upload it so the whole community can play it to get a special prisoner-head (decorative misc). So, what's the problem with this you may ask? 50% of the time they seems to just pick a random map pack, giving us some unfair, terrible, painful levels to complete just for complete the heads collection. I really wish they could check first what are they gonna publish before doing it. Final score: 9.5/10 You can get it for a cheap price pretty much each big steam sales, or just buy it full price, it totally deserves it.			"

												Disregard time played as I play this offline often.The game is fun to play, the items kind of make it a bit more interesting, the game has a cool community of level creators and stuff like that.Mainly the reason this game is good is because its a block puzzle game thing with an interesting and comedic story. The game difficulty can be really low or really high. depends on the level really.Story: 8/10 (Solid.)Gameplay: 10/10 (Levels are challenging and skill based and near infinite.)Presentation: 10/10 (Good style)Soundtrack: 7/10 (Repetitive, not very diverse)Replayability: 7/10 (You'll be coming back to play it for a while, until it feels like a chore. Longer duration with Co-Op)			"

												Great game to play with friends in both local and online co-op support. Great puzzles, highly recommended for any fan of platforming games. Great goofy soundtrack along with a lot of funny moments inbetween. Lots of collectibles to collect. Can be played with either mouse/keyboard or gamepad. However with this type of game I recommend a gamepad. 10/10 fun.			"

												BattleBlock Theater holds a special place in my heart. Sometimes games can be stressful, let's admit that. Morality and choices are such a huge part of modern gaming, and I think that's fantastic. I believe it is truly allowing us to view games exactly as they can be - art, just like movies and television before it. I truly appreciate that games have moved beyond ""rescue the princess"", or ""avoid those annoying ghosts and pick up those dots"".But sometimes being fun and funny matters more than being serious. And BattleBlock Theater is just fun. The graphics are simplistic and child-like, yet endearing. The music is fun and comical.And pushing your friend into traps never gets old, does it?			"

												Love this game. Make sure you play with someone who is especially maniacal, as screwing over my friends is my favorite aspect of this game. Has the potential to ruin friendships, especially during competitive times such as golden hat time, where my ""If I can't have it, no one can *throws hat in water*"" mentaility rears its average looking head. This game goes on sale quite often, but if you do not wish to wait, this game is definitely worth the $15.Different people play this game different ways, and there's a lot of interpretations on the most effective way to enjoy. Play in the way that makes you giggle the most, while making certain your partner is not plotting to kill you irl for your shenanigans.			"

												Buckle your pants and contain your peeslosh, children, it's time for BATTLEBLOCK THEATER!Hatty Hattington and his shipful of best friends are sailing around, making merry, when calamity strikes! A massive storm leaves them shipwrecked on a mysterious island, at the foot of a mysterious abandoned, old theater.But it's not abandoned.It's filled with cats! Loads of cats. Sinister cats who imprison you and all your friends, and then force them to run increasingly deadly acrobatic obstacle courses for their entertainment. All the while, Hatty Hattington watches on from the vault behind the gift shop. Boy, he's not moving much. But I'm sure he's fine! You'd better go rescue him, though! He doesn't look like he's taking this predicament very well.In the main story mode, there are 8 chapters, each with 9 normal stages, a 2-part finale, and 3 encore stages. In the normal stages, you must find at least three green gems and reach the exit in time. Each one you complete unlocks the next one, and the final one unlocks the finale. In the finale, you're racing against the clock. You still need three gems in the first part, though I'm not positive about the second. May as well collect them, just to be sure! You have to do these two stages back-to-back, you can't select one individually. Which is a little annoying when you've only missed the A++ grade on one of them, and aren't positive you even got it until after you've finished both and checked. The encores are all unlocked at the same time after the finale is completed. These are basically timed, more challenging normal stages, and are completely optional. But, you know. Do 'em.At heart, BattleBlock is a solid platformer. Beyond solid. The level design in this is pretty rather darn expert-tier, and there's enough variety to it that you won't get bored before the end. I mean, you've got your typical platformer fare. Ice floors and spikes and water you can't touch for... some reason. But then you have weird rideable squarish pig things, cats that breathe in really hard to pull you towards the hazards near them, these magmatic blocks that launch you off when you so much as lightly brush them, and some sort of... duck... shark... Yoshi's Island-lookin' guys that help you onto ledges and also poop you at things!It's also got the one thing that no other platformer that I've ever played has, and that's Stamper! I don't know if I can adequately describe this to you, but where the exceptional gameplay and endearing visual style make this a great game, Stamper's narration then makes it phenomenal. Every silly line is spouted in the perfect way to get the most comedic mileage out of it. I mean, the lines are already pretty amusingly written, but man, that voice, that energy... of all the best friends in this game, the narrator may as well be your bestest friend of all! He's right there with you, every step of the way. Advancing the plot, chatting with you as you play, commenting on and reacting to the situations at hand. We're talking Bastion levels of unforgettable narration, right here.So, what else.There are plenty of other modes besides just rolling through the basic story mode by yourself. There's also an insane mode which forces you to start the entire level if you die even once! Did I mention there's an achievement in it, for you? There's also a co-op story. That also has an insane mode, in case there's anybody left in your life that you don't completely hate, yet (Stamper notwithstanding)! There's also an arena, which has eight different gametypes, including a fun sort of basketball game, a race to finish a level first, one where you have to rub up on all the tiles to change them to your team's color (my personal favorite),  and of course just plain ol' beating the crap out of each other!You can, of course, play community-built stages, as well, in single player, co-op, AND arena varieties. These don't get you gems (the currency for unlocking new prisoners) or yarn (the currency for unlocking new weapons) unless they're featured, but they'll help ease the shakes you'll get when you're jonesing for a BattleBlock fix.Also, got a few bombs of knowledge I should drop, here. First, there's a new Furbottom's Feature every Friday. Every other week, it's a new arena playlist. On the non-arena weeks, it alternates between a set of single player levels, and a set of co-op levels. You can be notified whenever there's a new feature by subscribing to this BattleBlock Steam community subforum. Also, every so often special prisoner heads are released for a limited time, and can be collected either by simply booting the game, or by completing a current feature. I check in on this guide this guide every so often to see if there's one up. If you don't care about prisoner heads and just want to have fun, ignore all this garbage and go about your life, unburned by the hellish draw of completionism!BattleBlock's difficulty is fair, and has a good learning curve. The music is all pretty groovy and gives you something easily worth listening to as you step on that obvious trap and die like an idiot.I mean succeed wildly and without error.Alright, I hope that's everything because I've got stuff to do. So, uh, buy BattleBlock Theater! Enjoy it! It will enjoy you back!			"

												Remember those days in middle school when you would go your local afterschool program, hopped on a computer, and booted up the first flash game site you could find? Whether it was OneMoreLevel.com, Addicting Games, or Newgrounds, Battleblock Theater serves as the manifestation of the classic platformer you'd find on those sites. Collect x and get to the exit.The plot is simple: You and a group of friends get stranded on an island, kidnapped, and are forced to go through a series of platform-based levels to amuse the island's feline inhabitants, all the while trying to rescue others from your boat who were captured.With quick wit and style does Battleblock Theater serve to both amuse and delight the player, the game blends black comedy through the outspoken narrator with excellent and generally basic gameplay into a single entity that can provide hours of entertainment.Levels play out in unique ways to the classic platformer, yet pay homage to those of the genre that have come before it. Unlike most platformers, in a typical level, you can die as many times as you want, and the goal is simply to get three gems in a level to exit. However, due to the construct of the game, you'll likely, based on constructed OCD, end up collecting all possible and the yarn too. Gems can be spent on unlocking new characters which can be in turn used in future levels, while yarn unlocks weaponry.New concepts, such as specific baddies, blocks, and other functions of the game, are slowly introduced to the player in individual levels to provide for your ability to cope with them in the future. The game makes sure of your understanding of them by forcing them into the completion of levels so you're ready for them in the future.Battleblock Theater is one of the most addictive games on Steam, and arguably the best platformer the service has to offer. In case it needs to be said, I strongly recommend you add it to your library as soon as possible.			"

												Good lord this game's a riot. I played through most of the story with a friend and we had a blast. The basic idea is you've been imprisoned and are forced to run through various obstacle courses, picking up gems and golden balls of string along the way (for unlockable heads and weapons, respectively). The story is well written and narrated incredibly well too. Singleplayer may be solid but co-op offers a world of possibilities to screw with your partner. Do yourself a favor and buy this with a friend.			"

												This is a really fun and funny game. The humor is wonderful!The announcer really makes this game a gem. It you don't find humor in the game intro then you need to have your funny bone (or pulse) checked.I highly recommend picking this game up and getting some good, gaming satisfaction. The levels provide a level of satisfaction in getting bonuses (gems - which can be traded for new skins) for getting a perfect in each level. So the game causes you to want to play the levels and do your best to find the yarn balls so that you can get more weapons.I personally enjoyed Castle Crashers (the creators made this game as well) but the entertainment in this game far exceeds Castle Crashers. BattleBlock Theater is comical, silly/sarcastic violence and great comedy verses Castle Crashers which is bloody cartoon violence. I feel this game is a lot more ""kid friendly"" from what I've played so far. The online microphones/audio can be disabled (for any of you parents out there).10 out of 10!!! Get this game!			"

												Battleblock Theater is a comedy-like game from the indie game company, The Behemoth. This game is about a bunch of people with you which sadly you dont have a name (unless you check your invneotry to see what your characters name is and inside details). If you didnt know already but this indie game company made 2 other games, Alien Hominid (which is supprisingly on the Nintendo Gamecube and Gameboy Advance), and Castle Crashers. Both of those games were great but you guys might be wondering ""what does those 2 games have to do with Battleblock Theater?"" well ill get to it so shut up and drink your cup of water. This game has many refrencesfrom those 2 games like unlockable characters and even hidden backgrounds from those 2 games.Ahm so as i was typing (logic), You take on the role of a prisioner which is forced to play daredeveling levels at a certain time and collecting gems, the currency of this game. You also find yarn which can be used to buy weapons to either help you or kill a cat who are the guards in an abandoned theater which is currently the biggest theater in the world since it takes 1 entire island to make. The gems are used to buy prisioners, yes, you have to buy your friends and the more you buy the bigger the price is, total logic everyone.The multiplayer is acutally quite fun since arena mode has up to 12 modes to play on and you can even play story mode but with only 2 people.FYI if you were a beta tester for this game, you literally got this game from 15 bucks to free since its already stuck in your steam library.There is a level editor which by the name you can make levels and share them on Steam Workshop. I hope everyone enjoys making levels and sharing them.if you remember Insane mode from Castle Crashers well guess what, theres one in this game but you can play it whenever you want (phew) the only catch is theres no checkpoint which is really helpful.The acvhivements in this game are actually harder to get than from Castle Crashers, 1 of them requires luck and that is to play with someone from The Behemoth or someone who has the achivement (i got it already during beta).I give this game 10 out of 10 since this game is already good the way it is, lots of modes to play online with, show off all your prisioners/weapons and barelly any lag from this game. I'm suprised i didnt lag during the beta cause most people were suppose to and i was using a bad laptop			"

It's about time I reviewed this one.BattleBlock Theater is one of the best platformers I've played in recent memory, and considering my background with Nintendo games, that's saying something. The Behemoth's (known for their previous game Castle Crashers) trademark style really comes through here, with it's quirky humor, simple yet aggrivating level design, and a surprisingly emotional and depressing ending. It's an experience you won't soon forget.The story follows you, a friend of Hatty Hattington (the best friend of all) after you, Hatty, and all of your other friends are shipwrecked on a mysterious island. You attempt to take shelter in a suposedly abandoned theater, only to see Hatty kidnapped by a bunch of giant cats, forced to wear an old top hat. You (and the rest of your friends, who serve as extra character skins that you can later unlock) are then taken in as prisoner, forced to ""act"" in deadly performances, while Hatty runs the whole thing. The object of the game is to complete eight chapters (seven of which are supposedly shows, while the last one is a vault that leads to Hatty's office) and rescue your friend.So at face value, the story follows the typical damsel in distress needing to be rescued (though it's not nearly as blatant here as it was in Castle Crashers), though there's much, much more to it than that. The cutscenes that take place after each chapter in the game are all voiced by Will Stamper and Will Stamper alone, with an adorable ""puppet show"" motif in the visuals. These cutscenes all deliver what you would expect from Stamper: a hilarious yet mildly immature animation that knows how to use it's voice actor to his fullest. That being said, Stamper does give a very heartfelt and touching performance in the final cutscene, where Hatty is revealed to be more or less a vegetable by the time you save him. There is also the famous ""Secret Song,"" which Stamper does entirely in scat, and the results are nothing short of amazing.As far as the actual gameplay goes, it's a platformer with all the standard tropes. You got your powerups, enemies, environmental hazards, currency, weapons, checkpoints, and secret areas. The only truly unique thing that BattleBlock Theater offers in it's standard gamplay is the fact that you need at least three gems (the ingame currency) in order to pass each level. This is very easy to do very on, but towards the middle-end of the game this can become difficult to do. However, that doesn't make the gameplay bland, though. The game is very well paced and has only one very mild difficulty spike (not counting the final chapter, which is supposed to be insane and test your limits) that will only trip you up for a while, but you'll adjust pretty quickly.The game also has an ""arena mode"" which allows you to play one of twelve different competitve games against either the computer, friends locally, or anyone online (if you are lucky enough to have someone join you in the mode you want to play). All of these are extremely fun with the right people and are best played locally, but they can become very boring against the CPU or someone you don't know online.All and all, this game is a gem and HIGHLY recommended for those of you who want a platformer that isn't excessively hard or mind numbingly easy. It's the perfect balance of both with a lovable narrator and commedy straight out of early YouTube and Newgrounds to boot.9/10			"

Let me know if I'm gonna run into anything!... Ah! I'll just assume you didn't see that!Well done! Your ability to walk short distances without dying will be the green gem's downfall! Did you know my head is at your crotch level? I'm trying not to think about it.You make me so proud, minion. The way you're carrying on my fight to collect green gems and balls of yarn and player heads and weapons! It brings a tear to my eye. A figurative one, of course.

												This game is great from what I'vr played so far. The game itself I bought a while back for retail and at that price it is entirely justified as it is a really fun game and even better when playing with a friend. The game consists of several platorms to jump with each level getting progressively harder. The game to some may seem a tad repetitive and those views are completed justified as each level just consists with you getting from point a to point b but each level gets mopre complex and fun and it also contains jewels and balls of yarn which are used for multiple things.The jewels are used to buy new characters (I say new characters but it really is new faces for your character... still really good though :D) and the balls of yarn are used to buy new weapons. This collecting element makes the game more fun as you don't have to collect evey jewel or ball of yarn they are just in it to make your gaming experience more enjoyable.  The presentation is very close to that of castle crashers (Made by the same company) and  it really fits what the game is going for. The gameplay is very fun as it sees you jump between platforms using weapons and either chosing to help your friend or letting him fail while laughing maniacally. The controls are great very tight, however I'd highly recommend a controller as the keyboard can be used but is no where near as good as a controller (The keyboard does work very well by no means a bad port controller but the controller is better). The sounds of this game from the music all the way to the narrator were superb. The music was grat to listen to while playing the game and didn't get boring. The narrator has a hillarious voice and very funny lines, he is on youtube and has voiced a few animations online; also his name is stamper.My verdict of this game is that it is a very fun game to play with a friend however they didn't implement a feature that allows you to play with 3 friends during the main story which imo this game could have really benefited from. That was my only gripe with this game as everything else about it was fantastic. I'd give this game a 9.5/10 for very fun gameplay and funny moments while also being a very reasonable price of £10.99 (as of november 2014). It gets taken down a bit though for only having the ability of 2 player story when they could have easly made 4 player.			"

												The Behemoth has truly outdone itself with this awesome puzzle/platformer.  The premise is that you're shipwrecked on an island inhabited by cats who are forcing you to 'act' your way through life-threatening stages for their entertainment. Along the way, you can set your friends free with the in-game currency, gems, as well buying cool new weapons by bribing the guards (who are cats, of course) with yarn. All of this is accompanied by hilarious commentary which has been specifically designed to leave you in stitches. All of this can be done with a friend, either local or online. If you want to be a bit more competitive, there's even an Arena mode which allows you to compete with up to three other people in ridiculous challenges such as capturing horses or collecting gold. This game also covers the community connoisseurs with a cornucopia of community-made challenges on the Steam Workshop. Overall, this game is worth it for the comedy and even more worth it for the gameplay.			"

												Battleblock Theater is an extremely fun platforming game that is made that much better with a partner or several. I've played through the main campaign twice now, and it was just as fun the second time around. The encore levels provide enough of a challenge to keep the enjoyment after you finish the main story, and there are several levels in the workshop I haven't tried out yet.I highly recommend this game for the replayability alone. No jump scares!			"

												I have followed the Xbox release of BattleBlock Theatre since day one. Videos, screenshots, reviews the lot, I just couldn't get enough of it. Then I found out it was releasing on Steam. I buckled my pants.The Behemoth have really pulled off something great with this little gem (get it?), and I love it to pieces. Quite simply, BattleBlock Theatre is an experince that can be enjoyed by all, the MLG gamer, the grandma gamer, or just the casual one. Tons of replayability; pleanty of levels to complete, secrets to discover, things to collect and workshop support to provide an endless array of awesomeness!I strongly suggest you buy this game, you  will  love it. Trust me. Go on. Buy it, BUY IT.+ Hilarous. Honestly one of the very few, actually funny games I have came across.+ Great gameplay. Controls are simple and easy to learn.+ Tons of added features that add to replayability; levels, collectibles, workshop integration etc.+ Steam Inventory integration- Really stressful.  Really  stressful. In a good way, mind you.- Can, and will, destroy friendships.9.5/10			"

												HEY! Slow down buddy!Awesoness at it's finest. If you ever played Castle Crashers, and find it funny. Well, just wait till you heard the Battleblock Theater plot, if you don't laugh at it. Then you have serious problems!Single-player:- The game mechanics its just simple: go through the level, collect at least 3 gems to be able to ""escape"".- Controls are perfect. At the beggining they recommend you to uso a joystick. I'm playing with an Xbox 360 controller, and it's 100% compatible.- Graphics are amazing as Castle Crashers was.- Story is about a friend ship that sinked in a island full of crazy cats and a dangerous and scary Hat.- Customizable character: you have heads options, and as you go further through the storyline and gatter gems you can exchange them for new head styles.- It also has multiplayer, but I didn't got any further on it to give a helpful opinion. But the co-op is just great, everything work as it should beExtra points:- Itens market, you can sell/buy weapons.- Heads keep updating.- Co-op- Be able to change the storyteller (but I strongly recommend to keep it default)- Multiplayer- Level Editor- Community levels			"

												Now you see, BattleBlock Theater is a fun, quirky little platforming game where you and your friends shipwreck on an island, and the best friend of all ""Hatty Hattington"" enslaves you and the others to partake in deadly performances for a crowd of Cats.No, it's not THAT kind of game. This game isn't a ""joke game"", but rather, chock full of jokes.Pros:- Lots of content, with over 300 available prisoner unlocks.- Multiplayer.- Narrator makes comments on everything, but the responses are varied enough to not become stale (Also the narrator's voice is amazing).- Again on the Narrator, he has a lot of personality, and can go from thrilled to horrified to sarcastic.- Level sharing.- Arena mode, where you can fight others.- Very few achievements where you have to be perfect (Exceptions are collecting every prisoner besides a few limited-time ones, and one where you have to get a perfect level grade only ten times.)- Fairly decent difficulty curve. Cons:- Difficult to get all the prisoners, can require thousands of gems, forcing you to trade or go to the arena.- Very steep difficulty spike near the end, ocasionnaly requiring timing involving something you can't see easily, or having to make perfect jumps on blocks that appear for about 0.5 seconds or so (This one is mostly my opinion).Overall, to summarize the experience of the game, you should buckle your pants, because you're going to be in for a treat.Rating:9/10			"

-Quick Review-This game was hilarious, challenging, and very fun to play. The game plays like a 2D puzzle platformer, but the story and narrator will keep you laughing until your sides hurt. You can make the experience even more enjoyable with a friend. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  “Oh no! the Cats have captured Hatty Hattington and are holding him hostage! Hold on Hatty, we’re coming for ya! …It would be nice if you could meet us half way, or something…” You are a prisoner-slash-performer *cough* who is trying to save “Hatty Hattington, the friendliest guy of all, he’s the friend of friends, and a real stylish gentleman too”.I don’t want to give anything away on this story; it was witty, hilarious, and absolutely awesome. It’s worth playing through several times just to watch the cinematic’s again. The animation is hilarious and downright brilliant. These are the same people that brought you Castle Crashers, so if you enjoyed that game, this one is ten times better.Game Play: The game is a 2D platformer, usually the word “platformer” is a swear word to me. However this platformer gives you a little bit of slack with various accessories that help you complete levels (if you’re creative). The controls are tight, the puzzles change for multi-player so you’re not simply just playing single player with another person, and there’s many features for player-made-custom maps and even battle modes. Achievements: I haven’t finished getting all the achievements for this game, but most of them just took care of themselves while I played the game. Thankfully there *isn’t* an achievement for getting “perfect on each level”. There are achievements for both single player and Co-op, so you might want to make a friend or have a friend help you out as you play through this game.Price: The price for Battle Block Theater is $14.99, I received this game as a gift from someone thankfully it was on sale, but with all the laughter we had playing the game, and considering I’ve put 20 hours into the game so far (that number will most likely increase) the price is quite fair for the entertainment, but as always I recommend waiting for the game to go on sale. Conclusion: Why are you still reading my review? You should totally be playing this game. I cannot say all the amazing things about the game; it’s easier to say what’s not good about this game: Nothing I can think of. I highly recommend this game to anyone hard-core gaming or soft-core.

												BattleBlock Theater是一款跳跃躲避陷阱类的游戏。一说到这类游戏，人们第一时间想起的恐怕是Super Meat Boy。我没玩过Super Meat Boy，不过如果Super Meat Boy的跳跃系统真的如作者所描述的那样的话（来源于Indie Game: The Movie里的内容），那么BattleBlock Theater的跳跃系统是比不上Super Meat Boy的。不过，跳跃只是这类游戏中的其中一部分，BattleBlock Theater拥有非常多的元素：丰富的人物收集和游戏模式，能够进行本地或是线上多人游戏，拥有Steam Workshop，即使你把剧情打完了，你也能玩上新的地图。BattleBlock Theater的游戏内容很多，但其游戏质量并没有因此而下降。在Steam上，我们也不难找到这类游戏（变种的也算）的身影，例如Mechanic Escape，Rush Bros，Volt等等。私以为对于这类游戏，拥有并玩上一两款优秀的作品才是王道（因为实质的内容都是大同小异的，何不挑选最好的来玩呢？），而BattleBlock Theater就是这么一款我认为必须拥有的作品。BattleBlock Theater is a jumping and avoiding pitfall game. It has many characters for you to collect and many game modes for you to play. You can play this game with your local friends or your online friends. Even though you beating the story mode, you still can play the newest map through Steam workshop. There are so many games belong to this genre. In my opinion, select one or two this excellent game to play is enough. Because they are in the same core, why not choose the best to play? And BattleBlock Theater is the one which i think is the best to select.			"

												Now that Battleblock Theater is out of beta, early access, and the embargo is lifted, I can finally talk about how much I love it.The most obvious thing is Dan Paladin's art, which I always love. He has this simple but unique style that I never get sick of. A lot of his art manages to be a bit cute, without pushing things to a place that its so over the top that you want to vomit. Even getting killed manages to look adorable sometimes.The platforming here, which is the main draw of the game, is stellar. The levels may look simple at first glance, but as you play they will introduce many new blocks with their own mechanics, and drastically ramp up in challenge. The game has enemies as well, but they serve more to hinder your platforming progress than to actually act as a barrier to gameplay. This is more true in single player, where the game is about trying to clear each level with a high grade so you can unlock more content. In multiplayer, you can play on teams and try to disrupt the others by punching, shoving, or any other means. You can also do this to your team mate, if you need to.Speaking of content unlocks, you can unlock and trade a few weapons, each that act vastly different. Some have uses that aren't apparent at first glance. For example, there is a force ball that shoots a ball of energy out in front of you, that quickly arcs upward. If you shoot it next to a wall, you can jump on top of it on the rebound and launch yourself into the air. There are also many different heads to unlock. Each head and weapon is added to your Steam inventory, and they even have the option to market them if you want. Speaking of teams, the game has a lot of team based mechanics as well to help keep multiplayer interesting. If a ledge is too high, you can hang your arm over the side and offer an assist. You can jump off the head of a drowning player if you're quick enough, and escape his fate. There's also a button to make your character scream for help, if your partner isn't paying attention and leaves you stuck somewhere. The game lacks any real type of chat system otherwise, but honestly things get so crazy that you wouldn't have the time to type out messages during a match.The game has a level editor, and it's pretty powerful. Not only do you have access to all the various blocks, enemies, and what not, but you can change the size of the level a bit, to get things just right. It even has built in tools to help with things like building a level that is mirrored, either vertically or horizontally, as well as a 4 way split. This is a really nice addition that many developers would have over looked.The sound and music is fine, with the voicework standing out. Not only is the story unique and often hilarious, but it is well done as well.If I had to come up with a complaint, it would be that sometimes the control is a bit touchy. An example that comes to mind is trying to jump on the edge of blocks. There is a spike block that kills you if you land on it. If you manage to jump on the exact edge of the block, you won't trigger the trap. The room for error, if there even is any, is so minute that this can't be done in a reliable manner as to use this as a point in your level building without becoming overly annoying to players.Other than that small complaint, the game is another great entry from Behemoth, which is pretty standard stuff for their releases.If you like platforming, with more focus on the actual platforming challenges than on enemies and such, I can't recommend this enough. If you're expecting something deeper, like a Castlevania or Megaman, you might want to pass.As a side note, I'd like to add that Behemoth gave the full game to it's beta testers for free, which was a really cool thing that they didn't have to do at all. <3			"

												It's got lots of fun and cats, see? BattleBlock Theater is best enjoyed with a friend, as the antics and mischief that ensue are not easily forgotten. Strap in for hours of puzzling, problem-solving, friend-punching, cat-wrangling, and more.			"

												I realized how great this game was when I managed to shock myself after uttering for the first time the phrase: ""Wow, you can fart yourself to death!""People are comparing this game to the likes of Castle Crashers, Super Meat Boy, Fez and even Minecraft. The truth is: it's nothing like any of those games. It's nothing like anything made ever in ever forever. It's an completely fresh and utterly unique platformer with colourful graphics and an absurd story-line.Most of the fun comes with finding out and trying to deal with how bonkers this game actually is... You play as what I can only guess are doodles of humans who shipwrecked onto a mysterious island. The captain of the ship, Hatty Hattington, is possessed by a magical top hat he is forced to wear by the humanoid ginger cats who inhabit the island's creepy run-down theater. If you're having trouble grasping this, then you are not alone. These humanoid cats, or at least the security-worker cats, name you and all other crew members of your ship their prisoners and force you to entertain the civilian population of the island, who are also cats.The humour had me laughing the whole time, and I played for thirteen hours. I'm not even anywhere near completing even the main story-line; the game has so many levels and only sometimes gets repetitive, even despite it's simple premise. On the rare occasion it does get redundant it throws in another mechanic or unlocks another weapon and the fun returns. The story-line is only two player, but there are some sports-styled games for four of you to anger each other over. Oh and Stamper as the narrator: Genius.There is just so much here in one tiny package. Good old simplistic platformer gameplay, colourful goofy graphics, tons of levels and collectibles, make-your-own-level content creator, huge replay value even if you aren't a completionist, funky soundtrack and everything about it is hilarious and entertaining throughout.This game is good to buy!

												Very entertaining, graphics are good (style), workshop support, and making faces myself is also pretty cool. Though i think after 15 hours it will get boring. Also the Co-op or versus is very entertaining, with things like simple deathmatch, king of the hill but also other creative thought gamemodes. It is totally worth the money, you just enjoy playing it like, the hype for a while is amazing. Though at the end, it's a nice memory.			"

												BattleBlock Theater (previously known as Game #3) is a puzzle platformer with a few combative elements thrown in, and by god, it works.In my opinion, BattleBlock Theater is better than Castle Crashers by far, and that's saying something.EDIT: The game also has more customization then there are Atoms in my body.

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 21BattleBlock TheaterPurchase Date: 12/29/2014I was already familar with The Behemoth having played Castle Crashers in the past.  So when I saw this for 90% off during the Winter Sale of 2014, I couldn't resist picking it up, even if it did take me 7 months to finally get around to playing it.Battleblock does have a few things in common with Castle Crashers, such as the same art style, and the same quirky humor.  But Battleblock is in other respects a much different game, with it's focus on platform gameplay mixed in with some puzzle solving.The story, such as it is, has you crashing your ship full of friends (""friendship"", get it), on an island where you become a prisoner to a bunch of cat guards.  Inside the prison you enter a series of theatres.  Each theatre is a level that you have to escape from, to the entertainment of your guards who are all watching.I appreciated that the levels did not start out overly difficult.  Instead the game becomes more progressively difficult to give you time to pick up the basics of gameplay, which are easy to understand.  Each level has an exit which is unlocked once you gather 3 gems.  But most levels have additional gems that you can get as well.  Many levels also have a bonus ball of yarn that you can collect.  When you exit a level, you get a letter grade based on the number of gems and yarn collected, as well as how long you took to beat the level.  So the game definitely encourages replay.  Also, the gems and yarn you collect can be spent on upgrades like new characters and weapons. I love that the game comes with it's own level editor, but I did not actually check it out in the time I played.  In fact, it felt like my hour really flew by as I kept making my way through various levels.  I can see myself spending a lot of time in this game.  This was so worth the $1.49 I spent on it, but honestly even at full price it's still worth checking out.			"

												This game is not bad, though it made me raging as hell, because of the last few levels. It is very shattering if you try a level for about 3 hours and eventually beat it. But why had the devs made these levels that hard. I am a 100% completionist and this is really a thorn in me side. If the achievements or the last levels wouldn't be that damn hard I would like the game more. However I give a thumb up ;)			"

												I'll be honest, I mainly bought this game for the cards and the marketable items. However, after playing it for a while, I got hooked with it! The game is both simple and challenging, in the sense that you will challenge yourself over and over again to get the best possible score. The soundtrack is also nice and non-repetitive, and the narrator's witty banter will keep you interested for hours and hours.Highly recommended. If you like platformers, then this is the game for you.			"

												Really really fun game! Now yes, it does ask you to use a controller but dont worry! Keyboard works well and you can get use too it easily! Better controls than Castle Crashers on keyboard trust me. It is a must buy if you have a friend to play with, you will fight with your friend, race till the time runs out, and the narrator is just hilariouse! xD You will have a great laugh (unless you have some different sense of humor).  Don't have any friends to play with? Dont worry! You can still play by yourself if you want and there is online multiplayer! Finished all the singleplayer maps? There are user created levels as well, heck you can even make a level and publish it to the community! Soundtrack is really nice and fits well with the game, some of the sountracks is very catchy as well. Whats really cool about this game is as you play the levels, you have to get gems and with those gems you have to pretty much buy hats with them, there are HUNDREDS of hats to buy!!! Like A LOT. Now lets say you have A LOT of hats and you barely even use any of them, you can sell them at the community market!!! So you can get probably dollars if you sell all your hats! The fun never ends! So buckle your buddy's pants and buckle your pants (youll know why people are saying that when you finish the singleplayer ;) )  and buy the game! Yes i know i dont have enormouse amount of gameplay hours, it's not a big game and i haven't gotten to play all the levels yet. But withtin the first 1 hour of gameplay you pretty much understand the whole gameplay style. I give the game 10/10 its really well done!Hope you found this review useful and don't forget, buckle your pants, buckle buckle your pants! Pull up your socks and dance!! ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ			"

												Buckle your pants and buy this game already.Need a reason?  Well, that's a SEEEECRET.Bad jokes aside, the cutscenes themselves are hilarious, gameplay is addictive, and they could not have picked a better narrator.  There should be a game with him and the Stanley Parable narrator going head-to-head or something.  Throw in the LittleBigPlanet narrator and we'd have one amazing and amusing game I think.Only con I can really say is that while you can play with the keyboard, it can be a pain in the butt when you're trying to hit a cat guard but you end up squatting instead because you pressed the wrong button.  So you get licked and thrown into water.  Bad kitty.  But yeah, in-game it almost immediately says it's recommended to use a controller.  If you don't have one, though, you'll live.  Just a friendly warning.			"

""Pants buckling intensifies""BattleBlock Theater was created by popular indie dev The Behemoth, known for two of some of the greatest indie titles pre-indie game era: Castle Crashers and Alien Hominid. Now, after quite a wait, the third popular title of The Behemoth's games is released, but does it live up to expectations? Yes, but not by much.GraphicsI'll start with visuals. It honestly isn't much different from Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers, but I still do like the simple style of the game. Oh yes, and it does have the ""1,000,000,000p graphics with high resolution super texture technology that modern human eyeballs can't even see."" Trust me, that narrator does NOT lie. The graphics in this game make my eyeballs melt at times. It's so simple that I can't see the amazing hyper realistic textures this game has!GameplayNow, I'll move to the gameplay that includes the ""state of the art ragdoll physics."" Sorry to doubt you Mr. Narrator, but there isn't much ragdoll from what I've seen. Is there ""particle physic future systems?"" Yes. The gameplay is simple, if a bit dull. The combat is somewhat clunky and can be annoying when playing PvP. Not much to this platformer, especially from Behemoth. StoryStory time? I believe that would be a yes. The story, believe it or not, is humorous and pretty enjoyable. I'll try and not say much, but I'll explain the main plot: Your best friend, Hatty Hattington, you, and other friends go on a trip on the S.S. Friendship, but get shipwrecked on a mysterious island run by cats. Yes, cats. They give Hatty a corrupt top hat that makes him betray his friends and make him the leader of the cats. Especially when you add the humorous narrator that is quite underrated, great story overall.AudioNow we move to the audio. Okay, there isn't much to the audio, but the narration is very humorous and well done, despite not getting much praise compared to The Stanley Parable and Bastion's narrators. The music is above average, and uses choir in some rather creative ways. Oh yeah, and there's people make sounds when you do stuff. ""11/10 its okay"" -IGNReplayabilityFinally, we hit the replayability. Honestly, there isn't much to do that I saw post game, although I did enjoy making some levels. PvP, like I said, has clunky controls, Insane Mode doesn't seem as fun as it was in Castle Crashers, and that's about it. You could get a couple hours into the game, but I wouldn't expect too much.VerdictOverall, BattleBlock Theater meets expectations, but not by much. It did need some work in some very important areas, but was successful with the narrator's humor and large amount of content. I would buy this at about half off and say it was well worth it, so I would wait for a sale to get this game. However, it still is a game you shouldn't try to miss.Graphics- 7/10Gameplay- 6/10Story- 8.5/10Audio- 8.5/10Replayability- 6/10.:7.2/10:.+Awesome narrator+Lots of content+Great story+Lots of creative songs-Clunky combat-Not much to do post game, depsite all the content-Dull overall gameplay			"

I can't speak for the rest of the game, and I haven't touched single-player or the level editor at all, but I've no regrets so far.The Behemoth are masters of making a responsive, addictively fun arcade platformer.

												Best game ever. Buy it now. Hats.aka 2D Platformer that has cats that imprison you. You should buy it because it's great. And finally, you can customize your character by replacing his/her head with other heads that you unlock via trading or by using one of the two in-game currencies.			"

												Battleblock Theater is probably the best platformer currently on Steam. It can be played both competitively and casually and has a wide array of additional content other than the main storyline to keep you entertained. This game has a really good sense of humor and the levels all feel entertaining and unique. Also with the addition of the workshop it means that you can download even more levels offline which means limitless fun. If I have one main problem with this game it would be the combat. Don't get me wrong the combat isn't horrible but at the same time I feel it could have been a lot better. All in all this is a very well done game that offers lots of content for a fair price. 9/10			"

												I really love this game! There's SO much to do in it, like play the story mode, collect the prisioner heads, play arena mode, co-op, and much more.My only gripe: There's no real incentive to not die. Once you collect a gem or yarn, it's yours to keep. So if you kamikaze at a really tricky collectible, you're free to die and keep it. It's not very challenging (although I have yet to play it on insane mode...), but it's still worth it. Although to be fair you do drop the occasional Golden Hat upon dying, and if you're above water, say bye bye to that hat of gold. But aside from that, this is a very entertaining game.Now if only the Behemoth would release Alien Hominid HD on Steam, then It will be complete.			"

												I had so much fun playing. The story mode is quite enjoyable, on its single and co-op mode. The arena is a great mode to play randomly with your friends, providing to you and your friends a great time of fun!Making your custom heads is the best feature of the game. Its really funny to see your own face exploding! And the level editor is awesome for the PC version.A great game if you want to have a funny time. Also challenging, the levels had their challenge and the final chapter is insane. The possibilites are endless!If you loved Castle Crashers and Super Meat Boy, get it.. GET IT NOW.. Also.. CATS! LOTS OF!			"

												I had heard good things about BattleBlock Theater so picked it up in the previous summer sale for next to nothing - I had high expectations for it due to the praise it had received from online reviewers and YouTube playthroughs, and I was not let down.The game is a 2D cartoon art style platformer, like  many other platformers out there such as SuperMeatBoy, it will have you smashing your head against the desk with anger due to the amount of times you fail at one specific jump only to realize you had been doing it wrong the whole time.This is probably one of the longer platformers of it's type, the solo play through of the story took me a little over seven hours, this was on normal mode also. There is a never ending supply of user made content through the Steam-workshop, as well as a hard mode included for the main story too.One of the most attractive features about BattleBlock Theater is that you can play local Co-Op, a feature that these games often skip over.I absolutely loved the cinematic in between each stage as well, the dialog had me in stitches the whole time.I wouldn't recommend doing what I did and powering through this game in 2 sessions as you will end up wanting to scream the walls down, but you should definitely pick this game up, even when it's not on sale its a huge bargain for the amount of content and giggles you will get out of it.More Reviews at - http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/ "

												Firstly, this game is brilliantly funny. The voice overs are perfectly performed and you will laugh every time. The music fits the game perfectly as well being just the right amount of upbeat. The gameplay is simple and the level design is simpler still, but all in all it is an amazingly fun platformer that no platforming fan should pass up. It has major replayability, tons of user added content, lots of collectibles if you are into that, and a beautiful co-op mode. I truly have no complaints about this game at all.			"

												Bro, this game, bro. This game, this is it.First it's an XBOX Exclusive, and now it's on PC. Out of nowhere. What a dream!Anyway, this game; it's BattleBlock Theater; it features one of the whackiest stories of all time. But this game isn't all about that, of course not! The story has a deeper meaning to it. Seriously, there's A WHALE IN THE STORY. YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE STORY IS GOOD IF THERE IS A WHALE IN IT.On a more serious note, the story, again; whacky, fun, and still deep at the same time. Now I'm not gonna go and spoil it - that's for you to find out when you buy the game! Well, *if* you happened to buy this game. But really, who wouldn't? I mean, this game attracted me with its awesome humor and showcasing of simplicity in its own gameplay - which brings me to my next case.The gameplay; ultra super important in a game, obviously. The gameplay is simple. Platformer physics and platformer ideas along with requirements of a strategizing mind - also a hint of combat for your desire. Good balance, right? Yep! That's what's good in this game. It features a way to unlock new weapons and tools to serve the odds in your favor of getting past combat. The puzzles included in this game require, as said before, a mind that can locate a good way to solve that puzzle in the form of an obstacle or simple combat. Every aspect of certain puzzles is important to the overall gameplay in the game itself.The progression of difficulty is shown in this game very well. As you progress through the game, the difficulty increases with harder obstacles and such. It gets bigger. Harder. That's what sh- nevermind.The game encourages you to do better and manage the puzzles and obstacles put into the game, which make for a good gameplay and difficulty in the balance of clever design. Really, the puzzles are almost godly. They're very creative and I can understand every single one of them.There's also arena with many game modes to choose from. I'm not going to go in depth with each indiviual one, but let me say that these game modes are very good and the creators have done it the right way. Arena mode encourages competitive gameplay in contrast to the teamwork (or traitorous acts) of story mode co-op.There's also a level editor that allows you to make your own playlists or arena levels. It has everything, and you can do as you wish on it.The music in this game is catchy. It gets stuck in your head, but in a good way. I really love the music in this game. It really satisfies and motivates me to get past a level. I love the choice of music and how it fits the levels. It just never gets old.The art in this game is what you can probably expect from an indie game. It's clean, cartoon-ish, but in a good way. The art is very nice and reveals a depth of the story. It's up to par and it's very nice.On the other hand, I've praised this game's progression of difficulty, as said above. However, the difficulty is a bit steep compared to encores and required levels. I see that the encores are optional challenges, but for the chapter they're on, it might be easier to backtrack compared to finishing encores right off the bat.In conclusion: This game has everything. Parkour, combat, puzzles, competitive gameplay, and some more. I would give this game a steady 9.3333333/10. This game has a very awesome gameplay and a variety of them. This game has great elements, but some could also be improved. (Like the ♥♥♥♥ING ENCORE LEVELS AAAHH) But seriously, this game is really good. Go get it, and keep shining on, Behemoth!			"

												 Hatty Hattington and his friends were enjoying a nice sailboat ride when suddenly their vessel became caught in the middle of a serious storm. It crashed against the shore of a nearby island, and the survivors soon found themselves imprisoned by a race of giant cats that made their prisoners battle for their lives in a dilapidated theater. Meanwhile, Hatty watched in silence, sitting in a chair with a malevolently glowing top hat resting on his headThe story in BattleBlock Theater isn't especially memorable once you put aside the creepy imagery of homicidal cat people. What really sells the tale is the energetic narrator, who tears through one line after another of cheesy exposition littered with enough poop jokes to fill an adult diaper. Hopefully, you don't mind that sort of juvenile humor, or you're at least willing to look past it so that you can enjoy what is easily one of the most satisfying downloadable titles to arrive on the Xbox Live Arcade.If you've been playing 2D action platformers for years, one of the aspects you'll appreciate most about BattleBlock Theater is its refusal to hold your hand unnecessarily. The interface and objectives are designed to communicate their purpose clearly, so a tutorial is neither needed nor provided. All that you must do to win the game is reach your friend, which you do by clearing one portion of the theater after another. As you work toward that end, you explore more than 100 carefully constructed stages that put your platforming and puzzle-solving skills to the test.As each stage begins, you jump out of a cage that is positioned somewhere within an arena. Your specific goal is to pass through a glowing exit gate, but first you must collect a number of emeralds that are located somewhere in the vicinity. Collecting three of them is enough to do the job, but you can also gather additional ones to use as currency at theater gift shops. An oversized ball of yarn is also stashed in each zone--usually in a fiendishly clever place--and there are sometimes bonus stages that are hidden behind portions of the landscape in out-of-the-way places. Though you don't always work against a timer, you still want to hurry because completion time and any optional items gathered both count toward the letter grade that you are awarded upon completing a stage.You encounter new hazards and more demanding situations as you advance. Figuring everything out usually takes only a moment, and then negotiating the additional obstacles becomes second nature until you're faced with a particularly devious area and find yourself pausing to ponder the best course of action. Such moments come up quite often, since BattleBlock Theater can be quite the difficult game. By the time you're partway through the sixth chapter, you're wall jumping, dashing, sliding, and double jumping like a champion, and you still might not be able to avoid the buzzsaw blades, spike traps, and grenade-launching cats thrown your way.Fortunately, the normal difficulty setting includes a generous checkpoint system that prevents you from ever losing much ground. You can try your luck at some of the more challenging gauntlets a few times over the course of a minute, until you get everything right, and the feeling when you come out the other end is exhilarating. If you prefer a less forgiving system, try insane mode. It doesn't play a lot differently than its standard counterpart--until you die. Then, you have to collect all those gems and that pesky yarn ball all over again because there was no checkpoint to catch you when you fell. Considering how crazy things get by the end of the adventure, you'll likely be doing yourself a favor if you start with the easier default setting.Although the charismatic narrator and the thrill of each new stage are ample incentive to advance toward the closing credits, the developers also included a bunch of unlockable content that lets you personalize your experience. In addition to a variety of special attacks that include vacuum cleaners and exploding paper airplanes, you can choose from one of four head types for your character. That's a nice touch since the head makes up about half of the hero's body mass. Most of the available options are wonderfully zany; there's simple pleasure in watching a ragdoll with a giant, triangular head and curlers leap around an arena while launching fireballs and narrowly avoiding homing missiles fired by oversized robots.Personalized characters make sense in BattleBlock Theater, especially because the game features a robust selection of multiplayer modes. There are eight distinct events that place you in similar arenas with unique objectives. In one mode, you attack your foe to knock his soul loose so that you can carry it, while you avoid letting him do the same thing to you. The longer you possess your adversary's spirit, the more points you accrue. In another attraction, you must tag more blocks than your opponent does within the provided time limit. There's also a mode where you grab a ball and score hoops on your opponent's goal, while in yet another selection, you ride your rival's steed back to your goal to score points. You can also work with possible allies to complete stages, and even take a break from the action to trade collectibles with friends.Multiplayer modes allow as many as four people to participate at once either locally or online, but it's also possible to interact with other players less directly. The game includes an intuitive level editor. A tutorial is included, but you'll barely even need it if you've already played through the game. You select dimensions for your desired arena, then place blocks and objectives as you see fit. Once you create a ""playlist"" that contains three stages, you can upload your creation and other players may vote it up or down. Your creation could even be featured as a top-rated community selection if enough people like what you've done. Though there aren't as many creation and sharing options as you'd find in something like Little Big Planet, the tools could keep you and others entertained for hours.Even if you find BattleBlock Theater too challenging after the initial stages, you'll want to keep playing just so you can see where the story goes next, or because you're every bit as addicted to the platforming action as expert players are. There's no shortage of ways to play, whether that be alone, cooperatively, or competitively, and the capable level editor is the icing on the cake. Hatty Hattington and his friends may be living through an absolute nightmare, but you're bound to be so thoroughly entertained that you won't have time to empathize.The Good    Hilarious narration    Challenging, freewheeling platforming    Extensive multiplayer options enhance the nuttiness    Intuitive content creation    Lots of great, expertly crafted levelsThe Bad    Juvenile humor can occasionally grate8.5    Great  "

												BattleBlock Theater is one of the finest, wackiest and most fun platformers I have ever played.From the hilariously narrated story mode to the ridiculous co-op and multiplayer modes to its mighty yet accessible level editor: this game is a bundle of absolute joy!+ extremely creative and fun level & puzzle design+ slick gameplay with precise controls+ fantastic humor+ Dan Paladin's trademark art style+ great co-op and multiplayer modes+ editor with Steam Workshop integration+ character customization- difficulty is a little all over the place- few very minor bugs, barely worth mentioning			"

												From the developers of Castle Crashers comes yet another warp and twisted adventure involving prisoners, blocks, and nefarious cat overlords. You will be enslaved by the game's charm and demand all of your friends start playing this game right meow. Each prisoner you meet is saved in your inventory so you can swap with your friends or sell them on the marketplace. Weapons too. The goal is often simple. Collect gems to open the exit and make it there. Getting there is often plagued by water, cats, and even more hazardous traps. Play alone or online or with your friend sitting next to you, in any form, the game is extremely fun and never stops leaving a grin on my face. It only took like two years for this to come from Xbox 360 to Steam but it seems much longer. The wait was worth it and I am happy to finally play it.			"

YES, it's so much fun to play with friends and you'll have hours on end of fun and rage moments XD			"

												Battleblock Theater, Man I remember when I saw the trailer for it before its release and pre-orderd it.And I don't regret it, It's like buying food in a grocery store and you buy something you hate to eat.Battleblock Theater is a platformer made by Behemoth, also known as the developers of another great indie title named Castle Crashers.If you don't want spoilers, don't continue reading beyond this point! It might ruin the game for you. And that isn't fun at all! Before I tell you a bit about the game, please grab a blanket to keep yourself warm as I tell you a bit of a story as kind as a mother's kiss. You'r a part of a crew on the ship S.S friendship. You and all your friends on board leave your town to go on another exciting adventure on the S.S friendship. But something horrable happens. A storm hits the ship and its not very happy to you and you'r friends. The storm strands the S.S Friendship on a unknown island with a building looking like a theater. Where did your friends go? Where are you? What exacly happend after the storm? And most important of all, where is hatty? You gotta find that out yourself, by playing a cruel act in the theater! Pros:+ The StoryIt migt not be the best of storys out there, but its good enough to keep you going. It fits with the games style.+ The NarratorThe Narrator of BBT (Battleblock Theater) is constantly with you through out the game, telling you what happend in the past, talking about what might happen ahead and even commenting about you dying.  (""Congratulaions, upon dying!"") + The MusicIt might not be the best of music in games but, it fits the games style. It's quite unique compared to other games.+ Online Game modes And Online Co-OpMan, this game is way more fun with a friend, it was fun before but its even more fun with a friend in co-op story mode or just having you and 3 friends playing other game modes. Like capturing a pig to score points for the team or play basket or just fight to the death.++ Furbottom's FeaturesThis is the area where you acces other game modes, and aswell where you can play custom made maps from the steam workshop, there are maps for evrey game mode. Some are recreatios of the story mode but for 4-players. Some are just for you and a friend platforming along a series of levels in a playlist. This gives the game so much more life and you can have almost have endless amount of fun.Cons:- The Short StoryAlright it ain't that short but sometimes I wished it was a bit longer. And most likely when you beat the game you'r either gonna do it again on hard mode or play it on normal mode with a friend.Well there aren't many more cons I can think off. I like the game really much and if you have a chance to play it, I strongly recommend itI give this game a 8.5/10			"

												Fun little platformer with or without friends. So much content, so much fun. Even when you're done the game, theres an extra gamemode for an insane mode, the same tracks but ALOT harder. You can also get A++'s in the ones you didn't. You can download extra maps to play, and the hosting for this game is AMAZING. Just start a friends lobby and BAM. They can connect via steam, it's actually wonderful. Every friday there is a new featured map to unlock a head. It makes it so you have a purpose to keep playing. Theres TONS of different gamemodes, over at least 10 in Arena alone. It's puzze gets from an extreme platformer such as super meat boy with it's parkour and timing, to where do I go and confusing situations. It'd probably take so long to 100% it, that's why it's replay value is some of the best I've seen. And I FINALLY got it when it first came out so I get all of the limited time only stuff >:D			"

												Being the emotionally dead person I am, the kind who barely gets a laugh out of anything, Battleblock Theatre was a pleasant surpise. A game thats actually funny and doesn't just curb in pop culture refrences in an effort to get cheap laughs. *cough cough* Borderlands *unconvicing cough*. But being sprinkled with excellent humor wouldn't stop a game from being♥♥♥♥♥♥if the gameplay was♥♥♥♥♥♥ and luckily Battleblock's gameplay isn't♥♥♥♥♥♥ Its a fast paced platformer broken up into a series of chapters with 9 levels, 2 time trial levels which are basically the finale that allows you to go to the next chapter, and 3 optional levels to allow you to make some more gems, which allow you to purchace diffrent kinds of heads to customize your character, on the side. The levels are all amazingly well designed with loads of challenging bits and puzzels that managed to stump me atleast, but  to be honest it's probably because i'm thick as an asphalt milkshake when it comes to puzzels. The game builds up a brillant atmosphere and feel and manages to maintain it the whole way through. Oh yeah theres also multiplayer, but since I'm super lonley, and theres barely ever any open games available for some reason,  i wasn't able to test it out to a great extent, but i did play enough to figure out that its not like alot of games where other players seem unnecessary, nothing but a  usless tag along that does nothing except consume space, time and in some cases health and ammo. But its also not like alot of other games where the campaign was exclusivly designed for multiplayer but has a single player campaign, so if you're not playing on multiplayer it leads to you fighting way to many enemies and having an excess of supplies that were meant for you're friends. The levels actually get tweaked slightly depending on what mode you're on. On singleplayer the level, puzzles and all, are designed to be completed on singleplayer, while on multiplayer, everything is tweaked slightly to make you work together and rely on eachother for help. But you can attack the person you're playing with, including you're own team mates on one of the many, intresting battle modes, which will probably lead to some ruined friendships. So thats Battleblock Theater, an intresting little platformer, sprinkled with genuinely funny humor that i reccomend to all.			"

												BattleBlock Theatre, in my opinion is a must-buy. It has silly artwork with humorous charaters and a hilarious story. The game is most enjoyable when played with friends although playing alone is pretty fun too. BattleBlock Theatre also features an amazing soundtrack.  "

												I've only played this game for about 20 minutes just because I intend on doing a co-op series with another YouTuber. But just in that 20 minutes (That being an 8 minute clip and 12 mins worth of gameplay) I can assure you this game is astonishing. Its hilarious storyline and unique art style help to amplify the point of this game being one worth the money in your steam wallet. I would recommend this to anyone and anything (that includes pigeons even though those things I can't stand....friggen pigeons mayne...hate those things) 10/10			"

												Absolutely brilliant. One of the best co-op games you'll ever play. Bought the double pack for me and a friend and I don't regret it one bit.But I DO suggest to only play on Insane mode. (you only get 1 life between you and your partner. For example, if you die, it restarts the level.)  It'll extend the life span of the game by a boat load. Normal mode is too easy as you have infinite lives.			"

												Buckle your pants because BattleBlock Theater is one of the greatest platformers you will ever play.Its iconic gameplay takes platforming elements from the notorious ""Super Meat Boy,"" and combines them with the challenging puzzles similar to ""Portal.""This game will take you on a wild ride as you collect gems with your friends in order to free the bestest friend of all: Hatty Hattington, who has been corrupted by a mysterious, evil hat on an island full of, erm, cats.If the story hasn't sold you yet, then I must inform you that this game has excellent replayability. There are multiple gamemodes, which range from beating up other players to grabbing coins from a mystical cloud and placing them into safes. 9.5 / 10Buckle your pants.			"

												Let me adress the game's bad qualities first: The fact that even if you can't get into a server, it will stay up on the list of servers you can get on is pretty annoying to have to deal with. I'm not sure if it happens to other people, but it happens to me and my friends all the time. The only other complaint I have is that they stopped updating the game as much as they did, but I understand that they have to work on other games. Besides those simple things, the game is pretty interesting and hilarious. There's funny cutscenes and even when you do something as simple as getting a gem (the in-game currency) the narrator will say something hilarious. It also has a great story that I haven't actually seen much, but I'm not going to spoil what it is. The game also has good party games, like Ball Game, King Of The Hill, and more. It even has a level editor, which is supported by the steam workshop. So, this game is great for everyone out there who loves a good videogame storyline, level editors, and party games.(I Also Chose This Game For The ""Villian That Just Needs A Hug"" Award In The Steam Awards.)

												 Battleblock Theater is an 2D platformer-puzzle game created by the legendary Behemoth.   In the main story mode, there are 8 chapters, each with 9 normal stages, a 2-part finale, and 3 encore stages. In the normal stages, you must find at least three green gems and reach the exit in time. Each one you complete unlocks the next one, and the final one unlocks the finale. In the finale, you're racing against the clock. You still need three gems in the first part, though I'm not positive about the second. May as well collect them, just to be sure! You have to do these two stages back-to-back, you can't select one individually. Which is a little annoying when you've only missed the A++ grade on one of them, and aren't positive you even got it until after you've finished both and checked. The encores are all unlocked at the same time after the finale is completed. These are basically timed, more challenging normal stages, and are completely optional. But, you know. Do 'em.There are plenty of other modes besides just rolling through the basic story mode by yourself. There's also an insane mode which forces you to start the entire level if you die even once! Did I mention there's an achievement in it, for you? There's also a co-op story. That also has an insane mode, in case there's anybody left in your life that you don't completely hate, yet (Stamper notwithstanding)! There's also an arena, which has eight different gametypes, including a fun sort of basketball game, a race to finish a level first, one where you have to rub up on all the tiles to change them to your team's color (my personal favorite), and of course just plain ol' beating the crap out of each other!You can, of course, play community-built stages, as well, in single player, co-op, AND arena varieties. These don't get you gems (the currency for unlocking new prisoners) or yarn (the currency for unlocking new weapons) unless they're featured, but they'll help ease the shakes you'll get when you're jonesing for a BattleBlock fix.BattleBlock's difficulty is fair, and has a good learning curve. The music is all pretty groovy and gives you something easily worth listening to as you step on that obvious trap and die like an idiot.Pro´s: + Extremely creative and fun level & puzzle design+ Slick gameplay with precise controls+ Fantastic humor+ Easy to create servers+ Great co-op and multiplayer modes+ Editor with Steam Workshop integration+ Character customizationCon´s:- Few very minor bugs, barely worth mentioning- Overall rating: Is a 14/15 (Must Own!)

												Когда ты говоришь BBT, то обычно мало кто понимает о чём ты, пока собственно он в этот BBT не поиграет.BattleBlock Theater стал той игрой, в которую ты можешь затащить любого человека с любыми игровыми вкусами. Это платформер, который придётся по душ любому, т.к. он прост в освоении и прохождение. Тут наверное заиграет что то внутри хардокрищиков, говорящие из глубин их мозга: ""Да как вообще можно создавать платформер в котором ты не будешь постоянно умирать?"". А вот так вот. Первое: В BBT ты постоянно умираешь. Постояяно. Второе: нужен хардкор - всё просто: включи режим ""Хардкор"".Как уже говорилось выше, игрушка представляет из себя ненапряжный платформер, с полным, кооператвным прохождением. Стоит отметить что 1 игру пройти реально, но это  не доставить столько удовольствия, поскольку игра сильно ориентирована на кооперативное прохождение и для этого созданы все условия (и ачивки). Нужно кинуть друга на другой берег? -Делай подсадку. Не нужно кидать друга на другой берег? -Делай подсадку. Нужно достать золотой клубок на другой части карты? -Делай подсадку. Хочешь потерять друга? -...(думаю сами поняли).В игре так же есть какое - никакое ПвП в виде арен или соревновательных мини - игр, но про них я расписывать не буду, т.к. никогда не пробовал. Игра полностью поддерживает workshop что не может не радовать. Прошёл всю игру? Пройди ещё несколько десятков тысяч уровней, созданных пользователями! (Кстати ещё один плюсик в копилку хардкорщиков. От хардкорщиков, для хардкорщиков). Редактор уровней прост до невозможности - это развязывает руки многим пользователям.В игре присутствуют класные фичи по типу кастомизации и оружия. Кастомизация тут ограничивается выбором типа головы и её формы. Хоть это и единственный способ украсить персонажа (Здесь я опустил выбор цвета игрока), но его вполне хватает, учитывая что тут несколько сотен этих голов, которые надо ещё и открыть, а играете вы в конце концов в платформер, а не в sims (тут могла быть шутка про кастомизацию современных MMORPG, но её не будет). Следующий пункт - оружие. Его тут около 20 видов. Оно нужно для того что бы изничтожать (какое хорошее слово) котов. Либо что бы  помогать себе и товарищу проходить уровень. Или же что бы мешать. Или же что бы мешать товарищу проходить, изничтожая котов. Либо же что бы изничтожать товарищей, попутно мешая котам проходить вас. И т.п. (ну вы поняли)Структура уровней тут везде одинаковая: На карте расположен выход, который открывается когда вы соберёте 3 гема (гема, потому что огранённый изумруд - длинное словосочитание). Всего на карте от 6 до 7 этих гемов (редко - 5). Собирать их или нет - на ваше усмотрение. Так же на уровне всегда присутствует 1 золотой клубок. Обычно он запрятан в каком - нибудь труднодоступном месте. Зачем собственно всё это нужно? Ну во первых за прохождение уровня вы получаете оценку по пятибальной шкале от A до F. Так же есть A++ но что бы выбить эту оценку нужно умудриться собрать всё на уровне, да ещё и уложиться во время, которые тут в принципе не ограничено кроме финальных уровней глав (об это чуть позже). За гемы можно покупать головы - по 10 за шт. При чём голова даётся рандомно. Вы выбираете только её форму (Шар, куб, цилиндр, пирамида). После 10 купленных голов одной формы цена возрастает до 15 за шт. Золоты клубки тратятся на покуупку новых оружий, по 5 клубков за шт. К слову все виды оружий открыть куда проще, чем все головы.Теперь немного о прохождении самой игры. Игра делится на 8 глав. После прождения каждой главы вам открывается доступ е следующей, и рассказывается часть сюжета (Да, это платформер с сюжетом). В каждой главе 9 основных, 2 финальных и 3 дополнительных уровня. По поводу основных уровней всё описано выше. Финальные уровни, схожи с обычными, но у вас всегда есть ограничение по времени, по истичению которого вы проваливаете прохождение уровня. Дополнительные уровни устроены по принципу финальных, но для того что бы открыть следующую главу проходить их необязательно.Отдельно стоит отметить саундтреки к игре. ЭТО ШЕДЕВР! Я никогда не слышал ничего более подходящего для платформера, чем данные произведения искусства. Не буду больше ничего говорить, это просто надо слышать.Игра очень часто светится на распродажах по 69 р., хотя свою полную стоимость игра окупает.Вроде всё сказал, не думаю что многие прочли до конца, но спасибо за внимание!P.s: В игре много шуток про♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥br>P.p.s: Мне просто нужно было написать обзор для значка			"

												BattleBlock Theater is a game filled with death and cats. it is also pretty good at ruining friendships. after completing the game by myself for the first time, i felt the desire to go back and play again, this time on the hardest difficulty. This game also has lots of head faces for the prisoners that you pay for with gems, and weapons you pay for with yarn. this game gave me a desire to go back and collect all the heads as well. As for the co op mode. BattleBlock Theater's co op mode can be fun, boring, aggrivating, it just depends on who you play with. There are people who will constantly kill you, and there is people who will be trying to help get through the levels and not kill at all. just make sure you play insane co op with a person who wants to finish the level. There is also an arena mode if you are tired of the game's campaign. you can play games like, basketball, gold grab, capture the horse, soul snatcher, and more. BattleBlock Theater also features community levels that are made by the community and a level creater. So if you are tired of their boring levels, shut up and do it better : )BattleBlock Theater is also filled with lots of fun and enjoyable characters and cutscenes that are bound to put a smile on your face at least once through the game. This game's replay value is great and it has very addictive gamplay to keep you going for hours. I say if you haven't played BattleBlock Theater yet, what are you waiting for? I reccomend this game for anyone looking for a platformer that provides a fun experience and story.10/10			"

												Legitimately funny on its own, with plenty of content both official and community-contributed, but it becomes a thing of hilarious beauty when played with a friend, especially for local co-op. Screw each other over in the most amusing ways you can think of, or just by accident, it calls to mind Portal 2 for the kind of co-op shenanigans you can get up to. Eventually you'll have to call a truce as you traverse the increasingly difficult levels, set to silly, catchy tunes and delightfully narrated by the silliest of people who may or may not be even following the script.

												As a Beta Tester of this game, I can safely say that the bugs of this game have been worked out. Fantastic work on the port, Behemoth.The game itself is hillarious and fun. The online works flawlessly, easy to join and doesn't lag as badly as castle crashers did (on bad connections, at least.) The voice acting and writing is the best. Gameplay plays exactly like you'd want a side scrolling puzzle platformer hybrid to play, and the music is incredibly catchy. The art style, while slightly low res in some areas, fits the humor perfectly.The game clocks around 8 hours of play at best, but not counting the endless matches you'll be playing online or with a friend by your side. It's definately worth the price tag and then some.			"

												BattleBlock Theater is one of the funniest games I've played. The game takes place in a deserted theater that is now overrun by cats. After your boat crashes the cats kidnap your best friend Hatty and force him into running the theater. You and all of your other friends are now prisoners being forced to perform for the audience that will pay a good amount of gems to see you get destroyed in any way possible. To complete a level you must evade all the obstacles and collect gems along the way, until you reach the exit (Note: The exit will only open if you have collected three gems or more) Like I said before this games story is hilarious but that doesn't mean the game itself is all that soft. No, the difficulty grows higher and higher until you get mad of seeing your character blow up, drown, get pierced by spikes and get eaten. The closest i can compare, in the case of despicable enemy/trap placement, is Mega Man. But don't worry your not just some helpless little performer, because you get to carry two of many insane weapons that may come in handy to kill something or to reach some areas. Control wise this game has really responsive and tight controls, but it would be best to play with a controller and not your keyboard. The multiplayer part of the game is fantastic, you can play through the story with a friend or get four people together to play a new form of basketball or challenge each other  by creating your own levels in the level creator.This game is great for when you just want to try something different that’s  fun but at the same time challenging, so if you have money and you dont know what to do with it I really suggest buying BattleBlock Theater.

												As a Beta Tester of this game, I can safely say that the bugs of this game have been worked out. Fantastic work on the port, Behemoth.The game itself is hillarious and fun. The online works flawlessly, easy to join and doesn't lag as badly as castle crashers did (on bad connections, at least.) The voice acting and writing is the best. Gameplay plays exactly like you'd want a side scrolling puzzle platformer hybrid to play, and the music is incredibly catchy. The art style, while slightly low res in some areas, fits the humor perfectly.The game clocks around 8 hours of play at best, but not counting the endless matches you'll be playing online or with a friend by your side. It's definately worth the price tag and then some.			"

												Love platforming? Humor? CO-OP? Murdering your friends in cold blood? Then this is the game for you!BattleBlock Theater, ton's of fun and well worth it a thousand times over if you get in on sale! It's a blast with your friends, smashing and mostly killing eachother, and getting badscores on levels!But you only have a few hours, how could you even know? ♥♥♥♥ off, I'm a wizard. ""But I'm a worthless sac of♥♥♥♥♥♥ who should really stop taking chemo so I die faster and make everyone happier and possibly would save the effort of me having to kill myself later, and I have no friends to play this game with!"" exclaims Neckbeard Cancerface (and other low lifes like him). Well your in luck! Not only is this game good in multiplayer, but the single player is also tons of fun! With a different level set so you can complete it by your lonely self, you'll be crying (because you have no friends) but also because you are having so much fun!Now, what is the story you even ask? The most serious of stories, of course. To begin: You and your best friends, the most notable of all would of course be Hatty Hattington are going on an adventure on your ship S.S Friend...ship? And you have the worst of fates! You've crashed on an island and you have been captured and stuff, and you must perform!This game has been a blast so far, and honestly it's one of the best games, same with Castle Crashers and the other....one.I would honestly give this a good hearty 10/10, because it's challenging and fun!

												Really fun game to watch and/or play with. The co-op is great, there are some lag issues that I look forward to being fixed. The arena is fun if you have friends to play with, or just in a public lobby where strangers can join in the middle of the game and leave whenever. I can only assume the local co-op is just as great as online with no lag. The steam workshop is a great add-on to include endless amounts of fun playing with maps and arenas. I think that the part where you sell heads and weapons on steam trades is pretty much useless on how easy it is to get them.			"

												Gather around children, take a seat and shut your faces as I tell you about the grandest Theater ever to exist out on a desolent island. The Battleblock Theater is here to entertain you with death defying feats by one of our many prisonerrs, er I mean performers. Best of all we place all there lives in your hands so it will be up to you if they awe inspire the audience by taking them across the stage in a grand blaze of glory, or having them fall hideously to there agonizing and hilarious deaths! We even allow 2 performers to take the stage at once for even more spectacular feats, and if you feel like your partner is nothing more then a  pile of stinky horse turds go ahaid and shove him into that pool of lava over there because this Theater is totally Co-optional! Don't worry about our performers either, we have so many more happy, ready and willing to take there deceased pals place on the stage! So buckle those seat, belts and tie up your purple laced shoes because this is one Theater you wont want to miss! I've also heard people who don't attend are stupidheads and nobody wants to be a stupidhead right?			"

												I was honestly really skeptical of BattleBlock Theater in the beginning, but I had to buy it simply because of the trailer. I have played through the story on co-op and have gotten all As and A+s except for one B. Let me be the first to say I was absolutely wrong to be skeptical. This game got my expectations, blew them out of the water, caught them, pooped on them, then punched them into spikes and lava. It is an absolutely amazing game to play co-op. I would recommend getting this game even if you do not enjoy platformers, though I would suggest getting someone to play it with. Single player is still very fun.Pros:-Difficult levels. They start easy but get much harder later on.-Co-op is fun and works well for the most part (will explain in cons).-Steamworks and player-created levels.-Smooth controls and very easy to learn.-Nice controller support.-Good and well-made game mechanics, but still very silly and enjoyable.-Some gems and yarn (collectibles) are difficult to find and get.-A lot of different faces to unlock.Cons:-Keyboard controls aren't the best, but are tolerable. (Me and my girlfriend went through all of co-op, her on a keyboard, so very much doable and tolerable, but controller is recommended)-Boulders. If you are playing with an internet friend that is relatively far from you (probably 100-150 ms), the non-host can sometimes be killed by simply picking up a boulder and doing nothing with it. -Yarn becomes useless after a while. It is used to purchase weapons, but you can buy all of your weapons by chapter 5 or so.-Not a lot of replay value aside community maps.-Some weapons are essentially useless, but can still be fun to mess around with.Overall 9.5/10. One of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long while. It's honestly just pure, straight fun. Especially when I can punch my girlfriend into spikes.			"

												This s no Super Meat Boy, this is a good original game. But playing by your self is half the fun. Co-op mode will change how you play with friends. You will work together in storymode and you will create teams to go against each other. This is my favorite game ever. You should buy it right now.			"

												Great & funny platformer. The solo campaign could be compared to Super Meat Boy except it's not as merciless and doesn't require that much incredible precision. Don't be fooled by the easy first chapters, it does crank up the difficulty around the middle of the game. There's also puzzle influences with lots of levels utilizing switches. The co-op campaign seemed fun too, with hilarious friendly fire accidents. The arena modes induced lots of yelling with the 2v2 local multiplayer modes that were more like chaotic brawler games instead of skilled platforming. Since there's an editor built-in you can play random assortments of uploaded levels if you find the official levels dull.In addition to the gameplay, the main draw of the game is the comedy side. The story makes no sense but it's really entertaining, mostly thanks to the narrator. The cartoony animated artstyle is great (very similar to Castle Crashers), the soundtrack is awesome and the excellent constant narrator quips make everything funny. There's hundreds of stupid looking unlockable heads to collect. Check the Steam store trailer to see if the game's particular style of wacky lolrandom crazy works for you.As a pure platformer I'd most likely gotten bored before finishing the game, but the cartoony aesthetics carried it and I finished the main story because every raving cutscene after a chapter is a treat. The 4-person couch arena chaos is a fine addition to Broforce and Gang Beasts evenings.			"

												If for nothing else's Stamper's sense of humor makes this game a must buy.I feel the reason I enjoyed the game so much is seeing how insane and difficult it gets over time. Then when you get to the final chapter, everything requires lots and lots of timing. Some parts felt like a trail-and-error game play to get through the level, but other times had you sit and examine how to best complete a task in an individual level.The music was great and I loved the end game songs too.As for challenging, playing up some levels on the Steam Workshop or the bonus levels is always a nice way to test your skill.I think my favorite part is the huge cat motif the game carries, cats, cats as far as any furball can see.

												Killing your friends has never been this fun. Punch them into death lasers, freeze them and then shove them into water, or feed them to a giant raccoon monster. This zany platformer bursting at the seams with action, puzzles that aren't too difficult, tons of unlockable heads and weapons, and nonsensical arena modes that will put you to the test is no doubt one of the most fun and enjoyable games I've played in a long time. The comedy is what would be expected if you've played Castle Crashers; if you haven't played it, all you need to know is that the narration is full of just enough hilarity to keep you laughing the entire time.In other words: Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pick up this game now.

												It's about time I can play a game and actually stick to it without closing it out every 30 minutes becasue I'm bored. (In this case it's becasue I'm yelling to loud and dizzyness begins to slither in.) But, I am proud to say that this game is not only fun and stresfull it is bound to keep you in the game for atleast an hour.  I really like games with Steam Workshop so after you people who just like to rush through the game there is still sorta something to play next. I don't mind spending hours and hours and hours on this game becasue not only are the level designs nice and stargtistic, they are pretty mind boggoling and any move could send you to your death. I haven't found anything TOO bad with the game, but the check-point system is a bit out and place, but it comes to show that you should think/wait before you act. I enjoy the character edit system (although I really recommend you should make your own character.) If you love Side-Scrollers with Co-op, this game is for you.Oh and be prepared for alot of laughter. So grab a friend :P			"

												This is what happens when you throw Portal 2 and Super Meat Boy in a blender and facepaint it with Castle Crashes.Nice Game. Feels very organic and freshly aired. Fast paced. Makes you twitch you Angus as you try to make leaps of faith in the brink of a second. Complemented by an Announcer that makes you feel warm and cared for in the scenery of a muppets movie. Not to mention the online action you can have with replaceable human specimen to join you in shared anguish in the hunt for jewels.Cums with a shipload of levels and most importantly colletable hats and heads for leathal hatshots. And now after I received my complimentary gudmouthing paycheck, i listen to this for the rest of the day:

												Usually, I wait until I finish the single-player game to put out a review of a game. But I just had a co-op game with a relative of mine, and what I played was enough to clinch a recommendation out of me.This is Super Meat Boy lite - much smaller levels, much scaled back in terms of difficulty and without uber-hardcore gymnastic moves you have to pull to pass the levels (except for the ♥♥♥♥ing double-jump. Grrrrr.). Usually when a game goes ""It's like (insert game name here), but easier!"", it usually ends up playing like a damp squib, like a pat on the back and a reassurance that you are totally good at video games! Not so with Battleblock Theater. It has smaller levels, but they are more creatively designed, do more with their set of tricks, and the game itself has tons more atmosphere - mostly in the form of the Narrator, who makes silly quips to egg me on to continue playing. They could have ♥♥♥♥ed up and made him immensely irritating. But the writing and the delivery of said wrting straddles between irritating and flat, hitting the sweet spot between the two.And, most importantly - they've made different sets of levels for single and co-op experiences, which is all I need to recommend a co-op game to other people. Seriously, have you seen some of these co-op games? They pretend to have single player modes, but those modes are actually the co-op modes with a huge amount of restraint to keep from screaming ""YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY WITH OTHER PEOPLE? WHY NOT GO BACK TO READING BOOKS, YOU BIG DUMB FAT DORK, AND LEAVE THESE COOL VIDEO GAMES TO THE HIP FRIEND-HAVERS."" The fact that the developers actually bothered to create campaigns to differentiate between the two is an automatic recommendation by itself. Kudos, The Behemoth. Battleblock Theater is the game for co-op hating people who want to play the game without friends, and then play later with friends if they so choose!			"

												My first views on the game were slightly muddled being relatively new to steam and 'indie' games but after watching some online (multiplayer) gameplay my attention was drawn to the lay out (format) of the maps and challenges that followed. Alongside the fact I had heard it was an amazing game on the internet and through friends was what lead me to get BattleBlock Theatre.Positives:- Fantastic, interesting yet hilarious plot.- A wide variety of characters and powers/weapons achievable.- Each map is designed differently with chalanges such as fighting 'cats' and walking 'toast'.- There is always an aim/task at hand from completing maps on 'insane mode' to completing 'Furbottem's Features'.- How one uses the gems and balls of yarn they have collected through maps to buy new characters and weapons.- Online with friends is great with teamwork and completing maps causing much satisfaction.- Fubottem's Features is a great ad on with a much wanted character as the prize for completing the specific chapter.Negatives:- There are only 8 chapters. At least make it 10!- As much as it is a great game for many the £10.99 pound price tag on steam may be too much. To conclude I think by far the positives in BBT out match the negatives. It is by a mile my favourite platform and indie game of 2014. The 28 hours I have played so far have been unbelievably fun having completed all 8 chapters of the plot and Furbottom's Features.  "

It has smaller levels, but they are more creatively designed, do more with their set of tricks, and the game itself has tons more atmosphere - mostly in the form of the Narrator, who makes silly quips to egg me on to continue playing. They could have ♥♥♥♥ed up and made him immensely irritating. But the writing and the delivery of said wrting straddles between irritating and flat, hitting the sweet spot between the two.And, most importantly - they've made different sets of levels for single and co-op experiences, which is all I need to recommend a co-op game to other people. Seriously, have you seen some of these co-op games? They pretend to have single player modes, but those modes are actually the co-op modes with a huge amount of restraint to keep from screaming ""YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY WITH OTHER PEOPLE? WHY NOT GO BACK TO READING BOOKS, YOU BIG DUMB FAT DORK, AND LEAVE THESE COOL VIDEO GAMES TO THE HIP FRIEND-HAVERS."" The fact that the developers actually bothered to create campaigns to differentiate between the two is an automatic recommendation by itself. Kudos, The Behemoth. Battleblock Theater is the game for co-op hating people who want to play the game without friends, and then play later with friends if they so choose!			"

												I'd say this is another great hit from The Behemoth! It's a very intense platformer, particularly if you've got a ""go big or go home"" attitude like myself and try to do hardcore mode. The difficulty progression is fairly cozy; it doesn't hold your hand, but eventually you're going to have to do quite a bit of thinking to try and get some decent scores. Absolute tons of character heads to get if you're a customization-savvy person, as well as several weapons to use, although they aren't as useful as I'd like them to be. Trying to get those perfect scores and find the hidden gems gets really tough, but you feel pretty accomplished once you find them all and can still speed your way through the level fast enough. Co-op is really fun as well, with different challenges so you can enjoy a whole new world of levels with a friend.The voice acting is phenomal, as I would expect from Stamper. The story-line is fairly light, but still hilarious with said VA. Music isn't something I usually comment on, as I don't really pay attention to it for whatever reason, but I really enjoyed the sound-track. Various songs on each of the levels,Graphically, it's pretty similar to any of The Behemoth's other games; not to say that's a bad thing. It's very good, with plenty of dynamic animations everywhere to keep your attention to what's going on. As usual, a nice, clean, consistent look to it, and overall looks great.TL;DR - If you enjoy challenging but rewarding platformers, and are looking for something new and interesting, I definitely recommend Battleblock Theater.

												Before I bought this game I didn't expect much if I'll be honest, but I wanted it anyways because it looked pretty fun and adorable! And when I finally managed to buy it.. My oh my I was surprised! It was amazing! I laughed so much during the cutscenes, I raged during the frustrating levels especially on insane mode, man that's frustrating as heck omo, and the ending.... I just.. ;_; HWAAAAH--Okey, sorry about that, sometimes I go crazy when I think about sad things.. o_oSo anyways, you can play multiplayer! Two for Co-Op and up to four for versus mode! You can kill your friends or keep them as your slaves~ What the heck did I just say.. And you can trade prisoner heads! WatOverall this game is FANTASTIC! I really recommend that you buy it whenever you get the chance because it's gonna be so worth it! It can trigger all of your feelings at the same time whatever that means and you will love it!So, that's about it! If you really spent time reading this whole review, I'll have you know that I really appreciate it! ^w^			"

												One of my most favorite games to date, and is one of the few who has 100% completed the game and has all heads; including all the special heads.The gameplay notoriously difficult, especially in the insane modes of both solo and co-op. But, in the end, it was well worth it; as long you're patient, stay calm and persistent in at least finishing the campaign.Has a really nice story, though I don't want to spoil it if you haven't played through the campaign completely.Highly recommend for people who likes to fight through the frustration. Don't give up on completing the game!			"

												BattleBlock Theatre is a bright looking, challenging 2D platformer that doesn't take itself to serious.Story:You and your friends get stranded, and somehow you end up being imprisoned in a theatre by a bunch of cats.The goal is to free Hatty Hattington by performing your way through the theatre.The narrator with all of it's sarcastic comments and humor often cheered me up.GameplayYou can either play this solo or in co-op mode with up to 3 friends.I did enjoy the solo mode, but seeing a friend gifted this to me so we could play together I've mostly played co-op with him, and I don't regret it at all: We had a blast!~On normal modes you can activate checkpoints and have an infinite amount of lives... You can also push other people around, annoy them by trapping and, well, killing them.Especially when you're also talking on teamspeak (For me the in-game voicechat had some kind of annoying echo) you sometimes can't stop laughing due to failing/seeing the other fail, push them off once they finally make it, etc. etc.Seeing most levels don't have a time limit. and there's no game-over, you don't have to feel guilty about it either: There's no consequence whatsoever, except that they have to run back from whatever the last safepoint was.There are a LOT of ways to customise your character: With the gems you collect in the levels you can buy heads in a certain shape, though it's always a surprise how the head you get will look like.You can also buy weapons: There's a firebolt that sets monsters, and friends, on fire. The downside is that they can spread the fire.There's an iceblockcannon that, well, turns things into iceblocks.My favourite weapon was a frog with a hat... That'd run around until he explodes.OverallAn awesomely fun platformer with a perfect sense of humor you just have to give a try.Wether you enjoy the story mode, or mess around in one of the other modes, you are almost guaranteed to have a good time!http://backlogbattle.blogspot.nl/2016/01/battleblock-theatre.htmlPlease also check out Completing the Backlog's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

 BattleBlock Theater®  Great arcade game creators of Castle Crashers with a combination of platformer and puzzle game. The plot is simple and very funny, told by a narrator. In the game, we get on a mysterious island inhabited by evil cats, which are holding their prisoners that they took part in a deadly performances. Our goal is to survive and make it through to the grand final. The game features single player, co-op and two difficulty levels, normal and insane. The Arena features online co-op or versus in nine different modes. You can also play the levels made by other players or create your własnt track with obstacles. In the game you can also unlock new characters and weapons for diamonds or yarn balls collected during the game. Battleblock is a great production, a great voice of the narrator, brilliant soundtrack, beautiful and colorful graphics and great controls make this game really good game. In my opinion this is one of the best platform games I've ever played and what I am able to recommend. "

Battleblock Theatre is an incredibly enjoyable platformer that is enjoyable both solo or co-op. The Steam integration with it is fairly unique for a third-party title and allows a new way of building your collection of prisons and your arsenal, although the ability to import your own custom heads makes the market feel slightly redundant if you use it. The level creator allows for endless replay-ability with the Steam workshop, and the brilliant narration just seal’s the deal and adds to the overall charm of the game.Summary:+ Charming art style.+ Fantastic writing and narration.+ Great Steam integration.+ Brilliant co-op mode.+ Great level editor.- Custom content makes Steam integration feel redundant.- Combat feels slightly clunky.

												Why? Why, didn't I buckle my pants. now its everywhere, my excitement that is! BattleBlock Theater is the newest (and coolest) game from The Behemoth yet! It uses the same familiar art style combined with, in my opinion gameplay that feels like Castle Crashers and Super Meat Boy had a baby. Its great and coupled with a huge variety of co-op and pvp game modes makes for hours of fun. If hours aren't enough though BattleBlock Theater comes with its own ""in house"" level and playlist creator, if you want even more customization though the game has a bunch of weapons and hundreds of character heads but BattleBlock Theater even comes with the feature to import your own character head as easy as drag 'n' drop! BattleBlock Theater is worth your time whether you are a fan of The Behemoths games or platformers in general, try BattleBlock. A fair warning though you really should buckle your pants. No double buckle them because your gonna need it!			"

												BattleBlock Theater made its debut in 2013, where it was released on the Xbox Live Marketplace. Finally coming to the PC in 2014, nothing has really been added to the core formula. However, the presentation is still wacky and irreverent; the platforming remains fun, and the level-editor is just as approachable as ever. Combine this with Steam Workshop integration, and you have a cute platformer that will keep you and your friends entertained for quite sometime.Hatty Hattington, glorious leader and “best friend to one and all”, leads a crew of mates with humourously-shaped heads aboard the SS Friendship. That’s right - a ship, filled with friends. Friendship. Even after this very first, very blunt joke, it becomes almost unsurprisingly obvious that Castle Crashers masterminds The Behemoth are behind 2D puzzle-platformer BattleBlock Theatre, as they serve up some familiar slapstick♥♥♥♥♥tongue-in-cheek banter the way they know best: via garish and whimsical characters, button bashing brilliance, and diarrhea-infused humour. After a tumultuous voyage across the ocean, the SS Friendship runs aground on a mysterious uncharted island run by evil cats. Brought to life by the amazing narration of Will Stamper, we learn that the peninsula is controlled by a colony of nasty prison-keeping cats, hellbent on abducting the ship’s remaining crew, and pitting them against a series of twisted challenges for their amusement within a makeshift theatre. Placing their trust in Hatty to save the day, the crew are amazed to discover he has flipped allegiances, but do become inherently suspicious of the evil-looking, yet entirely stylish, glowing red tophat he has forcibly acquired since crash landing on the island.This rather bizarre setup paves way for the hundreds of levels, which make up the majority of the game. The theater motif finds its way into the game’s layout as well; worlds (which are referred to as acts) are composed of nine or so individual levels (stages), and each world ends with a ‘finale’ level. Each level plays out on a theater stage, with catlike silhouettes creeping in the foreground, standing in for a ‘virtual’ audience. It’s all window dressing, sure, but this attention to detail and unwavering dedication to keep the player engaged is what makes BattleBlock Theater stand out from the rest of the platforming pack. It’s ironic given how creative the setup is that the actual gameplay is simple, but what BattleBlock Theater might lack in novel mechanics and flashy gameplay is made up for with tight controls and excellent level design. Every level is laid out on what is essentially a grid, with various block types making up the floors and walls you maneuver your little avatar on. Some blocks might launch the character into the air or explode after a second or two, while others allow them to climb up or slide down walls. It’s actually quite impressive how much level variety the developers have managed to curate with a fairly limited set of tools, but the game’s nuance and depth becomes more apparent the deeper into the campaign you get. A mere triplicate of gems are required to unlock the exit in each level, but there tends to be a minimum of six in the stage. Plus a roll of yarn, which can be traded with corrupt feline guards in exchange for special weapons. These are handy for dispensing with roaming enemies that lurk in certain portions of some stages, but some also have additional uses like the gun which fires a sticky pellet that can provide you with an additional, temporary platform. One of the PC version’s tweaks is the ability to carry a pair of these weapons and switch between them.If you want to get the elusive A+ grade and all of Stamper’s praise, it’s also necessary to finish each stage within a time limit. Early on, this happens practically by default, but (if you’re anything like me) you’ll quite rapidly turn into the school kid who knows he’s smart but feels like just coasting along on A’s and the occasional B rather than putting in the extra effort. If you’ve got the supple reflexes necessary for completing all of the Encore stages with an A+, then I salute you. If you can do it on Insane Mode (which removes all checkpoints, meaning any death returns you to the start of a stage) then you may very well be a witch of some kind.Your incentive for hunting down more gems is that they can be exchanged for one of BattleBlock Theater’s hundreds of prisoner heads. The heads come in all shapes and forms, so if you hoard enough gems the start of every level can be an identity crisis of your own making.BattleBlock Theater wouldn’t feel right if you weren’t able to tackle the game with a friend by your side, and The Behemoth hasn’t forgotten its Castle Crashers roots. Playing the campaign solo works perfectly fine, but BattleBlock was designed with co-op in mind, and it shows. There’s a great sense of urgency and pressure when playing co-op; not only will you have to work together in order to succeed, but collecting every gem and beating par times will require excellent teamwork.There's good fun to be had in competition, too. Up to four players can duke it out in a handful of match types, both in free-for-all or in teams. Standard modes like King of the Hill and a basic challenge mode (essentially time attack) are rounded out with more creative ones, such as ‘Horse’, which tasks you with stealing the opposing team’s horses and riding them back to your own goal. Another favourite of mine was ‘Ball Game’, which is BattleBlock’s minimalist take on basketball. The multiplayer mode is complemented by robust matchmaking options, allowing you to play both online and off, with playlist modes mixing different multiplayer modes into one, well, playlist. To cap things off, there’s a robust level editor at your disposal, which provides you with the exact same toolset that The Behemoth used. Since each level and arena was designed with the same set of block types, it’s remarkably easy to break down your favourite layouts and incorporate them into your own custom design.In essence, BattleBlock Theater is not without its frustrating moments, but such is the nature of all puzzle platformers. Any negatives noted here exist, but are slight and surely nothing more than minor blips in what is a very rewarding, very well presented, and very enjoyable and hilariously funny puzzle platformer. As the landscape of these types of games becomes increasingly bigger, it’s nice to see a game strive so hard for innovation. And in doing so can make the player feel like the cat who got the cream. Perhaps I should leave the jokes to The Behemoth experts....

												I was first hesistant to buy this game, but once it was on sale, I thought it wouldn't hurt to purchase it. In reality, I should of bought this game earlier no matter what price it was! This game is an awesome platformer and has a variety in level design. Some of the levels have tricky obstacles and require some thinking before going through them. What's even better is that you can play co-op with a friend. Trust me when I say this - I was laughing out loud as my friend and I played through each level and somehow killed each other or did something very stupid.In conclusion, this game gets my approval! After only playing about 4 hours of this game, I can say that it is well worth the money! If you are a fan of platformers and like challenges, then this is the game for you!			"

												BattleBlock theater is another amazing game by The Behemoth, the team which brought us Castle Crashers.From the very beginning, it captures the viewer with a simple, but quirky story which sets the stage (pun not intended) for the events of the game. Will Stamper brings it to life with his purposefully over-the-top silly, purposefully awkward narration style which he does better than anyone else.Gameplay is simplistic, but the levels are structured in a way which keeps you challenged by constantly providing new problems to solve. You will feel motivated to collect all of the gems and balls of yarn in a level, and try to beat the clock, before advancing to the next.BattleBlock Theater is not the first platform game of this type, but it is by far the one with the most polish. It features a good story, hilarious narration, large amounts of player customization, and creative level design.I only hope that The Behemoth decides to give their Steam release a higher priority for their next game. I was waiting in agony for both Castle Crashers, and then BattleBlock Theater!			"

												God where do I start with this game... A hilarious adventure through chambers of death with your best friend would probably be the best way.The narrator is one of my favorite parts lots of funny lines to keep your entertained all the way through.The platforming is process and the levels extrememly well made but you can experience a bug now and then.Multiplayer campagne is basically the singleplayer levels with a small twist here and there so im slightly disapointed but it makes up for it in the different multiplayer game modes.Its also suprisingly long for a game of this price ive been playing for over 12 hours and im still not done plus workshop will make it even longer.Finally the collectibles: SO MANY TO GET! A ton of heads, around 9 weapons and trading compatible will lead to good times.9/10 I would say buy it when you can.			"

												This game is genius hahahahaha, it has been a while since I laughed so much while playing a game. I truly recommend it if you like platformers! Or platformers with ENEMIES! AND FRIENDS! AND FRIENDS THAT ARE MORE LIKE ENEMIES! And even MORE if you like MULTIPLAYER ENEMY... Friends?Bottom line chap, if you're reading this and not getting this game you are missing out on quite the adventure! Hurry up and gather all your friends and enemies to play BattleBlock Theater! Story mode is quite delightfully and morbidly entertaining too... but mostly fun!Also jokes, a jokemaster must have made this game, you will cry... of laughter! ... maybe? GET BATTLEBLOCK THEATER! THE ADVENTURE AWAITS YOU (and maybe possibly enem... friends!!!)			"

This game is absolutely bonkers! And I mean that in a good way! Very funny, very random, and a blast to jut sit down and play to watch the sillyness occur. I would definitely recommend this game to others. The only drawback, in my opinion, it needs tons more gore, like castle crashers.			"

												This game is a perfect deminstration of how to teach a player properly. Besides basic controls, it's up to the player to figure out how to play. Personally, this adds depths to all games. If you can play a game, get better at it only because it makes you better by observing and trying first hand, it's probably got a better shot than those that don't. Also, Stamper is the greatest thing that ever happened on the Earth.			"

												If you are looking for a platformer ths is the game for you. It has nice level designs and if you don't want to play by yourself, don't worry because there is a some minigames you could play with four people or you could play with another friend to play campaign. (4 players - minigames) ( 2 players - campaign). There is a whole bunch of cool items you can get and also a rediculous amount of heads. ( also if you get castle crashers you will have a head of the knight, and also so you can play as hatty in castle crashers).I would rate this game 9/10 because one thing i had a problem was bad respawns on co op campaign. Also if you like games wih stories you would like the beginning but not the end. This game will make you laugh and have a experience that you never had before. I think that this is one of the best platformers ever.			"

												Buckle your pants extra tight for this game. This game is a big ball of fun, happiness, colors, hats, and more fun all rolled up together. You play as a person betrayed by your best friend and imprisioned by cats. The cats force you to put on these elaborate shows (The levels) for their entertainment. Out of the box its a fun simple quirky platformer. The first levels are simple, but they do good to explain the simple mechanics of the game. The single player is quite long and gets pretty hard. I recommend playing this with a friend. friends will also enjoy the insane multiplayer arena. The arena features a wide variety of amazing minigames. You can play with a few friends or random people online or if you have no friends there are bots. There is also a level editor that works with steam workshop. I have not used that in the full release but is looks quite fun. I was interestd in this game when it was just for Xbox, and quickly signed up for the PC beta when it was announced. This game is soo worth a try. There is a slice of fun for everyone.			"

												BattleBlock Theater would have to be one of the best video games that i have ever played. It's got a great storyline where the main character Hatty Hattington wear's this hat that makes him EVIL!!!!!! (Not trying to ruin the storyline) but that is in chapter 1. You can get gems to buy cool heads (circle, square, triangle, cylinder and star heads.) You can also receive ball of yarns to get weapons that defeat the enimies (5 ball of yarns each weapon.) As i said before this would have to be one of the best video games that i have ever played!			"

												With the style of 'Castle Crashers' and the platforming fludity of 'Fancy Pants' it creates something beautiful.The point of friendship in this game is use them or be used , simple. However if you love throwing your friends into large vats of purple goo , you can do so. The character customability is unlocked through spending the in game currency 'gems' which unlocks some rather funny hats and accessories.BattleBlock Theater is not perfect, however it has alot of good fun and classic play time.

												This truly is a good game, though be warned this is a platform game, you are performing scence infront of a audience, like foul play (*and this is the only way it is like foul play!). You have to go through stages completing different challenges along the way. One welcome feature in this game is the level editor feature, with that as is sounds you can create your own levels and you can play along with freinds once the level is published and laugh at your freinds trying to work out how to survive.My main issue with the game is the 1 life restart feature.To put it simply if you die once you have to gather all the items again.Personally I would have a 2-3 life per level and grade the person on how many of their lifes they use.Highly reccomended but be warned this game is nothing like Castle Crashers so don't buy it expecting to be.

												This game is more fun when playing Co-Op but without a stable internet connection this is a small problem. The game has a rather twist when the storyline is being told. It's both comedy and a sense of despair in it as you try to save your friends while becoming part of a show to cats watching a theater as the name of the game is called. Overall the game is worth playing it either solo or in co-op. The graphics remind me of Castle Crashers and the music sits the enviornment.I would give it a 9.5 out of 10. It's worth buying the Ultra Baby's Co-op Chaos Pack for you and a friend to enjoy together.			"

												This is an abridged review!  The full written review can be viewed at http://coasterdude.moonfruit.com/#/video-game-reviews/4579924389/BattleBlock-Theater-Steam-Edition-Review/8472882.The Behemoth have returned with another game that will blow your pants off, so be sure to keep them buckled.  The game I'm referring to is the Steam edition of  “BattleBlock Theater,” a unique platformer filled with more than enough content.  This game takes the iconic game mechanic of “press A to jump,” and twists it into a brand new experience.  It takes place on an island of prisoners that have been imprisoned by cats where they are then forced to participate in deadly stage productions that require a lot of battling and a lot of blocks.Each level is linear, but requires you to find at least 3 gems that happen to be scattered throughout the level to unlock the exit.  There are at least 5 gems to find, and a majority of the gems are hidden inside mini-puzzles that deviate from the main path of the level.  This gives each level a much needed sense of complexity.  More importantly, the 3 gems that are required to exit the level are usually placed in spots that are almost impossible to miss.  To give the player the motivation for finding more than 3 gems, the game allows the player to use gems to purchase additional characters to play as.  However, I rarely felt compelled to find gems for the sake of a new character.  I honestly loved finding gems because of the feeling of satisfaction that I'd get from finding them in the first place.  This system of reward for exploration is astoundingly perfect.  Players that feel the need to collect as many gems as possible are well rewarded, and players that don't want to collect all of the gems are not punished.In addition, each level has 1 ball of golden yarn, and a majority of the levels contain combative cats.  The cats I'm referring to are the enemies of the game.  Their primary purpose in life seems to be to stop the player from getting to the exit via fireballs, bouncing balls, nerf guns, etc.  Although some of the cats are placed in spots where they can easily be killed by solving a minor puzzle, there are times where the player can be ambushed and must defend themself.  This game has many weapons that the player can use to attack or defend with.  Each weapon can be purchased with 5 balls of golden yarn, and each ball of golden yarn is found within the hardest mini-puzzle of each level.  Although getting 5 balls of golden yarn for just one weapon seems like too much effort, the reward is great.  The ability to kill a cat by throwing an exploding paper airplane at them is one of the greatest satisfactions to be had from this game.When playing a level, there is a chance of a golden hat randomly popping up somewhere.  If the golden hat is found and taken to the exit, the player is rewarded with 10 gems.  However, this is harder than it sounds because dying will cause the player to drop the hat.  If the hat is ever dropped in water, which is abundant, the hat is lost forever.  Not to mention that dying is very common in this game.  This game finds the perfect balance between having fun and being challenging.  Although it can be incredibly hard to get to the end of a level, The Behemoth make dying in this game an easy thing to handle.  This is thanks to the checkpoint system in the game.  There are many checkpoints placed on the way to the exit, so any progress lost due to a death is not too irritating.  However, for the maniacs out there, The Behemoth gives the player the option to play the whole game on just one life.  This option is called “Insane Mode” and is justly named.Where the game truly shines is in its co-op campaign.  Although the solo and co-op campaigns are similar, the co-op levels are more fun and more hilarious the whole way through.  Each death stops being a punishment and becomes an excuse to laugh at your friend's failure.  This laughter is usually followed by the death of the laugher's character.  Solving puzzles in the co-op campaign are infinitely more fun that solving the puzzles in the solo campaign.  There truly is something magical to be felt whenever a puzzle is solved with two minds as opposed to just one.  However, the co-op campaign has one huge problem that hinders how much fun the campaign could actually be.  Although the checkpoint system still exists in the co-op campaign, the game seems rather confused about where to respawn  characters.  These respawn areas usually end up being next to the co-op partner, at the latest checkpoint, or at the previous checkpoint.  This can end up in some puzzles being solved earlier than they should or some players spawning farther back than they should.  Either of those scenarios don't seem fair.  Thankfully, even with the respawn problem, the co-op campaign never stops being fun, even in the last 2 chapters.One of the greatest parts about the campaign mode actually has to be the plot.  That may seem like a silly thing to praise about a platformer, but the plot was surprisingly well made for this game.  Giving any of it away would be a spoiler, but how the plot is exposed is what makes it so much fun.  Each cutscene in the game is animated wonderfully and contains some of the funniest narration I have ever heard in a video game.  Each cutscene is shown at the end of a chapter, so each cutscene feels like a well-deserved reward.  The ending definitely has to be one of the most enjoyable endings I've ever seen in a video game and will definitely be creating a new fad of belt-buckling.Aside from the campaign mode, there are also many competitive multiplayer modes that can be played by up to 4 people, but most of them fell flat for me.  They can all be described as unfair and chaotic in a bad way.  For example, there's a gamemode called “Challenge” which simply let's two teams race to the end of a level.  The team that takes the least amount of times wins.  As fun as that may sound, playing that mode was severely disappointing to me.  This was mainly because the two teams do not race at the same time.  One team goes while the other watches.  This is a major problem because a majority of the time spent on a level is puzzle-solving.  In this scenario, the team going second will always have the upper hand.  However, the “Muckle” and “Ball Game” modes are rather fun to play.  “Muckle” is simply a team deathmatch mode, which is hard to screw up, and “Ball Game” is a unique take on basketball.  However, there are many multiplayer modes out there in the gaming world that these multiplayer modes simply cannot compete with.If you feel like this game needs more content, then you should know that there's even a level creator.  The level creator is a very useful tool that will give this game the longevity that it deserves.  Even if you're not the creative type, created levels can be downloaded.  Chances are that this game will give you many puzzles to solve and many platforms to jump on for a long time to come.“BattleBlock Theater: Steam Edition” is a very refreshing take on a genre that has been flooded with games.  Not only is the story worth noting, but the levels are as well.  This game is challenging, but rarely stops being fun.  The co-op campaign adds a whole knew level of hilarity and fun that most co-op campaigns miss.  The level creator  definitely gives me a reason to keep checking back on the game once in a while.  However, the competitive multiplayer modes left a bad taste in my mouth.  Overall, this is definitely a game worth jumping for joy about.			"

												I had always seen this on YouTube and everything else during last year (when it was released on Xbox 360), but I didn't own an Xbox, so I was a bit frustrated because I knew that The Behemoth had worked on this for a very long time, and I especially liked Castle Crashers. So, now it's been released on Steam a year later, and I completely believe that it was worth the wait. I appreciate the amount of love and effort was put into this game, and making it unlike any other game I've played (yes, it's a platformer, but it's more than that). The only thing I can criticize is the amount of players on the ""Online"" mode. This might just be because people are in Private Lobbies, but I'm not sure. Even if that's not the case, it has nothing to do with the quality of the game.        The storyline is fantastic (in my opinion) and it shows character (just like Castle Crasher's did, but with actual narration. Probably more so.). I enjoyed the narrator (StampyTV) throughout the entire game, and laughed a bit each time he had something to say. The multiplayer is great. Unlike their previous title (Castle Crashers), Battleblock Theater has many more gamemodes (both Co-op and competitive). All of them are fairly entertaining. I highly encourage any fans of Castle Crashers or platformers to take a look at this game, and perhaps buy it if they haven't already!			"

												First few levels are pretty easy, but then it gets difficult pretty fast. Don't worry if you have a hard time with it. Everyone does, but everyone always goes back to it. The levels are made differently for two players that add a little more of a challenge. Either way it's fun. While Castle Crashers is massively more fun with friends, this game is good on its own.Pros:-Challenging, but addictive.-Super cute art style-Fantastic music!-Narrator is hilarious. The opening scene itself was worth the admission.-Custom heads!-You get a Hatty knight for Castle Crashers!-Game is easy to run on toasters. Very few frame drops in multiCons:-May get too difficult and frustrating for casual players			"

												A magical gay  adventure you can experience with friends.(On a serious note, yes just buy it!)Even if you're like me, a person who in general gets bored of platformers fast this game will keep you intreasted for a while, specialy if you can get a friend with you to play along in co-op.It has tons of levels with brilliant level design.a level maker tool , a good variety of items, lots of types of environmental hazards/enemies to avoid and the most bizar and funny announcer ever, taken straight from the awesome short flash ""The fairy wish prince""One of the best platformers iv'e played in a while.

												+BattleBlock is a platformer with single player and 2 player co-op, also 4 player arena mode. The levels go easy to hard with 8 differnt chapters with 13 levels in each one of them. You collect gems and golden yarn balls that you can trade in for differnt player heads and a varitey of weapons. The voice acting in this game was fantastic, also the level designs were interesting and very challenging during the end. I spent about 20ish hours completing the game with a few breaks. There is also level deisgn which is simple enough to use. I made my first level in about 30ish minutes. I'd rate the game alone about 9/10.-The game does have alot of bugs when it comes to multiplayer. It's not very lenient with higher ping players. I myself have around 150 ping on a regular bases. When it came to pulling up players it made them spin and then fall. Collecting gems and golden yarn was also a problem it wouldn't count towards the score, I never did find out where they went. I also wish their were more customazion like maybe ramps or differnt styled blocks you could use in workshop levels. Which don't get me wrong this game is fantastic but higher ping players have a hard time enjoying multiplayer. Oh and don't forget ""Buckle yo pants"" for hatty!			"

												You already know how good the game is on the XBLA version, but how about the port? It took the behemouth 6 years to port castle crashers over and the key bindings were not that great. I believe they've bettered themselves with porting over to the PC because I was able to bind my keys the way that I wanted, and the overlay tutorial for using said key functions for certain things, whether it be punching cats into water or sploding yourself, or purchasing an eyeball from the store.        These are the things you need to look for when purchasing Battleblok theater including the options, they are rather minimalistic as any normal 2D sidescrolling game, you got options for turning down the teture qualitly of the background, Vsync options thank goodness including multiple sound options and optimises for the narrator and audience as you play(I reccomend keeping Stampers voice tunred on for the main enjoyement of the game)      as the port stands I say it does pretty good, I was still able to enjoy the game and the combat is smooth as it ever will be.the one gripe I guess I have about it is for some reason you have to hold down two keys to climb up the ladders, one to hold on and another to move. Other than that, it's a pretty awesome game and I reccomend you go check it out.     Oh and one more thing before I go. BUCKLE YOUR PANTS!			"

There's a Single Player Mode, and Co-Op mode and a ton of game modes. You can download user-created levels and make your own levels if you're bored. If you're stuck on a level, invite a friend!

												I was first hesistant to buy this game, but once it was on sale, I thought it wouldn't hurt to purchase it. In reality, I should of bought this game earlier no matter what price it was! This game is an awesome platformer and has a variety in level design. Some of the levels have tricky obstacles and require some thinking before going through them. What's even better is that you can play co-op with a friend. Trust me when I say this - I was laughing out loud as my friend and I played through each level and somehow killed each other or did something very stupid.In conclusion, this game gets my approval! After only playing about 4 hours of this game, I can say that it is well worth the money! If you are a fan of platformers and like challenges, then this is the game for you!			"

It's a fun game on your own for ""completionist"" types, getting an A+ in every level is a blast, but this game gets really fun when you bring a friend. The ability to lightheartedly screw your ally over without consenquence is a perfect blend of cooperation and competition.			"

This game is absolutely bonkers! And I mean that in a good way! Very funny, very random, and a blast to jut sit down and play to watch the sillyness occur. I would definitely recommend this game to others. The only drawback, in my opinion, it needs tons more gore, like castle crashers.			"

												PLEASEEEE SAVE ME!~ I CAN'T STOP PLAYING!I love this game. The levels start out nice and easy and somewhere along the line they get pretty insane. Not to mention you can create your own levels and play others, so gameplay is endless. They also have weapons that allow you to find your own creative ways to get those gems!The story is great and the storyteller is AMAZINGLY (minus the 'ly').The best part is probably being able to play with a friend. Online is not as fluid as on the x-box at the moment (I might need to fix my network to work with steam matchmaking) but go plug in another controller and invite your friend over to play on one computer/profile. It's better to see them irl anyway.Hours of entertainment. Literally. I have just over 100 as I type this.OH! And the collectable heads! So much fun. You can even have custom ones!It's a blast ya see?			"

												In my opinion this is a fun game to Play. Its even better when you are playing with friends The game is a big puzzle were you have to save a character called hatty he is captured by furrys(idk what there called) and they put a hat on him which gives him evil powers inorder torment you with the puzzels. In order to complete a level you need to adleast get Three gems. But if you want bonus points get the rest of em inorder to gain more gems. Almost each level there is a yarn ball(there kinda secret to find but some are easy) after you complete 3 levels in a chapter it will take you outside where you have 2 options either got to the next level/chapter or you could spend your gems and yarn for heads and weapons. to get a Head it costs 10 Gems and the Weapons cost 5 Yarn balls.Also there are other gamemodes in the game to. such as VS or co-op where you can go 1v1 or 2v2 or even 2v1.The main story can also be co-op But teamwork is always requierd in this.So i hope my review has help you alot and enjoy playing :)			"

Story mode is quite delightfully and morbidly entertaining too... but mostly fun!Also jokes, a jokemaster must have made this game, you will cry... of laughter! ... maybe? GET BATTLEBLOCK THEATER!

												This game is everything I like in coop platforming.  Here's several reasons why you should buy this game:- Unlockables galore:  You can unlock countless different avatars to play as, and the functionality behind this is very satisfying.- Low-consequence hinjinx:  Messing with your friends is going to happen when you play coop.  Dying is okay!  At least in normal mode...- The Humor:  Oh my gosh this game is hilarious.  The narration is GOLD.  If you find the comedy style of the trailer engaging, you'll enjoy the chapter-completion monologues and the in-game commentary.- The Execution:  Executing platforming maneuvers in this game is extremely satisfying, both single player and coop!

A hilarious adventure through chambers of death with your best friend would probably be the best way.The narrator is one of my favorite parts lots of funny lines to keep your entertained all the way through.The platforming is process and the levels extrememly well made but you can experience a bug now and then.Multiplayer campagne is basically the singleplayer levels with a small twist here and there so im slightly disapointed but it makes up for it in the different multiplayer game modes.Its also suprisingly long for a game of this price ive been playing for over 12 hours and im still not done plus workshop will make it even longer.Finally the collectibles: SO MANY TO GET! A ton of heads, around 9 weapons and trading compatible will lead to good times.9/10 I would say buy it when you can.			"

												BattleBlock theater is another amazing game by The Behemoth, the team which brought us Castle Crashers.From the very beginning, it captures the viewer with a simple, but quirky story which sets the stage (pun not intended) for the events of the game. Will Stamper brings it to life with his purposefully over-the-top silly, purposefully awkward narration style which he does better than anyone else.Gameplay is simplistic, but the levels are structured in a way which keeps you challenged by constantly providing new problems to solve. You will feel motivated to collect all of the gems and balls of yarn in a level, and try to beat the clock, before advancing to the next.BattleBlock Theater is not the first platform game of this type, but it is by far the one with the most polish. It features a good story, hilarious narration, large amounts of player customization, and creative level design.I only hope that The Behemoth decides to give their Steam release a higher priority for their next game. I was waiting in agony for both Castle Crashers, and then BattleBlock Theater!			"

												BattleBlock Theater is good. Like, crazy good. Coming into the game having watched a few videos on it, I'd thought it would have been a nice time to just fool around and murder your friends and whatnot. I got that, but what I had expected should have been more. I underestimated just how fun the game was.You're given tight controls, clean and art that is very good to look at. The music fits the game very well and for me, personally, much like Newgrounds music does. I've found myself rather focused on the game itself to even notice the music, and when I do, Stamper's off, meowing a few times, or something. It's humourous, it's comical, the cutscenes are done in a pesudo-puppet show fashion and pulls out plenty of fun visual gags.The level design works very well for the platforming-puzzle mechanic is has going on, and each level seemingly has those optimal designs which makes killing your friends a breeze.The weapon seem simple at first, but they can be used to bend the game or make certain aspects easier, considering you're skilled enough to use them, which can make speedrunning much more viable.If you are going to play this game, however, Grab a Friend, and preferably one who is perfectly fine with dying a few times by your hands, and willing to do the same! It keeps things fun, the air light, and you'll be smiling and laughing all the way.			"

												Okay. This game is the best co-op game I've played, ever. The trailers are what led me to the game in the first place and Stampers narration will win you over immediately with it's goofy humor. The game has lots and lots of it. So I got it, and started playing it with my friends.First thing I noticed is that the music is amazing. It's the kind of music that you search for later on youtube just to listen it on your time off from Battleblock Theatre. Then we started playing. While the campaign is co-op the game allows you to screw over your partner at every opportunity which is encouraged by quick respawns and various hilarious ways to cause your friends demise. The levels are wonderfully designed, containing exceedingly cleverer puzzles and traps and more and more different situations to fail with laughter. The controls are precise and once you get good, you can pull off stuff you wouldn't believe. If that isn't yet enough, there are arena gamemodes which all feel different and polished as well from basketball to king of the hill to capture the horse. Then there are extra levels. Then there are the levels made by other players. Then there is the level editor.This game has made me laugh more then any other coop game and I've played a lot of them. Do yourself a favor and check this game out.			"

												Battleblock Theater is definitely best played with friends, just like Castle Crashers, but the singleplayer is just as fun, from what I've played. I had Castle Crashers on the Xbox, and loved it. The Castle Crashers art style is extremely similar, if not identical, and offers just as much fun. It's a great party game, and can provide hours of fun with your friends. On sale, it's definitely not a bad purchase, along with Castle Crashers.			"

												I usually absolutely suck at platformers. This game is no different. It is hard for those of you who lack the hand/eye co-ordination required to play. Luckily for me I have a friend to carry me through each level who is akin to a God. Amazing humour, amazing fun, very enjoyable...after you have raged and thrown your keyboard across the room.			"

												You literally run around as little people with who knows what head you'll choose to decorate yourself with and blow yourself and some cats up as you try and save your best friend. You can play with another friend and blow him up too. The humor is great, and the announcer is one amazing person. I've bought this game on Xbox and after seeing STEAM VERSION, I had to buy it again. Everything about this game is great. Except for Ferdinand. He's an a-hole.			"

												You already know how good the game is on the XBLA version, but how about the port? It took the behemouth 6 years to port castle crashers over and the key bindings were not that great. I believe they've bettered themselves with porting over to the PC because I was able to bind my keys the way that I wanted, and the overlay tutorial for using said key functions for certain things, whether it be punching cats into water or sploding yourself, or purchasing an eyeball from the store.        These are the things you need to look for when purchasing Battleblok theater including the options, they are rather minimalistic as any normal 2D sidescrolling game, you got options for turning down the teture qualitly of the background, Vsync options thank goodness including multiple sound options and optimises for the narrator and audience as you play(I reccomend keeping Stampers voice tunred on for the main enjoyement of the game)      as the port stands I say it does pretty good, I was still able to enjoy the game and the combat is smooth as it ever will be.the one gripe I guess I have about it is for some reason you have to hold down two keys to climb up the ladders, one to hold on and another to move. Other than that, it's a pretty awesome game and I reccomend you go check it out.     Oh and one more thing before I go. BUCKLE YOUR PANTS!			"

Do you like fun games with shiny, sparkly green gems?If you answered yes to all of those questions, buy this game right now, but if you're not convinced yet, let me lay it out for you...- A great 2D action platformer that is in the golden area between easy and difficult, being approachable while also packing harder challenges.- Perfectly functional and smooth on-line and local co-operative multiplayer; the stage designs even vary based on single or multiplayer!- Amusing writing that doesn't fall back on memes or vulgar humor to do its job; you can even adjust how often jokes are made!- Great music and art design, which is to be expected considering Behemoth was previously responsible for Castle Crashers.- Shiny, sparkly green gems!

												A Fun single / coop platformer with witty narration made by the company that made Castle Crashers.  Very similar to Playstation's Little Big Planet, except more cartoony looking.  Steam Workshop is a plus as well with many user made levels. You can also sell items you get in game in the Steam Market, if thats your thing.  Overall, BattleBlock Theater is a pretty fun game filled with laughs for any age.			"

												This game is totally worth the money. If you play it alone you will at least have 20-30 hours of gametime. If you try to get all the achievements you will have 50-100 hours of mixed feelings (happines, sadness, anger, pride, etc.). If you have friend that play the game you can have up to 200 hours of fun. Game mechanics are really good and it has a easy learning curve. When you pass the story you can go replay it for achievements and if you get bored with the story there are a lot of community levels. If you have a friend/s to play the game with you there is a co-op story and there are community maps aswell for co-op. There is an Arena with 8 different modes and you can play up to 4 players. If you ever get bored with the game there is a level editor that you should try out, its really easy to build levels.The only thing I was dissapointed with is that there are not a lot of players online, but that not a big deal because you can play with bots. So to end this review I would recomend this game 100%. Had a lot of fun playing it 10/10.			"

												BattleBlock Theater didn't seem that interesting at first, but when I first played it, I enjoyed it. BattleBlock Theater is a 2D game with  fun levels full of new things, and don't forget the parkour. The narrator is hilarious, and you can get a few good laughs out of him. This game also includes a level builder, so you can make whatever you wish. This game has a great story and plenty of levels, even when you beat the game there is still levels to be played made by members of the community. Also, did I mention each level has two different versions for both co-op and singleplayer? I have also enjoyed trading heads and collection them for my character. Overall, Battleblock theater is a fun, cheap, and awesome game that is only 15$ and can give you so many hours of great fun. I would recommend this game to all my friends!.			"

												This is a fun and hilarious game! While the controls may be a tad confusing without a gamepad (xbox 360 controller, logitech f310, etc.) they aren't too bad after a few minutes of getting used to them. If you have a weird sense of humor like myself and can be open to oddities, this game will be great for you. The only frustrating thing is that I find it VERY difficult to go through a level without dying a lot (I have done it a few times but not many), but either way the deaths don't really count against you (other than taking a hit in time trials). The whole concept of the game is strange with cat creatures holding you and your fellow creatures captive  and you earning them back by putting gems into ""prisoner dispensor machines.""			"

												Buckle your pants extra tight for this game. This game is a big ball of fun, happiness, colors, hats, and more fun all rolled up together. You play as a person betrayed by your best friend and imprisioned by cats. The cats force you to put on these elaborate shows (The levels) for their entertainment. Out of the box its a fun simple quirky platformer. The first levels are simple, but they do good to explain the simple mechanics of the game. The single player is quite long and gets pretty hard. I recommend playing this with a friend. friends will also enjoy the insane multiplayer arena. The arena features a wide variety of amazing minigames. You can play with a few friends or random people online or if you have no friends there are bots. There is also a level editor that works with steam workshop. I have not used that in the full release but is looks quite fun. I was interestd in this game when it was just for Xbox, and quickly signed up for the PC beta when it was announced. This game is soo worth a try. There is a slice of fun for everyone.			"

												I really like this game, but I kind of wish that there were more types of blocks to choose from, and that Behemoth would actually patch the game so that there weren't so many bugs/glitches. Other than that I found it to be a great platformer with a really funny and witty story line and commentary.			"

												Ah, BattleBlock Theater, a pretty, humorous and unusual game. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a very well constructed game, that will not only make you laugh, but also give you alot of cooperative experience (if you have friends to play with ofc). The game supports multiplayer up to four players and is very stylistic in the form of bright colors. The game has its own story, and it really fits well with the style. Along with the story, you can also play Arena mode which features 8 gamemodes: Soul Snatcher, Muckle, Challange, King of the Hill, Color the World, Grab the Gold, Ball game & Capture the Horse. If you play online, it offers 3 additional gamemodes: Furbottom's Features, Community Teater & Grab Bag. There's two different ways to play Arena mode, Co-Op and VS, which is both fun. The game also has Level Editor which lets you create your very own Levels and Arena modes!In BattleBlock Theater, players control a prisoner while they are forced to play game levels, devised by Hatty Hattington, the main antegonist in the game. Controls are simple and the levels are built up with blocks, such as collapsing blocks, sticky walls, bouncy volcanic rocks and deadly spikes. The deadly spikes are... deadly, and theres more... deadly stuff such as deadly water and deadly, scary, but at the same time cute creatures!While playing, you will be introduced to the to the Gift Shop! Here you will be freeing prisoners with help of the gems you've earned. The prisoners you've saved are selectable to play as via the player setup. You can also buy weapons from the Cat Guards with Golden Yarn that you also collect while playing, some are more usefull than others, but it's all fun and games :).

Style wise this game is cool, but it stays on the same style until it becomes stale. The multiplayer in all of the vs modes is an absolute mess of who has the most OP weapon.

												Let's begin with this, would I recomend this game? Oh hell yes I would, are you kidding me. I never actually heard of BattleBlock Theater until I had a friend who told me that this game was coming out for the PC, and so I was curious about this game and decided to find out more about this game. Just watching the trailer for this game alone got me hooked on the game, but what got me even more interested about this game was the voice actor that doing all of the hilarious remarks. Since I actually knew about Stamper before I ever found out about this game I admired Stamper for his voice, cause his voice is pretty Godly, if you ask me.... I wish I could speak like that. Never the less when I had figured out that Stamper was the voice actor for this game I was absolutely thrilled about this cause it would be hours upon hours of listening to Stamper's voice constantly mocking you as die absolutely hilarious deaths. But enough about the voice acting, I'll get back to the rating of that later. To continue, the graphics on this game was in my opinion very good and very fitting for this game the layout style or genre of this game also was very fitting which does play into the story quite a bit in all honesty. So in the end I would deffinetly give this game 10/10 in graphics. Now the game mechanics I can't complain about what-so-ever, so 10/10 in game mechanics and style and so on and so forth you get the idea by now I hope. The story, oh the story. I love the story and with Stamper doing all of the voice overs you simply can't go wrong with this game's story and the humor tops it all so I would totally give this story a 10/10, which overall rating of this game would have to deffinetly be a 10/10. So back to my original question, would I recomend this game? Of course I would yet again, now in my opinion is it the best game I have ever played? Not really, but it would totally be my second favorite game that I have played (first one being FTL and third one being The Binding of Isaac). In my opinion it's just one of those games that sparks memories of me being 8 years old and playing Metroid Fussion on my Nintendo GameBoy Advance SP and constantly raging at that one dammed spider boss for some reason. But enough about my memories, just go get the game and as always, enjoy your experience.			"

												God where do I start with this game... A hilarious adventure through chambers of death with your best friend would probably be the best way.The narrator is one of my favorite parts lots of funny lines to keep your entertained all the way through.The platforming is process and the levels extrememly well made but you can experience a bug now and then.Multiplayer campagne is basically the singleplayer levels with a small twist here and there so im slightly disapointed but it makes up for it in the different multiplayer game modes.Its also suprisingly long for a game of this price ive been playing for over 12 hours and im still not done plus workshop will make it even longer.Finally the collectibles: SO MANY TO GET! A ton of heads, around 9 weapons and trading compatible will lead to good times.9/10 I would say buy it when you can.			"

												You already know how good the game is on the XBLA version, but how about the port? It took the behemouth 6 years to port castle crashers over and the key bindings were not that great. I believe they've bettered themselves with porting over to the PC because I was able to bind my keys the way that I wanted, and the overlay tutorial for using said key functions for certain things, whether it be punching cats into water or sploding yourself, or purchasing an eyeball from the store.        These are the things you need to look for when purchasing Battleblok theater including the options, they are rather minimalistic as any normal 2D sidescrolling game, you got options for turning down the teture qualitly of the background, Vsync options thank goodness including multiple sound options and optimises for the narrator and audience as you play(I reccomend keeping Stampers voice tunred on for the main enjoyement of the game)      as the port stands I say it does pretty good, I was still able to enjoy the game and the combat is smooth as it ever will be.the one gripe I guess I have about it is for some reason you have to hold down two keys to climb up the ladders, one to hold on and another to move. Other than that, it's a pretty awesome game and I reccomend you go check it out.     Oh and one more thing before I go. BUCKLE YOUR PANTS!			"

												The bane of funny Platforming Games. The Behemoth did great with this game just like Castle Crashers. The gameplay does get a little annoying though. Also 10/10 would trick my friend into exploding by the exit again.			"

												Though I haven't played very much of it, (Yes, ~11 hours isn't enough). I find that it is extremely entertaining and a fun game for the whole family. Though to truely get all the fun out of it, I recommend playing with a friend, a friend you can trust, or not you can always push each other into pools of water, lasers, and spikes. Ha, I wouldn't care, in-fact you probably didn't even put effort into reading this, and bought the game because you saw other YouTubers play it. Well so did I. 10/10			"

												A hilariously funny game that offers more than just a single or co-op story mode. With the arena modes and level creation, the possibilities are...not endless, but certainly very close to it. The voice acting is a very large part of the comedy and although it's not to everyones tastes, I think many people can still enjoy it.			"

This is a long review so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend BattleBlock Theater then skip to Results and read from there.The Behemoth creates yet another comedy as they strive for gold in the ever ending cosmos that is the adventures of a shipwrecked crew on a terrible, no awful, wait… no terrible works, Island!!! BattleBlock Theater is a wonder game, with amusing anecdotes, rides, and all sorts of malarkey.Story:You play a member of an amazing crew of friends on you could say a friendship. As it sails across the ocean you are all having fun. Then a little storm rolls its way, the ship sways, but don’t worry nothing is wrong until suddenly out of nowhere the storm rocks a ghastly blow. Your crew is thrown everywhere, it’s very scary, trust me I saw it all. Your ship is marooned on a small little island, and the crew is held captive where else but BattleBlock Isla *cough* Theater. You leader, Hatty Hattington, is being held captive by some cats, as he sets up theatre spectacles that involve death and traps. It is your job to save him and escape from this woe, but will you succeed… well I don’t know but it will be fun to watch.Campaign:The campaign is broken up across eight chapters; each one has an outro cinematic that adds to the overall story. Each chapter consists of eleven required levels and three encores. The encores are drastically more difficult than the normal levels, and if you do not go back to a previous chapter to view the levels again you may not even know they exist. As you progress through the campaign you receive two forms of currency “Yarn” and “Gems”. You can use Gems to unlock prisoners; this essentially allows you to change your appearance. You can use Yarn to unlock weapons, each weapon costs five Yarn. Each level offers anywhere from 3-9 gems (typically 7 or 9) and 1 yarn. Be careful what you buy, as you can only get the max numbers of gems for each level one time. If you get six gems one time and then plays it again and get seven you get only onre gem. Gameplay:BattleBlock Theatre is a unique platformer that combines puzzle solving, item collection, enemies, and abilities into an incredibly in-depth game.  There are thirteen weapons you can use, each have their own purpose. In order to progress through a level you must collect at least three gems, although if you don’t collect everything and get the best time you’ll only at most get an A rather than an A++. One of the brilliant elements of this game is how each level has its own puzzles and secrets to solve. Unlock a typical platformer this game gets you to go through sections again moving blocks and manipulating enemies in order to solve complex puzzles and tasks. As you progress further through the campaign and especially on the encore levels you will notice how difficult the game can really get. Insane mode is the exact same as normal, except if you die it’s over. I would recommend normal, as insane is more likely something you’d want to do with a friend, that way if one of you dies at least the other can make it through. Steam Support:This game has workshop support, which is awesome as it allows you to download custom levels and upload your own. There are a huge variety of custom campaigns out there, which give you a whole bunch of new levels to play once you’ve beaten the original game. The community provides loads of new campaigns which is great if you are looking for a game with high replay value.Results:BattleBlock Theater is a spectacle to see, with action, and puzzles, and comedy that is just plain awesome. There are loads of levels, and depending on your play-style the campaign can take easily up to eight hours. Of course the levels in the campaign have high replay value, but to push it even further this game provides workshop content that continually updated by the players. There are loads of custom made campaigns and levels which you could try. Plus there are fun arena games where you can battle with/against friends or even random people. BattleBlock Theater has a lot of offer and if you love platformers you will want to get this game. Pros:+Combination of action, platformer, puzzle, and objective.+Great cinematics (there is a lot of comedy in this game and the cinematics between chapters were one of the big reasons I beat this game so quickly)+Loads of workshop content including custom campaigns+Keyboard/Mouse Mapping and Controller Support+A built in level-editor+Awesome multiplayer arena battles+Complete character customization (with over 300 prisoners)+Thirteen amazing weapons, not including your fists+Brilliant Soundtrack, I couldn’t help myself dancing at the end of each level. Cons:-The keyboard and mouse support seem flaky, it was as if they didn’t really try to port over a good control system.			"

												This is an all around fantastic game expirience for both single and multi-player modes. I couldn't reccomend it more because of it's amazing puzzles, incredibly difficult platforming, and hillarious storyline. It'll take you about 15-20 hours to finish the story, but you'll spend many more perfecting ones you didn't get an A+ on, enjoing yourself destroying your friends and strangers in the arena, and trading hats and weapons. But before you buy, consider:-When they reccomend a controller, they mean it. Keyoard controls aren't the best.-Don't let this game come off as a Super Meatboy type expirience, the majority of the gameplay is through puzzles.-The co-op story is almost identicle to the single-player one, besides the fact that you occasionally need to help you friend get over a ledge, boost him into a hard to reach spot, ect.There's so much more to this game that makes it fantastic, I can't even squeeze it into one review. So just buy the goddam game.			"

Another thing I love is how there's co-op in story mode, in fact-I love it so much that I stopped playing single player on story mode! I just wished it could be played with 4-players, that's all I want, other wise this game would have to be 10/10, the cute kitties, the humor, the levels are all worth it, trust me you won't regret it.

												- Yarn was invented in 198..4 by Stanley Yarn. Back then it wasn't called yarn, it was called cat string. People used to use it to lure cats to their homes, because meat was very expensive. True story. The end.That being said, if you want to survive horrible deathgames while cats watch and laugh at you and corrupt your friends with hats. Not to mention torture you based on your performance. Then DO NOT hesitate to buy this game! Because while you're being drowned, pierced, eaten, etc... Or even better, while your friends are, you'll most likely laugh so hard that no noise comes out and you sitt there clapping like a deranged seal.Buy two of these games, send one to a friend and find out the horrible truths behind cats and their yarn.. Definitly worth your moneys. Pros: - Hilarious cutscenes and gameplay- Plays good with mouse/keyboard or controller- Difficulty can be set very high- Cats- Singleplayer, multiplayer, level creator, timetrials, arena mode...Cons:- Tryhard mode is difficult as ****.10/10			"

Multiplayer is what hits this game home, with endless hours of fun volly-spiking your friends into the ground and vaulting them into a wall of spikes.			"

												Words are not enough to describe how good this game is. I mean, there's a little guy with a square head, wearing a top hat. You can't go wrong with that. Oh yeah, CATS. Cats are everywhere. If you don't have this game, get off your couch (or chair), download this game, and then go back to your couch (or chair) and play it. Or you can sit on your couch/chair while downloading it, i mean, that works to. I have put a ton of hours into this game since I originally reviewed it, and I am still addicted. The level editor gives you all the freedom in the world, and the campaign is just amazing. Every time you have the gems to unlock a head, it is exciting going to the gift shop, and seeing what your new head will look like. There are many arena mini games, which you can play locally, or online. People are always making new level packs, so there is always something to enjoy, and neither the campaign or arena ever gets boring.  GET THIS GAME.			"

Review: One of the most entertaining Co-op games I have played in a long time. The Behemoth really knows how to make a fun game with lots of characteristics like the interesting story, lots of levels, cosmetics (no DLC, just in-game currency), jokes, and everything their games have.Pros:- An amazing game to play in Co-op with a friend/your girlfriend, or against two other persons (Custom made match, or even searching an Open Public game)- The community is really kind and the players are funny and cool to play with.- You have an interesting Trade system in-game to trade your diamonds/faces for something you like/want from other players.- Each level has it's own challenge, where you can Co-op with your friend, try to kill him in a funny way, or simply try again and again until you complete it.- With near players, the lagg is almost none. Really well made for network gameplay.Cons:- I had some problems playing with 3 friends Local against 1 other friend Online. There is a restriction of 2/4 players in the same computer that might bring troubles to uneven players, but it works perfectly when inviting from Steam.Score: 10/10, a must have for all the players that love Co-op, funny challenges and annoying friends with friendly fire :P			"

												Alone or with friends, it's a great experience. One of the best indie games around. Very fun and addictive. I would recommend playing this in short time intervals, Graphics: nothing special, but it's unique. So simple yet so pretty and ""cute"". It's makes my eyes ""feel nice"".Sound: The music is very simple and fun I like it, its sets the right mood.  The only real voice you hear is of the narrator which is enough. He is extremely  funny. You will laugh hard and a lot.Story: Story  is not so important, but the way it's told it's even more important. You play this game for the puzzle adventure not the story. Gameplay: Simple and fun. I would criticize the sluggish combat at times, but it's not relevant.I would recommend the buy. It's double or triple your money's worth.			"

												- Yarn was invented in 198..4 by Stanley Yarn. Back then it wasn't called yarn, it was called cat string. People used to use it to lure cats to their homes, because meat was very expensive. True story. The end.That being said, if you want to survive horrible deathgames while cats watch and laugh at you and corrupt your friends with hats. Not to mention torture you based on your performance. Then DO NOT hesitate to buy this game! Because while you're being drowned, pierced, eaten, etc... Or even better, while your friends are, you'll most likely laugh so hard that no noise comes out and you sitt there clapping like a deranged seal.Buy two of these games, send one to a friend and find out the horrible truths behind cats and their yarn.. Definitly worth your moneys. Pros: - Hilarious cutscenes and gameplay- Plays good with mouse/keyboard or controller- Difficulty can be set very high- Cats- Singleplayer, multiplayer, level creator, timetrials, arena mode...Cons:- Tryhard mode is difficult as ****.10/10			"

												Buckle your pants and dance.Battleblock Theater is one of those games that progressively gets harder and harder to the point that your swearing at the monitor because of how many obstacles and enemies are shooting things at you or are just getting in the way. The further you progress the more important your timing becomes, just like theater. No, seriously though, this game can get rather difficult and you'll be mashing buttons like a maniac.On the other hand, at least it's funny and the narrator keeps the stride going while telling the story as well. You're some, uh, person, on a ship with Hatty Hattington, your best friend. Suddenly, you end up shipwrecked on an island ran by cats who operate a theater. The cats, though, take you prisoner and have you ""act"" on their sets. The prison also has a theater section where all of the levels are ""built"", as you perform in front of a crowd. It's a neat take on the platforming genre. You traverse through eight chapters and a bunch of crazy stuff happens.9.3/10			"

												I had heard of this game before, and at the time, i really didn't think much of it. when i looked at the trailer though, i immeadiately changed my mind. a game with humor like this coudn't be bad, right? RIGHT?i was right.I knew i made the right decision as soon as i started playing.now something about the game itself:The game is story-driven, but plays in separate levels accessible from a hub.The story is delivered in a funny way and has a real good flow to it. you can play in story mode in singleplayer, as well as in multiplayer. multiplayer can be played cooperatively as well as against eachother in arena mode, so there's enough choice there.the one thing i could complain about is how the levels start looking the same after a while, but that's just a minor complaint because they more than make up for it with the other elements in the game, including the level editor (did i mention there's a level editor?)All in all, a nice game with action as well as platforming fun, but it could get boring after a while for an avid gamer.

												Before I say anything else about BattleBlock Theatre, I must say that it is a very JUICY adventure.The objective in this platformer is to locate and collect green gems scattered throughout each level.  Once you collect 3 of  them, the exit will open and you can complete the level.  It is a very simple concept, but it can be very addicting and delicious.  Only 3 gems are required to finish each level but if you are a big time sumo wrestling grand champion and you want to devour everything, then you will be rewarded with an A++ on a level if you manage to find all of the gems and the secret Yarn in each stage.  Completionists are rewarded for their MLG skills.For godlike players looking for an even greater challenge, there is INSANE mode that sends you back to the beginning of the stage every time you die.  Even though every slam is fatal in this mode, I found it very fun due to the challenge and because you can get even more gems in this mode. While I enjoyed this game greatly, I feel that some may get bored of it quickly.  If you don't enjoy the simple platforming/puzzling that it offers then you won't have any reason to keep playing.  It will keep on throwing more levels at you while ramping up the diffculty until the end.  A comparison would be some fat lard who keeps on eating macaroni noodles even though he doesn't like them. Don't be that fat kid!  I suggest looking at some gameplay before you buy.One great feature in this game, however, is the Co-op play.  If the single player portion of the game doesn't hold your interest, then playing alongside your tag team sumo wrestling partner might be the key to success.  Story mode supports 2 players at once in Co-op play, and in Arena mode you can play with up to 4 players.  The best parts of these modes are laying a smackdown on your friends.  You can uppercut them, you can push them into a lake, you can explode on top of them, you can throw grenades at them, and you can use FROG EXPLOSIVES against them.  Much hilariousness to be had.There is also an announcer in BattleBlock who comments on your journey with many funny insults and tips.  He may call you a spicy little fart or something. The announcer, along with the amusing deaths that you and your friends will endure, provides this game with plenty of ""Haha Laughter"".At the end of the day, this is one of the best platformers on steam. Very simple, very humorous, and even better with friends. Go and check it out today you blubbery sea slugs.BattleBlock Theatre has been given the score of ""Chanko Stew Out of 10"".  Thank you for tuning in.			"

But that's not the reason why I had to throw all my money at it.Gameplay.The controls were responsive and easy to learn, for a title that was ported from xbox, my logitech controller has yet to misfire (hem hem, Darksiders COUGH!) Customizability (do you even into the english language?).From changing my colour to the shape of my head, I was able to make the perfect prisoner, but I find myself changing my head daily JUST BECAUSE I CAN!Story.I was in tears, THE PLIGHT OF HATTY IS STILL FRESH IN MY HEART AND MIND!MultiplayerIf, like me, you're tired of the moaning ""MLG PROS"" on tf2 mix servers, then my son it's time for a change. If you enjoyed super smash bros, feel free to try at the game mode of the same name (don't you quote on me that) I had a righteous giggle, molesting two other players because my team mate ""lost connection""Verdict11/10 would play again, if only to hear Stamper cry ""NO! DONT DIE! It's a real gem from the indie scene and well worth the $15 price tag ($3.74 if you act now)			"

												BattleBlock Theater is a great game and fun to play. You either can play with your friends the CO-OP story or the Single Player one. Also , there a lot of mods ( levels ) that you can get and play different game modes ( such as King of the Hill , PvP , etc ) .It's like Skyrim with Blocks.			"

												This has easily become one of the best indie platformers I have ever played!Remember in Super Mario Brothers 3 where it looked like it was a performance? Well this game takes that setting and expands it like crazy, you can create your own levels for your friends to play on!Also the soundtrack is awesome, and my favourite has to go to the secret levels, honestly the music is up there with Awesomenauts, Payday 2 and Teamfortress 2 as being some of the best on Steam.The charm of this game is through the roof and the voice acting by two rather famous youtube celebrities do a fantastic job, also the humour easily makes it the funniest game I have played in ages.Just like Tiny and Big, I feel bad getting this at £1.09 in the winter sale, the developers deserve every penny because this game is amazing.If you love platformers, theres no reason to say no to this great game.

												Buckle your pants and dance.Battleblock Theater is one of those games that progressively gets harder and harder to the point that your swearing at the monitor because of how many obstacles and enemies are shooting things at you or are just getting in the way. The further you progress the more important your timing becomes, just like theater. No, seriously though, this game can get rather difficult and you'll be mashing buttons like a maniac.On the other hand, at least it's funny and the narrator keeps the stride going while telling the story as well. You're some, uh, person, on a ship with Hatty Hattington, your best friend. Suddenly, you end up shipwrecked on an island ran by cats who operate a theater. The cats, though, take you prisoner and have you ""act"" on their sets. The prison also has a theater section where all of the levels are ""built"", as you perform in front of a crowd. It's a neat take on the platforming genre. You traverse through eight chapters and a bunch of crazy stuff happens.9.3/10			"

												I can't speak highly enough about this game.  I LOVE it.  As you can see, I've logged over 150 hours and I'm still not done.  Yes, I've beaten the single player mode on normal and insane with A++ on every level.  I've played a lot of co-op with several different people.  I've enjoyed some of the arena modes and had a blast hosting a game night for it in my old gaming clan.  I'm still playing weekly to collect star heads.  So why do I keep coming back?   The art style is wonderful.  The overall humor  is great and, in my opinion, this game has the best narrator of any game.  The platforming controls are tight and as you play the game more and more, you gain a better and better sense of control.  This means that although the insane mode seemed like madness when I first started playing, by the time I was ready to tackle it, it felt doable.  There's a large variety of collectable heads that you can constantly swap in order to feel like you're playing a new character.  I've heard the main story many times now and it just doesn't get old.  Also, the end song is immensely satisfying.  Whether you'll be playing alone or with friends or both, this game has hours of fun in store for you.			"

FOR BATTLEBLOCK THEATERBattleblock Theater is an amazing game developed by amazing developers. It is challenging for hardcore players (via insane mode and some of Furbottom's Features) while also being a good casual couch game for friends and family. The co-op meets even at the level of Portal 2, (but does NOT exceed it, Portal 2 is the best) and the narrator, Will Stamper, is absolutely hilarious. I had quite a few laughs during the cinematics. All in all, Battleblock Theater is one of the best out there. I suggest it for anyone and everyone. If you do enjoy it, check out Castle Crashers, a 2D side scroller indie made by the same developer, The Behemoth.			"

This is a long review so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend BattleBlock Theater then skip to Results and read from there.The Behemoth creates yet another comedy as they strive for gold in the ever ending cosmos that is the adventures of a shipwrecked crew on a terrible, no awful, wait… no terrible works, Island!!! BattleBlock Theater is a wonder game, with amusing anecdotes, rides, and all sorts of malarkey.Story:You play a member of an amazing crew of friends on you could say a friendship. As it sails across the ocean you are all having fun. Then a little storm rolls its way, the ship sways, but don’t worry nothing is wrong until suddenly out of nowhere the storm rocks a ghastly blow. Your crew is thrown everywhere, it’s very scary, trust me I saw it all. Your ship is marooned on a small little island, and the crew is held captive where else but BattleBlock Isla *cough* Theater. You leader, Hatty Hattington, is being held captive by some cats, as he sets up theatre spectacles that involve death and traps. It is your job to save him and escape from this woe, but will you succeed… well I don’t know but it will be fun to watch.Campaign:The campaign is broken up across eight chapters; each one has an outro cinematic that adds to the overall story. Each chapter consists of eleven required levels and three encores. The encores are drastically more difficult than the normal levels, and if you do not go back to a previous chapter to view the levels again you may not even know they exist. As you progress through the campaign you receive two forms of currency “Yarn” and “Gems”. You can use Gems to unlock prisoners; this essentially allows you to change your appearance. You can use Yarn to unlock weapons, each weapon costs five Yarn. Each level offers anywhere from 3-9 gems (typically 7 or 9) and 1 yarn. Be careful what you buy, as you can only get the max numbers of gems for each level one time. If you get six gems one time and then plays it again and get seven you get only onre gem. Gameplay:BattleBlock Theatre is a unique platformer that combines puzzle solving, item collection, enemies, and abilities into an incredibly in-depth game.  There are thirteen weapons you can use, each have their own purpose. In order to progress through a level you must collect at least three gems, although if you don’t collect everything and get the best time you’ll only at most get an A rather than an A++. One of the brilliant elements of this game is how each level has its own puzzles and secrets to solve. Unlock a typical platformer this game gets you to go through sections again moving blocks and manipulating enemies in order to solve complex puzzles and tasks. As you progress further through the campaign and especially on the encore levels you will notice how difficult the game can really get. Insane mode is the exact same as normal, except if you die it’s over. I would recommend normal, as insane is more likely something you’d want to do with a friend, that way if one of you dies at least the other can make it through. Steam Support:This game has workshop support, which is awesome as it allows you to download custom levels and upload your own. There are a huge variety of custom campaigns out there, which give you a whole bunch of new levels to play once you’ve beaten the original game. The community provides loads of new campaigns which is great if you are looking for a game with high replay value.Results:BattleBlock Theater is a spectacle to see, with action, and puzzles, and comedy that is just plain awesome. There are loads of levels, and depending on your play-style the campaign can take easily up to eight hours. Of course the levels in the campaign have high replay value, but to push it even further this game provides workshop content that continually updated by the players. There are loads of custom made campaigns and levels which you could try. Plus there are fun arena games where you can battle with/against friends or even random people. BattleBlock Theater has a lot of offer and if you love platformers you will want to get this game. Pros:+Combination of action, platformer, puzzle, and objective.+Great cinematics (there is a lot of comedy in this game and the cinematics between chapters were one of the big reasons I beat this game so quickly)+Loads of workshop content including custom campaigns+Keyboard/Mouse Mapping and Controller Support+A built in level-editor+Awesome multiplayer arena battles+Complete character customization (with over 300 prisoners)+Thirteen amazing weapons, not including your fists+Brilliant Soundtrack, I couldn’t help myself dancing at the end of each level. Cons:-The keyboard and mouse support seem flaky, it was as if they didn’t really try to port over a good control system.			"

												I can't speak highly enough about this game.  I LOVE it.  As you can see, I've logged over 150 hours and I'm still not done.  Yes, I've beaten the single player mode on normal and insane with A++ on every level.  I've played a lot of co-op with several different people.  I've enjoyed some of the arena modes and had a blast hosting a game night for it in my old gaming clan.  I'm still playing weekly to collect star heads.  So why do I keep coming back?   The art style is wonderful.  The overall humor  is great and, in my opinion, this game has the best narrator of any game.  The platforming controls are tight and as you play the game more and more, you gain a better and better sense of control.  This means that although the insane mode seemed like madness when I first started playing, by the time I was ready to tackle it, it felt doable.  There's a large variety of collectable heads that you can constantly swap in order to feel like you're playing a new character.  I've heard the main story many times now and it just doesn't get old.  Also, the end song is immensely satisfying.  Whether you'll be playing alone or with friends or both, this game has hours of fun in store for you.			"

FOR BATTLEBLOCK THEATERBattleblock Theater is an amazing game developed by amazing developers. It is challenging for hardcore players (via insane mode and some of Furbottom's Features) while also being a good casual couch game for friends and family. The co-op meets even at the level of Portal 2, (but does NOT exceed it, Portal 2 is the best) and the narrator, Will Stamper, is absolutely hilarious. I had quite a few laughs during the cinematics. All in all, Battleblock Theater is one of the best out there. I suggest it for anyone and everyone. If you do enjoy it, check out Castle Crashers, a 2D side scroller indie made by the same developer, The Behemoth.			"

												Very friendly and extremely enjoyable platform game.Literally theater, because everything is happening in front of audience in theater. And they are all cats.Single Player story is introduced through simple story-cutscenes after every chapter, using narrator. This narrator will often speak during the game, usually saying something hilarious... Whole game is constructed to be funny. The point of every level is to grab as many diamonds, as you can and get to the exit. In your way will be deadly spikes, hostile cats and... more random obstacles. Story also allows co-op mode. Even though most level are in coop slightly modified, it brings very different experience. Everything is more fun with friends, right?Besides story mode, there is arena, that contains many PvP modes like King of the Hill, Capture the Horse and more - not just made by developers, but also player-made. There are also player-made adventure playlists. Multiplayer can be played locally or online, which is currently weaker, but you can usually find some games.Story mode and official arena maps will earn you diamonds and yarns, which you can use to buy new head skins and weapons. These can be later traded with real players, directly ingame.Game also has its ingame level editor, where you can make your own maps of any type - adventure playlist or arena.+ Local Co-op+ Narrator+ Level Editor- Weak (but alive) online MultiplayerThis game brought many laugh-hard moments and its always well wasted time. :D9/10			"

												A quirky platformer  that borrowed most of the good features from Super Meat Boy & Spelunky, but then the game is also dripping is delicious absurdist humour. The result is that it feels like you are playing a party game which is wonderful when playing punishing platformer puzzles.The Positives- As a platformer the puzzles are excellent and there are many levels/stages- big variety of new and old platformer gameplay mechanics; eg. enemies that chase you and bump you around- a story in a platformer, yes I know 'who cares', but it is a delightful non-sequitur intermission to the rest of the game.- whimsical humour - from the story narration to commentary on your deaths & level completion- 4 player co-op online or 2 player local- great soundtrack & Voice Acting- Cartoon-y art style is pleasingI didn't feel that a gamepad was necessary, so that means if you do have a gamepad then 2 player local co-op will be easy. The only real problem I/you have is that the game strongly prefers to be online. You can't get all the bonus gear if you are not online (largely cosmetic items which you trade for with in game collectable gems).Steam Cloud Sync is buggy and you may all lose progress switching between online and offline. If you discover you have to start over again (i.e. saves wiped), immediately kill the game so it doesn't autosave - then resync online. Got me twice, sigh.Conclusion:A very good spin on the platformer genre - highly recommended if you want a platformer or a 2 player ""couch co-op"" game.			"

												A deeply emotional game where you play as a schizophrenic man on the set of a snuff film. While you see the world as a cartoony and happy landscape, it's actually quite far from that. You're forced to collect the severed heads of your friends which have been painted green, the protagonist portrays them as gems, symbolizing objects of great value. This makes sense, since the protagonist is forced to put on a show for the viewers, i.e dodging traps, falling close to death, almost drowning, and collecting the heads of his friends, or he is killed.The game also has some enemies, and the whole show is run by cats. Cats are seen by humans, instinctively, as predators. This is what they are, as you know how dangerous lions and tigers are, and you feel fear around them. This is why he views them as cats. He knows they can end his world, and he has to avoid them or even fight back in some cases.A bit dark for a platformer, but it spices things up.edit: Some people actually thought this was serious?

This game contains everything that will make you laugh, cry, get angry, feel hungry, and requires a change of pants on standby. this is perhaps one of the funniest games i have played, not from just the story (although quite hilarious in its own right), but from the enitre experience i had in co-op. Friends are recommended, but strangers are even better. Buy this game ASAP to support Behemoth since they know what they are doing in this industry.

												This game is probably one of my favorite games, if you like strategy games that make you think, it's probably something for you. Although you may not think so at the beginning, because of how it is pretty simple, it gets very difficult in later levels. If you like to think and solve things this is definately worth the money, but if you get mad easily and are, well, not the best at solving puzzles, thinking outside the box, etc.. it's probably not for you, but anyone can give it a shot. Either way it's worth the pay.			"

												BattleBlock Theater is a great game. The narration is funny, the co-op is great with friends and the level editor has a really well-thought-out system for controller use. Controllers are recommended for the best experience. The customisation in the game is somewhat extensive as you can unlock different ""prisoners"" (just different heads your character can use) and weapons from the gift shop in game. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a game to just sit back and laugh at. Screw Steam sales, just buy it. Now. "

												I really wasn't expecting much from this game at all due to the childish nature, and flash-like graphics. I was pleasantly surprised when I started playing. What really makes the game is the narrator. Almost everytime he talk I can't help myself from laughing. The game reminds me of if LittleBigPlanet had their child with Castle Crashers. It is an ugly baby, but at least it is fun to laugh at.			"

												This game is probably one of my favorite games, if you like strategy games that make you think, it's probably something for you. Although you may not think so at the beginning, because of how it is pretty simple, it gets very difficult in later levels. If you like to think and solve things this is definately worth the money, but if you get mad easily and are, well, not the best at solving puzzles, thinking outside the box, etc.. it's probably not for you, but anyone can give it a shot. Either way it's worth the pay.			"

												A deeply emotional game where you play as a schizophrenic man on the set of a snuff film. While you see the world as a cartoony and happy landscape, it's actually quite far from that. You're forced to collect the severed heads of your friends which have been painted green, the protagonist portrays them as gems, symbolizing objects of great value. This makes sense, since the protagonist is forced to put on a show for the viewers, i.e dodging traps, falling close to death, almost drowning, and collecting the heads of his friends, or he is killed.The game also has some enemies, and the whole show is run by cats. Cats are seen by humans, instinctively, as predators. This is what they are, as you know how dangerous lions and tigers are, and you feel fear around them. This is why he views them as cats. He knows they can end his world, and he has to avoid them or even fight back in some cases.A bit dark for a platformer, but it spices things up.edit: Some people actually thought this was serious?

												BattleBlock Theater is a great game. The narration is funny, the co-op is great with friends and the level editor has a really well-thought-out system for controller use. Controllers are recommended for the best experience. The customisation in the game is somewhat extensive as you can unlock different ""prisoners"" (just different heads your character can use) and weapons from the gift shop in game. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a game to just sit back and laugh at. Screw Steam sales, just buy it. Now. "

												Started off slow when it first launched, but this is one of the best ports i have ever played on pc.  This game contains everything that will make you laugh, cry, get angry, feel hungry, and requires a change of pants on standby. this is perhaps one of the funniest games i have played, not from just the story (although quite hilarious in its own right), but from the enitre experience i had in co-op. Friends are recommended, but strangers are even better. Buy this game ASAP to support Behemoth since they know what they are doing in this industry. Battleblock Theater recieves a 5/5Warning: Loss of friends may come, but are not to held liable by this game, review, or even developers			"

												In this game, you control a cute character and you save Hatty Hattington from evil power from his cat officers.Story: 10/10 - The story is honorably epic, i like when Hatty went posseded when he weared a top hat, aswell the cat officers are cute too.Controls: 8/10 - The controls sometimes are wrong, aswell i may vote 8...Graphics: 10/10 - The graphics look toony and it's well polished, good job The Behemoth.Music: 10/10 - It's exciting and catchy, will you dance to this?Gameplay: 11/10 - BattleBlock Theater brings the most greatest retro-styled gameplay back from the 1990, picking gems and yarn balls, they also become currency items, with these you can unlock prisoners (new faces for your character) and weapons. It also got its own Steam inventory like Team Fortress 2 does.Total: 4.9+/5THE BEHEMOTH, YOUR A LEGEND!!! THIS GAME IS EXCITING, MAN!!! I PLAYED ONLINE ALREADY AND IT'S SO GREAT!!!

You can also throw your partner to reach high places or spikes if you feel like it.

With a 10+ hour story, a lot of extras and secrets to find to get A++ rating in a levels, it's a game with a lot of things to do. if you are planning to do all those things, prepare to play for 30+ hours. Battleblock have cool cartoon graphics, easy gameplay, a lot of cool weapons, and hundreds of heads for customization! The game also have a cool online mode and a complete co-op campaign play with your friends! Batteblock theater is a cool game to play for fun and/or with friends. But do not play it for much time no-stopping. It can become boring! But it's a fun game when you have nothing to do or wanna have some fun.

												First of all: If you click+hold ""Ctrl"" key you will fart and explode. BattleBlock Theater's is a mix of CastleCrashers + SuperMeatBoy + OneyNG voicelike crazy narration + weird... cats. This platform game is awesome both on single-player or multiplayer (co-op). This game is quite difficult (especially in time-attack stages), having many sort of traps. The story is a true definition of insanity, athought the story was made to be like that, which makes this game unique. You can widely costumize your character in terms of face, color and weapons.  Also, this game has its own Steam Inventory with your Battleblock Theater items, these items can be tradable and/or marketable. In all, this game is pretty funny and creative.			"

The levels are specially designed in  the coop mode, where you need your pal to beat it. The beat-the-clock levels sometimes are reeeally hard, but if you like challenges you'll love them. Those are encore levels, btw, so if you don't want to run against the clock you can still play the normal levels.I totally recommend it!! Buy it for you and your friends, you won't regret it.			"

												This game is, to put it simple: Hilarious.The story is told by Stamper, if anyone knows him, a guy with a great narrator voice as shown in the game. During the game he will pretty much tell you what is going on and what you shouldn't do: Dieing mostly.In cutscenes he will progress the story and tell you all kinds of things in a fun fashion.The gameplay is nothing that spectaculair but still really good. It's a puzzle platformer as much as it can be a platformer. In 2D, you will run, jump, ride and slide across blocks of various elements, collecting gems to open the exit. The difficulty progression is steady and with the amount of levels, the final ones will/can be really frustrating but certainly do-able.The music is happy and upbeat as the game itself and with the great visual style, jokes and voice-acting, I believe this is certainly a game looking into.Additionally, it has multiplayer, so you can even go nuts with your friends in existing or self-made levels!

												I first played this game on the Xbox 360 when it was free with Gold. I loved it. I beat the whole game and bought all the heads. But when I found out it was on Steam, I instantly bought it. I only have 5.9 hours, but I played the Xbox version so much I think I have a very clear verdict:This game is amazing!!! Incredibly fun, hilarious and charismatic. The game itself shouldn't take longer than 2-3 weeks to complete, but there's still much more to do. Co-Op, multiplayer VS matches, building your own stages to ruin friendships. I won't say much about the story, other than it's completely nonsensical and bizarre.To get the most out of BBT, I recommend an Xbox 360 controller for maximum enjoyment. If you've thought getting the game, DO!!! But be warned.......the story has 8 different chapters, and they get increasingly difficult. 6 and 7 especially so. 8 not so much, but that's probably because you're used to the game at this point. But if you're still not satisfied......You give a cat some yarn and he gives you an exploding frog.SCORE OUT OF 10: 9.0/10			"

												You can kill your friends (and random people online) by distintegration, fartz, explosions, more explosions, knocking them into water, knocking them into spikes, freezing them, burning them, and so many other ways...The narrator is the best and also one of the main reasons I bought this game, next to the whole friendship-destroying thing.Levels are fun and well constructed.But, they could explain how to play a bit better in the beginning. I can't find anything else wrong.I rate 9.5/10			"

												This is insanely fun.For those saying: THERES NOTHING TO DO AFTER YOU BEAT SINGLEPLAYERPlay it in insane mode, or co-op if you haven't already, try unlocking ALL the heads too, Theres even almost endless user-made levels that you can play and have fun with, even build your own if you wanna choose how to play your game.Theres also various insanely fun minigames, whether you wanna fight to the death, play basketball, or even color the blocks with your friends. (Yes, you can create those in the level editor too)How in the world can anyone not like this game, the only thing thats wrong with it is the connection issues when you try to join someones game thats not your friend, they still didn't fix that, But we can atleast be invited to join a FRIENDS game, So it's not really a big deal.You should really buy this, you won't regret it.

												That was the best and worst 12.2 hours of my life. Haven't tried singleplayer (I don't think I want to after playing multiplayer already, and I don't really recommend it but if you're one of those sadists then by all means finish it in singleplayer). As for multiplayer, now this is where the♥♥♥♥♥♥is at, GOD DAMN. Find a friend to play with, test your wits, test your guts, and most of all test your patience.Overall this is quite a fun and challenging puzzle game with good humour. Very entertaining especially if you have a friend to play with.			"

												// BattleBlock Theater 2D Platform Adventure Game : //// Schuitje82 - Extended Review //About the Game:============After playing Castles Crasher as a crazy person on many platforms it was a big surprise to see they did not make a part two of this videogame.No, they made a totally new game that having nothing to do with castle crashers in any way.So me playing this game was a little bit sceptical about this game because I love the Castle Crasher franchise so much.First when you start the game you will be pulled in with the crazy story they tell you about Hatty going on adventure and laugh if you like english humor and the way they tell you this.After some days on sea you crash your boot on a island in the middle of nowhere we cats are the bosses and will take you and harry prisoners.Gameplay:========The core gameplay is as basic as it can be if you ask me.You collect the gems of tree that will set you free of every stage only there are more items to collect because of every stage haves more than 3 gems and a ball of wool to collect.The gems can be used to unlock new character parts and the wool can be used to get new weapons. The game haves a super massive collection of body part to unlock so you will need al the gems you can find if you want to unlock them all. What makes it fun to collect because the game generate sometime the item the Golden Head and will grand you exra of 10 gems and the end if you can finish the stage with the item.And what makes this game extra cool is that you can play alone and with a friend in full story mode co-op offline or online and this is a lot of fun because you will NEED to work together.Otherwise can not complete the stages because you need the partner to help you.There is an support for 4 player offline / online main problem this is that you only can play mini games fun still co-op 4-player would be much better and much more fun.The game supports many challenges for many and many hours and if you are done with these you can even make your own if you like totally massive download stages so you can not be bored with this video game.Controls:=======For the casual player this will need some practice because of some crazy jumps over time you need to take if you want to reach the last gem of need to jump over spikes.Beside that it’s an easy to learn videogame and will give you no frustration if you look to the controls.I try’s the game with an Xbox 360 controller and everything works perfectly even the button layout has been supported by this game.Overall:======If you like me are a big fan of the The Behemoth Studios games you will love this game to.It is not an Beat ’em Up like the Castle Crasher series still it’s a freaking good and fun game for young and old.Score - 9/10.== For more reviews go to www.gamegrin.com ==== Please don't forget to like my reviews ==			"

												This game is a really fun platformer that is fairly challenging. The story is histerically funny. Theres plenty of cool heads to choose from and a good bit of weapons to aid you in your mission to save Hatty Hattington. I found that this port is pretty well done so far considering i haven't found any bugs or glitches yet. So i wound definitely recommend this game when it releases.			"

												This game... is.. so great..Really it is, just the narrator makes this game so amazing, the voice and the acting is really wel done and that combined with the witty comments make it a great and very fun game. The gameplay itself is also very fluid and a very nice puzzle/platformer indeed. A defined recommendation and especially with friends, but only if your playing with 1 or 3 friends, this is because you do arena in teams of 2, thus making it unfair is playing it with 3. A minor flaw in a great game, but still a great game and recommendation!			"

From customizing how your character looks to creating levels yourself, there's surprising depth to this 2D game.Another surprise is that the multiplayer campaign has the same basic layout as single player campaign. And yet, they MAKE you cooperate with whoever you're playing with, making collectibles a team effort. Much to love in The Behemoth's BattleBlock Theater.			"

												(The following review is loosely based on a real history)Well... How can I begin? This game is awesome! Got me in love right at the hillarious intro sequence. The whole game is quite fun to play and it has local and online co-op! Double the humor, double the action, double the ache in your cheeks and diaphragm after you f*** up with your friend's jump and make him/her fall in some spikes!This is that type of game where you turn to your best bro and says ""Hey, dude, give me a little hand here"" and then s/he punches you in the face and you fall to your death and s/he starts crying, but not because s/he's sad, but because s/he's an a**hole and can't stop laughing at you, and you're all like ""Well, not THAT kind of hand"", but also laughs because you're an idiot that didn't stop to think of what you were about to say.If you like platformer, humor and screwing up with your mates, then buy this game, because I'm saying so. You can trust me! Who doesn't trust a guy who always find a way to kill his best friend?The gameplay:Well, it's a platformer and you jump and kill some fat security cats (and your friends!), and collect some faces and have some weapons that are cool like a hadouken-ish fireball that'll burn your enemies (and friends!), but also have some that are really worthless, like a little rubber ball or whatever was that little piece of round ****. The co-op features some actions like throwing your friend (to his/her death, if you wish so... And you know you'll wish so, don't try to be that ""I never kill my friend"" guy now) or using him/her as a ladder to reach higher platforms (and then coming back to help him/her, because you'll need his/her help to proceed, but only after taking all the gems you could without his/her help).There's also an Arena Mode with different types of games that you can play online with some random guys or with your friends. I think it's up to 4 players, at least it was the maximum I managed to play with.And there's an editing mode, like said in the trailer, where you can create your own level and share with people over the internet so they can have more fun and spend more time playing this game while the developers sit back and throw away any worry of updating the game with new stuff!Oh yeah! You can also trade your items through the steam inventory or directly in-game, like Pokémon.The story:During a very peaceful journey aboard a little boat with your trusty friends, you find an island where they capture and force your friends to perform at a sadistic and horrendous shows at the local theater. And now you're the only one who can save them all!... Except that you get captured too and are forced to perform on those shows. Now! It's up to you to perform well and get out of there alive with your friends! What are you waiting for? Go call a friend and perhaps s/he can be your sidekick! Who doesn't want to be a superhero (with a sidekick!) with their own comic published in the entire world in different languages? Ok, you don't get to have comics published in different languages, or in the entire world... you don't become a superhero at all, ok? But you can still have a trusty sidekick! Ok, perhaps not so trusty, but you can still have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sidekick that will ruin your journey and make your quest harder! Well, stopping to think of it, you would like to kill your sidekick before he kills you... hm...Note: 12/10			"

WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?!Fourthly...seriously, how can you NOT appreciate being licked by a maniacle, loathsome, cute and cuddly hairball of death and destruction?Eightly, there's some kind of level editor.

Stamper did a really an amazing job here <3 Just listen to the ""Steam Announcment Trailer"" above and you'll hear the beautiful comedy-narration in this beautiful game.I also really enjoyed the music in every stage, very well done!The gameplay is a simple platformer but gets really difficult as you progress through the levels, especially when you collect everything in every stage or even play on Insane mode. It could be a little frustrating sometimes but you will get back and ""do this without dying or messing up"".And if you have a friend to rely on, you can also play coop where the stages are missing some blocks to jump on, so you'll have to use teamactions to get each other to the exit... or you betray the sh*t out of them! >:DIt also has (online) multiplayer matches with some funny gamesmodes.Overall a really good game, can't wait for Behemoth's next game :D			"

I love it.- Trading on the court cards, weapons.- Lovely to behold and nyashny seals, giving them the glomerulus, which is very hard to get. lol.Cons have each and every one, but I do not want to think about them, because the game itself is perfectly demonstrated.

The co-op features some actions like throwing your friend (to his/her death, if you wish so... And you know you'll wish so, don't try to be that ""I never kill my friend"" guy now) or using him/her as a ladder to reach higher platforms (and then coming back to help him/her, because you'll need his/her help to proceed, but only after taking all the gems you could without his/her help).There's also an Arena Mode with different types of games that you can play online with some random guys or with your friends. I think it's up to 4 players, at least it was the maximum I managed to play with.And there's an editing mode, like said in the trailer, where you can create your own level and share with people over the internet so they can have more fun and spend more time playing this game while the developers sit back and throw away any worry of updating the game with new stuff!Oh yeah! You can also trade your items through the steam inventory or directly in-game, like Pokémon.The story:During a very peaceful journey aboard a little boat with your trusty friends, you find an island where they capture and force your friends to perform at a sadistic and horrendous shows at the local theater. And now you're the only one who can save them all!... Except that you get captured too and are forced to perform on those shows. Now! It's up to you to perform well and get out of there alive with your friends! What are you waiting for? Go call a friend and perhaps s/he can be your sidekick! Who doesn't want to be a superhero (with a sidekick!) with their own comic published in the entire world in different languages? Ok, you don't get to have comics published in different languages, or in the entire world... you don't become a superhero at all, ok? But you can still have a trusty sidekick! Ok, perhaps not so trusty, but you can still have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sidekick that will ruin your journey and make your quest harder! Well, stopping to think of it, you would like to kill your sidekick before he kills you... hm...Note: 12/10			"

												There are a whole slew of good single-player, controller-supported platformers on Steam, and this is certainly among the best. The real strength of this game, however, is it in 2-player local co-op campaign, where the hilarity of certain death and comic nature of the story and gameplay make for a fantastic shared experience between two friends.My girlfriend, who is not a gamer, absolutely loved this game when I made her play through it, and I'm certain she would recommend it to any couple looking to kill some time on a rainy Sunday, when Netflix isn't quite filling the void like it's meant to.

You can get gems to buy hats for your characters, or collect yarn for new powers (if you don't want to spend cash in the Steam market. This game is very fun with friends, with many things to do. The steam workshop also makes this version better than the XBLA version. The level editor has every block you will see in the game, and the enemies too, for you to play with. There are many versus modes and things to do in this game. I highly think people should buy this game. "

												Definitely the best platformer I've ever played. Use the entire world around you to complete levels and earn gems and yarn - jumping on walls, exploding blocks, boats, and even your own dead bodies and weapons, just to name a few. There are so many different ways to solve each level and a set of weapons you can use to do it, even if you're alone. Dart guns, exploding frogs, acidic bubbles, and fireballs all help you to get by - Not to mention the awesome music, arena mode, and level editor. 10/10.			"

												The whole point of BattleBlock Theater is to be absurd and hilarious, and it does it very well. It's a great party game, but the single-player campaign is equally entertaining.From the first cutscene in the campaign, you'll be laughing your head off. After every set of levels, another cutscene will bring to light the unfortunate story of the island you're trapped on and the cat overlords that inhabit it. The cutscenes are filled with absurd gags. Sometimes the humor is very childish and immature, but handled in a way so that they're funnier for being childish than for the actual joke itself. All the while, the story gets more absurd with each cutscene.Then, level by level, you'll be slowly making your way through a gauntlet of deadly platforming challenges to amuse your cat captors. After every death, the announcer will make light of your unfortunate demise. The levels are well-designed and challenging, and are only frustrating in a couple tricky spots. On rare occasion you will find ""secret"" rooms, where the announcer sings an absurd song constantly. Luckily it only takes a minute or to get everything in a secret room (even if you take your time), so you're out before it gets annoying.The multiplayer is very well-designed. There is couch co-op if you manage to get a few Xbox controllers, and maybe have one unfortunate player use the keyboard, but there's also online multiplayer. The lag can be noticeable at times, but is less of an issue for a party game. There are a variety of multiplayer modes, but I've found Muckle (team deathmatch) to be the most fun. The game is a few years old though, so finding an online game without coordinating with friends can be difficult. As for co-op, every level is redesigned to require cooperation with your partner. Ironically, the game gives you plenty of opportunities to sabotage them, even encouraging you sometimes. Good luck trusting your friends.This game is not a serious platformer, and doesn't try to be. It's a unique, entertaining experience that will stick in your mind for years.			"

												Narrator- “Get the best time and I’ll give you a kiss because I love you!” This is one of the funniest games that you will ever play. And here's why; the narrator is absolutely out of his mind, he says all sorts of funny stuff especially  in the cutscenes . The plot consists of cats who have taken your friends prisoner after your boat  the ""SS Friendship"" is shipwrecked on a island .Aside from the hilarious lines and the evil evil kitties, this game is a surprisingly fun platformer that will keep you entertained until the very end. The levels aren't long, but can get extremely frustrating from time to time, especially if you're trying to collect every gem. And even though there aren't any ""bosses"" in the game, the last level of every floor is timed, and can be pretty difficult to get through. All-in-all, if you're looking for a new platformer to sink your teeth in to, consider picking this game up as it's one of the best platformers on Steam ,...... ohhh wait !!! There is also Multiplayer where you can team up with a buddy and you can play the levels using teamwork and stuff or kill your friends and countless other players in the Arena mode. And if you don't, then you'd better watch your back, because the cats are surely coming for you. Oh yeah, and did I mention that the soundtrack is totally awesome? Because it is. And anyone who knows their platformers knows how incredibly important a killer soundtrack can be. What are you still doing here ? Buy the game !!!			"

												Whether you're playing the game by yourself, doing co-op with a friend, or going toe to toe against 3 others in the arena gamemodes, this game is hilarious and insanely fun! The graphics are great and cartoony, and isn't too demanding on your machine. There may be some frustration from not being able to figure out the levels, or if you're doing co-op your friend or random partner can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥to you. I highly recommend this game to anybody! Also it's narrated by StamperTV and his voice just makes the experience better and very funny!			"

												This game is worth playing. There is a ton to do. There is so much to collect. It's a game you can always come back to. The story is amazing, and funny. It's a game great platformer, and the humor when you die always gives me a good laugh or 2 witch keeps me from raging when I die. It's one of those not so serious platformers that even if it takes you some time to finish, you still have fun doing it.			"

												10/10Get this before the Sale is over, or you'll regret it.I've played 1 session so far; I beat the first chapter, some of the ""feature"" tests, and searched for a multiplayer game (but couldn't connect to all players :T  ). There wasn't a second that I didn't have fun or wasn't laughing, besides getting somewhat frustrated by the traps / obstacles that were put together really cleverly.After Alien Hominid (an NG classic) and Castle Crashers, The Behemoth came through strong with Battle Block Theater.TL;DR GET IT WHILE IT'S ON SALE OR ELSE YOU'LL BE HAVING FUN WHILE CRYING BECAUSE IT COSTED $12 MORE THAN IT WOULD'VE IF YOU GOT IT ON SALE.

												As of writing this, I've owned this game for less than a day and there have already been at least 6 times where I had to pause the game and put down my controller because I was laughing so hard.  I don't think a video game ever made me laugh this much.  The narrator is hilarious.The gameplay kind of reminds me of Little Big Planet since they're both platformers with level editors that allow you to share your custom made levels with the community, but this game has better controls and a much more user-friendly interface. Character customization isn't quite as diverse as LBP since you're limited to just interchangeable heads and basic colors, but there's lots of heads to unlock and you can trade them with friends.I'm also really glad that this game has local multiplayer.  There aren't nearly enough PC games out there with multiplayer that can be played on one PC.			"

												I believe the ending to battleblock theater to be a high point of the post modern era for it's abiltiy to both portray the likeness of the casual gamers current situation they find them self in. Buckle up your pants, it's such a simple phrase but when you really consider it, pants is of course a metaphor to you, the gamer who's philosphical fly is open to new ideas an experiences but you have no direction and let everything out opening yourself up to harm and emotional distress. This game enthuses the idea to buckle up and tell the casual gamer to be more conceded and not to trust to easily. This is easily a defining problem in this era of gaming of people getting to connected to these digital presences of, essentially real life people, that they can relate to, and the thing keeping there fly down, which is of course resembled with hatty. When in the end after all of your trials and anguish it is simply that hatty must be put down and you must buckle of up your fly so you are not quick to connect to characters and are still capable of human interaction. It is telling the gamer to go out and live life and not be tied down to fake relationships. Simply a beautiful game. 4/10			"

												I do recommend this game if you really love sillyness alot of fun to it! The main fun part about the game is that you would have to play with a friend, and this is the part of the game were it gets better! Playing with a friend changes the experience alot! Teamwork is mostly needed though so no messing around! Single-player really doesn't feel the same way this game was made to play with others and to have fun with them!			"

												This game is really solidly built and really fun, but damn if it doesn't slap you in the balls a couple of times. The art style is simple and nice to look at, the story is fantastic (it's basically a rescue the princess story with a Behemoth twist), and the music is... music to the ears! I really don't recommend the online multiplayer, because 9 times out of 10, your partner and/or you is going to have serious lag issues. Also, the AI of the bots in singleplayer versus is just... Eghhhhh... I think they have the same AI as the cats in the regular game, just slightly harder. They always have discs, no variation between their weapons. Sometimes, since they have perfect knowledge of what to do because they're soulless programs, they will pin you into a corner until you can actually god damn move. But either way, Battleblock Theater is a charming experience that you should definitely jump in to.I give this game 8 cats out of 10.			"

												Meow meow? Meow meow meow.... MEOOOWW!!! MEOW MEOW~~~ That's it. :3Jokes aside, amazing and brilliant platformer I've played in a while since I last played Nintendo platformers (Mario, Kirby, DKC)So far I've played Co-Op Campaign with my friend, but haven't played Arena that much, so I'll be focusing on the Main Mode review : Levels : Very creative and well-thought. Love to see large variety of blocks, enemies, and puzzles. Though at some times need several attempts to pass through a section (Using wings to fly through a room full of obstacle and hazards) and/or to get gems and yarns. Enemies are surprisingly CATS SPEWING HAZARDS, block-shaped reindeer that will eat you upon sight (or whatever that is), Robots with their homing rockets, and more. Also I like how the Co-Op Campaign is surprisingly designed for 2 players, while solo is designed so it's possible for 1 player. There's also Encore levels which, after clearing the Finale (last level of a chapter), are unlocked. They are time-based levels (like the Finale) where you must clear in an amount of time and the time can be replenished with checkpoints. Recommended for those who seek time-based challenges.Gameplay : Really satisfying, the movements are very solid, and Co-Op movement features that made the game also enjoyable (You can smack and push your partner to hazards, too! or kill em with your weapons!) There are also mounts, block-shaped horses (I didn't realize that was a horse at first). At some points, using weapons can be a bit of annoyance though, as it could end up killing you too. And I noticed several bugs and glitches.Other than that, the movements, climbing, and Co-Op movements (Judo throwing your partner across wide blocks of water, or lending a hand to help your partner jump onto a high cliff), making the game satisfyingly enjoyable.There's Normal and Insane Mode. Normal is for casual playing as it gives endless of lives, so the goal is just collect the gems and yarns and get to the exit.Tried Insane a few levels solo, and it gives more yet challenging levels for those who want more from this game. Insane gives you only 1 Life (Shared on Co-Op) and it will restart from the beginning of the level if you hit any hazards once.Gift Shop : I checked and did a research, there are about 320-ish characters ready to be unlocked, and many weapons. I liked how each weapon has their own distinctive use, Flying Disc is thrown and acts as a time bomb. Dart sticks onto a solid block and gives you a platform to stand. Frog walks over the level and explodes when someone is near.Character unlockables are traded with gems, and it's satisfying to see them came out after clearing a few levels.Music & Story : Oh damn I'm in love with the music! Gives you the feeling of Opera-ish theme. The music always keep you at your seat at all times. The story gives lots of humor, while keeping the plot solid and interesting. :3. (Oh, there's a truckload of cats!!)What I like to see : 4-Player Co-Op Campaign for future Platformers (if Behemoth plans to make another). 2-Player is good and enjoyable enough, but I would like to see a 4-player Platformer such like Kirby's Return to Dreamland (Wii), although there's also 4-Player Arena which is also quite enjoyable.Conclusion : Buy it and invite your friends! Very recommended for all true platformer fans, and support this amazing dev! :)			"

												Probaly the best game to play with friends, if you dont have any friends that own the game or is interested in playing, then dont buy Battle Block, the game has online play, but at the moment there isent alot of people online, but the game shines when you got a friend to play it with. What's good about Battle Block?- The game is REALLY funny, Stamper does a great job- The platforming is hard and fun- The music is AMAZING- Alot of diffrent weapons and costume to look the part.- Great ArtstyleWhat's bad about Battle Block.- The checkpoint system is♥♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes you dont spawn at the last checkpoint, it feels like it's just random where you spawn.- Some small glitches in the game that does make it frustrating, atleast if you use controller.8/10 Still need's an update to fix some problems, but fun as hell.

												MY RATING: 10/10Ah, the Behemoth has done it again with this instant classic for a game, Battleblock Theater. When this game first came out on Steam, I immediately bought it, because I already knew how the gameplay was; absolutely amazing. The whole story plot and levels were very well thought out and amazing. This idea of a game was a miracle to all of the gaming community. Everything is really cheap too. Buying the game for 15 bucks, worth it. Heads, they're free and also able to be bought for only a few cents in the community market.FACTS ABOUT BATTLEBLOCK THEATER:Cat Enemies - Because, why not?The Narrator - My god such a beautiful voice.Free-To-Win - All you need to do is buy the game.The Story Plot - The plot of the story is the best part. It's absolutely FLAWLESS.Graphics - Beautifully made graphics.Funny Game - It's a really comedic game, which makes for a fun time!Progressing -  When you progress into the game it gets harder, which is what we all love.Game Design -  Did I tell you how creative they were?FREE Star Heads every Friday - Hell yeah!The Shop - It's free!Weapons - They look amazing!Behemoth will be forever flawless with their game titles and their gameplay.

He kneels up and pulls a condom on to his considerable length. Oh no…Will it?

This Sure is Neato! 10/10Wow, what a game! Hi, I'm a man (or woman, whatever) who you don't know in real life, and I want to tell you what I think of this fantasitc product. Let me just preface this by saying how easy, and just, accessable this product is to use. As a busy, newly single parent of two, I hardly have any time to play modern computer games, what with their 500+ button combonations and 900+ hours of gameplay. It's tough to find a nice computer game that I can easily pick up and play for 15 minutes or so (but not around my young ones, it's a little inappropriate in my opinion), and then get back to my normal, repetitive, day by day life. But enough about me! You probably want to know why this game deserves your time, don't you? Of course you do, even I knew that. So I wrote this to tell you why you should pick this up (not really LOL. It would a digital download version of the game). Simply put: This game has a lot of content for it's price. Not only do you get decently sized, replayable campaign, you also get an insane (or ""hardcore"" as the hip kids say) mode, a few online arena game modes, numerous head customizations to unlock, and access to community made maps so the fun never ends. WOW! WHAT A BARGAIN!It sure is a whacky, zany game that you really should check out for yourself! You can believe in my words when I say that Battleblock Theater is a wonderful game that anyone should add to their library. Seriously, don't be a doof and not buy this game! You gotta be bonkers not to!4/5 Acorns			"

												This game. I love the fact that I can just kinda push my friends into a pool of water that will kill them if I feel like it. I love the awesome and hilarious narrator. I love everything about this game.The level editor has allowed for so many creators on the workshop to make some pretty awesome stuff.I spent about 14 hours just playing through the arena mode. I found so much enjoyment in that feature of the game.The story is absolutely fantastic.Basically like The Behemoth's other games, this is a wild success and an awesome game that should be required for EVERYONE on steam to have.

												This has got to be one of the best games I ever played, but what else do you expect from Behemoth?The story is simple, funny, weird and I had no troubles understanding it (I normally don't care about the story of a game until I played through it), and it was also really funny! The ending is...well, you have to see it for yourself.Do I even need to say anything about the narrator? I don't I have to, he is one of my favorite narrators of all time now. He was the main reason I kept playing, just to hear him talk!The graphics are colorful and happy, and they really fit the silly mood of the game. The music is also excellent, some of the soundtracks have been burned into my skull, I just can't get them out of my head, especially the Secret level music and the Time Trial theme!The gameplay is excellent. I am not a huge fan of 2D puzzle games, but this one I love. It reminded me of ""Professor Fizzwizzle"", and that was one of my favorite puzzle games of all time! The puzzles are not too hard, the difficulty curve is steady and good, and you ALWAYS get prepared for what's ahead of you. Especially the last levels which are the hardest ones feel great when you finally beat them. Especially that stupid last Time Trial...I had to play it over and over, it was so frustrating because you had to do everything perfectly, but when I finally beat it...wow. It's just like old hardcore NES games, but fair!Each chapter had a certain theme, which I liked a lot, but I can't really recall any of the themes. One of the chapters I think was all about jumping around on the lava blocks (which are trampolines in this game and don't hurt you), another chapter had disappearing and reappearing blocks, so you'd have to time your jumps. I like that a lot, it was subtle and not too obvious, and it added a lot of variety to the already varied gameplay.I also like that the boss levels are Time Trials, and didn't have a huge monster that you have to fight, because the combat in this game is not as strong as the puzzles, so the time trials were a fantastic idea. The game also has some additional elements like unlockable characters (like 500 of them), weapons to help you with the game (GET THE NERF GUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN. It makes the game a 1000 times easier.), and even some additional levels of each chapter.All in all, this game gets an 8/8 for being, in my eyes, a perfect puzzle platformer. DEFINITELY buy it.			"

												Great game! Had a lot of fun playing with my friend (way better with a friend).The game has a great voice actor that gives the game a really special humorous side.Overall a very cool concept of a game!The only problem I have is the replay value of this game, once you're done with the main game I didn't feel like playing it again compared to the previous title from Behemoth castle crashers. Maybe it's because I'm getting old and try to spend my time more efficiently than playing the same game multiple times... who knows. I won't really comment on the competitive multiplayer since I didn't really like it and it's pretty hard to find matches. Anyway, if you ask me, it is worth the price and any 2D platformer lover should get this game.Warning: better have your pants buckled! "

The gameplay is downright fun and I definitely recommend playing the game with a friend. The coop in this game is great and you'll be playing for hours trying to 100% each stage and collecting the large amount of hats the game has to offer.The music, voice overs and general whackyness of the game is funny and will give you some good laughs.Great game, great coop, great fun.10/10			"

												This... This game for fu... I mean farts sake is something really great. It has it all, challenging platforming, collecting stuff, 'great' story, level editor... If you like platformers, this game is made just for you. This game is much better in co-op, but it also works in single player, very well indeed.			"

												Play it on Insane only. You eventually start to develop twitch reflexes and really get through the game like a pro. I like it.Movements is fluid and precise, you really feel like you're in control. Humour is that of the trailer. The visuals are fairly nice. Every level is memorable and a combination of different tools for movement (jumping on the bubbbles that you can create) can give you different, unintended ways to finish some levels.The soundtrack is only mildly repetitive. It's worth the price of around 5.50.			"

Outside of my extreme fandom of this amazing game I gotta say that it is really freaking funny because of the narration of the very talented Will Stamper, has different difficulties just incase you think it's too easy and is just an all round amazing game - also Behemoth is noted for their co-op game design so grab a friend and buckle up for YOUR JOURNEY AS TOLD IN YOUR FATEBOOKS OF ....

												Oh my god, this game made me laugh my pants off. There is a narrator that makes dying funny, and theres a level editor that allows you to create your own level and post it onto the steam workshop! While some levels are hard, with security cats and Hatty Hattington, I love this game. The only thing I can think of that's bad is the level editor doesn't have labels on items, so you don't know what's what.			"

												A platformer that is insanely addictive.The tone of the game and narrator are fun.The story sort of acts as a guide but the cutscenes are beautifully narrated and animated. The premise of the game is that you and a boatload (literally) of friends got shipwrecked and are kidnapped by a bunch of cats and forced to perform in their theater. The sountrack is very impressive and will leave you with a tune stuck in your head.The gameplay is great. First off you can customize your character in many different ways. This includes the shape of your head, your face, your color, and which weapons you choose. It is a platformer so the basics like double jump and powerups are there. A crap ton of levels are in the game (at the time of writing this review I have only beaten chapter 1 and 2. The completionist in me needs A++ on every level). It can be easy at times and harder at other times. If you are going for A++ you will want to throw your controller/keyboard at your moniter and take the remnants of your moniter and smash your computer with them. There is also an option for insane mode, but I haven't dared touch it yet.The muliplayer includes co-op (2 player) with the main story as well as a plethora of arena modes. Nobody is really playing them so a match can be hard to find. If you have three other friends who have the game it doesn't matter anyways as most, if not all, of the modes are only four players.Definetly recommended!			"

												It is to be expected that a game from the same team that brought us Castle Crashers is going to be filled to the brim with humor and other random silliness. I'd say they hit another nail in the head with this one. Unlike their previous title, this game is essentially a platformer but still has some forms of combat that often involves infinite hilarity and mayhem on both friend and foe.I can list the pros and cons but to be honest I don't think there's any con to this game whatsoever. There's a plethora of levels which you can play on normal or insane if you fancy more of a challenge and to prevent you from easily getting bored, it features a variety of game modes that can all be played solo, cooperatively and/or against friends or other players online. On top of that, the game includes a level editor integrated with the Steam Workshop to give the game even more replayability and every Friday a different playlist created by the community is chosen to be featured, which players can then play to gain extra gems/yarn and new prisoners. The items you collect in the game (gems, yarn, weapons and prisoners) can all be traded with anyone through either the in-game lobby or Steam's very own trading system, which means you can even trade against cards and items from other games. If all of that is not enough, the game's comedic value more than makes up for it.To sum it all up, the game is quite expansive with more than plenty of things to do, sights to see and stuff to collect in an environment that can be enjoyed by one and all. The game is definitely worth it's price and even if you're usually not into platformers, I'd say it's still worth a try as it offers a lot more than just platforming.			"

												Where to start? BattleBlock Theater® it's an amazing game, from concept to execution, it must be the funniest and most entertaining Platformer ever made. The Behemoth outdid themselves with it.The Story it's full of funny and desperate laughter-inducing gimmicks that will make you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants of enjoyment, The Narrator will guide you through the levels while making witty comments of your actions, or lack of, like dying or finding secrets.The main story it's pretty fun to play in coop or even alone, and after that you have tons of multiplayers game modes to exploit with your friends or other dudes and dudettes. Still not happy? The soundtrack is bloody amazing, you can't play BattleBlock Theater® without it's music, it's like... capital sin, don't you even dare. Also, it has a mother♥♥♥♥ing level editor and it's integrated with the Steam Workshop so you can share your own created levels and download other peoples awful ones. Cool uh? Yeah, I thought so too.

												This game is really solidly built and really fun, but damn if it doesn't slap you in the balls a couple of times. The art style is simple and nice to look at, the story is fantastic (it's basically a rescue the princess story with a Behemoth twist), and the music is... music to the ears! I really don't recommend the online multiplayer, because 9 times out of 10, your partner and/or you is going to have serious lag issues. Also, the AI of the bots in singleplayer versus is just... Eghhhhh... I think they have the same AI as the cats in the regular game, just slightly harder. They always have discs, no variation between their weapons. Sometimes, since they have perfect knowledge of what to do because they're soulless programs, they will pin you into a corner until you can actually god damn move. But either way, Battleblock Theater is a charming experience that you should definitely jump in to.I give this game 8 cats out of 10.			"

												BattleBlock really a great game and i will recomend the game for people especially the ones that will enjoy the great humor and music. The game not just fun alone it get's better when you play co-op with you're friends and there's a good variety of different types of game modes or mini-games. It will have you playing for a lot of time trying to het everything too and the music is rather crazy byr really good. There's even theather-is scenes that are really funny and the voice actor/narrator (Stamper) voice is amazing he's really funny. Overall the game will be a good expirience i played the xbox 360 version a long time ago and i still have it actually. But when i heard about the beta un steam i had to play the beta it was fun just like there other games Catle crashers which i still have in xbox too and alien hominid that i played on my friends phone. 9/10 :)Ps. sorry if there's bad grammar			"

												Honestly, Behemoth is hands down the best video game company on earth. They have a refreshing sense of style and humor that shows in every one of their games (INB4 Game 4 is the same). Battleblock Theater has rolled with that theme. I love everything about this game.  From the plucky little story, to  the suprising violence of this seemingly cute game, or even the hilarious scumbaggery of the multiplayer. I have around 50 hours in this game and every time I play it i notice somethign new and lovely about Tom Fulpe's ultimate masterpiece. Today I was looking through my steam inventory when I saw each friend/head has a cute little story to go along with it. I love this game, and I guaruntee you will too.			"

What's good about Battle Block?- The game is REALLY funny, Stamper does a great job- The platforming is hard and fun- The music is AMAZING- Alot of diffrent weapons and costume to look the part.- Great ArtstyleWhat's bad about Battle Block.- The checkpoint system is♥♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes you dont spawn at the last checkpoint, it feels like it's just random where you spawn.- Some small glitches in the game that does make it frustrating, atleast if you use controller.8/10 Still need's an update to fix some problems, but fun as hell.

												-Core Review-Gameplay . 8 (with friends 9) average = 8.5Music . 6Art . 8Mechanics . 9*bonusComedy . 9Total . 8.1-Nice Words-The game is a blast, a short and sweet adventure. Play by yourself or with friends. With it's extremely responsive mechanics and challenging maps this game is really fun. If you like platformers and laughing it is definitely the game for you. Music is fitting but not anything substantial. Art style is very comical and will have you giggling as you work your way through the maps.-Personal Experience-Honestly I'm already hooked on this game, and I've only been playing for about an hour. It has been an amazing hour of laughs and trying super hard to run through the levels as fast as I can collecting ALL the gems. The comedy is really well put, I think this game (by itself) has made me laugh more than any other game I've ever owned.The movement is what you would expect from a platformer, and there are plenty of hilarious obstacles. I also thought the level editor looked cool, haven't touched it.The Art looks like it came straight from the internet with all the funny lookin' faces.Also the narrators voice, and comedic timing is perfect, I should say.All in all it is a very enjoyable game by yourself, and much more fun with a good friend. Perfect for if you're tired of try-harding your balls off in the games you really want to be good at, and just want a break with some laughs.			"

												This game is hilarious!  From funny commentary to awesome artwork, this is a great one to just kick back and play with someone else.  Some levels are challenging... but nowhere near the level of other games I've played before.However, this game does have a annoying bug.  If you die multiple times in the same area, it doesn't always resurrect you to the same location.  Sure, you can just blow yourself up and hope for a better respawn point, but damn if it doesn't get annoying.			"

												BattleBlock Theatre is fun for everyone!If you have a friend, it'll be twice as fun!  But be warned:  you could potentially lose this friend if you play the wrong cards.. Of course I didn't lose my friend, in fact, despite  purposely  accidentally killing each other over and over, we became even better friends! But if you lack friends, there are other options for you! You could either play online with strangers, or play alone, in the dark, all by yourself. So no matter your age, gender, whatever, this game is for everyone to enjoy!			"

												The funniest game i have ever played! I got this game during a steam winter sale, 2 hours in, i was loving every minute of it! The Narration in the story mode makes it so much funnier as well as the animated puppets movements! The gameplay overall is good as well, it has a co-op mode as well, you can play with up to 4 friends, you can play in teams of 2 and race eachother to the end of each level. I highly reccomend this game to all ages, as it can be quite a challenge for children, but is still a blast.			"

There is a narrator that makes dying funny, and theres a level editor that allows you to create your own level and post it onto the steam workshop! While some levels are hard, with security cats and Hatty Hattington, I love this game. The only thing I can think of that's bad is the level editor doesn't have labels on items, so you don't know what's what.			"

I myself, know of friends who do not like the game, but I have friends that do like the game and they really like it, and mainly for one reason.Stamper.Stamper, the in game voice narrarator, has stupidely funny lines.That's all i'm going to say, if you pick up this game you'll know what I mean.and here's a list of pros/consPros:The storyline is funny.Stamper makes a great narrarator.The gameplay is a fun platformer with quite a few mechanics.Multiplayer is great, I had friends laughing quite a bit there.Cons: Fighting is not that good.(minor) It influences heavily on Xbox controllers, and most will not have one.All in all, it's a great game, you should pick it up, I definitely had a great time with it.

Not only is the story hilarious, but the game play is so easy to get a hold of that even I- infamous among my friends for being the worst at video games - can actually make it through each level.

												I don't often bother writing these, but this game is the first platformer i've enjoyed since the early sonic games  (i think i stopped at sonic 3), and in co-op mode this is probably the best platformer i've ever played.The game has well written humerous dialog, and all the classic elements you'd expect (secret area's, ways to mess up and trap yourself/deny yourself some of the levels rewards) The difficulty level ramps up, but not so fast that you can't cope yet you also genuinly feel challenged as you go.

												This game is incredible. Is it as great as the powerhouse Castle Crashers was? Perhaps. It's got the same humor as Castle Crashers, but amped up big time. This game feels like a behemoth game should.(I know I only have about 9 hours when I posted this review. I played it lots on the Xbox version though.)First off, the graphics. They may not seem impressive, but it's not just quality we are talking here. I'm talking about how the game looks, and it looks great. All of the prisoner heads have their own personality, and it's pretty awesome the diversity. Not just the prisoners have this personality though. The cat guards, for example, are cute and look friendly, although they can (and probably will!) kill you.But graphics aren't as important as gameplay. Good thing the gameplay here is great. In the game, you take part in nasty plays after crash landing on an island, in which you collect gems and balls of yarn. Playing single player isn't as much fun as multiplayer however. I'll be talking mostly about the multiplayer, which is pretty unique. It is a ""co-optional"" system in which you don't have to always help your partner, or you may need to kill them to progress. There are also many different weapon types you can use, each granting some cool abilities. You can use the pop-gun to fire a projectile at a wall that will stick there for you to jump on. You can also wield a primary and secondary weapon, which is a nice touch. There are 10 weapons in total. In addition, there is a fun arena battle mode consisting of many different modes you can play.On to the story. It is mostly told through cutscenes, but it isn't the kind of cutscene where once it starts, you think ""ugh, another one?"" instead, you'll be thinking, ""Awesome! Another cutscene!"" because they are just so funny. The narrator for the game, Will Stamper, also narrates these cutscenes.And, there is a level editor installed. It is easy to use, and is fun to work with aswell. Creating levels can be somewhat of a challenge if you aren't creative, however. But, this is what happens in any game with a level editor.And that'll wrap up my review. Sorry it was a little lengthy, but I had lots to say. It's a very fun game, and stays funny while doing it. If you want a score, it gets 9.5/10. "

												The game is fun, BUT one flaw: there is a RNG factor in this game: how things are timed. For example, chapter 4 finale has a series of on/off blocks and a cannon towards the end. RNG has to line up perfectly for you in terms of when the cannon fires for you to make it, and this is annoying, ESPECIALLY IN INSANE MODE. Fun game, but levels like this makes me want to kick the develpors repeatedly in the groin			"

												BattleBlock Theater, the game that taught me that in this world, nobody can be trusted, not even your best friends or that one guy who always gets an A+ at school.This is the ultimate game of betrayal and mayhem. Plus, Hatty's voice narrating makes it even better. So if you've been feeling down for still not being able to win Dark Souls, or if your Dota 2 MMR has been going down lately, this fun and friendly platformer is a good game for you.			"

												This game is great. If you're looking for a serious game to be better at than someone else, this isn't the game for you. This game doesn't take itself seriously in the slightest. It's pretty funny and I found myself enjoying the silly light hearted humor of the storyline. I usually play games to achieve greatness in my own way, however this game is a lot of fun to progress through the levels with friends and collect heads and weapons. I'd give it a 8/10 for being an honest DLC-Free good fun game. Nice way to pass some time. ^_^			"

												Whether you're playing the game by yourself, doing co-op with a friend, or going toe to toe against 3 others in the arena gamemodes, this game is hilarious and insanely fun! The graphics are great and cartoony, and isn't too demanding on your machine. There may be some frustration from not being able to figure out the levels, or if you're doing co-op your friend or random partner can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥to you. I highly recommend this game to anybody! Also it's narrated by StamperTV and his voice just makes the experience better and very funny!			"

												This game is excellent.  If you like games like super meat boy then you will like this one.  It's not as hard as super meat boy, but it's a platformer that kind of reminds me of that game.The story and art are hilarious.  You get kidnapped by cats and are forced to perform for them on stage.  This is made by the same people that made Castle Crashers, so if you liked that game then the humor in this one is similar.  It looks hand drawn and is really high quality with the graphics.  You can choose from a whole ton of heads for your character, and you unlock more by playing the game.  The heads are really fun, and I spend just as much time choosing which one to use as playing the game itself.  The game is multiplayer either online or local.  It's best played with friends because you can throw your friends into a spike pit.  Enough said.  Watch for this game to come on sale.  It will frequently go from between 2 and 5 dollars.  At that price, there is no reason not to get it.  The game would run well on an Apple II probably so even if you have an old computer get it.			"

Beat the game in Normal mode, working through Insane mode, and playing a lot of Arena with randoms. I would recommend this game to any fan of Castle Crashers, or to fans of 2D beat-em-up games. With similar gameplay to Castle Crashers, a hilarious comentator, and a brilliant sound track, this would easily make my list of ten most infuriating games of all time, and ten best beat-em-ups. With gorgeous graphics, I can easily say that this game is one of my favorite games of all time. Looking forward to collecting all of the heads.			"
