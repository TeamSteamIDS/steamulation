Early Access Review
								Every once in while a game comes along that reminds us of something we played before, but still stands on its own as a separate entity. When you enter the world of Nor you are assailed with nostalgic feelings of Magic Carpet, Gothic 2, Myst, Alladin and other Shaherezad tales. The game gave me that googly eyed feeling of listening to a campfire story from the village elder.Onwards to features... You get to throw rocks, no wait. You get to bury a lizard in a pit of sand, charge up a rock with awesome wind power and ram it in its snout at supersonic speeds. Or toss some lava rocks at em and watch em burn. You make the rules. Aaaaaand once you pile all the corpses in a neat pile in the corner you can grab a cup of tea and wrack your brain on the intricately designed puzzle that lets you get to the next room.Obviously this game needs polish and work, but the framework is solid. Devs seems to be dedicated to making a good game. And once they get the cash, feedback and time the final product is sure to impress.PS: You get to throw rocks... Any SWTOR Shadow needs to get this game like NOW!!!			"

Early Access Review
								After having had mouse issues, this morning the game worked as compared to not working the night before. I have no idea, but I could speculate that whatever API is used for controller support was messing up the mouse controls. (all Unity 4 games seem to have this bug, the first time you start the game the mouse is broken)Ok, so it seems to work now. Here goes a quicky review:I haven't played through all of the single player yet, but the game offers very nice and colorful graphics with very interresting effects. Yay for sand waves! Audio sounds fantastic. I'm very excited to play through this game now! Gameplay is a 3rd person view and a magic system that is easy to use. It's quite hard to describe, but very easy to learn the basics.Impressive for early access and since I got the mouse working I'm changing this to big thumbs up.The only thing I'm missing is more than four players for online games, but hey, four is better than zero, which is what many indie games offer. (network code is hard, really hard)Looking forward to a full release and seeing how Stillalive studios will continue to develop this really interresting game idea. ^_^EDIT: got more gametime in and the single player mode is EXACTLY how you introduce players to new games and hook them. BRILLIANT!			"

												Ripping boulders out of walls and smashing your foes with them is soo much fun.I have played the early access for a few hours now. The game has an original fantasy story and Zelda-like puzzle dungeons which I enjoy. But the game’s core experience is its physics based combat. You raise and lower the ground, you throw stuff at enemies, you throw enemies at enemies… you get the point. It’s a lot of fun and very rewarding. Combat can get out of hand in larger battles. But it hasn’t frustrated me yet. Simply reload and retry - I usually manage well the second time around.It was a wonderful experience to see how the game (bumpy at first) got more and more polished and complete with each patch. The indy developers published funny behind the scenes videos almost every week since before the Kickstarter. Now that the game is released, including recorded voice, intros and so on I cannot wait to play it in full glory from start to finish. Because, once again, smashing your opponents with large chunks of rock is such soul pleasing fun :)Appendix: After playing through single player------------------------------------------------------------What a wonderful game. Learning new skills and progressing to more complex fighting mechanics is very well done. After about a third of the game, I started to control my abilities with a lot of precision and so I could start to control encounters. It became so much fun to get the hang of a new enemy type and then wreak havoc amongst foes. Phisics based combat is something larger titles usually refrain from. Mostly because so much can go wrong (glitches, exploits...). It's remarkable how well it works in Son of Nor.A good change of pace and also my personal favourite in Son of Nor are the puzzle dungeons. If you like Zelda, you'll like these dungeons. Level design and puzzles are pretty clever. Though most of the puzzles are rather easy to solve, there is a tricky one or twoIt's nice to see that in some parts of the game, sneaking past enemies would have been a viable option. But then again... I control earth, wind and fire. Come get some.			"

												I liked the concept for this game, and thought it had a lot of potential, but it suffers from shoddy execution.PRO Concept is novel, and gameplay not typical. Co-op is available, and playing co-op can help make up for the game's shortcomings by making interesting combos possible. Puzzles and platforming with physics - a great combination in almost any game that does it. It's possible the game would have been rather better for me if it had been about the puzzles instead of boring combat against swarms of boring enemies.NEUTRAL Dated graphics - only a con if you want AAA visuals. Railroading - the world isn't open The plot and characters are forgettableCON Voice acting is cringeworthy. Inaccurate physics in a game where the physics is vital to gameplay Controls are... slippery? I think that's the word for it. Hard to explain, but controls sometimes react slowly, and other times suddenly. Surpsingly demanding on hardware for an older graphics style. Combat is repetitive and dull. You can be creative, but the game encourages you to just bash everything with whatever is handy. "

  Introduction            	Son of Nor is third person sci-fi action adventure game. The story/lore in Son of Nor is very unique/intriguing and is the main thing that pulled me to play it. The story is very great, but there are so issues I have with this game. Two of the big things is the fact that the multiplayer is so dead, and the voice acting is very bland at times. With this being said the intriguing story, platforming, puzzles and cool telekinetic powers (Pick up stuff to throw and terraform sandy areas) really pulled me in to play and keep playing. I really just wish multiplayer had a place, but unfortunately its dead as of now.  Pros                Cool mechanics Interesting story Interactive environments  Awesome Co-op Sandbox/Proving Ground mode Plenty of graphics options Great controller and Keyboard/mouse support    Cons               Dead multiplayer Voice acting is bland at times A few performance issue (I had none, but I’ve seen a lot of people complaining about it)  Combat is a bit clunky      Conclusion                 	Son of Nor is really fun and a great experience, but does have a few problems. (Nothing game breaking or completely annoying) The multiplayer seems completely dead, but the single player and co-op is really where this game shines. If you are looking for a really cool story with great puzzles, platforming, and powers, this is the game for you. I thoroughly enjoyed myself nearly every second while playing Son of Nor-HiPFiRED   If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												A great Indie title which I have owned for a while now. From a fairly small team comes this title which allows you to terraform, use telekinesis and manipulate your environment to swing things in your favour! Multi-platform, extensive co-op/multiplayer modes as well as co-op story mode with lots of challenging levels and puzzles. Combine magical powers with your friends and make fire tornados! Who wouldn't want to be able to use their mind to throw boulders at your enemies' head? Gameplay?The gameplay reminds me a lot like Jedi Academy while the visuals and the feel of the game makes me think of Stargate, Indiana Jones and Prince of Persia. Not a bad combination! It forces you to think about your surroundings and the abilities you have to hand in order to defend yourself. Unlike a lot of action-adventure games, you don't wield weapons but have to use elements and take advantage of your surroundings. You can kind of use weapons, but not physically hold a spear, but take it from a Sarahul's hand (the bad guys in this game, like big lizard men) and throw it right back at them. There is also freedom to choose different paths as to how you're going to proceed to your goal. Are you going to go stealth? Go in blazing and take on an army of lizard guys? Flank strategically with your friends? Up to you. For an Indie game title, it's not as linear as you would expect. I believe there is roughly 12+ hours of gameplay available single player and/or co-op, plus PvP arenas and a few other multiplayer game modes.Cool stuff, GADGETS! Another thing which really caught my eye was the amount of gadgets you can use in this game. It's compatible with Oculus Rift (although I believe there are some tweeks needed), Tobii EyeX which is an eye sensor bar and finally, EPOC Emotive which enables you to almost literally control the game with your mind! Other than being awesome features, it really broadens the market to other avid gamers who may not be so physically able to enjoy games. Having eyetracker software, and being able to train your hardware to the thought patterns of your brain is truly astonishing. Again, I don't know of many Indie games that enable you to do this. So kudos to Stillalive Studios! Overall?Well, I can't be the judge of this game only you can. With anything I would always advise to check out some gameplay of something first and this would be no exception. I personally think it's a really cool little game and a bit of a diamond in the rough. The team at Stillalive have been awesome to everyone by listening to feedback, developer diaries to keep you up to date with changes and to give you a chance to express your views whether they're positive or negative. You can tell a lot of hard work and love went into this title and even if the game isn't your cup of tea, you'd still want to support the developers.			"

								Son of Nor First Impressions


YouTube™ Video: Son of Nor - Mac Gameplay 

			Views: 1,473		

			NEW Son of Nor out now for Mac on Steam Early Access! A fun action-adventure with magic, telekinesis and earth-bending. Click Here To Subscribe  http://bit.ly/19ksM1a Full Review ...		

I’ve never been very fond of third person adventure games. The last one I enjoyed being the Tomb Raider reboot, yet Son of Nor pleasantly surprised me.The back story is actually rather interesting, and it’s rare a game these days has a decent back story. One of the developers narrates and explains what the game story and setting is during an intro cutscene.Right from the start the gameplay mechanics and movement system worked brilliantly. It's actually one of the smoothest controlling games I’ve played in a while, There is no latency between issuing a command and it executing. Jumping platforms and picking up items worked brilliantly, and it certainly helps that the game’s performance is also great.Motion is smooth, and responsive, the game runs well and plays even better. The graphics might look a decade out of date, but the gameplay easily makes up for that.Did I mention the beautiful water effects/physics? No? Well it’s amazing! The game is certainly an oddball, with visuals that look very dated, but gameplay, and mechanics that could easily surpass many games that have come out lately.In fact it handled better than Tomb Raider for me, and even allows you to use the Emotiv Brain Computer interface, for really getting into character as a mighty telekinetic.Puzzles are also solved using your telekinesis, and I’ve never been good at puzzles in games. Easily getting stuck on the most simple of them. Yet here, well; I rather like them. The designers really knew what they were doing and puzzles are introduced very early on in simple quests. There’s someone stuck in some sand, quick! Lower it with your powers to let them out. This man needs help carrying melons, here, use your powers to lift and move them to a set area/pen.These might seem like boring quests, and that they are; but they give you the underlying skills you need to solve some rather complex and amazing quests later on. Such as breaking a pillar, and using it on a massive pressure plate, which in turns activates some sort of later that kills if you’re too close. It shows you how to increase and decrease the distance of the object you’re controlling and more. A rather great game design.There’s even a little tidbit some people might even miss entirely, and I loved it! During the intro cutscene it’s shown that both primary races were created from sand. If you kill an enemy, their body reverts to compacted sand. The same for your character as you take damage; the more damage you take the more of your body reverts the material of its creation. From dust to dust, a rather brilliant little thing to add to the game and play on its very lore.Now the music? Well, it along with the rest of the game so far is phenomenal. I really, like the music. They really put in some effort here, and I could easily just stay in an area and listen to it.All in all Son of Nor is a great indie action-adventure game. They seamlessly blended their mechanics into the gameplay and it just works. Plus it’s damn good fun!I could easily recommend this as an early access game, and you should certainly keep an eye on it. Yes the game still needs quite a bit of work, but it’s got a very good base already, and I’m eager to see how the game develops.			"

												Love this game so far. You can use telekinesis and terraform sand and sh*t. Feels like being a little kid playing in the sand box again. Also cool story, cool world. Voice acting is great, graphics are very good for a small indie game. Coop is a blast with friendly fire on. Pure chaos - exactly how I like video game stuff. And there is not too much water: 10/10 would buy again!			"

								As of v0.5.2:Pretty awesome adventure with some nice mechanics, amazing world, challenging puzzles and pretty tough enemies (except for when the AI is acting brain dead).If you are looking for exploration and puzzle-solving gameplay with occasional combat (or stealth if that's your way to play) - this game is probably for you.It's still a bit rough on the edges - there are some minor glitches, AI sometimes does no acts properly, arranging levitating pieces can be infuriating.. But overall the experience is pretty cool.More content and polish can make this game pretty much perfect adventure.Oh, yeah, it also supports things like Emotiv, Oculus and eye tracking devices which is pretty damn crazy.More details in video:

Early Access Review
								Long before the Kickstarter this game picked my attention. It looked fun thought the graphics needed a lot of work (around 2012 I think) and mainly because it is a small indie team. But now playing the beta version in 2014 I see so much improvements in the graphics department, it's literally a new game and looks great!  Character animations need a lot more polishing but I suppose that will be fixed for the final version.But the real meat of the game is not the graphics itself but the powers that you have: telekinesis, fire, wind,  and the most awesome of all terraforming! So imagine that an enemy is chasing you with shooting arrows, you can easily terraform the sand and create a barrier. This could be used to climb to another places! And mixing all this stuff in multiplayer is insane and fun, sometimes just messing around with telekinesis is pure fun. Just messing with stuff is so much fun, you can grab materials like rocks and trhrow them using the power of telekinesis. I was really surprised the moment that I  and even the enemies to throw to other enemies. Can't wait to play the final version and to see how all the story folds. Right now the game it's in early access stage so don't expect to be a finished release and you can also help with feedback (they have a tool inside the game I think for that).Note for the record: I have played this game a lot more than the hours here in steam, since I have played the very early alpha builds and some beta builds too.

												You are the son of a Nor and you will be tasked of putting 10 melons to 3 other melons into a big basket for a very lazy dude. Unfortunately, the idyllic valley is haunted and so all the melons are catapulted out of the valley by a mysterious force! When you investigate these puzzling events, you will find out that invisible giant sand moles seem to kill all the NPCs in your village or at least drive them to flee into savety onto the rooftops of their houses. Sad and lonely you will find some comfort in collectiong lifelike looking statutes, which you can pile up in front of a giant guy who chills out and spends some much needed shadow, Unable to find any booze around, you will eventually venture out to find the escaped melons.Make sure to chat up the friendly bald girls who are alway happy and grinning, they are real good company!You'll have a blast with all the things you can do, when you always do the exact opposite of what your quest givers tell you to :) But from what I have played by the rules so far, I can say it is a mighty fine and very atmospheric game with a very unique game world and of course, the star of the show: these extremely innovative gameplay mechanics!Besides all that, you will experience wonderful oldschool moments, fans of games like Gothic will be pleased by that! If you are still not certain if you should get the game, just take another look on th eprice tag!These guys have worked their asses off for years now and as a KS backer I can only say that their communication with the community has been a shining example for how it's done!I'm looking forward to when I can finally manage to allocate a little more time than now to dive into the game and hopefully find out more about this secret easter egg / game mode that lets you play as sandworn and prey on both friend and foe!!

								Even  though I've only played just over a couple of hours of this game, I enjoyed it and decided to make it the first game I actually do a series on for my YouTube channel.Son of Nor has some interesting elements to it that you just don't find in other games, and I was even more surprised to see an option for local split screen gaming; which is a rarity to find on modern day PC games.I also enjoyed the fact that there is terraforming in this game and it works surprisingly well for the current build. I wish more games had a terraforming element to them and not be based around the 'God' genre.Here are my first impressions and overall commentary of the first few stages of Son of Nor:


YouTube™ Video:  

			Views: 0		



Even though this is only an early access game, the amount of content and game that is actually playable still warrants a solid playthrough and will most likely fill up most of your day if you're just a casual gamer looking for something new and out of your normal genre.REVIEW UPDATE:There are a few areas that need to be worked and these are as followed: (IMO)Textures: Some aren't too bad but they could use with some blending in some areas, such as rock faces and areas where the textures are tiled could use some blending or realigning.Character/s: Character models could use some work with their motion/s and the main character needs eyelids to blink. Them eyes are popping out of his head at the moment.Memory: I'm not sure why a game of this calibre needs to use much memory! I have 16Gb of 2400Mhz RAM and this game uses 1.5-2.0Gb on idle doing nothing at all but inside the in game menu. Memory optimization needs to occur.Support/Fixes Needed:- Starting the game for the first time does run it in fullscreen, however the Fullscreen option in the menu is not ticked/activated.- Support for greater resolutions higher than 1920x1080 (Full HD). With the current immersion of 4K and Ultrawide displays hitting the market, resolutions need to be bumbped up or supported if possible. I myself have an Ultrawide monitor with a resolution of 2560x1080 and aspect ration of 21:9.- Selecting the preset graphic quality from the current drop down menu is somewhat of pot luck. If you select the 'Fantastic' quality option and then accidently select 'Beautiful', some fiddling needs to be done in order have the 'Fantastic' graphic option appear again- Some Dialogue needs to fixed to make it easier to understand who is talking- Some collectibles cannot be collected			"

												finally a game that is different from all the triple aaa stuff. it’s kind of a 3rd person action adventure game mixed with an interesting backstory and a desert world that invites the player to be explored. I think the graphics are really good for an indie 3d game. the sound, music and voice recording is top notch though! I have just played a couple of hours so far, so I haven’t finished the single player campaign yet, but I already love the implementation of how you can use different powers. you can terraform your surroundings to your advantage (for example by lowering or elevating sand) or in order to solve a puzzle and use telekinesis to throw things around and fight against enemies. there are also some magical spells you learn later on. it is the balance between action, puzzles, and exploring that makes son of nor so good.

												As a local co-op game, this is definitely worth the money. There are too few games that have local co-op in campaign mode to be picky. I played 2 hours with a friend, and it was good fun. But, as a single player game, Son of Nor just isn't worth the time when there are so many better single player games out there.The gameplay is dull. There's only one tactic effective against each type of enemy, and only a few different types of enemies. Telekinesis, which doesn't require mana and is available from the start, is the easiest way to kill most enemies, so there's very little reason to use the spells that cost mana. The story is not very interesting. I feel like a lot of it was lost in translation, because there just isn't much there. It alludes to there being a lot more lore that wasn't explained. Also, I have no idea what happened in the ending - did my character save his people, or cause the destruction of the world, or was it a cliffhanger? I have no idea. It just cut to credits.As a better alternative to Son of Nor, I recommend the game ""Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers"". It has similar telekinesis-style mechanics, but is MUCH more fun and it has a coherent story.			"

It's not the easiest game, and sometimes i get frustrated with my inability to beat the baddies, but it's the kind of brilliant idea that just stays in your head for days.

Posted: April 1, 2015
												First it's important to note, that this title is the result of a Kickstarter project with a rather small budget. The developers put a lot of effort to make the most out of it, so it can be easy to forget that it's just a very small indie game and should be considered as such.""Son of Nor"" is a combination of adventure, action and puzzle game built around an unique combat mechanic: Instead of using normal (or abnormal) weapons, you command the world and the elements around you using your extraordinary telekinetic and elemental-magical powers.These powers remind of ""The Force Unleashed"", the puzzles and archeological adventures of ""Tomb Raider"".But the ""Son of Nor"" is not only a mere explorer: the destiny of his race, that fled into a hidden refuge from the threat of total extinction 400 years ago, depends on him, his special powers and his wits. If you are smart, you can even decipher an ancient alphabet to reveal the secrets of a past long-gone and the frightening future soon to come.No worries though, the gameplay itself is rather streamlined and its puzzles were reduced in complexity so that even less patient players should not have much problems to move on. The more challenging riddles are only optional and give access to collectibles, more powerful spells and insight into the surprisingly elaborated plot.So even if some aspects seem unpolished and far from state-of-the-art, the conception of the game flow is certainly not one of them, and this is an outstanding achievement. There are multiple facets working together hand in hand to make it very dynamic, fluid, complex and offering lots of options, while still being very intuitive:- The controls are very intuitive and responsive and help to materialize your intentions effortlessly (with some exceptions like rotating objects, jumping and switching specific elemental spells).- The saving system builds on smart use of checkpoints.- There is a surprising variety to combine spells and ""tricks"" with each other. Even after beating the final level of the game you will not have seen them all!- There is no ammo management.On your quest you will be able to snatch three energy crystals that each can be filled with three elemental charges of wind, fire and spirit essence obtained from obvious sources in each level.These sources will regenerate after a small time. This results in a very dynamic gameplay as the powers at your disposal will constantly change. You will run out of elemental power or objects to shoot, but at the same time defeated enemies, dropped weapons or destroyed environment will offer new opportunities. Or you can decide to take the fight close to a source of elemental. It's up to you.This is definitely a refreshing and unique gameplay and makes ""Son of Nor"" special and worth of a recommendation!The presentation is quite good for an indie game, but of course you can't expect a triple A production value.- The music is very well done and fits perfectly. Especially the combat music is doing it right, it doesn't annoy me like in most other games, and the gentle drum roll that signals the end of each fight is very welcome.- The voice overs are from top-notch actors and are well done.- The art concepts and graphics offer a lot of nice sceneries.- The models are ok for the most parts, but the Sarahuls don't cut it. On the other hand though I am glad that the lizards look a bit goofy and more comical than realistic. This makes sadistically experimenting with them a lot less sick and cynical.- The animations are acceptable, but lacking in some areas: There are no face animations, and no proper animations of turning characters during cutscenes.- The graphics engine has nice effects, but in some areas severe performance issues.Generally the game shows a lot of dedication, but at the same time evolves the certain kind of charm of indie type amateurishness through occasional deficiencies in story telling, presentation and discrepancy between aspiration and delivering.So even if you are in for nitpicking, you will have a lot of fun dissecting every single flaw of this game.And most others will enjoy the game in any case.––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––(There follows the former short version.)The gameplay of this Kickstarter title is similar to the Jedi Knight series (or sequels), especially ""The Force Unleashed"", just without any lightsabers or weapons of the normal kind.Well, except if you are able to telegrab a sword from an enemy, then it can be turned against the former owner – or his boss. I just was able to fatally headshot a boss with the sword of his servant... What can I say, I had no elemental powers left, you gotta take things as opportunities arise! Needless to say that it was very fulfilling to see the blade stick out of his body after it turned to sandstone (as every inhabitant of this world does after death).This is typical for the very fluent and dynamic gameplay of ""Son of Nor"", you make your plans up on the fly and intuitively improvise your attack strategy. The very intuitive and responsive controls almost always do what you want to do (except for the lack of ability to rotate things). This is done much better than in ""The Force Unleashed"".The checkpoint saving system is subtle and smart; a big improvement over the quicksave failure in games like ""Jedi Knight / Outcast / Academy"" which ruined the gameflow for me.The production value is good – for being an indie title. Nonetheless some people might have to get used to some ""cheesiness factor"". But once you figured out how to build bridges out of sometimes very strangely twisted bodies of the lizards, you will even begin to nourish a secret love for the Sarahuls.			"

								This game and team are amazing!Never before I've seen an original game like this and a team so committed to make it.The vision of a spectacular game with Terraforming & Telekinesis comes to live and it works in Linux too!More you still have a chance to get involved in the development process by giving then feedback to improve the game.These guys deliver to Linux and don't drop support on our platform just because we are just a few, compared to Windows Mac gamers.No one has ever respected the Linux gamers so much has this team and Digitilus (http://www.digitilus.com/projects/skyjacker/)Every Linux gamer should buy this game!Checkout their website:- http://stillalive-studios.com/- http://sonofnor.com/Checkout their youtube channel (contains the making of; developer tips; lot's of funny stuff):- http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7mPOIap3RCsDL1k6Hl4iHg "

												I tried the game with the Tobii eye tracker. It was AMAZING! Normally in a fight you look around, see a rock, turn the mouse to center the rock in the screen, pick it up, center the enemy by a mouse turn and shoot. Now with eye tracking it is just: Pick, shoot, KILL! All the mouse movements fall away. With the mouse you just steer the viewing direction. The cool thing is: You focus the things you want to do automatically with your eyes. You don't need to care about that part. Just click, and you get the thing you want. It works!			"

												This game was a bit of a mess.  The engine didn't seem quite able to keep up with the physics, the environments seemed created with a toolkit of some sort, and the hit detection never quite worked as expected.  The game does feel inspired, however, and was a valiant effort.  In addition, some of the puzzles in the game are quite clever.  These positives can't quite overcome the unpolished feel of the entire game.			"

								I started out on the BETA doing a Let's Play and instantly liked this game. One of the best parts is that there isnt just one way to do something whether it be in battle, an objective, or changing terrain. It is all up to the player how you want to achieve your goal! Son of Nor also has a great blend of Puzzles, Story , and Fighting it hit the right mark on these. I'm really excited about playing the Multiplayer mode so I can co-op with my friends and continue adventuring in the world of Noshrac!

												This game is amazing, Its an incredibly awesome game, you play as a human , or not exactly human with special magic and telekinesis forces,female or male which you can more or less customize in your own style.You strive trough the sand , shape the world by your hand , burst through fire and kill enemies with flames, there are many levels pvp and alot to explore a magical world.You come across an intresting story an advanture while expoloring this magical orld , learing spells , unlocking items finding secret items on the map and dicovering a whole new fighting system and gameplay.I would reccomand , and Ive been a fan for a year now , watching the development , but there is still alot of work to get done.BUT !!!!Its still full of bugs ! and some lags ! that m ust be fixed ! these bugs absolutely ruins the game !

												I've got this game for free during winter event and i didn't want to complain much but... its not that good.I've reserved playing this game until it was done, though i did get a glimpse of it month's ago and quite frankly i don't see a lot of changes, except perhaps intro video.Each part of the game lasts for about 5-10 minutes because game engine just can't handle bigger levels. It can barely handle even those tiny portions of the game filled with few enemies and items to smash and throw about.Character animations are non existent, from running to talking it looks unpleasant, like it was made years ago. I would rather play it in first person view just to avoid seeing those weird running stickmen hands and legs. In fact - it should've been first person, like Dark Messiah. Though i guess we would have to stare at those horrible, motionless, low polygon npc faces then... sigh.There are bugs, there are slowdowns, the story doesn't make any sense whatsoever, with unknown names, places and characters introduced for no specific purpose. Oh that person cared for someone and betrayed us? Its fine - he's dead now. Lizards want humans dead? Humans saved by birds? Birds gone away? Long faces whatstheirnames saved humans again? Why is it so unnecessarily complicated, convoluted and why do you pour so much info in the first 5 minutes of the game? Surely there are better ways to present the world and its story than that?There's also a disconnect between scenes, music, sounds and characters which almost gives me one of those ""omg how did it make onto steam?!?"" vibes. Its not THAT bad, but at times you can almost feel bad coding, graphics, animations and characters voices misaligning into something resembling ""Garry's Incident"" or ""Slaughtering Grounds"". Though, i will mention it again - its not THAT bad.I suppose what i am trying to say - its not finished. Its unpolished. Its bugged, its laggy, the dialogues are horrendous and the animations (except levitation, which looks pretty neat) will make your eyes bleed. The game is just too ambitious for its own good.Bigger levels, first person view, scratch the story, make it a sandbox with terraforming, telekinesis, fireballs. Heck - a multiplayer arena with all of those same spells would've been amazing. Sadly - no one is playing this game in co-op, the server list is empty.I suppose i could've overlooked bad story if the game had bigger levels and better animations, or i could've overlooked tiny levels and bad animations if the story was amazing but (and i am sorry for that) - i can't recommend this.------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPD:I really wish there was an option for a ""neutral"" rating. While i would not personally recommend this game, i feel that voting down the game you got for free might be a little bit unfair. Thankfully the developers are nice and understanding and a lot of people disagree with my opinion, so this particular review shouldn't be a problem for those who still want to try that game.Its just an opinion after all.

												Spend now some time with Son of Nor and I must admit that I got addicted to it. Its not comparable to other games which I have played before. You need to solve various puzzles, transform the world arround you and after all you need to survive. Im very excited by the teraforming and the telekinesis tools, they open a new dimension in the game. Therefore I can only recommend this game!!			"

												abit fiddely on the controls when playing with mouse/keyboard.  a key for this...  a key for that....a mouse click for this.... you get the jist. takes a while to figure the controls out in fact I changed them loads of times. the tuturioal or intro at the beginning of game doesnt teach you enough of what you need to know for instance without spoiling anything I got stuck so badly I assumed it was a bug (which there are quite a few off ) but upon deep thought I figured it out by experimenting with my powers which wasnt easy. I was able to get across the abyss in the caves (of where the antharis egg is.) by maknig a bridge with my telepathic abiltities but there was no"" lesson"" on how to do this at least not a CLEAR explanation on how to do it. The minimum specs for this game are far to unrealistic I am playing with a fx63000 gtx 1050 2gb and the framerate is so varied from as low as 25 to 60! you seldom hear your avatar speak except THIS IS THE WAY I CAME FROM!! lolnow the negatives are out of the way THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED and I must have played near 100 different games over the years..  It was long-very long and well worth the money. The story well thought out and unique  with good characters and good chosen names for each of them - noldric etc.  I liked the various range of paces too - sometimes the game required your quickness on the controls for instance when fighting  at other times you are  free to explore at your leasure. you always know what you need to do next so theres no pointless wandering (unless you WANT to freely explore). it reminded me of the ""myst"" and ""uru"" franchise (regarding mainly the scenery) but with  available powers and alot of ""action"". Its also Like ""uru"" in that you can choose what your avatar will wear and receive at certain points in the game such as an arm shield , you can also choose male or female. The music is beautiful and really  projects the correct atmosphere and changes pace very well when needed.  compatible with EMOTIV ,OCULAS RIFT and EYE TRACKER. hope there is a son of nor 2  sometime soon.

												As a proof of concept this is pretty good but as a finished game it fails on multiple levels. The level design looks like something you'd expect from a late 90's early 3d platformer. It all feels too designed and not something you could actually live in. The controls are ... off. Things that should be easy take way too much effort to pull of. Like creating a slope so you can reach a collectible on a high rock. Or creating an air bridge with rocks. I got those things to work but the game was constantly working against me. Your character will often clip through the rocks you've floated in order to create steps. They also won't rotate so that the flattest side faces up so you if you don't clip through you'll slide off instead. Controling objects you're levitating is also finicky with a controller. Rotating objects that are part of a puzzle works but took much longer than it should have. Character animations are stiff and stutery. Heavy rocks bounce around like they're made of styrofoam. Puzzles are very standard and fail to surprise or entertain. There are simply too many issues to make this an enjoyable game.			"

The game has a lot more than the trailer makes it appear. It doesn't have skyrim graphics, but who cares about graphics when the gameplay is this fun!Love it.			"

								If you are looking for a game that includes rocks, paper and scissor. Then you came to the wrong place, this game is about your ability to control and bend elements to your will. Want to cover a NPC house with sand? Terraform. Do you want to play the pain game with an enemy? Mass telekinesis, go tenpin bowling on those lizard freaks with boulders. Want to annoy character? Wreck their place.The current format really does remind me of the unity web player default tab button looks. It is a wonderful game with a wonderful touch, of wrecking anything that moves or breaking vases... I know you zelda and link fans.It does have frames issue for low-end computer, i hope in the future, they will implement a 320 x 480 texture pack :) For us, purist Performance players hahaha			"

												It might not have an epic quality to it (like Elder Scrolls), but I liked the simplicity of it. It feels like a casual game in a 3D world. If you like the Prince of Persia series, you could probably get into this game. The puzzle aspect is a lot of fun (most of the time). One of my favorite things is feeling like a sand version of Silver Surfer (closest thing I can compare it to). This game was not only fun, but also unique. Just like flappy bird, I see their unique character abilities showing up in other games down the road. Truly innovative. Its not the perfect game, but its an awesome game!			"

Early Access Review
								For me, Son of Nor has been for a long time a collection of impressive and sometimes hilarious video dev logs.Then came the alpha/beta/early access.Yes it still needs some polish. That's taken care of.A strong example: The first version was simply unplayable on my machine (<10fps  hiccuping). Then a few updates later, on the same machine, it was running smoothly at 60fps and much better graphic quality.Yes it is not the *most* beautiful 3D rendered world. But what is not there in terms of gloss allows your mind to take far better hold of the world and free your imagination. Some effects however are worth notice, like the water & its physics.Son of Nor is a beautiful 3rd person action adventure game, with a nice story and strong lore. You will care for the protagonist(s). I won't spoil it here.Some nice touches and attention to details will reveal more about the world than is written.It semi sand-box play with ESP powers (telekinesis, pyrokinesis...) is pure fun, and very intuitive. The gameplay keeps improving and is now almost perfect in some areas. And above all it is smooth and feel very dynamic.Puzzles are mostly physic/power based, and can be quite inventive, growing in complexity without becoming too difficult or feel repetitive.The music is nice, and some of it excellent. At some points you will just want to take in the vistas with the music... until an ugly lizard takes note of you.			"

												Let me start by saying this is a very weak recomendation. Son of nor has an good idea for a story, fun gameplay mechanics and interesting level design. The problem is that the game doesn't really do anything with those elements.  One would expect a game where you can raise and lower ground and move objects around with the power of your mind to have a bunch of puzzles and secret areas right? nope, puzzles are few and far between and the secret areas are generaly eather scenic roads to the objective (pretty to look at but otherwise boring) or small caves with some collectable or another. There is some story but it's pretty bare bone unless you want to spend time translating the game's invented alphabet. I found it too tedious to do so.The combat is where the game actually gets my recomendation. Its fun throwing enemies around, launching huge burning rocks at them, using wind to blow them off cliffs, ect. Indeed the sadistic will find plenty of ways to creatively dispatch creatures trying to kill them. Objects in the environment break in a rather satisfying way the levels are rather pretty in my opinion but are rather short often leaving you asking ""oh we are done already?"".Overall it is a fun game but it isn't going to wow you.

												As a Kickstarter backer I am following this game for quite a while. It was very interesting to see the development and the developers did a very good job. And now that it's done: This game is great!I think the control of the various magical powers is solved very well. The mix between action and puzzles ensures that the game remains interesting and varied. It feels good and makes a lot of fun.Now I'm looking forward to my eye tracker. I had the opportunity to test it briefly: impressive! The eye tracker allows a fast and precise control without moving the mouse to the individual items, thus makes the game even more fun.			"

												So after playing this game shortly after launch on Linux, I have to say, that even though I have not tested it under windows, 30-40 fps with a GTX 970 just doesn't seem right. However, I would still say this game is well worth the price. While the story/dialogue is somewhat confusing, the actual gameplay elements are truly one of a kind. The combat takes some getting used to, but overall, it really is a unique experience. Launching sharp/heavy objects from your surroundings at your enemy can be quite exhilarating, but also having the option to bury them in sand, or drop them off a cliff makes for some interesting styles of fighting. Having no UI is actually implemented quite well in my opinion, and turning to sand to indicate losing health actually feels natural. But where this game really shines is with the puzzles. It makes excellent use of telekinesis, and while some of the puzzles can be a bit confusing at first, once you realize what you're supposed to be doing, they actually have some very clever designs.  Overall, this game does have some rough edges, but for the $20 asking price, I'd say it's money well spent. and if you can get it on sale, then I say definitely grab this game. There really isn't anything else quite like it.			"

												This is one of the best games & I would have easily payed quadriple it's price if I knew in advance how awesome it truly is!I kinda knew about this game while it was still in development but because of too many things going on with my life I forgot about it with time. Last night I accidently noticed Son of Nor on the steam home page & I almost broke my mouse while mashing the ""Buy Now"" button! I went through it already & I'm going to play it all over against at least one more time on my own and a few more times with different friend groups and last but definitely not least - I'll have genuinely fun experience while going through the Co-op with my girlfriend. There are so many great things about this game. First - it's developer team is one of the best ones I've seen (and I've seen a lot), so don't take this statement lightly. Rarely you'll see such activity from such a small team (when even huge ones are doing so bad), so many promises delivered & so many more to be! Second - the game is greatly innovative. I dove into the game without prior knowledge of it's gameplay, story or anything. I made sure that I know literally nothing of Son of Nor when I clicked ""New Game"". The mechanics are great even if a little clunky at times. The spell system is great - both in how you unlock everything & how you can use it in later playthoughs & in the multiplayer, and how the spells work. Story is great & I actually found myself digging for bonus lore, searching for collectables just so I can find more stuff & when the Bible of Nor was bestowed upon me - I was more than happy to eat it with it's covers! ^_^ About the spell variety - I can't stress out how hard for a game with completely new spell system is to make all aspects of it worth while! I found myself using absolutely everything non-stop in this game while in most others I just find what is ""best"" & ""most efficient"" & I just go with it from beginning 'till the end. Here it's not like that & credit Must be given where credit is Due! Good Job Stillalive Studios! About the pacing of the game - it's not perfect but it's really good & I saw on the forums that the developers actually changed the first 2 levels after receiving players feedback. This happens like once every millennium in the gaming industry. Again cudos to the dev team! The more I see the more I'm expecting from them but that's the thing, ain't it? We as gamers & consumers hardly expect anything of much value. We're used to be treated like consumers & we're used for big companies to milk their old cows even tho those cows are drier than the deserts in Noshrac! Also this game rewards explorers. I also found myself constantly going everywhere (except for when I really got hyped on the main story line & I just wanted to know What Happens Next!). Single Player is a Great Experience which I hope that anyone who reads this review has either experienced or will exp it! I also had the luck to try out the multiplayer with one of the developers. Even tho he lagged a bit - I had immense fun. And I must add - I'm a hardcore competitive gamer to the bone! And I played PvP without a single care of who's going to win. It was just so fun! But tbh I can't wait to find at least one person to get together with so we can practice some advanced techniques & fully optimize the potential of this great game!From the gamer who's played it all - Buy Son of Nor!

												I like how the game makes you feel powerful right off the bat - move huge objects with telekinesis, smash boulders into your foes (or your foes into boulders), and even command the terrain itself, shaping sand into little hills and valleys through the powers of your mind. If you're into action adventures with juicy puzzles, this one's well worth checking out. If you have one of the exotic input devices that the game supports - like an eye-tracker or brainwave interface - it's a clear insta-buy!			"

Also it deleted my progress once or twice, always nice of a game to do that.Gameplay wise it can be summed up like this: Fun at first, but viarity comes too slow to be fun for longer.Pity I blew 20 bucks on this sucker.

												A blast to play, and actually quite enjoyable as a co-op experience. The mechanics of it can lead to some funny situations between players and I had a great time. I didn't quite beat it yet, but I love the way the whole thing feels.It does feel a little bit janky, but in a good way if that makes sense. You can tell it's not a big budget game right away but it adds to the mystery of what you might find. It feels like there are lots of things to discover and toy with and generally I can say I recommend this to anyone who wants a fun co-op experience or who likes to play games that aren't really your standard affair.

												Just awesome game. Can't wait to continue playing. :)Graphics: It's an indie title. It's quite good for that. UI could use some overhaul but it doesn't really mater for the gameGame play: The player control is very good. So much better than for example in Remember Me. It's also very intuitive (except maybe shift is not to run faster)Overall it's a very nice title. If you are interested in the development you can checkout their Youtube channel for over 100 episodes of the dev log: https://www.youtube.com/user/stillaliveGameStudio "

												The game is pretty sweet once you get to know the mechanics a bit, although ive bought it during the time of it's early development. The art style is great, the story is well in depth, but most importantly THROW EVERYTHING AT EVERYTHING!!!  Telekinesis and Terraforming  is a real friend as you navigate through puzzles, finding unreachable areas and rewards. I have yet to see any action in Multiplayer, but maybe with the game's full release, thatll change. However, because of my obselete graphics card, its a little difficult with clipping lag. You'll need a more modern day GPU to better enjoy this.  Also the other issue is being careful as you target single objects for TK as the reticle is pretty precise. Overall, using the powers of Gods to dispose of obstacles has never been so fun and challenging. So I would give this game a shot since it's just $20. "

												Even though a fairly short game it's is still very much worth playing. The ability to control the terrain around you as well as move objects and throw them provides for a very unique game play mechanic. The best part of this game is that it feels like the physics engine allow you to solve any problem a number of different ways rather than the typical ""1 right answer"" that many other games have.

The magic system comes close to a 'pure magic' kind of ideal. The story isn't fantastic, but is at least interesting. In short, an enjoyable game with a unique and effective interface.			"

												After 15 hours of perseverance I'm calling it quits, and deleting the local content.  I guess I'm stuck with it in my library regardless.  The reasons why it disgusted me are substantially the same as @Edgewalker's, with additions.  The moment when I realized I was done was a scene/level/whatever where I was supposed to ""seek shelter"" and there was no guidance or hint whatsoever AND there was an unstoppable enormous monster waiting to ambush me.  Also, the game has no compass, no minimap, no sense of direction in a game where sense of direction is critical.  The only way one can learn what needs to be done or where to go is to simply experiment wildly and die repeatedly until one gets it right.  Last time I checked, dying in the real world is an abrupt end to learning.  I don't find it any more entertaining in a game than I would in real life.  Dying is a final resounding failure; one doesn't learn from that.			"

								Its a interesting game with a interesting concept although as Kotaku said you are pretty much the Avatar although instead of a natural instinct to control the elements you are using ""magic"" instead and you are struggling thru the game to protect other people. Although it is early access the game right now is quite promising and I am looking forward to a finished product.

												I recently got the opportunity to spend some time with Son of Nor from Stillalive Studios. In this action adventure you take control of the elements and set out into the unknown. Tasked with protecting the last standing home for all humans, you quickly jump into the action.Equipped with your power to control the elements, and it's setting, I can't help but be reminded of The Last Airbender when playing Son of Nor. The early tutorial section quickly gives you a glimpse at several basic powers. Taking advantage of the physics based engine, you control the earth, sand and wind around you. This allows you call rocks, broken branches, dropped weapons, even fallen enemies to your use. Throwing these objects at oncoming enemies, or at obstacles to clear them.The early game play is quite simple, with your first quests having you aid the small starting town. Later you get to defend the town from it's lizard like foes. Generally though the only danger comes from falling, or mishandling your powers and accidentally dropping a boulder on your head. The quick feel of power however is rewarding. There are several other powers and abilities to be gained as you explore the world. The power over fire and water for example. You can also combine these powers to make more powerful attacks. Flaming tornado anyone?Visually Son of Nor isn't the best looking game. There are many clipping issues, textures pop in and out, and the polygon levels are fairly low. This is early access however, so many of these issues are likely to be smoothed out in later updates. The overall vibrancy of the game is subdued as well, with mostly neutral colours in the pallet. Lots of browns, and beiges don't add much life to your surroundings. The powers however work fairly well, and the control scheme is easy to adapt to.All of the early scenes contain full voiceovers. This adds an element of polish to the game, however the voice over quality is a bit over the top and a little campy. The campiness goes along with the general storyline. There is a detailed story here, but it often feels like bits and pieces of other stories we have already played, or seen. What does come to the surface though is the developer's sense of humour. There are a lot of silly, funny lines in the game, some characters often complaining about you terraforming the ground underneath their feet gave a few laughs for instance. I have only spent a short time with Son of Nor however, so I am hopeful that the story will improve as I dive deeper into the game.The overall sense of power early on makes Son of Nor a fun play. You get to smash a lot of stuff to your hearths content. As you earn new spells, this sense of fun continues throughout the game. The lighthearted comical nature of dialogue, though campy and sometimes overly silly often still adds to this fun. I hope that later parts of the game, are more colourful and vibrant than the early zones to encourage more exploration. I will definitely keep an eye on Son of Nor's progress and check in when they next update.			"

												I hate giving this a thumbs down, theres some excellent potential here and I'm really impressed with all they've managed already.  But at the end of the day this is too unpolished in it's current state.  I want to see more, I want to see it done better, there are some ideas and first steps here with brilliant potential and in the hope they someday see the light of day I don't regret giving the devs my money.  But it's too laggy, a bit buggy at times, way too unclear on occasion, and the control scheme for doing the cool things you need to do just isn't there yet.  To put that last complaint in perspective (since I think that's the big thing that earns a 'I do not recommend' rating)... imagine portal.  Now, imagine you had to pull off button combos to place your portals and then add a couple of different combos for orienting the portals different ways.  The same basic amazing game is there but it's now made nearly unplayable by some major problems.			"

												Son of Nor looks cool. I bought it and found it literally unplayable on my Mac. I'd like a refund, but am not gamer-savvy enough to understand where to request it.Yes the frame rate is jacked up; yes the controls don't work properly.			"

												Son of Nor is interesting at a glance. Although it has some very dated graphics, anyone can look at it and say 'hey, that looks like it could be fun', and they'd be right.Son of Nor has moments at which I really enjoy myself. But they are few and far between. The game seems dead-set on forcing it's users on trudging through poorly designed levels, plagued with poorly designed puzzles that halt the otherwise interesting action component of the game.The multiplayer can bring some enjoyment to the table as well, but it's just fluff--there isn't any portion of the game that I truly felt like it would benefit from having another player accompany me through. The levels are small, and that is only hidden by the sea of barely understandable puzzles that seem to be designed to not engage the player, but instead hinder their progress.I think there's a lot of good ideas in this game, some of which are executed quite well. But at the end of the day, it's tedious, uninteresting, and just not very fun.			"

												The story is interesting, and the powers imaginative, but unfortunatly, this is easily one of the poorest examples of optimization I have ever seen. Early on in the game, the player encounters an enemey camp that they must go through to get a powerup. Unfortunately, this is next to impossible, as the frames drop to less than 1/s due to the never-ending river of enemies that poors out. The menues are literally unreadable on anything but the highest quality setting, and since when is a minimum requirement of an nVidia 8800 a reasonable design descision? 8800's and higher should be for those players who want to get a little extra oomph out of the visuals, they should never be the base requriement. Based on the promotional videos, it seems like the devs spent thier time getting the game to work with some (admittedly really cool peripherals) when they should have been spent it to make the game run at more than 10 fps whenever there are any number of enemies on screen. I'll end on a positive note: the terraforming feature is a lot of fun, and the story sound incredible. I just hope that the devs optimize the game so that its playable.			"

												Anyone that gave this game positive reviews should be ashamed of themselves for misleading people so terribly. The concepts behind the gameplay could have been good, but the premise is trumped by the presentation. Clunky controls, worse camera, unoriginal lore (humans are nearly extinct because of a race of evil whatsits that enslaved them long ago, hide in the desert, lizard men still hunt them for no reason blah blah), boring visuals with graphics reminiscent of the original Black and White (character models as jagged as the cliffs that restrict your movement). Just a bad game in every way but the physics based combat and enviromental control idea, but that is put into action so poorly you'll wish you just had a way to punch your foes on the nose. It'd be more effective.I also suggest everyone flag the Character Action tag as being applied incorrectly. This is in no way a part of that genre.			"

												I want be back here some day, I want be here writing some nice positive review as I think this game has big potential ahead and it may be very good (if Devs take care right of him)---This game needs so much work on it. I can't recommend it by now. I'm sorry haters ;)Pros:-Innovative (can't deny)-Good Graphics (ONLY in max resolution - here is 1920-1080)... more to come when the game gets complete (by now it's an Early Access) again, sorry haters ;)Cons:-UI Design (incomplete - lack polished and more options)-Optimization (plays at 11 fps in max resolution) -> my PC runs Sniper Elite 3 max settings so smooth ;)-Optimization again (plays at 20 fps in 1280-720 wtf?! yeah, it's true)-Controls (the game don't know when respond to gamepad or not - confuse system - needs work)... more to come if I give a shot again to find out or remember other faults!    ... less to come if I see patch updates coming everytime just like the guys behind GRAV do (GRAV Devs - hats-off!)so by now Rate at 4/10			"

												Update: I tried, per the dev response below, to play again.  Its sooooo lame.  I just can't... I played 10 more minutes and removed from library.  The game is awful.  Terraforming is clunky and tedious... i went through every battle simply holding shift and clicking and killing everything.  Subtitles will have exclamation points, while the voice actor simply talks with no emotion. (except for Tanath, his voice acting is pretty decent).  There is ZERO enjoyment here.  My original  review still stands.I played the tutorial, or some of it, i dunno... i played for 20 minutes.  I got bored and turned it off, to me it just seems like a kids game or something.  Cheesey art, Cheesey story.  All i did was Pick up a rock, throw it somewhere.... Pick up a person, throw him somewhere...Pick up everything, throw it all somewhere.  Which, even MAYBE that would be fun, except that it looks super lame when you do it.  You don't feel like your smashing anything, or really destroying anything, everything feels light, physics feel off, FPS bogs constantly.   Its like a dull platformer from the N64 days lol. (not graphic-wise, just boring wise lol).  Granted, i only played for 20 minutes, but to be honest, i kind of expect to be ""captured"" by a game in the first 20 at least enoughto to want to dig in a little more , enough to want to continue to learn it, and play it at least.  The devs seem real nice though, reading through other comments, they seem anxious to hear feedback and seem very professional.  So maybe this gets patched into something better.  For me however, i just dont see myself turning it back on.			"

												Firstly I would like to say that this game had some good concepts and ideas, if were not poorly executed- this game had great potential and generally would not be poor in terms of gameplay, mechanics, performance, dialogue, transitioning; these are the core elements in which should be top quality in a video game. After playing an hour, attempting to fix an issue of lag, bare in mind my GPU is above the recommended yet it seems to be the case where my GPU is running at maximum capabilities in terms of memory and shader allocations; and yet I still have an issue with framerate and ligthing. I even lowered my resolutions from 1920x1200 to 1280x720, yet still the issue persue.  More on the topic of graphical issues, the 'telekanesis' ability when picking up rocks, in fact anything you pick up has a glitchty outer texture, whether that was supposed to be some sort of glowing effect- I do not know, but it was not well executed either way. Okay, enough about performance issues and graphics, more onto the gameplay. Do not get me the wrong, the story has a good concept just the characters seem too wooden, emotionless and the whole dialogue just seems to be cliche, typical. The transitions seems to be unnatrual, with instancing between certain areas of the level you are on, meaning you get a loading screen for fixed points in the level. Most items you can control with your abilities, along with shaping the ground with terraforming, I believe that due to most things be prerendered, you get a lot of lag on the start of levels. Combat is poor, I was expecting good combat with these great concepts, but mostly the AI is poor and enemies are too easy to deal with after playing 3 levels there is no challenge present (I am also playing on hard difficulty). And NPCs do most of the killing for you, which again, ruins the experience. In conclusion, I would not recommend this game- it was a great idea but sadly was not expressed or brought out upon it's full potential. Which is a shame.			"

												NOT recommended.  The controls are janky as all heck.  By janky I mean that, holding a rock with Telekenesis feels like you're throwing spitballs, but pick up a character and it's like you're trying to move Mt. Everest.  The story is contrived, with the writing on the level of something you'd find in your High School drama class.  You're commonly thrown into sections with lighting so bad that you literally can't see what's killing you.  You'll run into a bush that kills you in less than 3 seconds, while jumping off a cliff that would kill a mountain goat leaves you with barely a scratch.  The camera finds wonderful ways of embedding itself in scenery and the levels are so linear they might as well be on rails.There is some definite creativity here.  So much potential.  Given a good team, this could have been a great game.  Instead, it's relegated to the bargain bin section, with bland textures, and character models so stiff you'd swear you're playing  Han Solo in Carbonite.  Oh, and the UI?  Ha!  Just wait until you turn on subtitles, and then realize you can't read them because half of what is said is formatted off-screen... then realize that the spoken sections, while admirable, is voiced by the same person, dozens of dozens of times...Save your money for one of the other hundreds of fine games.  Skip this one, you won't miss much.			"

												What a terrible game.The animation and gameplay is clunky, like someone was following a YouTube tutorial on how Unity works. The writing is roughly at the level of a seventh grade fanfiction. I played it both with controller and keyboard/mouse and I couldn't decide which I disliked more: the imprecise aiming of K/M or the difficult camera of the controller. Nevermind the INSANE list of bugfixes and ""level revamps"" that came out A MONTH after it was released.This plays like a kickstarted indie game rather than the AAA knockoff it wants to be, which is such a shame. I could forgive much of its flaws if the spellcasting were cool enouch - but sadly, the design of the game isn't polished enough to encourage the player to immerse themselves. Save your money.			"

												EDIT: issues have since been fixed and whole game runs much smoother after a few updates.Still not reccomended to play with the Oculus Rift DK2 but on SteamOS and Windows is great fun.**Original Below**I purchased this to play on SteamOS with a wireless gamepad (xbox360 controller), this experience was pretty horrible. Despite saying it has full controller support you still need a mouse/keyboard to create your character and start the game. The game also seems to fail to register some button presses and the default keymap is completely wrong (ie instructions on the screen do not relate to the default button map).I have also tried the game windows (with the same xbox360 controller) and it was a completely different experience. Buttons are mapped correctly and the controller worked perfectly. I doubt this game was designed with a gamepad in mind though as it still feels a bit clunky and my fingers were having to do a lot of work just to run,jump, and move the camera at the same time.  Some sort of camera follow option might fix this.That said once I had it running the gameplay seems quite fun, the plot is interesting enough and the puzzles kept me challenged at the right levelI also tried it with the Oculus Rift DK2 (I know its alpha) and found it completely unplayable as I could not get head tracking working.  Based on the resolution it sets up I suspect this might be build to support the DK1 instead.I still have hope that this will be a fun game however due to the controller issues I experienced I cant recommend it to anyone that wants to play on Linux.
