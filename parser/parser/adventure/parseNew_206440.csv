												Video games often deal with larger than life situations, and yet it tends to be the simpler things that hit home the most. Borrowing elements from films such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and Pixar's Up, this is the story of a man on his deathbed attempting to fulfil his lifelong dream to visit the moon. To go into anymore detail and risk spoilers would be a crime, but know that To The Moon stands as one of the most heartfelt stories of any game I have ever played, and when paired with the immaculate score composed by my much beloved Laura Shigihara, I can hardly imagine how someone could play through it without feeling something.It's worth noting that what is here consists almost entirely of exposition. This is in by no means a slight against the game, just a fact that needs to be mentioned so you know what you are getting into. I realize that many have a disdain for games that barely warrant being described as such, but in this case I beg that they put aside those prejudices, as I feel if anything could change their minds To The Moon is it.To say that Freebird Games creation was emotionally affecting to me would be an understatement. Despite coming close on many occasions, I can scarcely recall any game that managed to make me tear up the way To The Moon did. It's a remarkable achievement in not only videogame storytelling, but as a narrative in any medium, and you would be an absolute fool if you passed it up!You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Wow.To be brutally honest, I loaded this game up today thinking that I would just play around for a few minutes and then put it away, unlikely to ever play it again. In reality, from the point the story began to unfold I decided that I wouldn't ... or couldn't stop until it was completed. It's amazing what Freebird Games managed to do with the RPG Maker tool. With some subtle animations, lighting, and movement, it didn't take long for me to forget the 'low budget' visuals and imagine as the game and story elements unfolded in whatever resolution my mind can create. I will admit that this isn't what a person could call a gameplay heavy experience. However, the way that the elements are woven into the story are creative and even add to the story. I think as a medium we hurt ourselves by calling our games 'games' at all... however, I was able to complete the journey through my own interaction with enough perceived freedom that I didn't feel corralled into a corner. Mostly the story itself made me want to push to the next story element or conclusion... it was simply that good. It's sad, really, that a small time developer like Freebird can craft something with such a small budget that is so moving, yet all the big AAA developers can hardly bring me to laugh let alone shed a tear. Speaking of laughter, the pacing of the story is impressive with some comic relief to mix up the joy and sadness. Although I will admit, a few times I thought one of the main characters was a little over-the-top silly... but that may just well be who he is.When I was in college I took a movie class where the instructor said it was a travesty to ever watch a movie in pieces... and in this case, if you can free up a few hours, I think that this dish is best served in one sitting. Just keep a box of tissue next to your monitor.			"

												I like to think of myself as a human being in touch with my emotions. I feel, love to feel and don't stray away from bad or good. I admit, sometimes I tend to overreact, but my opinion is that things like that can't happen if you don't care. However, I am not easily touched by art. The last time I've cried is also the first time, as far as I can remember. Back in the nineties, when I was five or six, I've watched this movie... I can't remember its title, but I remember the dread and tears rolling down my cheeks during the final movie scene where character visits his buddy's grave. His deceased friend is his circus monkey and instead of flowers, he's bringing him bananas. Something about it disturbed me deeply.Since then, I had a few emotional rollercoasters where consuming art made it harder to swallow or breathe, but I was never moved completely.Steam Awards this autumn had To The Moon nominated by a buddy of mine. I was suspicious about it; hey, it's Enterbrain's engine RPG, which means Game Maker, which means, dude, stuff like that can't move you. I didn't really point it out to my friend, but could he feel I was skeptical? Could be, because I've received it as a gift. So, at least I could give it a try, right?At first sight, To The Moon looks childlishly naive. It's a simple 'walk-in-four-directions' RPG game with limited interactivity and no combat system. It gives an impression it wants you to explore its world, however, soon enough you will discover the game is rather linear.Dr. Rosaline and Dr. Watts of Sigmund Corp. have a rather peculiar job - they rearrange memories of dying people so they remember their life differently seconds before dying. The new technology allows them to fulfill dying person's wishes. They didn't expect visiting Johnathan Wyles would be anything more than a regular night on the job. However, things turn out to be rather complicated when they find out they need to fulfill Johnathan's dying wish - make him travel to the Moon.It doesn't take very long to get tangled into a four hour story choke full with symbolism and emotions, aiming and succeeding in shattering you to the core. This is a game that thrives on its lack of stereotypical heroes, big quests and otherworldly ideas. Meeting Johnny (Johnathan's nickname) proves to be a gutwrenching, slowbuilding experience. Nothing in To The Moon happens too fast or too slow; the story is perfectly timed and it's progressing toward the epic finale one step at a time. Both humans and certain objects are pieces of grandiose puzzle. However, motif is not onedimensional - it consists of several layers and, as you piece it together, it takes away your breath, masterfully emphasizing tearjerking moments by utilizing comic relief in form of Dr. Watts dialogue lines which are often used to break the fourth wall and make the world even more beliveable. And while moving and interacting mechanics are not something that game should be proud of, they're basically non-important. On the other hand, music composed by Kan R. Gao, game's writer and director, proves to be a moving force behind the title and catalyst for game's story. It works wonders in creating atmosphere, be it moments of light comedy or heavyweight anxiety. As the game progressed, I felt it coming: I knew To The Moon is actually influencing my mental state and changing my perspective with each passing minute. I knew I was getting attached to the characters, their ideas, fears, thoughts, doubts and hopes. By the end of Act 2, it was getting harder to breathe and my emotions evidently grew stronger.As I was approaching the game's climax, I felt my eyes were burning and body's temperature rising. And then it hit me so hard, the way I wasn't struck by anything in art since that monkey scene from a movie I no longer remember - To The Moon made me cry and it didn't stop there. As I was gasping for air and being thankful I was home alone, I couldn't stop myself. Emotions were too strong, no matter how hard I fought against them. I even tried concentrating, meditating on my breath, thinking crying over game is probably silly because I'm causing pain to myself... But I was wrong. I was so wrong.To The Moon made me cry during playing, step away from a keyboard and cry for another half an hour after finishing it because it was so liberating. It was an unscrewed valve releasing tons of pent-up emotions from who knows where. A silly little game I knew nothing about proved to be one of my favorite games ever, one I will ALWAYS recommend and the one I will measure interactive art from now on.Few months ago, I was at home, nervous about some basically unimportant reason (could it be money, or recent  unemployment or what?). My daughter was sitting by the window, her elbows on the window sill. So I was nervously pacing through the room when she turned to me and said: ""Dad, come here with me, let's look at the stars.""And I've really turned around, somehow, the fate didn't allow me to miss out on that opportunity. So we sat by the window and we've looked at the starry sky and then she said to me ""Look at the stars, Dad. Stay here with me. We'll look at the stars. Aren't they beautiful?""So I sat there and gazed upon the shiny dots thinking that, as we grow up, society murders something good in all of us and that our kids are the only way we can, at least partially, get it back.So, just as my daughter on that very night, this game did the same thing for me - with its story of hopes, dreams, fears, love, life and death, it made me feel a little bit more human. And I'm forever thankful for that.   *** You have reached the end of a review.

												This game had me from the start. I knew I was going to be filled with emotion following the story and the soundtrack. This was truly a little piece of hidden art. I actually did not want it to end and I must admit that I may have shed a tear. This is one of those stories that makes you not want to take a break to eat or take phone calls.

Exquisite, emotional storytellingTo the Moon was released late 2011 to immense critical acclaim - it received several awards as one of the best Indie-games of 2011. Steam user reviews are also ""overwhelmingly positive"" (97% positive out of nearly 12.000 reviews is really impressive). That's already quite an achievement by itself, as it was the first game made by the then new and really small development studio ""Freebird Games"". So I went into this game with quite some expectations, and I am very happy they were all fulfilled, and more.To put it frankly: as a game that wants to tell an original, emotionally involving story, To the Moon is simply among the very, very best. Its story is so original, so gripping and so sad at some points, that I found myself completely absorbed by it, and I played through the entire game in one day and almost in a single go. That's no exceptional feat: it's not very long, I needed just under six hours to reach the end. But what wonderful six hours these were! Since To the Moon relies for more than 90% on its story and its twists and turns, I won't spoil anything here. Suffice it to say that I felt involved in a way that a good book or a good movie can achieve -and maybe even more.It's not only the story that is gripping, there is more to it. To the Moon dwells extensively on very important social and philosophical questions, such as the desire to develop one's individuality amid a rather bland society, or man's right to decide (or not) on his own life's ending. Heavy and even depressing as this may sound, in reality the game succeeds wonderfully in touching these delicate issues in a subtle way, made all the more digestible by its great use of humour. I found myself quite often laughing aloud, only to feel tears coming up the next minute or so. It's this so difficult to achieve balance between humour and depth, that makes this game outstanding and a true piece of art. Dialogues, of which there are plenty, are simply masterful: all credits to the story- and copy-writers for this one.Not everything is perfect, though: the actual gameplay is rather bland and even repetitive, since it mostly involves moving the two playable characters around on a small map and interacting with objcets and other persons in a rather straightforward point-and-click adventure-syle. Happily, the inventory is kept very simple, but there are is a whole series of mini- (even micro-) games that is simply boring. But even this rather disappointing gameplay vanishes into nothing thanks to the story and the emotions it evokes. The subtle 16-bit graphics are quite interesting: even though heavily pixelated, they manage to bring across quite some detail, even on an emotional level.All in all, this is a gem of a game; a testimony to the fact that Indie-games have evolved into gamings most innovative department, where content is so much more important than package. It's a must-have for anyone who takes his gaming even a tiny bit serious.Overall score: 9.5/10			"

Just...such a HUGE LOVE and amazing dream! I can compare this game with one of my favourite movies ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". Spectacular dialogs, emotional roller coaster, great humor. And main piano theme ""For River\To the moon"" it is....I am speechless. 10 out of 10 from a sentimental dreamer.			"

OverviewTo the Moon is not so much a game as a story driven interactive narrative. The gameplay is minimal and it mainly consists of moving around, but once you get into the story, believe me, you won't give a s#!t. This is an absolutely AMAZING game that will make you both laugh and cry. Words cannot describe my experience with it. Just... Just play it.The Pros:Amazing Story - I will not spoil any details about the story, but I will vouch for it's quality. You play as a pair of scientists who work for a sort of ""Make a Wish"" foundation, but which use an Animus-like machine to enter peoples memories and alter them in order to grant the dying person's wish. The story is divided into three acts, and takes about 4 hours to naturally progress through. Some may argue the story elements are a bit cliche, but frankly it was so well executed and related that I cannot say that bothered me. Also, great piece of advice from me: Pay close attention to everything. Even something that might not seem relevant will prove to be a foreshadowing of a greater truth. It's worth it to pay close attention to surroundings, dialogues, scenery, anything and everything. Great Characters - The characters' personality is well defined, and you will grow to like them, especially Dr. Neil Watts, one of the controllable characters, who is the comic relief of the story and does a great job. But in all seriousness, everything is so amazing about this story.Amazing Music - If anyone says music in gaming doesn't impact on experience they have obviously not played this game. The music is absolutely amazing and only hearing different tracks can put you in a different mood. You can go from happy to sad to worried to sad in a few minutes.Beautiful Pixel Art - The game's retro RPG style graphics is a strong point in my opinion. It makes you concentrate more on the story. Anyways, the environment is beautiful, lighting is superb and I've never admired a pixel graphics game with such attention thus far.Free DLC! - So far there were two mini episodes released which you can download and play for free! Also, the OST, which is paid, apart from being beautiful, offers 50% of the profits to charity. This is DLC done right.The Cons:Resolution - This isn't about graphics, and you won't even notice, as the game really sucks you in like a good book, but I was having problems opening up the game, and instead of upscaling to full HD, the game resorts to a very tiny resolution that might cause issues to some. Also, it's 4:3, and you'll see black bars. This is most likely because of the game engine they used.It ends. - At some points i couldn't wait for the story to go on so I can see what happens, and at the end I wish it didn't because I was just sobbing at the ending. Amazing.ConclusionThis game is an excellent visual narration, and I recommend it to anyone wanting to read a great story in a great manner. The Overwhelmingly Positive reviews are truly deserved. Also gift this to people who play tough, and see if they cry at the end. I was surprised I did.If you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

""I never told anyone but... I've always thought they were lighthouses.""There are odd, mismatching anecdotes in everybody’s life that would not absolutely mean a thing for anyone else beside a handful of people. Like an old, tattered soccer ball, an origami rabbit figure or an ugly platypus plushy... Here in this heartwarming narrative story, we are given the chance to acknowledge the sentiment hidden behind the oddity: a story of love, loss and a promise that would make a grown man shed a tear or two.It was the middle of a storm shaken night when esteemed doctors Eva Rosalene and Neill Watts arrived on the address given to them. They argued a bit among each other - about whose fault it would be the company car getting crashed on a tree - and took off, hurrying towards the house on the cliff. They heard the lingering song resounding from a piano as they get in. Lily, the caretaker of the old man welcomed them in and asked them nervously as she was leading them towards their client: ""If you wouldn't take my question the wrong way, what would be your business exactly?” Neill answered the question with a wide grin on his face before Eva had the time to say anything: ""We grant wishes!” The caretaker was a bit startled by the unexpected answer, but didn't push for any more explanation. This time Eva directed the anticipated question: ""What was his last wish?” Lily took a pause just long enough to catch her breath while opening the door to the master bedroom where a doctor was in attending to observe the patient's vitals, then answered: ""He wanted to go to the moon...""To the Moon is a wondrous little story about an old man and his enigmatic dying wish. Thousands of anecdotes, daily items, far forgotten dialogues and faces that belonged to a life past brought together paints a picture that you wouldn't soon forget. Ever watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? Well, it's that kind of experience, plus some sense of humor inclined to be either absurd or noir, and minus Jim Carrey. It is cheesy, it is sensual, and it is heart wreckingly realistic and... It is a modern fairytale.I mostly agree that beauty lies in simplicity. To the Moon seems to be proof enough with 16 bit RPGMaker graphics, a handful of beautiful piano songs and cartoonish figures moving around with near comical animations, yet still with powerful enough narrative and screenplay that would result in making a grown woman like me cry. I've seen Hollywood sob stories with lesser creative spark and elegance in narration compared to this one. It is weaved with odes, references and commemorations that would bring faint smiles to your face; sometimes with bitterness, sometimes with warmth.There is arguably no gameplay aside walking around and collecting some items - and solving a folding puzzle now and then - thus, the game can either be categorized as a minimalistic adventure or a visual novel with puzzle elements altogether. For the fair warning, it certainly is not an RPG. Knowing whatever you are getting yourselves into, To the Moon is a welcome experience of 4-5 hours.For me, it was worth every single second I spared. There are the kind of games that you'd wish you forget about, just so you can experience them for the first time all over again. This is one of them.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												To The Moon is definitely an interactive story more than a game, but please don't let that turn you away and cause you to miss out on an amazing experience. This is a story that will hit you, possibly directly, in The Feels™. It takes around four hours total depending on how quickly you move through, but please do yourself a favor and don't rush through. Freebird Games did an excellent job in presenting an emotional story which will keep you glued to your screen. Pick an evening, sit back, and take the time to enjoy the tale as it unfolds.			"

												I'm meant to be doing IT work right now but I'm bored, so I thought ""why don't I review a game?""Well, I say a game, but To The Moon is more than a game. It's a story, and a damn good one at that. To The Moon sits on a prestigious list of ""Games that made me cry"". This list features games such as:Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue TeamPokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of TimeMetal Gear Solid 4LA Noire Unboxing 40 crates on TF2 On a more serious note, I thoroughly recommend this game to everyone. It has a beautifuly written story that makes me want to replay it again and again, a beautiful soundtrack that deserves the purchase and has beatiful artwork, especially considering this was made in RPG Maker. Even if you aren't a fan of story driven games I'd pick this up, I wasn't and this is probaby in my top 5 games I've played this year.10/10 - Would cry again			"

												This is one of the greatest games I've ever played. If it were a movie To the Moon would be on par with Titanic if not better. Coming from someone who doesn't get emotionally affected easily, believe me when I say if you want a heartfelt and sentimental experience worth every penny, you will want to buy this game. It's on the Humble Indie Bundle X now but you should definitely pay the $10 to buy it on steam. There is a huge amount of detail put into this RPG style game so you can explore every nook and cranny of his life and how it is like. With an amazing storyline and touching soundtrack you will feel like you are the one getting his wish fulfilled. Seriously stop reading this and buy it right now and it'll be the best 10 bucks you ever spent. The question I hope you will be left with at the end is, what does it really mean to be living the dream?			"

												When your life comes to an end, what else is your life than the accumulation of your memories? To the Moon introduces the idea of having the possibility to rewrite your life in order to be content with it during you last concious moments on this planet, but  also presents you with the costs of doing so.Besides having a filosofically interesting plot, this game features tonnes of little jokes and references that will keep the enjoyment up to scratch right from the start, all the way through the game, always knowing when it's appropriate to be funny. This story is nicely accompanied by a lovely soundtrack that deserves to be picked up and having a listen to. Unless, of course, you have an intrinsic hate of piano music. The tracks are composed in such a way that they fit the individual scenes perfectly and add a genuine extra layer to the storytelling.Playing this game for anything than its, frankly magnificent, storytelling capabilities would be a mistake though. Walking around feels like being in an outdated JRPG and further gameplay consists of non-imaginative puzzles that serve little purpose other than helping the player to not feel like they're watching a single cutscene.Despite its flaws and being just a couple hours worth of an experience, I can do nothing else than recommend this wonderfully emotional piece of storytelling masterpiece, manly tears were shed. A must-play.			"

												Well this game has been rattling around my library for quite some time now, I finally clicked ""play"". Then I didn't get out of my chair for the next 3 hours. To the Moon is a great story, the whole game plays out like a nice movie. A few 4th wall breaking references here or there, some comic relief, and of course TONS of sappiness. I really wasn't sure what to expect going into this, but with so many positive reviews and such a neat pricetag I remained fairly optimistic, and honestly any expectations I might've had were blown out of the water by what this game really delivered. I didn't think such a story could be told in this format, I didn't know that so few pixels could make me experience so many feels.. I can't make a pros/cons list for this game really. It wouldn't really make sense. If you want to sit back and casually navigate your way through a captivating story then this game might be for you! If you're looking for a more interactive experience - or maybe want to blow some♥♥♥♥♥♥up - I wouldn't recommend this for you. Honestly even if this isn't the type of game you think you'd enjoy I would still recommend waiting for a sale and giving it a shot, I spent 2$ and then one day I was in the mood for something different, and now here I am adding another thumbs up to the mountain of positive reviews this game has :)			"

""I'VE ALWAYS THOUGH THEY WERE LIGHTHOUSES. BILLIONS OF LIGHTHOUSES…STUCK AT THE FAR END OF THE SKY.""One of the best buys from Humble Bundle ever. Approx. 1 dollar for this little gaming gem. Debut of the Canadian developer Freebird Game. But they wasn't really out of touch. Previously they created 3 games already and Kan Gao as the head of Freebird did another projects too. But as their debut, this is the best they could wish for. To the Moon is the game that define or used to define indie games 5 years ago. Small puzzles, little interaction with enviroment, vintage visuals, great audio and what is most important thing - dialogues. Creative approach indie games have is just whole another level. Imagine AAA game with indie game dialogues. Oh boy.Game will last you around 2-3 hours depends how you play it. I've finished that in 2011 under 2 hours, now I did it second time, but game itself isn't that much replayable to be honest. Second time you won't enjoy it that much. Game contains free DLCs, so make sure you get them and play them aswell. Soundtrack is awesome too! But you already know that.About the price, it's really questionable. Me personally, I wouldn't pay 8 dollars for it. During sale it might be reasonable to get it for 4 dollars, but if you are hard on sensitive games, and really enjoy that way of gaming experience, then do it anyway.Finding Paraside is the new game similar to To the Moon, and it's realasing this summer, so we'll see how creative Freebird will be with that one. That being said, we've reached the end.Bonus Point: Definition of GenreRating: 10/10 "

												To the moon tells a wonderful story, of life, love and loss.  It's more a piece of art than a video game.  Anyone who enjoys a good story will enjoy this game.  If you're looking for cutting edge graphics, or state of the art gameplay this won't be for you.  In fact this game is pretty devoid of gameplay outside of moving from one scene to the next.  The game has some very simplistic puzzles which can typically be solved in under 10 moves.  Although game isn't about defeating enemies, gaining experience or collecting loot. You play as a pair of... well they are called Doctors but I think they are more or less Scientist.  Their job is to go into someone memories, unlock the meories and use them to rebuild the memories in such a way as to fulfil their dying patients wish.. This story centers around a dying man named Johnny who wished to visit the moon.. hence the games title.. To the Moon.  Along the way of recovering Johnny's memory a wonderful story of love, and loss unfolds before your eyes..  This game is very good, it tells an amazing story, which if you enjoy stories, you'll love, if you are the pew pew pew, kill enemies, collect loot, gain levels type of guy, you should stay far away from this.   The game will last about 2 hours give or take a few minutes for solving the puzzles.  The ending will bring out the feelings in even the most hardened gamer.  Although as good as the story is, it can be pretty predicatable, although that isn't really a bad thing..I'd recommend this game highly, great story, great music, and generally enjoyable enough..

												For the past couple of years, I've been diagnosed with a mental condition that puts me in a state of extreme fear, anxiety, apathy, and other kinds of disorders. The medication worked fine and calmed me down, but there's something in this game that made me feel something I haven't felt in a long time, I'm not really sure what that feeling was but it feels amazing. I'm not saying this game cured me or any other pretentious things like that, but It pulled some kind of trigger in me that made me at least ""feel"" something.Thanks devs..			"

												The storyline was beautiful and funny. It made me feel as if true love no matter the obstacles or hardships you may face, it is worth tackling them together. Sometimes one may make sacrifices that others may not understand, not even the one they might of been intended for but its always for a dream. Love is such a big word and can be expressed in many forms. The story really felt almost like a novella (soap opera)One moment they are jerking your tears, the next you are smiling and that is what made it more interesting to continue playing. The twist in this game were on point and with some patience it really pays off to follow the game through the ending. Brace yourself though, ninja onions will pop out of nowhere towards the end!Happiness is best shared amongst those you love the most.. family, friends, and that special someone.“A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.” ― John Lennon			"

												Got this game from a friend. But honestly, I'd pay 20$ for it.It starts off slow, but after about 30 minutes of playtime, you are exposed to the most beautiful, thrilling and exciting story.It got me to reconnect with some of my long forgotten dreams, and it made me cry. A lot.The soundtrack is beautiful, and I still listen to it whenever I'm down.If you finish this game and don't like it, you are dead to me.			"

												When I first started playing this game my goal was to get that one achievement. Easy perfect game right there so I went with it. But wow.. What an emotional experience. It's not one of those other games you play and then just forget about them. You might think back to this game and relate to it everyday. Simply amazing it's worth every penny, loved the story :) Voted on ""To The Moon"" for The “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award. If they don't win on that category I honestly don't know what will.			"

												To the Moon gets a lot of praise for it's story, and I'm happy to say it lived up to my expectations. There is very little gameplay to be had, the 'game' is about the journey you go on, slowly going back through John's life piecing things together.I was warned that I would be in tears playing this, and there was a little part early on that got me blubbering, perhaps because it hit a little too close to home in that circumstance. As I approached the end of the story, I was ready and waiting for the part that would hit my emotions, as I had been told the ending was quite a tear-jerker. Just as I thought the game was coming to a close and I had missed it, it hit me. I was a blubbering wreck as the story tied everything up and came to a close.To the Moon will not thrill you with revolutionary gameplay and mechanics. However, it will take you on a journey that will captivate you and leave you feeling such strong emotions for the little pixelated people.'Play' To the Moon, it's quite the journey.			"

												This game has the best story I've ever seen in gaming.I was not expecting to play this game a lot, I got the game in a bundle and I don't like point & click at all.But, I loved this game. I've been playing this until the very end. This game is a masterpiece.Kan Gao is a genius. The story is not only amazing, the music and art(if you're into pixel art) are aswell.Reviews said that this game makes the player very emotional, I was not expecting this to happen since I don't get emotional easily. But this game did make me emotional. I love it. I would recommend this game to everyone even if the gameplay is not your style. It has a lot of cutscene's, but that is what makes this game.			"

To the Moon is a game that's hard to review, because it's hard to tell you in detail why it's great without spoiling anything. At the same time, if you just tell people a game is great and you can't tell them why, they're bound to avoid it because it raises expectations and they can only be disappointed from there. So let me tell you instead what it isn't and work from there. To the Moon isn't your standard pixelated RPG with 20 hours of grinding and half a dozen colorfully troubled individuals who have to band together to save the world from an unspeakable evil. The only RPG it reminded me of is Chrono Trigger, and that only because, like Chrono Trigger, it has a soundtrack for the ages. The game elements in it are very shallow and you will never be required to make a meaningful choice anywhere. It's got just about enough interactivity that you can still call it a game rather than just a story, but at the same time it's clearly all about the story. And the story, when you get down to it, isn't even all that clever. It's got nothing in it that you haven't seen somewhere before, especially if you're a fan of unconventional drama or sci-fi crossing over with the mental landscape (think Memento, Inception, and especially Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). The story isn't a ripoff of anything, mind you, but if it was told in a straightforward manner it probably wouldn't impress you.But the story isn't told in a straightforward manner, and this is where To the Moon really takes off (pardon the pun). This is the kind of material where it's so easy to become pretentious and melodramatic that the game goes into the territory of Art with a capital A just in the way it manages to avoid that. The framing story of two doctors who've done this all before and to who this is just another job (to the point of them making irreverent and occasionally downright crass comments about what's going on) keeps it firmly grounded. When there's a big emotional moment, the game no more than touches on it through the dialogue, never making the mistake of hitting you over the head with how you're supposed to feel. It leaves it all up to you whether you just want to say ""good stuff"" when you're finally at the end, or instead cry for five minutes straight, like I did. (The way I could empathize with one of the protagonists probably helped.)How much do I like this? Let me put it this way: I got this for practically nothing as part of a bundle and left it lying on the shelf for a long time before giving it the old 30 minute tryout. Four hours and one handkerchief later I bought the game at full price on Steam just so I could put up this review. That's $2 per hour of memorable gameplay, and that's a better deal than you'll get from most summer blockbuster AAA titles.			"

 Concise and beautiful. It's a short game, but I would definitely say it's worth the purchase. The soundtrack is superb, it evokes a lot of emotion. I personally find it important to have a good soundtrack let alone a great story. I loved the way they progressed through the story backwards and still successfully made the game play out smoothly. I wouldn't suggest buying this game if you're purchasing games for gameplay or graphics. To the Moon is basically a story but you have to push buttons to read it. When I first began the game, I had a mindset where I believed the story was going to be linear, predictable. But I was wrong! I found myself wanting to know more, because a lot is left out and told to you later. I didn't think the game was ""too short,"" I thought it was perfect. Just like watching a movie.Granting a bed ridden elderly person's wish through altering his memory. Interesting. Throughout the game you will realize that you will be encountering powerful symbolism and significant events that led to the present day John. I cried.  "

												I just finished this game and I'm still stunned. It's been a long time since I sat in front of the screen, watching the epilogue and the credits of a game with tears in the eyes (Thank you, Freebird games!)Going back the life of ""Johnny"", reliving all his beautiful and sad memories really touched my heart and let me reflect my own life. The choices I made, the chances I missed and the experience I gained. There aren't many games out there causing this! 'To the moon' kind of showed me what's important in life. Maybe this sounds strange, but it's the truth.I have only one complaint: I really couldn't the stand the playable characters (Dr. Watts/Dr. Rosalene). In some situations, their script almost ruined nearly every beautiful moment of this game. Their childish behaviour in an overall serious experience was too much for me. But that's just my opinion.In the end, this game is a special gem for me though. While playing I often had the line of a song by 'Paramore' in mind: 'I could follow you to the beginningJust to relive the startAnd maybe then we'll remember to slow downAt all of our favorite parts'(Song: 'All I wanted')Isn't life beautiful and bittersweet?

												While some games are easily memorable for their gameplay, others will stood out by their Story. To the Moon is a game where the story is clearly the winner and it’s the reason why everyone should spend their time playing it. I’ll start by saying that it may not be a game that will please most of the players but consider starting the game with an open heart and the experience will be a remarkable one. The two main characters are doctors who go by the name of Watts and Rosalene and their jobs can be many things, but common isn’t one of them. They can provide an alternative, a different path to the ones whose life is approaching the end. During the story, your role is to help your patient to fulfil his wish: going to the moon. While it may seem an odd thing to wish for, there may be a reason for it, but that, is up to you to find out. You start by going from the most recent memories to the older ones, until you reach the point where you may find key-points in the Johnny’s past. But as you advance in the game you start to create a bond to his memories which can be odd, considering it’s just a job and Johnny is a stranger for you, but remember, if you let yourself immerse into the story you will end playing a much better game this way. There’s not much to be said about the Story itself without spoiling most of it to be honest. The game is very straight to the point, hence its short length but this can be a good thing because there won’t be any unnecessary time spent doing pointless quests or wandering off for long. You have a goal, this is your job and emotions should be left aside, but play this game as intended and emotions will surely make part of this experience. As they should.The music/soundtrack is as much important as the story because during certain events you will be listening to a nice piano tune that will provide warm feelings or a sense of loss, sadness and curiosity. I don’t believe the game to be any sort of depressing, as humor also plays an important role in To the Moon. Small conversations with some jokes and jests will arise from time to time to create a lighter mood since, after all, this is your goal and you shouldn’t let your personal feelings obstruct your intents. While I’m sure many will leave satisfied with the story (weather you end up liking the very end or not) and the music as well, do not come expecting some heavy gameplay mechanics or a rather lengthy game. I believe its short size can be a strong point this time because it takes you right where you need to be so I would advise to not measure your time and money invested with the length of the game but rather in its storytelling. If you are able to past the simple visuals with almost no gameplay mechanics, and if you let yourself engage in the Story while listening to the wonderful soundtrack then To the Moon will be a perfect fit to play in the between of any other lengthier games you are currently playing. It’s a respectable violence-free game, short but sweet experience filled with some humor, remarkable music and probably some tears as well. Play the game as intended, do not haste, do not do anything else while playing it and I’m sure your money will be a good investment. Enjoy the story. PS: As you may have noticed, English is not my first language so I apologize for the lack of a better grammar and steady writing.			"

												I'm writing this game as my first ever review because To the Moon deserves it.What many games fail to recognize today is this: They don't need all the bells and whistles to become something remarkable.What I mean is, I'm able to fully recommend this game to you in 2016 even though everything about this game is outdated. And I can do that because of what this game makes you feel as a player.I'm telling you now, if this game doesn't make you almost (or actually) cry, then you either didn't pay much attention to the story, or you're just not an emotional person in the slightest. This game is a masterpiece. I know modern games love to draw you in with action, constant stimulation, and maybe some emotion or some sort of 'rush' or competition, but the truth is you need to play this game. I'm a person who recognizes different tastes and opinions, but I can honestly say that when I walk into my computer science club, we can all talk about how much we loved this game.In short, buy this game. Do it to spark the feelings inside you, and allow yourself to be taken into a work of art that doesn't need to be fancy or anywhere close to triple A. Because it can make you feel so much more, even without all the 'new'. Passion drove everyone who worked on this game. I can say that because I'm a writer and I've had to discover what that looks like. Music, art, story, even the coding is bursting with passion.Besides, play this game as a refresher to remind you what games are supposed to do: Make you feel something. And you know... What good is every precious year of your life if at the end you can't remember what moved you?			"

												Warning: For now, on Linux and Mac platforms, the features are still unstable, you won't get an achievement, after you finished the game, and a bonus game, which is attached into the game's folder. So try to avoid playing on Linux and play on Windows instead.--------------------------------------------------Have you ever met someone who loves doing a job for dying people, making their wishes come true? Only get supports from those who are going to die and only get accepted from those who are already dead? Most importantly, how hard does it take to get the job done? What will you receive after making other people's wishes come true since they will be already dead after that?This game is all about the story of a dying old man and his one last wish. You will absorb its heart-felt story through your playing. The soundtracks keep your mood on a good pace throughout all the scenes. Great characters you would grow to love. Every character has its own important role that will effect your feeling in a quite good impact.Its story simply, quietly, gently, made me shed tears. After I finished the game, I re-played all soundtracks and still felt so much feel. Give it a try. I'm sure It'd be worth every bit of both your cent and your time.			"

												Thanks to my hunt for achievements at the time and a few friends who recommened it, I ended up trying out the game.I didn't expect to much from a cheap indie game, but I was really pleasantly suprised.Not only was it as good as some of my friends suggested, it was plain awesome. I loved the storyline and the soundtrack and while the game mechanics aren't that great, in the end those didn't really matter compared to the experience of the rest.It was an remarkable story to follow and the soundtrack fitted that great. So even though a lot of the game seems dated, I fully recommend people should give it at least a chance and maybe they will experience the same great feelings I have gotten from it.As an additional note:This is the game I nominated 23-11-2016 for the “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award.

Short Version: 7.8/10Even if you're like me and don't really like Visual Novel, Walking Simulators, or games where you actually have little to do aside from move the story along, I HIGHLY recommend this game. The story is interesting and compelling. The characters are well developed and believable. The soundtrack is great most of the time, and aside from some weird control issues, it's a very great experience. Sadly, this game has been bundled many times, so grab it at a discount or you might feel cheated. 7.8 out of 10.Story: 10Honestly one of the better stories I've played in an indie title lately. To The Moon does something that while not traumatizing like Memento reminds me of it. We discover more and more about the main characters (not just Johnny, but all of them) the further back in time we go. While this isn't exactly a new story telling device, it is masterfully executed. I particularly like the way the author allows you to connect some of the dots, without having to connect all of them for you. Gameplay: 5Eh, there really isn't much to say here, this is probably weakest part of the game. While the momento puzzles at first are a bit entertaining, they soon lose their novelty and it's a matter of getting through them as quickly as possible to advance the story. One other irritating aspect is when you're left to search everything to find what you're looking for to advance the story. Often times these areas are small, but sometimes they aren't. That's when you want to take a sledgehammer to the level. Advice, if you're using the gamepad, hover with the mouse. Another small issue, half the things you couldn't walk over, there seemed to be no logical reason why you couldn't walk over them, when in other areas you could. Soundtrack: 10Personally, I found the soundtrack to be quite appealing. I'm not sure if the music is all original or not, but I absolutely loved it and felt it was appropriate and well composed. Controls: 6Most of the time, everything is fine. However, a few weak moments in the game, and I'm not sure if they are from RPG maker as the engine, or something the developers did. If the mouse is in the wrong spot, when you're trying to solve puzzles, even if it has disappeared, it can screw with your ability to solve the flip puzzles. At one point, the cursor kept moving away from where I was trying to go and I couldn't figure out why. Eventually, I realized it was because the mouse 'cursor' which at the time was invisible because I was using the controller, was near the center of the screen resetting the position of the cursor I was moving, even though I hadn't touched the mouse in five minutes. Second issue, while the gamepad works for nearly everything just fine, toward the end there is a situation that I was struggling to get through, because I was using the gamepad, and keyboard at the same time because I couldn't figure out how to 'shoot' with the gamepad. Major design flaw.Other Notes: N/ALet me first express my surprise. My previous experience with this developer was A Bird Story which I absolutely hated. To The Moon was actually GOOD. Some of the same irritating elements showed up in To The Moon, which leads me to believe they were started here, and then the developer decided they were good ideas and overused them in A Bird Story. But To The Moon while having a few moments of irritation blew away my expectations. I'm truly thankful for my stubborn nature and willingness to try new games, because, I had filed this game away to never be played. Thankfully I dragged it out and was rewarded for that experience.There is one achievement for finishing the game which you can do in a few hours.  "

												No need to tell about the story - you already read about that in the description, so I just want to tell about what it is to be played. It is the most emotional and heart touching game for me.Because of the graphic style it doesn't look like a classic p&c adventure game at first sight, but it really is! Nothing for those that need hard puzzles to enjoy a game though. Some people might prefer to classify it as a kind of interactive story because of the easy puzzeles but that's not the point here. It touches your heart deeply and I read a lot of times about adults commenting that were stirred to tears or cried during the play while the story enfolds more and more (also males!).Several games managed to catch me at some scenes or with the story (sometimes sad and sometimes funny) but I never finished a game crying before this one. Also Laura singing that song is really awesome.This game will leave you with lots of thoughts about life and death, dreams and much more ...  so be prepared.			"

												On occasion in life you come across a moment, or in this case game that you simply feel fortunate enough to witness or again in this case play, and To the Moon is definately one of those games. To the Moon is set in a world where scientists can fullfil and create memories and thus giving John who is the centre charector a chance to complete his final wish to travel  To the Moon . You play as two of these scientists and it becomes clear early on that visiting people's memories to fullfil these wishes is just part of their job,  and that they hold no emotional ettachment with their clients. As the story unfolds you are forced to visit John's unpleasent memories which are tied together with completing this wish, as the two scientists witness these remininescences of the past they begin to connect with John, you slowly begin to see that in this special case they no longer consider it their duty nor their obligation to fullfill this task but too do it out of good will - they begin to care for him. As the story progresses it takes you on an emotional rollercoaster, like the two scientists the theme transferred i started to care for John. This game moved me like few others out there can and I would like to thank the main developers and in addition the main writer of the music  Laura Shigihara.If i was to describe this game in one word it would simply be Beautiful. 10 / 10			"

												And The “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award goes to:To the Moon!The plot is bittersweet. The music is solemn, yet edifying.It's a game about life choices and how the decisions we make in life might not always result in what was originally intended. We all live and learn. We all are filled with some kind of regret. We all strive for more. Hindsight is 20/20.My review is meant to be vague. I refuse to attempt to teach a life lesson or spoil this gem for anyone.			"

But when I decided to play through it completely with my boyfriend sitting there with me, I had my heart shattered, rebuilt, and then shattered again as I witnessed the most beautiful love story within a game. This is a must have, and when it goes on sale during Steam Sales, I would recommend it highly as a 1st purchase.I love this game, and there isn't a day that goes by that I haven't stopped thinking about it. 10/10 would have my heart shattered again			"

												This is one of those games that stick right to your heart. It's a simple point and click game that gives you the experience of a lifetime, literally. The music, needless to say, is a major part of the game and will leave you with all the feels in this world. The game unravels slowly, through various timelines. With each passing memory back in time, you understand a little more about the protagonist and his life through his eyes, and it's too beautiful to be put into words. The game has a gorgeous setting, even without any actual graphics. There's that certain warmth about the story (and the game in general), that leaves you overwhelmed. I've seen a few people complaining about how ""amateurish"" the dialogue writing is. Well, I see that as more of a strength than a weakness. That's where the heart of the game lies, and it's that of a child. For someone who cherishes ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" as one of the greatest films ever to be made, this game radiates some strong reminiscenses of the film. All in all, this game is nothing short of a masterpiece and has every reason to be in your library right now.			"

												""To The Moon"" is a sci-fi JRPG story game which has you follow two Doctors throughout an incredible night.I don't want to summarise too much, because the game is so great. It took me 4.1 hours to complete (which is standard for everybody really). The gameplay is similar to an old Link or Pokemon game, top down sort of thing, really excellent stuff.I installed it, played a little, and then completed the entire game in one sitting, being unable to turn it off with how engaging and interesting the game was. Keep in mind though this is more ""story"" than it is ""game"", but man, what a story. Absolutely awesome, cannot wait from more from Freebird Games. If this is anything to go by, the next production will be amazing.I hugely recommend this game to all.Nilesy			"

												NOTE: AS I'M NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THIS REVIEW, IT WILL BE COMPLETELY REWRITTEN IN THE (NEAR) FUTURE---Get the tissues ready, just in case ...To The Moon (mini) ReviewI swear to god, there's this one song on the album that makes me cry (or teary-eyed) EVERY TIME I listen to it. After a few marvelous tear drops tonight I reminded myself that I still needed to write a review for this game, even though I completed it months ago. But hey, better late than never!My goodness, where do I even start?! I'd like to say so many things about this game, but at the same time I could sum it up in one sentence: It's an amazing game that everyone needs to play, period! Even if you're not a fan of RPG-maker games, this game is well worth the try. The story alone makes this an incredible experience for sure. So let's just get this over with:About""This particular story follows Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts’ attempt to fulfill the dream of the dying elderly man, Johnny. In their mission to do so, they traverse backwards through the man’s memories, unfolding his curious life story before their eyes. With each step back in time, a new fragment of Johnny’s past is revealed. And as the two doctors piece together the puzzled events that spanned a life time, they seek to find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish to be what it is.""What's good+ Cute style + Atmospheric+ Beautiful soundtrack+ Amazing story+ Sweet price tag+ 2 Free (extra) chapters+ (perfect length to play through in one sitting, as to not lose the immersion)What's bad- Not a whole lot of gameplay, but the story makes up for itRecommended to: Everyone. I could go on forever about how amazing the game is, but you'll just have to experience it yourself. Lastly, again, don't neglect this game for its RPG-maker style graphics. It actually sat in my library for months at first, solely because I didn't like how it looked. Oh, how stupid I was. With that being said now, just get to it!			"

												To the Moon is a story-heavy, well executed lovestory by FreeBirdGames. It's about two doctors that travel to fulfill a dying mans last wish. The story is told in a very different way. You controll these two doctors through a bunch of memories. The memories are about Johnny life and his love for River. It's about how he lived his life and what happend during it. Time- travelling, puzzle solving game with much dialogue. The music in this game, mostly piano music, is freaking amazing. It's right on time, very fitting. The conversation between the doctors is really fun. It's good, because the rest of the story is very sad and emotional. The doctors argue about anything really, from olives to driving skills. It made me smile several times. If I had to say something bad about the game? The controls. Sometimes you click and the characters dont really move as you want them to. It can be a bit awkward, but its not that much of a problem since it's mostly just dialogue and not that much moving around. The puzzles are simple, yet fun. To be honest I really like when they're simple because I think hard puzzles are just off-putting and frustrating in a story-heavy game like this. If you happend to like pixelgames or just want a game focused more on story then gameplay, then this is the game for you.			"

												To start off: HOLY MOLY GUACAMOLE, IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THIS GAME AND LIKE STORY EXCLUSIVE GAMES, PLAY IT, NOW! Stop reading and play it!OK, with that out of the way, we can finally get to business.The game To the Moon is a story driven game where the player takes control of two scientists who are sent to an old mans' home to work in his memories to send him to the moon. It has many moments to make you smile, and many moments to make you cry, as well as some to bring about both reactions at one time.The gameplay is relatively nonexistent, however, it fits the game and how it was intended to be played. It consists of walking around a memory finding key memory orbs, as well as a memory link (if you're struggling, try the platypus.) Once you unlock the link, you solve a tile puzzle, then repeat the process. (If you're still struggling, move your cursor slowly over people or walk somewhere you didnt think you had to go.) There was one area where the gameplay got a bit different, which some may like, while it just broke my immersion.The simple mechanics made this game easy to play, but also easy to get bored while playing for some.The graphics were beautiful. They flowed smoothly for a pixelated game, and everything blended together well. Some may say that ""You need to be able to see what to interact with and what not to!"" But that simply isn't the case in this game. The fun is in the hunt for what you need. Of course, some things you will find will be a given whenever present, but for the beginning and a few things in each memory, the graphics play beautifully into it.Last and certainly not least, the soundtrack. Pardon me as I fanboy. AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I think, nope, not done. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! OK definitely done now. In short terms, buy it, I did, and I have no regrets. In long terms, this games soundtrack is gorgeous. It makes use of the piano as the base for all songs, adding strings in some, not much else for others. It captures the mood of the story so well, and almost carries meaning in and of itself. My favorite is every single one. It reuses songs a lot, but they are so beautiful I still listen to them in my day to day life. If you buy this game for NOTHING else, buy it for the music. It is superb.While this game may seem boring, it can get emotionally attaching, especially for those in a relationship or very close with another person. I repeatedly kept looking at my own life and thinking, ""Yeah, that sounds familiar!"" While other times I looked at my own life going ""OH NO, WHY IS THIS SO FAMILIAR!"" And proceeded to cry for the next couple minutes, trying to play the game still. This is definitely a game to make you feel happy, sad, and even maybe a bit mad, but not a game for mindless joy. WARNING, THIS PART IS EXPLICITLY HOW I PLAYED AND CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I played this game completely open to myself, my life, and people around me. I tried to find parallels, or think to the future in order to connect to what was happening. I am certainly no old man, so it helped to think about how it would be to be taking my final breaths. I could do this safely, I have what I would classify as a strong mind. However, I know some people very close to me that tried that and got highly anxious, some even breaking down completely. If this may be you, please, do not feel pressured to play this way, and don't try to. Besides that, try to play the game by putting yourself inthese situations. Try to put yourself in the shoes of an old man wanting to go to the moon, try to put yourself in the feet of a young man marrying a woman with a mental disorder.Finally, be prepared to cry. This story is so tragic, it isnt even the love story. In one scene, the big twist, a mother accidentally hits her son with her car, killing him. It turns out to not be the old man (obviously), but instead his twin brother. After that, it's revealed he was given beta blockers, a drug to essentially delete traumatic memories. His mother is actually so distraught, she starts acting like the living twin is the dead twin, calling him the dead ones name, Joey, and almost forcing him to live the life his twin brother wanted to live.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anyway, this game is so touching and amazing, with some funny moments, sad moments, and joyful moments.I rate it 9.7/10 PLATYPUSES "

												To The Moon is one of the most touching and sad games in my life, no doubt.This game is a life-long story, a story that will be remembered for a long time and story that is able to touch your heart.Music in this game always fits the situation and sets you in the right mood. Piano tracks are amazing and my favorite one is ""Everything's Alright"" along with ""For River"".The story itself is great. Story of a man who is going to die very soon and he wishes to fly to the Moon, and how it ends... ending made me happy and sad at the same time.Thanks to the developer for this small and beautiful miracle.Thank you, Kan Gao.:'(			"

												9/10To enjoy this game, you must meet two criteria:First, you must focus on the story.Second, you must have a soul.Then, you will find this short tale captivating, emotional, and stunning.Like I said, the story is the focus. The gameplay revolves around exploring until you find enough secrets to unlock the next level. This can get repetitive, but is really the only downside.A huge upside is the soundtrack. It's beautifully done piano that adds to the emotion and nostalgia that ties in the present with your exploration of the past.This game is short and cheap, so you don't have much to lose. But if you play it, I think you will find you won't lose anything.			"

												""A story-driven experience about two doctors traversing backwards through a dying man's memories, in order to artificially fulfill his last wish.""♥ I have finished this game ♥ This is a beautiful and well thought out game. It's no easy feat to create a story that progresses backwards in time so that you can fully appreciate the present. The game is short, which may be a perk for some and not others. I feel the length of this game was perfect. There are many references in this game, and it's fun to find them! The sound track is beautiful and really helps influence your emotions. This game is emotion and story driven. As for gameplay mechanics, you basically walk around (using your mouse), collecting memories so that you can progress to the next period in time. You watch this dying man's life unfold from the present until he was a young child. This is a heavy dialog game, and you have to click to go through the dialog. So walking, collecting, and dialog. Each time you progress to the next point in time, you have to solve a little puzzle. The puzzles aren't that difficult, and I found it kind of fun. You grow to really care about the characters. You sympathise with them. If you do not shed even one little tear at the end, you might want to have yourself tested. You may in fact not be human.			"

												10/10 - as a must have, for me, personally.  YMMV.What to say, that hasn't already been said? This is a game, that is more of an experience, with game elements. The entire game made me think back, over as many of the 50 years of my life as I could remember. Thinking about what I could have, should have, wanted to do do differently. Wonderingg what my life would be like if I had done things differently, and if it would have even mattered. Wondering if I would be the same person that I am now, if I had done things differently. And wondering if I changed the course of my life. would I have beomce a better person. or a worse one.If you are looking just for quick, easy achievements, and Trading cards, looking for pew pew pew combat, looking for difficult puzzles... this isn;t the game for you. Sire, you can idle for TC's. The single ahievement for a ""perfect"" game will come. But, to really get the most out of this game, you need (IMHP) to go into it with a willingness, and perhaps an ability, to look at things from a very different perspective, be open to feelinmg joy, pain, happpiness, sadness, understanding, confusion, success, frustation... one after the other, seperately, and all at once. It is an experience. With game elements. If you aren;t open to the experience, you probably won;t enjoy this game at all. I enjoyed it, and I cried. At the same time.If you do nothing else, play the Minisode 2. And don't Alt>Tab out before you see and read the entire message at the end. I am still sitting here, and likely will be for some time, wondering how he is, if he made it through or not, and how many lives he touched, without knowing he did so. As a survivor myself, I hope he made it. And if not, I hope he made it to the Moon.			"

												I'll be frank: When I first started playing this, I thought it was just some soulless 2D game, quickly slapped together, throwing text in where it pleased and passing itself off as art. Shallow. Boring. Pretentious. But I wasn't very far in. I knew it wasn't fair to judge a game without giving it a proper chance.So I kept playing, in the beginning forcing myself, assuming it was just another overrated artsy game with no real meat to it. Well I was wrong; without noticing, I began to feel myself compelled to keep going, the feeling growing stronger the longer I played. Soon enough, I almost literally had to see the next part. I actually played it all in sitting, unable to pull myself away despite it having kept me up past 5 in the morning at that point.It drove me on relentlessly, leaving me constantly wanting to know what was next, and why such-and-such a thing happened... why characters were who they were. I kept thinking I came to a conclusion, when once again it would twist my thoughts. I came to the brink of tears repeatedly towards the latter part of the game. I winced when I saw something bad happen. I smiled for the characters when they were happy. It ripped my heart out to see them suffer. And then I realized – I’m feeling so strongly for a bunch of pixelated sprites, not even realistic looking things… this game is THAT powerful.I told myself again and again, “Don’t cry. Don’t cry. It’s just a game.” But when the ending came, there was nothing I could do. The waterworks were coming whether I liked it or not.That’s not to say the game is depressing. Far from it: It’s sad, it’s happy, it sprinkles in humor when it knows it needs to… and it ends in such a way that your tears most certainly won’t be of sadness. It pulls at your heart and mind simultaneously; it makes your emotions come out full force and provokes your thoughts with the many questions, both story and real life related, it poses to the player.Quite simply, it was -the- most moving, beautiful game I’ve ever played, and I recommend it to absolutely everyone.Buy it, play it, and don’t stop until the end.

												One of those ""games"" with terrible gameplay but awesome storyline. The basic gist of it is that you work for a company that help dying people fulfill their wishes. In the case of the main patient in the storyline, this wish is to go to the moon. Saying any more than that would be spoiling the storyline, which is by far the main reason why you'd want to play this game in the first place. The gameplay itself is quite mundane. It looks and plays somewhat like a 16-bit era RPG, but without combat. It's rare that you'll find yourself lost for any significant amount of time. The game is also very (written) dialogue-heavy, so if you're not a fan of reading, this probably isn't the game for you. The soundtrack is quite superb.The game will generally take you around 3-4 hours to complete. Given the nature of the game, I would recommend completing the game in one sitting.Overall, I personally loved this game, although I have to admit that it's not for everyone. I personally bought this for $2.50 AUD, and I thought it was worth every penny. With that said, the game has practically zero replay value and is relatively short. I would overall recommend people try the game out if they're willing to sit down and appreciate a good, touching storyline.			"

I could compare this game to similar movies or other games, but not without spoiling what makes this game so special. The main theme song fits so perfectly within this game, it's just so dreamy.

It's a very emotional game with a fantastic narrative, exceptional music and a very touching and sentimental at the same time history. Regarding the gameplay is quite simple. It reminds me of the games of the year’s 90. Establishes such a deep connection between the game and the player who will make you feel many sensations and emotions, and perhaps even eyes moisten. At the same time it has some touches of humor. Well, I will not give more details, simply if you want to experience a different feeling and above all very human need to play. Pure love story.

												Have you ever picked up a book and do not fully understand the story until you have read from cover to cover? Entranced by the story and pieces soon to be discovered, you had mindlessly flipped through the pages until you arrived at the very last word followed by the final ""."". You skim through the pages, frenetically looking for more content. You think to yourself, surely there must be more pages, something more that I can grasp, something to keep me in this wonderful story. But you sigh as you realize the magic is over and the author intended on ending the story on that final page. Soon after, you begin to make connections you never made before, piecing together the story like a jig-saw puzzle one would complete and stow away for a lifetime of memories. Enter To the Moon.To the Moon takes you on a backwards adventure through time. During this process, To the Moon has the unique ability to triple as a mystery, puzzle, RPG, story-driven experience. This 5-hour journey into the conscious mind of John(ny) Wyles, an old and venerable man and widower, manages to engage people with a series of moving discoveries. While absorbed in To the Moon, you will experience every emotion possible. It's unavoidable. You will somehow manage to have tears in your eyes within the first hour of the anecdote and be laughing a minute later, as I did. From sadness and confusion, to awe and excitement, to anger and disbelief, and finally happiness, To the Moon leaves you with a feeling of warmth and a unique remembrance of the narrative of John(ny) Wyles. The man who wanted to venture to the moon, but could not remember why.Final RatingsGameplay: 8.5/10 - Being made from an RPG maker, there are some points where I was unsure how to advance in the story and had to do a bit of ""random clicking"".Storyline: 10/10 - One of the best story-driven games I have played. Second to Thomas Was Alone (see review)Soundtrack: 10/10+ - Creates the prefect ambience for every situation found within the story.Combat: N/AScary? Nope.Pop-Ups: None.Graphics: 5/10 - Do not let the graphics dissuade you from purchasing To the Moon. This is a game to experience because of the story within.100% Achievements: Easy. Complete the game and you earn the one achievement in the game.Singleplayer: 10/10Replayability: High replayability, but definitely not necessary to remember this beautiful story.Multiplayer: N/A			"

												It's one of those games you inevitably hear about, want to try, and then start playing it and realize that it's not that great technically, that characters need a lot of time to exit a car and get to the house, that you'll have to stop for a dialogue every now and then... Not something you can just play anytime, you have to leave it for the right moment. Luckily, I had a new reason to get back to it, and last night decided to download it again and give it a second chance. I could write about the game, I could write about me playing it and feeling this or that, but I think it should be enough to say that, after a short time, I realized it's past 5 am and I had to be at work soon. Yes, the game is slow to grab you, but once it does... omg! After just a few 'jumps' you get this horrible feeling of something being really wrong, and the need to find out what it is surpases the simple wish to play the game and finish it. It is what holds you glued to the screen to the very end, what forces you to learn how to solve those short puzzles faster so the story can continue as soon as possible, what will keep you playing even during the otherwise stupid horse riding scene, which is totally wrong for a game like this in a technical sense and could have destroyed it completely by forcing people to quit... if not for the gripping storytelling that simply does not let you move away. It's a game that I will think about a lot, and that, more than anything else, makes it a work of art. It's a well written animated book, with characters full of life, well motivated and engaging. It's something that will stop the world for you, and make you sad knowing that not everyone will have the will to give it a chance. But they should. And you should, even if it does has some annoying features. What game does not have them?			"

												Wow.... I literally just finished this game and I'm at a loss for words.  But I really feel that I can't let this one go without saying something about it....I guess first things first.... the story is absolutely beautiful!  A perfect love story through and through.  Even with its simplistic pixel art style, it did everything right to tug at the heartstrings something fierce.  Accompanied by the wonderful music score, the story really just comes to life.  A total masterpiece!To be honest, I'm now sort of feeling a bit ashamed because I don't even know how this masterpiece came to be in my library.  I was prepared to just let it idle for the cards, but then I gave it a chance on advice from others and actually started to play it.  And now I'm extremely glad I did!This piece of art is definitely worth playing.  If you're contemplating buying it, I think you'd find it worth it even at full price.11/10 for sure!			"

												A must played game for every fan of story driven games. Gameplay is very basic. Most of the time you will read dialogs and watch the characters move around. From time to time you will be able to control them. In most of the scenes you have to find multiple objects to move on to the next scene. But they are very simple so that you can concentrate on the story.I really enjoyed it. Give it a try if you can spare 5-7 hours			"

												PREPARE..FOR..TROUBLE!-AND MAKE IT DOUBLE!(Sorry I had to they remind me so much of them)ANYWAY!I completed the game in roughly 6 hours. But those hours were fantastic! It opens like your typical RPG. Overhead 2D gameplay. Your main objective is to really just follow along the story...and there are a few panel based puzzles. but not too many. This is a game that's absolutely impossible to put down once you get into it just a little bit, as the music is outstanding...and the story is very well made!! Unfortunately, The only big surprise I got out of this game was the suprise that I wasn't going to be surprised...in otherwords...with how amazing the game has let me on...I expected the wrong ending. Either way. It was great. and worth a great deal of money, and then some. It makes me wish I had a machine to re-visit my memories...oh golly.			"

												To the Moon starts off slow, but as soon as the story unravels itself piece by piece, you slowly get pulled in into this emotional roller coaster where you'll feel all kinds of emotions. The soundtrack is nothing short of a masterpiece and is a major contributor to the game's heartfelt moments. It is a game where I was hesitant of playing, but as soon as I finished I realised what I've been missing out on. Sure it has its shortcomings, but in the end To the Moon is a must have and definitely a worthwhile experience where you'll learn that life is as beautiful as you make it out to be. Be grateful for what you have today and cherish every moment like there's no tomorrow. < 8.5 / 10 >			"

												I knew To the Moon received a lot of praise, I had it in my library for a long time but never tried it. I finally decided to see what is was about. It started slowly, it didn't catch my interest right away. But I kept playing past the first hour and could not put it away until it was over. I played the whole game in one sitting (4.5 hours), it was truly amazing.The graphics are not what make this game great, the gameplay is minimalist, very linear as you cannot decide how the story will change, you just walk around and do whatever is required to keep the story unfolding in front of you. But the story is amazing, touching, sad and beautiful, sometimes funny, simply brilliant. It would make an awesome movie, I hope they do it someday. It would without any doubt become the best movie based on a video game ever made.If you have a heart, you must play this game.			"

												An all-round great game, I would say.I heard that this game was emotional and tragic, but had a great story. So I kind of went into this expecting to be incredibly depressed by the end. Fortunately it’s not all that bad. It has a very emotional story to it but all in all it’s a wonderfully imaginative game with a satisfying ending.Character wise, there is a nice contrast between what I guess you would call two sets of main characters. You have the couple who are followed throughout the game, and the work colleagues, that are doing the following. I say ‘contrast’ because they are pretty much opposites of each other. The couple are in love and are going through their struggles together in a very emotional way, whilst the two work colleagues are that typical brother/sister relationship. Messing around, insulting each other and generally just being a very comedic pair.The music in this game is absolutely amazing. It is integrated into the game wonderfully and it really does get those emotions going at the right times. Now, as a girl I cried a fair few times. My brother rolling his eyes as if to say ‘typical woman’ after asking if I had finished it, me swinging round with that ‘I wasn’t crying, I had something in my eye’ look. But even with that taken into account, I still think this is something that guys can enjoy as well. Maybe they won’t ‘cry’ like I did, but it still tugs on those heart strings.Story wise, I have to admit it’s not anything like I imagined it would be. I knew there was going to be a couple, a struggle and a few heartbreaking moments, but I never thought the story would be set how it is. It’s really a very surreal kind of game that I guess can be compared partially to Inception. These work colleagues are hired to do a job inside the head of their client. Which opens up a lot of possibilities for the story. It isn’t as predictable as you might think and it brings a lot of neat game mechanics with it.Finally, the graphics. I love this style of graphics and whenever I’m recommended a game with this kind of style it is always going to be something I will try. I don’t even know what you call it but I just refer to it as the Pokémon-game-ish-style. It makes the game even more unique then it already is, and strangely enough, at one point while I was playing it, I actually got the feeling that if the graphics were any different it wouldn’t be as easy to get so attached to the characters and generally get into the game. The simplistic graphics actually make it what it is, in my own opinion. All in all, it’s a wonderful game and I think it is definitely worth a try for those who like a good story. TL;DR : Great characters, beautiful music, good story and pleasing graphics. Emotional but well worth the time put into it. Buy it! "

To The Moon is probably the most difficult game I’ve had to recommend so far: mainly because I have mixed opinions on various aspects of the game. For the most part, I enjoyed the it, and can agree with what a majority of steam users have to say about this splendid game. But while I found it enjoyable, it's not without its problems.The main premise of To The Moon is that two doctors-Eva and Neil (which you'll be playing as)-work for a company that ""reconstructs"" dying people's memories so that they can pretty much live their life again without any regrets. The patient in question that Eva and Neil must help is a man named Johnny, a dying old man who dreams of going to the moon. Without trying to spoil much, Eva and Neil will travel throughout Johnny's memories so that they can alter his life so that he eventually becomes an astronaut that reaches the moon (It’s a cool and simple premise that is easy to understand, and becomes even more interesting when you look at it through a symbolic point of view). They’ll also learn about his relationship with a girl named River and exactly why Johnny wants to go to the moon. The gameplay consists of you wondering around Johnny's memories looking for important moments/objects in his life so that you can go back further into Johnny's past (ex:  a toy that he's treasured all his life, or a life changing event). There really is no action in the game (the screenshot[cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com] on the store page depicting a turn based battle is incredibly misleading, since it's only used on one part as a joke), although this is not a bad thing. Looking for the hidden mementos (and solving the puzzles at the end of each section) is actually kind of fun, and in narrative games like this, sometimes it’s best if there is less action. So if you’re the type of person that only plays games that involve action/fighting, stop reading this review right now. I'd also like to add that the graphics are nice (though keep in mind that the game was made on an RPG Maker engine) and so is the soundtrack (although it can be quite annoying to hear the same songs repeated, although this is a minor problem).So why exactly did I not find it fully enjoyable? I think the answer would be with the two main characters: Eva and Neil.Throughout To The Moon, there are many moments where the game will just make you want to tear up, whether it be tears of sadness or joy. With that being said, having one of the protagonists [Neil] say things such as “HADOUKEN!” and “You never cockblock someone in the middle of a kamehameha!” (yes, that is an actual quote from the game) shortly after these emotional scenes completely ruins the mood. A majority of the dialogue between the two is usually Neil making a lame joke, and then Eva responding sarcastically (or just “…”). I’m probably the only person that thinks this, but I feel that most of the time these jokes ruin the flow of the game, shifting it from a sad love story to a lame comedy. Even a majority the jokes that don’t coincide with dramatic moments come out as a bit lame: mainly because they are usually modern day reference jokes (though this is not to say they can be funny every now and then-the scene where they travel to important parts of Johnny’s life just to convince him to be an astronaut made me chuckle a bit). Aside from their sense of humor, some elements regarding what Eva and Neil do seem a bit odd. Why are Neil and Eva so hostile towards Johnny, the person they’re supposed to be helping? If they’re always this hostile to their patients and don’t feel like going through all of this, why are they working for a company that’s main goal is to help dying people? *SPOILER* Why do Eva and Neil have to run back quickly to witness the death of Johnny’s brother, even though they can reset the simulation and watch it over again (which Eva does later in the game)? These are just a few of my questions regarding the game.You’re probably thinking that I hate this game after reading the previous paragraph. Well I don’t. The rest of the game still manages to deliver a sweet, sad story about a man wanting to become an astronaut and be with the girl that he loves. Even after a while, Eva and Neil-who I spent an entire paragraph bashing-start to grow on you. It all culminates to one of the most heart-touching endings (and games) that I’ve seen in a while.Pick it up when you have the chance: you [most likely] won’t regret it.			"

												About the game itselfPros- One of the best story telling game I've ever play- Pretty good graphic- Beautiful musicsNote : You may need some tissues while you're playing this gameCons- Not much things to do ( Move to where the game tell you to go there, some easy puzzles )- Reading the converstion the whole game ( Pass this game if you don't like reading )- Short story ( You can finish it within 2-4 hrs depending on your reading skill xD )10/10 For me, since I don't mind reading, I love the musics ( it force me to buy the soundtracks after I've finish the game ) My personal opinions / experiences- Got this game for half a year and never try it, until one of my friend told me that I must try it. Not sure where I got this game, but it was a part of MOST bundle games in my library, which mean I got this game in real cheap price, but it was an only bundle games I've ever play and feel like "" Can't believe a bundle game was so good, it's almost made me cry ~"". It's just more awesome than bundle games. . .- I'm not usually write a reviews for games, This was my second reviews of all. but I just can't stop thinking why don't just put reviews on this games it tooo awesome ~- As I meantions above, If you willing to get the game, believe me, just get it with the soundtracks, because you're going to get it after you've finish it anyway.

												The gameplay is dull, linear and you won't ever have to make any decision tougher than in which order you want to click specific items. There is (or was) no controller support, the game has a few bugs, it's not always clearly visible where you can walk and where there's an invisible blockwall, and i dont know if there was even an option to change the resolution.The interesting thing about that is though, that it doesnt matter one bit. Play the game. Don't read any more about it, avoid any information about it as well as possible, and for goudas sake, do yourself the favor and dont watch a let's play. You would regret it forever.This game is about its story and the feelings it conveys, made possible as well by the charming artstyle and the perfect soundtrack, which now is finally available as FLAC, which is actually the reason I'm writing a review now, the soundtrack alone is worth way more than anyone ever paid for it.And one has to experience it by oneself, it would be a terrible waste to know that much about it, that there's nothing to experience anymore. Or to say it like this: If i had the chance to forget all of it, so i can replay and experience it all over again, i'd do it.Of course, it won't be everyones kind of game, I know some Idio-... people who think: ""If i want to read a story, i can read a book, i don't have to play a game for that"", but at least to me, games are way more personal. Even if you don't really have many choices, you still get more involved, by moving around in the world which the game is presenting to you, and experiencing it at your own pace, in your own way.In my admittedly kinda dull NEET-life, where every day is basically like the last, the next, or any other for that matter, I always forget what i did at some point, as there is just nothing special about it. But i can remember one of those days clearly. I remember sitting in my room (well, as always), tucked in a blanket, drinking rooibos tea. It was evening outside, later even night, and it was snowing with the snow lying around 6-8centimeters high. I still had some peels lying next to my screen, from the clementines i ate earlier that day, and they and the rooibos distributed a comfortable fragrance throughout the room.And i remember all this for one reason only. It was the day that i played To the Moon.			"

Product received for free
												I was late to a party. However It's all thanks to one of my friend who recommended and gave this story driven masterpiece to me.To the Moon is a short role-playing adventure video game developed by Freebird Games. The game focuses nothing more than driving you into story with high speed train. With little gameplay no more than interaction and solving small puzzle. A story is about two doctor. Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts who have a machine that can grant anyone wish by diving into patient's memories then reconstructing them into what patients want and what needed to fulfill their wish. A machine is capable of uncovering any patient's memory at any life time, even the ones that patients don't remember.To the Moon, this is one of Johnny's wish, and his wish sounds exactly like that, he wants to go to the moon. The entire story will be involved around fulfill said wish but things seems to not be as easy as it sounds, as the two doctors uncover more and more secrets regarding Johnny himself during his whole life time and the whole things about go to the moon itself.This is really a game for expressing story and story alone. In order to express story effectively of course, is to use suitable musics. This game have the best set of musics that can narrow every single inches of story they want to present, it's emotion, it's happy and it's sad, they have everything. An astounding of depth in both story and music synced, they enough to touch anyone heart, they simply show how memories could be such things that influence the life of one person and what caused him or her to behave that way.For a small price like this game, it surprisingly gives me more than I could ask for. I didn't expect this small game to teach me something about life and drive me cry like this. I recommend anyone who want some short story worth of 4 hours that put you in a train and then simply hook your feelings to a heart of this whole story right away.Another note; Right after you've finished to the moon story, you should also play both DLC mini story. They explain more about two main characters, Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts. Even it's just last 1 hour each it packs with some interesting facts for these two and probably rise more questions. You shouldn't miss it if you have a chance. Those DLCs are free so make sure you play them as well.			"

												To the Moon is a game that wants to be played; no.  It DEMANDS to be played.I'll be the first to say that the 16-bit gameplay isn't earth-shattering.  I'll also say that the minigame that is a part of the forward gameplay isn't particularly masterminded...just being a sliding puzzle.  Yet here I am still writing a review on To the Moon because it has still left a footprint on me.  What does set this game apart however  is the impeccable writing and story.  There are moments you find yourself smiling at the humor, and there are moments you find yourself saddened with the emotional connections you are making with the characters.  I finally broke down to purchase this game during the Autumn Steam Sale because of all the rave things I had heard on reddit.com from users about this game.The game will take only about 4 HRs of your time, and most certainly will leave you yearning for more storytelling like this.  This musical composition is near genius with original pieces, and the fact that they were able to make such a moving game on this kind of medium says more than anything my review ever could.  THIS is why we support Indie games.  I can still tangibly feel the heart and soul that were placed with love into this game.			"

												I played this game long ago and I keep forgetting to review it. It is a good game, but a little bit overrated, don't expect something big out of it, first of all it is not an RPG game as how it looks like, it is more like an adventure visual novel with a little bit of interaction. You can control your characters and move them, but there is no fight or random monsters popping up to you ever two minutes, the game is a story telling, a beautiful story although I wished for a different ending. I liked the two main characters, I actually liked all the characters and suspected many things as the story going, but something different happened by the end of the game.Pro:+Amazing music, one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard while playing a game, it fit every scene and blend well.+Interesting story.+Mystery.+Easy achievements, only one and you will get it once you finish the game.+Steam achievements.Cons:-Limited interaction in the game.-Ending kind of.. unsatisfying but not bad. You will still like your experience of the game.I recommend this game to everyone, the experience alone is nice and you'll enjoy the music, plus there is a second part of the game 'Finding Paradise' which will be out in summer of 2017!

*Non Spoiler Review*Even though at the very beginning I was put off by the old styled, low-resolution graphics and without any previous knowledge about this game, it very quickly grew on me soon after I started it. The dialogues, sadly all just in written form, are both funny and extremely touching.And... I... have... never... before... cried... this... much... in my life, because of a video game!!! Seriously, how can such a ""simple"" point & click puzzle adventure move me to tears? Answer: The story! The characters! Even though they're just plain pixels, you feel a deep connection to these characters, from the two buddy scientists to the tragic couple with a very complex backstory which unfolds chapter after chapter, memory after memory. Gameplaywise you won't be overwhelmed, though sometimes still a bit challenged, especially when you can't find all the necessary clues at first or have to figure out the minigames. But with some time you'll get the groove of it. Also there's always some good humour interjected into the experience. Nevertheless, when you finally have reached the ending, and you've both laughed and used enough tissues to wipe away your tears (stop being so dirty minded, people!), there's just one thing to say: WOW! A big bravo to the people who wrote this story and developed the characters. This would actually make an excellent mini series (for a feature film it might be a bit too long)!			"

												Personally I liked this game , but to be honest not for everyone. Read an equal mixture of positive/negative reviews and decide. PROS~The story*~Characters (although most info on the protagonists will be found in the minisodes)~The art (*) The story is good , but not great. Fans of the game may say it is ""GENIUS"" but in my opinion there was no genius plot element or twist, it was a a good and nice story and that`s all.CONS~The controls*~The humor**(*) The characters` movements feel ""slidey"" . I think the maps are made on a grid pattern so if you use a keyboard you might stop pressing the key but the character will keep moving to the end block , it creates a ""slidey"" feeling and puts me kinda off. You can of couse you can use a mouse so it`s up to you , I prefer keyboard and the keyboard didn`t feel right.(**) The humor feels forced and cringey. Dr.Watts for example constantly makes jokes and puns, I think they are intentionally written bad and cringey but I think it was unnecessary. I personally suggest you try it, you will probably like it.7/10			"

												Absolutely incredible game. Every aspect of it comes together with perfection. A heartfelt story, beautiful, yet simple graphics, and one of the best game soundtracks I have ever heard. This game tells a story in a beautiful way, and keeps you glued to the screen throughout. Mixing sentiment and humor well. The game is about 3-4 hours long , but worth every penny. I got this game as a gift and feel like it is just one of those games you need to share with someone you care about, and I will. Buy the soundtrack too. It fits the game like a glove, but as a standalone playlist of music it can be enjoyed anywhere. Not to mention that they donate 50% of the soundtrack price you pay to charity. Even if you are not a point and click adventure fan you may find that this game will make you one. It might be my favorite adventure game I have played to date. Highly recommend this game.			"

												To the Moon is so far, my favourite game experience. Why ? you might ask. Answer is simple: STORY. This game is superbly written, it beats most movies that i saw recently , also every single game i played recently . It has charming humour, sad/dramatic moments and what is important, these two aspects have great correlation. Also game is well paced, what cause I went through it in one session (that is not ussual for me). AND! Silly me i forgot the second greatest thing about this game. MUSIC. Music component is very importatnt for me in every single thing, and music here is AMAZING! I will listen to from now till eternity. To the Moon was emotional rollercoaster and in future i will gladly take one more ride.Grade: A+ "

												For River.....To sum it all up, this game is balls deep in the feels T_T What stands out the most is the amazing storyline and music that will tug your heartstrings. To give you an idea of the story, it's ""Inception"" with a mix of ""Bioshock"" and lots of cheese..... you'll get the idea when you play it. Manly tears were shed at some points in the game and the soundtrack isn't helping. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a beautiful, heart-warming experience.			"

												Games don't really make me cry. Except for this one. It's like the movies Inception, Memento, and The Notebook all had a threesome and made a baby together. And that baby was an eight bit puzzle video game called To The Moon.Worth every penny. This game hits you in the feels.			"

												For some reason a lot of games with crap graphics have really good stories. This one is no exception. For $2.49 I practically feel like I'm stealing this game. There are a lot things I've wasted 2 and a half bucks on, but this is money VERY well spent. Not sure If I'm going to nominate this game or Undertale for the Sad game Steam award!10/10 Amazing story and character development. Truly, To the Moon is more of a interactive story-telling experience than it is a video game. And it's a story you're gonna love.			"

												I just finished ""To the Moon"". Though I doubt I'm the expected or intended audience (57-year old male) I DID enjoy the game, but as to loving it? Not so sure.The writing wasn't realistic, being more on the level of teenage dialog. That, combined with some very mature themes (meaning concepts, not parentally objectionable items) created an odd blending. The mixing in of mini-games further contributed to a sense of (almost) absurdity, especially the (in my opinion) completely unnecessary zombie game. At about the halfway point I found myself intending to finish, but wishing it wouldn't take too much longer. Then things changed. Around the middle of Act 2 the story became deeper, more real, more emotional. I did NOT cry, but I will admit to tearing up at the absolute purity of the young love that EVEN old men dream of. And the music was VERY nice.My opinion isn't important, other than to me. Yes, I AM glad I played this game. Perhaps due to the nature of it, it needed the filling-out that I found slightly tedious and unnecessary, without which the game would have been still shorter. While I might not recommend this to other 57-year old men, I would CERTAINLY suggest it for almost anyone else. (I would have been nice to get the achievement, but apparently that doesn't happen on a Mac. The brief gametime is result of offline play.)			"

												I try to review games as I finish them, so I can look back on them later. Weeks, months, years down the road - they help me remember the way a game made me feel, or even the person I was when I was at that particular time.To the Moon, for some reason, I never reviewed.Was it because upon completion, I was crying? Reflecting? Contemplating the meaning of life? Experiencing the dreaded feels?Yeah, probably.In To The Moon you take control of two doctors/scientists who have been hired by a dying man to grant his last wish - to go the moon. Though it is an odd request, the doctors do not question it. But to get him there, they must piece together his blurred memories, of loss, of love, of his complicated relationship with the love of his life.It feels almost intrusive to walk through a stranger's most delicate memories, and they invite you to examine your own relationships with the ones you love, flawed and complex as they may be.Play when you're contemplative, you won't regret it.

												I just.. I sat down and did this game start to end and simply couldn't put it down. It's incredibly powerful and sad. There have been a very small handful of stories that I'd say have made a really deep impression on me, something I end up remembering for the rest of my life, those tales and characters that are so touching and poignant that they sort of become part of me, making me want to dedicate and live my life for them and succeed where they could not, and become a better person that way.This is one of those stories. And I absolutely will not tell you the plot of the story. I could never do it justice. The game presents all these weird puzzling plot items and ideas at the start of the game, but then ties them together in Act 3. My gosh. It hit me so hard.The game flirts with existential philosophy, and that is referenced a couple times by the characters but is more an undertone of the game rather than the main focus and story. There is also a fair amount of banter and humour between the two playable characters, that had me laughing out loud on occasion.It has a very linear plotline and map and is written in the RPG Maker XP engine. Slightly clunky UI, the windowed mode is incredibly small and unable to be resized, so the game is meant to be played full screen. Nothing too egrerious however, I found a couple small annoyances like movement obstacles and not knowing where to go during the horse part, but they were easily ignored. The soundtrack is simple and haunting and even plays a minor role within the story.			"

												This game, if you want to call it that, was possibly one of the most well written and heart felt stories I have had the pleasure of being a part of.  It's a prime example of what great Indie artists can accomplish.  From start to finish, the story had me involved, wanting more, and at many a times, emotionally invested to the point of tears.  I cannot recommend this enough for the truly captivating tale of love and loss that this game brings to life.  Also, don't be afraid of the tears that are bound to come, you'll feel better in the morning about life, love, hope and what tomorrow may bring.  So tear up, it's good for you.			"

[SPOILER FREE]I simply can not state how this game made me feel during it's last hours and especially in the end. This is one true masterpiece, a game to be forever remembered for it's unique storytelling, dialogue and characters. The game gets really emotional in a way I've never seen since Mass Effect 2 (Yes, it is THAT good), but it also features great sense of humor, really nice pixelart and an incredible - to say the least - soundtrack. The only flaw I see in this game is the lack of an options menu, since the game apparently doesn't run at the native resolution of your desktop.Overall, I believe that any story driven gamer should play this.Strongly recommended.9.3/10 "

												I payed a mere $1.99 whilst it was on sale, what a steal.I would be very happy to pay full price for this masterpiece, everything about it was sublime. The not so subtle TV show references when breaking a memento, the world design, the game mechanics...  I'm not going to comment on the story that was told as I don't wish to potentially spoil anything, suffice it to say it will make you cry MANLY tears. The soundtrack is one of the few soundtracks I have even thought of purchasing in my lifetime; it was beautiful.I've played this through once, and I certainly will be again. Not to mention the DLC is free! This is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most well executed games I have played and will every play. Hats off to Freebird Games for giving us this piece of art. I'll be giving A Bird Story a go and if it's even half as good as this was I'll be over the moon *unintentional pun I swear*I cannot recommend this enough, buy it and steam share your library to your friends if they do not wish to purchase it; it's a must play.10/10 "

I've read a lot of books, I've watched a lot of movies, and I've played a lot of games, but never have I come across something that has caused me so much emotional turmoil and heartwrenching bittersweet feelings than this simple visual novel. The visuals are beautiful, the music consistently compliments the mood so well while being some of the best songs I've ever heard, and the characters are so well developed I could reach out and touch them.

												Put simply the best story driven game I have ever seen, this game has a better made story than some best selling books in my opinion. To the Moon is a beautifully written game that brings tears to my eyes one minute, creeps me out the next and after it's done all that it makes me laugh like an idiot, a big factor of this is the music. The mainly acoustic piano soundtrack is amazingly written to fit each situation, so well in fact it made me actually look up the sheet music, print it out and start learning the pieces. To the Moon is full of story and tons of humour that can make you laugh out loud, it deserves every single good recommendation it gets. If you love a good book pick this game up and play it, you won't be disappointed.			"

												9.5/10So... You're here to take me to the moon?OverviewTo The Moon doesn't offer much in the gameplay department. It doesn't present stunning visuals nor is it particularly exciting... But it doesn't pretend to offer any of those things. It's short, honest, beautiful and emotionally consuming. A solid piece of masterful storytelling.StoryThe story follows the whimsical Dr. Neil Watts and level-headed Dr. Eva Rosalene, high-ranking employees of the Sigmund Agency of Life corporation, a service that specializes in altering a terminal person's memory before time of death in order to make their dreams come true. Basically, they're selling deathbed happiness.To The Moon isn't a comedy, though it's hilarious. It isn't a tragedy though it's heart-rending. What it is is brilliant. The dialogue is as powerful and relatable as the thematic is harrowing. I don't want to go into too much detail about the story; I want you to experience the twisty narrative of it by yourselves.GameplayAt first glance, the game plays like you'd expect an RPG to play, minus any form of combat or statistical management. The gameplay mechanics are bare-bones: You walk around, talk with people and interact with objects to progress in a linear fashion. The walk-and-interact gameplay is briefly diversified every now and then with a series of flip-tile puzzles. These are never too difficult and are not detrimental to the experience in the least. Other unexpected gameplay elements are also introduced for brief segments, all of which are an appreciated change of pace.Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene enter the mind of John (their patient) and start off in a late memory. They need to understand the patient's history in order to progress farther back into his past and construct variables to influence the patient's future. The goal is simple: Work your way through John's memories and spark the changes that will alter his future forever.AudioThe original soundtrack may be the strongest aspect of the game. It's strongly in-tune with the emotions that the game attempts to pull out of you and often feels like it leads the resulting impressions. I can't lie, I had to hold back tears to Laura Shigihara's ""Everything's Alright"" when it ripped the limelight from the scene during which it's presented.TechnicalThough the game isn't a technical marvel in itself, the user interface is pretty bland and appears ""cheap"". The lack of options or settings is odd and the game does not support the Steam overlay. These are all very minor shortcomings and I could only bring myself to shave off a fraction of a point for these. The game otherwise runs well, saves automatically to prevent progress loss and it all just works.The TL;DRAn engaging fable of love, waning time and the human condition it encompasses. A tale of fabrication and untruth. This is a story you likely won't soon forget. It lingers with you. A tragic comedy.To The Moon is a success. A brilliant, sense-shattering success.			"

												This game made me realize that being bigger and having beautiful graphics is not always better.  More than anything else, game developers should strive to give us games that are both memorable and satisfying.  A game that makes you feel and experience something extraordinary.     To the Moon is not gorgeous in terms of graphics.  What it lacks in graphics, it makes up for its interactive story telling.  It lets you take part in a tale that is both hearthwarming and incredibly tragic.     The story immerses you and engages you to fulfill a dying man's (Johnny) last wish to go the moon, by altering his memory and replacing them with alternates ones.     What really made the journey interactive is how you put together bits and pieces of his memory and various highlights of his life and love story with wife (River) in order to progress forward in the story.        You will also be carried away by the games soundtrack, specially its main theme also entitled - To The Moon.  It really enhances your game experience and sets the mood in every game sequence.  The game, however, is relatively short, but the game content is what all that matters to me.  The game's message about life and death and the joys and difficulties we might or have already experienced did struck a chord.  In the end all we have our just cherished memories of our loved ones. The moral of the game is' if we had the chance and the ability to change our past, Will you do it?  Maybe some for me.       I really recommend this to a mature audience or even someone who needs a break from the run and gun games we have in our games library.  Kudos to the game developers for giving us such a wonderful game.  Can't wait for the next installment.			"

												I felt that this game was held back entirely by it's two main leads who felt the need to share their ""hilarious"" commentary throughout the entire story. Their banter felt so forced and awkward that I'm amazed at all the positive reviews on steam. The controls were also very clunky and the mouse clicks didn't give proper feedback when using it to control the characters movement. The music was good though and I thought that the story had some pretty interesting twists and turns. It's just too bad that games writing felt very immature and even inappropriate at times given the topic.I honestly think you'd just be better off just listening to the games soundtrack since the game is only 3-4 hours long and you wouldn't be missing much by not playing it.

												I remember when this game came out in my junior year of high school. Great time. I was an awkward, nerdy little♥♥♥♥♥♥with more time than I'd care to admit and I guess I was looking for something that'd make me *feel* stuff. One night, a couple of buddies were over and we all decided we wanted to play something with a story. Something that'd eat up a couple of hours and keep us all focused.Enter: To The MoonAs one of my buddies narrated the dialogue, we were absolutely enthralled. We couldn't tear ourselves away. How did we get so wrapped up in what was essentially a move-and-click sprite game with cliche tropes and easy puzzles? By the end of that session, we'd finished the game and, for reasons you'll understand if you decide to play through, all of us sat in the dark and cried for a while while we talked about what we'd just experienced.I cared about the characters, I loved the soundtrack, and every moment of the game made me feel warm and fuzzy. I've sat down to show it to a few people over the years since then, and even though the magic and surprise is gone, I still can't help but smile like an idiot or get a little teary-eyed while I play this game.Ladies and gentlemen, regardless of your age, if you buy one story-driven walking simulator this year, don't let it be Dear Esther or one of the seventeen ripoffs of that game; let it be To The Moon.

												One of the very best games out there. It has a very strong storyline. This game has everything; mystery and suspense which keeps you on the edge of your seat, emotional moments that'll move you in a way that very few games would ever have. The game has great dialogues consisting of wit and humour. The soundtrack is simply amazing and it changes according to the situations in the game. This is a game that will get you deeply attached to the characters, it will simultaneously break your heart and warm it.I actually completed the game at a stretch of a few hours. The story had me compelled to play it. It literally made me cry at some points and made me really happy at times. I felt strongly for the characters and it hurt me when something bad happened to them. It would be unbelievable if someone told me he/she didn't shed a  single drop of tear in this. ( The person would probably be heartless )Damn amazing story with a damn amazing soundtrack, this game is simply the most touching, emotional and beatiful game i've ever played.

												""To the Moon"" is a storytelling game. So if you like games like The Walking Dead or similar ones, you might like ""To the Moon"". Sure, it's not the best graphic but the story is totally awesome. If you like games with an excellent story, you'll love ""To the Moon"". The music is also awesome.			"

												This is a game something of an emotional roller coaster. You really have no choice but to look at your own relationships after playing this game. It draws on your sense of humanity and the empathy that comes with relationships, loss, and regret. What if you could change your memories, so your death is filled with idyllic memories of a life that perhaps you never truly lived? I wouldnt call this a fun game, but it was an interesting game that provokes much thought and is well worth the 4-5 hours you will invest in it.			"

												To the Moon, despite its soft name, has a rather compelling and uniquely colorful story that often lends to unsettling themes in regards to life/fate. Although being, arguably, a downer type of story, there are witty dashes of wry humor to liven the mood. Has remarkable usage of sprite art and music as well.Would recommend for squirrel roadkill.

And you will never look at paper bunnies the same way.The only glitch is the achievement to gain: for now you have to play on WINDOWS and in ENGLISH to make it happen. At first I played in Polish so it didn't count. I had to change the language in settings to English and replay the last auto-save.But above that... 4 hours of heart-melting gameplay. It's worth it.

												To The Moon is a story-driven point and click adventure game that also incorporates puzzle elements. The gameplay mechanics are simple and incredibly easy to pick up. You won't ever find yourself stumped or frustrated at this game, since the gameplay is used to pace the plot perfectly. Without revealing too many spoilers, at its heart To The Moon is a love story. It's also much more than that, it delves right into topics such as life and death, regrets and even fate. If you're a pessimist, this is a story that will restore your faith in humanity and make you believe in love again. It had just the right amount of humor thrown in, you just can't help but smile at how silly one of the characters can be at times. It plucked on your heartstrings plenty as well, and I'm comfortable enough with my manliness to admit that there were a few moments when I was on the verge of tears, both out of sadness and out of happiness.The pixel art is beautiful and charming. A lot of care and thought was placed into the art style and I never imagined that 8 bit graphics could be so expressive. The only minor flaw I found with the game, and it's incredibly minor, is that the game runs in a set resolution and there is no option to run the game windowed. It's probably for the best, since running the game windowed can easily break the immersion. It isn't a terribly long game, it took me just under 4 hours to complete. You will want to set aside a healthy chunk of time to dedicate to this game though. I highly recommend playing this through all in one sitting, though if you're anything like me, that won't even be an option. I was so immersed into this game, I don't even think I glanced at my second monitor the last 3 hours of play, let alone get up from my chair. The soundtrack is beautiful, filled with piano arrangements that accompany the story so well. Every aspect of this game has a simple elegance to it that adheres to you at such a fundamental level. This is a game that will stay on your mind long after you've finished playing it.To The Moon is damn near perfect. It's not often that I play a game where I struggle to point out flaws or things I wished the developers changed. It's not often that I am so entranced by a game, I am glued to my computer chair until the end credits scroll past my screen. Even now, as I'm writing this review, listening to the game's soundtrack, I still feel goosebumps. This game has affected me on a level deeper than any other game ever has. The story in this game easily stands as one of the most beautiful and touching tales I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in ANY form of media. This game is absolutely amazing, and it's one that everybody should try, even non-gamers.			"

												To the Moon tells one of the most heartwarming stories in gaming. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy it - it's truly a game for all ages. To say too much about the plot would ruin the magic, but just imagine if you had the power to give a dying person any wish they could desire. How would you do that?True, the graphics are basic, but the beautiful music and characters more than make up for that.My only complaint (if you can call it that) is that the gameplay is very minimal. Little beyond fetching items. So you won't lose much by watching a playthrough on YouTube.But regardless of how you chose to experience this game, trust me, make sure you do. You will have a blast.... a... blast off... to the Moon?I tried.			"

												'To the Moon' is intelligent, well written and extremely creative. Two scientists dive into a dying man's mind to alter his memories in order to fulfil his final wish. And yes, the game is just as awesome as it sounds. It has some really cool moments and even though the idea is pretty surreal, it is presented to you in a way that it just sucks you in and the game MAKES you believe it is all actually possible. Not only that, you will feel for these characters. Rarely have there been games that tug on my heart strings the way this game did. Some people seem to finish it in one sitting, take 2 or 3 hours to complete it but it took me 5.2 hours for 1 playthrough from beginning to end. I like to be thorough in my games, especially the story heavy ones that rely on exploration. You will want to take it all in with this game because it is just that good.It is a very basic point and click game, nothing overly complicated and it doesn't require too much work, there are some minor riddles to solve but in the end, it relies for the most part on its emotion heavy story. The game is story driven and the visuals and soundtrack are both there to intensify the experience. Some songs might come over as repetitive (something actually made fun of within the game itself) but you will hardly notice this because the music is just that good. The graphics are reminiscent of the Super Nintendo era and it works for this game. Finally 'To the Moon' is jam packed with useless nerdy trivia for gamers and people who watch all the good tv shows.'To the Moon' is dark, atmospheric and you won't leave the game unmarked.			"

												I have to preface this recommendation by saying that To The Moon isn't really much of a game. It's an interactive story, and a phenomenal one at that. So if you're one of those people who refuse to play interactive story experiences for whatever reason, then you'll probably get nothing out of this.For the rest of you, I say strap yourselves in and give it a shot. To The Moon is an emotional journey through a dying man's memories in order to fulfill his last wish of going to the moon. To say more really spoils what makes it so great, but suffice to say I went into this with fairly low expectations (it is an RPG Maker title after all) and came away from it wondering why we haven't had more stories in gaming that were this compelling. I couldn't actually pull myself away from the screen until I'd completed it and left going ""argh, the feels!""As a result, I can do nothing but recommend To The Moon. Just know what you're getting into.			"

												To The Moon has the most moving story I've ever experienced, not just in games, but anywhere.  The game only takes a couple hours to complete, but it is definitely worth it just to experience the story.  The music is beautiful as well and fits perfectly with the story.The gameplay, however, is at the level where some people may not even call it a game.  While it looks like a classic JRPG, the level of interaction offered is very low.  It mostly consists of walking around to discover what triggers the next cutscene.  At some points the level of interaction offered is almost insulting, with the game giving you control just for a couple seconds to do something easily accomplished during the cutscene.  It's almost as if it's trying to remind you that you're playing a game, not watching the story.  Later in the game, it turns into more of a hidden object game where you solve simple puzzles between chapters which is much more pleasing.To The Moon is a game that needs to be experienced.  It's too difficult to put it into words, especially without giving any spoilers.			"

I don't know, because it's not a game, it's a movie, yes yes as replayable as your average movie or more of an interactive story.I want to finish the story to see what would happen to the characters at the end, I really hoping and believing in a happy ending.The soundtrack is amazing and fits every scene of the game. This game is one of the best games I've played in a long time.This game is different from many of today's games, and different in a good way.If you're looking for a game with a exciting story, interesting characters, nostalgia, a beautiful soundtrack or simply a game that is different, then buy it NOW!!.. BUT if you're looking for good graphics, physics and a hard challange this is NOT the game for you.Certainly recommended for those who want to resting to experience a marvelous story, and don't mind a lot of reading.

												Slightly clunky controls and occasional glitches are completely overshadowed by the amazing story. I don't think i've been this moved by a game since The Walking Dead S1. It doesn't take very long to complete but feels longer than it's length and can drag at times. The gameplay itself is mediocre rpgmaker type point and click with some arbitrary puzzles placed throughout. This in no way deteriates from the story though, with a steady ramp up to a heart wrenching finale this is one of the best stories i've ever played.			"

We're going on a feel trip!This is a very story driven game with a graphic style reminscent of something you'd see on the SNES, and while there is no voiceovers in this game it has very strong dialogue if you don't mind doing some reading. The soundtrack is great as well. There is not so much actual ""gameplay"" here as much as you interacting with the story in order to progress it further. If you're looking for a low cost game that will tug on your heartstrings this is it!			"

												To The Moon is everything I want in a game,  Sure, it has little gameplay and is more interactive story than really a game, but this it handles perfectly. It is one of the rare games that made me laugh, cry and feel with the characters on screen, which not many games manage to do nowadays. The story within is very human, touching, and well handled in its build up till its very tear-inducing conclusion. It is a story about people, about love and loss, and every fine nuance in between. Honestly, I can't hardly recall any game --or media in general -- which moved me to this extent like it did. Yes, it is limited in its graphics, being an RPG-Maker game, though it does use it in a very charming and heartwarming way, accompanied by beautiful music extra composed for the game. To say more would mean to spoil it, so let me conclude in saying that playing To The Moon was a very unique and great experience, and I'm thankful for having made it.			"

												To The Moon is an emotional journey, one that I haven't really ever experienced in games. It's a game with RPG Maker graphics so it looks simple, but its strength lies in its storytelling.The way the story is told is done in a way that will keep you (mostly) interested during the entire experience. While it lasts only 4 hours or so, there's very little gameplay involved (there's even a somewhat frustrating part near the end).Even though the game lacks in the graphics department, it makes up for it by its amazing soundtrack. I enjoyed it so much that I even bought it seperately afterwards.Keep an open mind, ignore the graphics and just enjoy the ride.A must own !(It should earn the ""I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye"" award)[Rating: 83/100]			"

												'한 편의 아름다운 소설과 감미로운 음악을 동시에 체감하며 즐길 수 있는 작품' 게임이란 넓은 범주에서 보면 인간이 즐길 수 있는 모든 것을 포함할 것이다. 투 더 문은 이런 넓은 범주에서의 게임에 속한다. 투 더 문을 하면서 느낀 게임의 '장르'적인 방식은 마치 '디어 에스더'와 비슷하다. 유저가 게임을 직접하면서 개입할 수 있는 것은 거의 없으며, 게임적인 요소도 거의 없는 점이 비슷하다. 유저가 할 수 있는 행동은 이동과 단서 모으기 및 퍼즐 맞추기 뿐. 하지만, 이러한 요소 중 단서 모으기 및 퍼즐 맞추기는 절묘하게 스토리적인 '시스템'에 부합해서 어색함이 없다. 다만 이런 게임적 요소도 챕터 1에서 끝나버린다. 이 게임을 하게되면 유저는 4시간 가량되는 플탐동안 감미로운 OST와 감동을 이끌어내는 스토리를 별다른 개입 없이 체험만 하게된다. 게임의 스토리 요소와 OST는 매우 높은 평가와 점수를 줄만하다. 하지만, 어찌보면 그냥 비주얼 노블 마냥 진행되는 게임의 방식에 질리는 유저도 분명 존재할 것이다. 게임인가 소설인가. 그것은 직접 유저들이 판단할 문제지만 어떻게든 이 게임을 구매한 유저들에게 만족감을 준다면 그건 그거대로 좋은 작품이라는 뜻이되지 않을까? 투 더 문 시리즈의 미래를 봤을 때, 앞으로도 후속작들이 이런 방식으로 나올 것이 거의 확실한 듯 해보인다. 여러 떡밥을 해결하기 위해 작가가 스토리를 어떻게 풀어갈지 후속작도 기대가 되는 작품이다.

												Don't let the store page screenshots fool you, this game is not an RPG despite being made with RPG Maker (The squirrel battle is an ingame joke), It's a linear 16bits-ish adventure game.Talk to people, look for some items, do a few puzzles, and follow the story. The sad, touching, tear-jerking story. Seriously, if you don't cry you're not human. It's hard to talk about why the game is so great without spoiling the story. The characters have a profound personality rarely seen in a videogame, and they share a deep pure love. The beautiful music just make the experience even more enjoyable.There's two control schemes, arrow keys or mouse (No WASD for you). Mouse control can be a bit clunky sometimes, with your characters not going at first click where they're supposed to go; playing with a keyboard is faster and more efficient but then you won't have a clue about what things you can interact with.You can choose from 10 different languages. The game lasts around 4 hours and doesn't really have replay value, but it's worthy.			"

												OK, I had previously recommended this game, but I reread it and I thought, ""thats all I could say about it?"" This is one of my personal favorites. Everyone needs to play this. I don't care if you don't play games like this. Play it anyway. The first time I played it, I enjoyed it and found the story beautiful and sad at the same time. I played it again and, since I knew what was coming, just enjoyed the ride. If I had to give a one word review it would be this: beautiful. The creators made good use of RPG Maker. The look is retro but charming. As great and touching as the story is, the soundtrack is the star. It never misses a beat. It covers every emotion that runs through the story and pulls at your heart. Have Kleenex nearby because the music brings a level of reality that isn't found in a lot of games. To the Moon is more than a computer game. It is something special. Its pulls you in and touches your heart. It will stay with you.			"

												You know, day by day, year by year, games will be dated except To The Moon. 5 years later, 10 years later, world can change, technology can evolve but this is still a glorious masterpiece. It takes you few hours to finish the game (about 4-6 hours) but you will spend several days or months thinking about it, about your goals, your life, your fate. This game taught me that I cannot change it, cannot change my fate, the only thing I (and you) can do is choose the way to live and die without regretting.			"

												'Ladies and gentleman, welcome aboard the feels train. Todays destination will be: the Moon!'Okay let's be honest: the gameplay of 'To the Moon' is quite boring, it's repetitive and often more annoying than entertaining. It's not the typical 'Fighting & Fantasy'-RPG-Maker game but a strictly linear adventure whichsets its focus on the story about an old man and his dying wish. Sure, there are minigames and some 'better' levels, but after the fifth time collecting some memory links to go on to the next level I just thought 'C'mon just skip this, I don't want to do this agai-... great another memory link level'. But I still recommend this game - without any doubts - to everyone who enjoys a good story.You ask why? It'S true, for me 'To the Moon' is an 'average' game at best, but at the same time it's a fantastic 'movie' with an interesting story backed up by an amazing soundtrack, well-written dialogues, interesting characters and an atmosphere that makes up for many flaws. I really enjoyed the plot and the great dialogues between the characters and you can definitly see how much time the developers used to make every scene create the right emotional situation. And - at least in my case - they succeeded.			"

												Note: I received a copy of To The Moon for my birthday!First off I would like to start by stating that you don't actually have to use your mouse (some people get annoyed), you can use your arrow keys and your space bar (interaction key) and just use your mouse as a guide. Also, this game's graphics isn't the best (pixel art) but I promise it actually grows on you and you will start to like it. Especially because there are some sick illustrations later on.Positives:+ Deep storyline (very well thought out, kudos to the Developer's efforts) - you don't actually know what to expect when you first start playing this game; it's much more than you think it is+ Relatively nice graphics (Pixel Art)+ Beautiful and fitting music (Situational)+ Extra minisodes (DLCS)+ Character development is simply wonderful, and very well done+ Good excuse to go grab some ice cream as soon as you get to 'Act 3' (I cried a little)+ Maps aren't too large, but large enough to explore thoroughly and enjoyably especially with the little dialogues or things you pick up+ Relatively easy puzzles, but not too easy - it also displays the lowest amount of moves needed to complete the puzzle which makes you visualise the outcomes and how to complete it with the least amount of moves. Tip: As soon as it tells you about the diagonal flipping, use it because almost every puzzle afterwards requires it (to achieve least amount of moves)+ Saving options are very well thought out - automatic saves for important actions and you can also use manual saving+ There are nice little extras in the game menu where it shows you the items you have and specific 'notes' or interesting things you have found out - this is updated quite frequently and worth your time to check outNegatives:- Although I loved the character development and thought it was very well done, I definitely would have liked it more if there was more background information about Johnny's mother. We only know a little about her but I feel like she plays a bigger role than that.- Puzzles that can get repetitive (it's not too bad)- Walking speed is quite slow and can get annoying waiting for them to hurry up- Some larger maps can get tedious - walking around and finding thingsOverall:The main focus of the actual game (storyline) is very beautiful, relatable and enjoyable. It made me cry after 'Act 3' at various scenes (those who have played know what I mean). The way the story is set out seems a bit odd at first, but as you continue on it makes a lot of sense and I feel is the perfect way to lay it out. The ending was simply beautiful and you don't really see it coming - in fact, you don't see many events (plot twists people) happening until it does. There is a little bit of humour, especially with the protagonists and it's a very deep, heartfelt story. Despite the negatives, I would like to say that the postitives definitely outweigh the negatives.I love stories like these because you don't have to make any serious choices, yet the choices the protagonists make, makes you think about your morals and what you would do in such a situation. I've spent some time considering the many options and the options the protagonists made plus the repurcussions and their situations, and I finally came to the conclusion of what was morally correct. I'm fully content with the ending. I think this game is a lot about the morality of how these people help the man, as well as others. The DLCs do explore the concept of morality and how some people think what they do is immoral.Score: 9/10It's not perfect but it's close enough. Definitely worth the full price (and if you like the music, get the soundtracks too) and you get free minisodes (DLCS).I could go on and on and on... But let me say this: Just play the game, you won't regret it.			"

												Its barely a game, its a piece of art. It starts slow, but it gets progressively better having a peak at the very end. Level of emotional involvement is just incredible that almost no AAA titles have and guarantee you great experience, just with a bit simple and lacking gameplay, but amazing story to put you through.Couple doctors arrive to grant dying man last wish - ""To the Moon"". How hard can it be to go through old man's memories and alternate his past, his dreams for young qualified doctors, to ensure his adjusted dream-life brings him to the moon before he dies? Apparently dying man doesn't know why he wants go to the moon at the first place, he just does. Doctors are going to discover that its not about him, its about people he loves and cares; its about his only dream he worked for his whole life; its about connection between all those things. Would one dream destroy another one and all he lived for? Would it make him miserable, make him find something new, both or something else? Is there time to make it work? This game is so alive and tense it almost made me cry. I witnessed beautiful dreams, lives, endings, losses, achievements and success altogether, leading man to his dream, To the Moon and everything beyond it.			"

												When I first heard about this game I heard it was very sad and I thought to myself how sad could a game be? So I bought it and firgured I would only play it for about an hour while I had something downloading. I after playing for about 10 minutes I was really liking the story so I kept playing and the thing I had downloading was done after about an hour but I just couldn't stop playing the game, the story was getting really good. I beat in the average time for everyone which is about 4-5 hours and the game left me speechless it has one of the best stories I have ever experienced probably the only game that has ever made me cry the only game that has ever came close to doing that was Red Dead Redemption. The games soundtrack was fantastic and totally worth buying. It has very likable characters and a emotional and amazing story. I recommend playing this game in one sitting if you have about 5 hours to kill. You should buy this game trust me you won't regret it. 10/10			"

												Great, great game. I must say that I was rather surprised by how the developer managed to make a very good story fit within the short length that the game is. The story, in my opinion, is the biggest highlight of the game, followed by the sweet soundtrack. It manages to be both really clever and moving, and the textual dialogue within the game contains that quality to it that I absolutely love, which is the one that brings emotion and personality into the written words. The one that makes the characters sound more human, and that familiarity with them renders them very emotionally potent; a kind of emotional truth that we experience at a biochemical level quite the same as we would with strangers whom we get to know with time.I suppose that the only one I genuinely have with the game is the fact that it only runs on 640x480 in Windows. While the art is still very good, it's a shame that it's not possible to experience the game in bigger resolutions. The lack of an options menu for that is an issue, and it's bad that the Steam overlay doesn't work with the game as well. Albeit, as usual with other RPG Maker games, the game's properties and settings can be easily accessed by pressing F1. Those can be used to alter the game's controls, in case the player isn't satisfied with them. They're smooth and easy to learn, however.Any gamer that loves games that are story driven must have this in their library. To The Moon contains a heartwarming narrative, good characters, fine art, and a wondrous soundtrack. This is something to be paid attention to.  It's simple, yet powerful. It's short, but gripping. It's part of why it's as impressive as it is. Very recommended, thank you for this stunning journey, Freebird Games. 9.1/10.0 "

												Decided to play this game for some Steam Trading Cards.Didn't know what to expect.Friend of mine did praise the OST and told me it was fantastic a couple of years back, but I never gave the game a second thought. Never read any reviews, had absolutely zero fμcking clue what it was about. I honestly thought it was some kind of space exploration game.Clunky controls, pixel art, cheesy dialogue...thought this was gonna be your typical indie game.Let me just say, ""Wow."" I wasn't ready for this. What a rollercoaster. This game helped me discover emotions I never knew I had. It's incredibly depressing, just flashing through a person's lifetime of memories like that...I'm glad that the cheesy dialogue was in there. Great balance of cheerful and poignant moments. Pretty much left crying at the end, though.A video game has not really moved me like this. #FeelsTrip			"

												Absolutely sensational storytelling. Very few games out there succeed in excellent story and character development that attracts and scars players. To The Moon is one of the few that does an outstanding job in not only nailing this, but also leaving a long-lasting impact.Without revealing too much to those that have yet to play - You assume control of two Doctors – Dr. Neil Watts and Dr. Eva Rosalene – whom work for an agency whose job is to reconstruct certain aspects of dying people's memories and fulfil their deepest wishes before their lights are out; in this case, taking Johnny to the Moon. The reason to which I will not explain in this review, otherwise there would be no point in going through all the emotions this game sets out to deliver. Though you can expect a story filled with excellent dialogue and character development with plenty of unpredictable momentsGameplay is fairly straight forward and pretty much the same as TWD or any point-and-click game for that matter. There are a few mini-games and puzzles to add that little challenge factor but nothing overly complicated or mind numbing. Everything is straight forward and easy to pick up.The soundtrack is composed to perfection and aids the storytelling in a very unique way. A great mixture of tracks which change depending on the scenario at hand.The only aspect that may throw some people off is the fact that there is almost zero replayability, with the average completion time appearing to be anywhere around the 4.5 hour mark. Unless of course certain aspects of the game did not sink in properly the first time and you attempt a second rerun, though this does not bother me at all as it aimed to convey a purpose right from the beginning and was delivered to great satisfaction. Overall a wonderful game I would very strongly recommend. Do not let the simple graphics fool you! Deep down tears will be shed playing this little blockbuster.			"

												At first glance, To the Moon may simply look like another of those retro-coated adventures or RPGs that go dime a dozen these days. Granted, it is technically a text-driven, point-n-click adventure with a few minigames here and there. Yet when experienced in its entirety, it becomes clear that it is much more than that.Fresh from credits rolling, I can say that it's one of the best stories I've ever been told through the medium of video games. It's a unique, humane piece, unlike any I've come to experience; so elaborately woven together, so well-written and touching with flawless pacing all-around that I could have easily enjoyed it as a book if the author, Kan Gao, had chosen to tell it so. Better yet, this superb script is accompanied by an exquisite audio-visual package that enriches the adventure greatly. The result of the amalgamation of these expertly crafted elements was an experience so rich that I couldn't help myself going through it in a single session, caring about every single one of its small cast of characters and wondering what would I uncover about them next all the way. Needless to say, I found myself being amazed from scene to scene, as the 'game' was delivering everything to be expected from a true work of art in spades.The fact that this kind of an experience is not coming from of a first-tier developer but born from the minds and crafted in the hands of a small group of individuals with a small budget is only a nod to their talent. I must admit that I wasn't expecting such a fine-tuned creation with this much of an impact when I first booted the game. But here I am, after a five-hour rollercoaster of emotions, feeling all the more human thanks to this excellent work of art disguised as a game.My advice, don't lose any more time reading about To the Moon. Get it, live through it and see if it doesn't take a place among your most precious gaming memories, 'cause it surely got itself one of the best for me.			"

The story begins when a John a very ill person nearing his end called for two doctors that can dive deep into the patients memories to artificially fulfill his last wish.The story telling is backwards. You start from the present dive deeper into the past until his childhood and things will slowly start to make sense along the way. I tend not to give off any kind of hints to my reviews, you should play this game and know the story yourself and why it's called ""To the Moon"".[+] Surprising depth in writing.[+] Outstanding story that has both emotional and funny moments.[+] A casual mini-game that doesn't ruin your momentum on a story-driven game.[+] Soundtrack that you will listen over and over again.[+] Likeable characters.[+] Humor were added perfectly to where they should be.[+] I get to play whack-a-mole and ride horses and totally forgot about what I should really be doing.[-] No window. A sprite game doesn't look pleasant on fullscreen.[-] Unfortunately I wasn't able to get a screenshot for the finale due to F12 being a hotkey for pause. (LOL)[-] Some grasses are not walkable. (LOL'd again) This made some areas of the game really hassle to explore.RatingFun-factor: ★★★★★ Atmosphere: ★★★★★Story: ★★★★★Soundrack: ★★★★★Average: ★★★★★  "

												I picked up this game because it reminded me of Chrono Trigger (my favorite rpg of all time).  While there are no battles, the storyline is superb.  I was not expecting such a heavily involved story, but it had all the elements.  You have humor, sadness, anger, confusion, love, pickled olives, platypus dolls, paper bunnies, and a piano.  Such a beautiful game.  You want a game with a good story and very well developed characters?  PLAY THIS GAME.			"

It has an amazing story presented in such a beautiful way along with a soundtrack that's absolutely heart warming. The graphics style is gorgeous (never underestimate the power of pixels, lol).

												To the Moon is a beautiful game on many levels. The music, sounds, story, artwork, atmosphere, and delivery unlock a cornucopia of raw and powerful emotions that cling to the obvious passion the developers put into it. It's a pretty remarkable journey of closure, one that is amazingly told backwards.All giddiness aside, the gameplay and user interaction are definite weak spots, although quite easy to overlook. The story also showcases a striking resemblance to movie concepts from Total Recall (memory implants)--not a knock...just saying.Only a select few indie titles have come close to pulling off the grand gaming experience that To the Moon delivers. It is every little bit a must experience game.			"

												Gifted by a friend, I had no idea what this game was. A wonder! I recommend it without a single doubt.Basically it is rather something to watch than something to play as it is all about the story. Few actions are required from the player, which most of the time are easy. Make sure to read as it is the core of the game, and give it more than an hour to get into its story.Pros:- Excellent storyline. Captivating and pushes the player to have some kind of reflexion about it. Despite the player being quite passive the story will push you to continue if you pay attention to it.- Soundtrack is superb- the 16-bit style does it justice - yes I know this sounds weird.- Text. Suits the game perfectly and - to me - was very pleasant as it gives some room for imagination.- Those entertaining flipping puzzlesCons:- At times I found the controls/mouse precision to be a little bit annoying but it was no big deal tbh.

												WHAT GENIUS CAME UP WITH THIS SORCERY!?!?!? This game is better than Bioshock, Total War, Star Wars games, and ALMOST Batman!(When it comes to story---granted, Batman's my favoritest(Yes, it's a word) game ever) It is it's own unique genre. If you think you're a man, prepare to be proved wrong. This game seemlessly forces you to feel happy, sad, angry, and just about every other motion in the book. It may also make you shed a tear or two. It also has an OUTSANDING soundtrack that almost makes me want to learn to play piano. I think myself to be an action gamer, but this game told me otherwise. The graphics may have been like old gameboy games, yet to me, they seemed just as good as the latest and greatest graphics do. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and just when I thought there wasn't going to be any action, there were a few extra sprinkles that brought that into it. I highly recommend the game and for the price, you can't go wrong. I streamed it (Some was silent) so if you want to see, or if you have any questions about it please let me know.			"

												To the Moon is a very short game about a company who fulfills one last wish of our loved ones before they pass on.  In a short amount of time not only do you learn about some deep and surprising facts of the character who is dying, but also about the people who are trying to guide him through his final moments and complete his dying wish.  This game also comes complete with two mini games!! :)  (*spoiler alert* One of the mini games also has a fun and quite honestly challenging mini game within it.)  My suggestion is to be sure to play the main game first, as the content within the mini games will not make as much sense. (ESPECIALLY the second one!)  I really hope that many others will discover this quaint and adorable game.  Most of it is text novel, with some point and click along the way.  It is also currently as I write this on sale for 75% off.  Although it is very much worth, in my opinion that is, the full price.  So what are you waiting for??....Go get yourself a copy today! :))  ~~*NOTE* I have intentionally left out many details of the game as possible, so as to not spoil the wonderful experience of the game for others.  (The game description and trailer of it explain more anyway. lol)			"

												This game. It seems to be one of those typical pretentious indie games at first glance, but by god, this is so much more. Let me get this out of the way first: To the Moon is the game that I cried the most at throughout my whole life.Now, it doesn't really consist of a lot more than text and accompanying music, but that's way more than enough for immersion into such an amazing story—the plot was absolutely new to me, with no clichés in its integral parts at all. The setting is very similar to, or I'd even dare say borrowed from the movie 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', but it goes way deeper beyond that, to, as far as I know, previously uncharted territories of storytelling. Naturally, because of this, the story was for the most part unpredictable for me; this is what happens when none of your actions really matter and yet the life of someone is depending on them... maybe. I'm really not even sure what to make of this all, I still am in shock after having played through the game and I will need quite some time to completely process what I've seen.Above all this, the game has an unbelievably great soundtrack that meshes with the story so well that you'll cry even more just because of the musical score. There's even some really humorous moments in the game, that include but are not limited to: poking fun at those pretentious indie games I mentioned above, breaking the fourth wall, making hilarious puns, having absolutely unexpected moments, and so on. There's clearly tons of attention paid to every detail of the game, having a masterfully crafted experience.The negatives: not much, really. The author clearly doesn't have the best technical background, so you'll be stuck playing at a weird resolution no matter what, but it doesn't take a lot to get used to.I'm still real close to crying. ♥♥♥♥.

												There's a great story in here but it needs a professional writer to edit and redraft it. As it is, the dialogue is very clumsy, very painful, very awkward, very unnatural - the inappropriately shoehorned jokes range from unfunny to baffling. Half the story deals with people middle-aged to elderly but the characters all speak consistently like teenagers or young adults. I hate to be that kind of snob but - maybe the overwhelmingly positive rating comes from a mostly younger audience who don't notice the bad dialogue as much? Like how Stephanie Meyer's books are so successful?It's a shame, the core ideas - mostly Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with chunks of Elfen Lied - are solid and at times I came tantalisingly close to feeling something.Art and animation and music were all polished, can't fault them. Found the controls to be clunky, seemed a bit haphazard as to whether I could click on a thing or not, and invisible walls everywhere. There's no real gameplay, there's objects or places in the map that when clicked on will help progress the story, same as a lot of walking simulators, which I don't mind if the story's worth it.This is a completely un-cynical game written with passion and some talent, about a quasi sci-fi future where a dying man's memories of his sometimes troubled marriage to his childhood sweetheart, who lived with asperger's, are relived in a bid to grant his deathbed wish of going to the moon. That's such an awesome setup, and how many video games are we going to get with that kind of thoughtful and creative elevator pitch? And I hate, hate, hate this game for wasting it on what's basically a particularly surreal and lengthy Big Bang Theory episode. Bazoonga! or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ that guy says.			"

												Two parts Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, one part Inception, some really charming visuals and an extremely memorable and beautiful soundtrack and you've got To The Moon. You take control of two scientists who are part of an organization specializing in altering the unfulfilled memories of dying patients in order to help ease their passing. They crash their car on the way to their latest patient, who wants to believe he went to the moon before he dies, and saying much more than that would begin to ruin the premise, but rest assured it is a GREAT premise. Some very good narrative reveals, great character dialogue (for the most part, details on that later), and a story that you'd have to have a heart of stone not to appreciate on some level. I can admit that I'm a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to games trying to touch my heart, but with the story, visuals and music I couldn't help but give myself over to the experience during a few particularly beautiful sequences. As far as gameplay goes, there really isn't much to speak of outside of hunting for clues in the levels, solving the picture puzzle at the end of each memory and a few scarce, optional minigames. It's also worth noting that it's a very short game, able to be finished in around 4-5 hours. That being said, it's one of those games I plan on going back to play every couple years, and it's not a very expensive game, either.My only real complaints are that the game can be broken fairly easily (Moving through solid environments, walking through cars, I even encountered a glitch early on with the log jumping mechanic that nearly forced me to delete my save and start over) and the dialogue between the scientists can be extremely poorly timed and downright obnoxious and can occassionaly ruin otherwise very touching moments. I understand the need for comic relief in a game like this, but screaming ""HULK SMASH!!"" and ""HADOUKEN!"" during emotional moments isn't the way to do it. Even so, it's still a very enjoyable game that you should definitely play if you get the chance. I wouldn't suggest picking it up for more than a few bucks if you're not the type to replay a game periodically as it is, like I said, only about 4-5 hours long. It's in a bundle right now and it goes on sale very cheaply from time to time, though, so why not pick it up?			"

												To the Moon is an adventure game/bordering on visual novel which uses 16-bit era RPG-style graphics to communicate its story. In it, two doctors use a device which allows them to travel through a man's memories, altering them in such a way that in his coma state it allows him to dream that he has lived the life which would have resulted from those alterations.The story is the important factor of this game, so I'll refrain from saying any further due to spoilers. It's an excellent story although the writing can be a little mediocre in spots. I'd recommend finishing the game in one or two sittings to get the full experience, but that is not mandatory by any means.For those who enjoy narrative-driven games, this is a must purchase. However, it might be worthwhile to wait for a sale of some sort.			"

The writing is high quality, and the music is even better. Actual gameplay is severely limited. There are a few puzzles, but nothing major. Ultimately, this is a game more about telling a story in a unique way, and it does this beautifully.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good yarn and has a few hours free to play it all the way through.

												Really good game, definitely worth playing at some point.It is like watching a train wreck in reverse, you watch an awful event fold itself back together and you have the ability to change someones life, at least in their dying memories. The characters are fantastic in this game too.My only gripe is that it felt like it was missing something. It felt like it was set up to have multiple episodes but it ended up never getting past episode 1.			"

												I don't really know how to describe this game, other than to say it's an interactive story with some light gameplay in it. However, I don't mean that in a bad way, as it's a very good format to tell a story.The story follows two doctors working in a company that grants its clients (who are all people on their deathbeds) a last wish of sorts before they die: they rewrite their memories so they can accomplish whatever they dreamed of; in the case of the game, the client is a man who always dreamed of going to the Moon, hence the title of the game. The story is very good, and emotional; and I'd say the game it's worth it for the story alone. Still, I'd make a disservice to the devs, as they managed to craft a very good game not only storywise, but in aesthethics and overall tone. The traditional RPG style fits the game pretty well, and the soundtrack is very good as well.As far as gameplay goes, as I said, it has light gameplay; there won't be a lot of fighting or anything like that; only going around interacting with certain objects, and having dialogue with different NPCs. Even then, it's entertaining enough, and the gameplay works to enhance the story.After the main story, there's two extra DLC chapters (which can be downloaded for free), which show a bit more of the company the doctors work for; and it's set during Christmas, after the events of the main game. The tone remains somewhat similar to that of the main game, although there's a few interesting twists (particularly in the second chapter).Well, I don't think I can say much more about this game, other than I recommend it.

AUDIOHeart-feltVISUALStockDIFFICULTYSimpleVIBETheatricalCRAVINGCinematicON SALEOccasionallyPROS: Story is exceptional, and told creatively. OST is wonderful, worth a download if you can appreciate solo piano. The world is very interesting; it would be great to see more episodes following different people. The game is easy to control and understand. CONS: Doctor Watts is a major atmosphere-ruiner. I'm assuming his more obnoxious lines were shoehorned in when it appeared the game was a bit too dramatic, but his meme-rife ""comedic"" relief is very unwelcomed. Much of the graphics are RPGMXP stock.WORTH: The short total playtime and stock graphics may not make it worth its full asking price.OVERALL:  To The Moon is a touching endeavor and worth 2-3 hours of your time. Freebird Games can make a hell of a story that's proof that the video game medium can tell tear-jerkers.SCORE:8/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												People give excellent games a 10/10 and maybe half of them deserve it, but To The Moon has a brilliant story that needs to be experienced by everyone and their grandmother.  There's really nothing quite like it, and the fact that it's able to convey such a brilliant story WITHOUT voice acting and using 16-bit graphics is genius in itself.  I would put this in the same calibur as a Half Life, Super Mario 64, Warcraft 3, type of level even though there really isn't any gameplay.  I would put it above Life Is Strange and Grim Fandango as well, which were my favorite interactive-story type of games before I played this.  Yes, it's THAT freaking good!11/10			"

												Human wishes are the meaning of our life. They set our path, affect our decisions… They make us what we are. To The Moon tells us a story of an old dying man that wants his final wish to be fulfilled. Wish that he cared through his life. That made him who he is. As Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts you will travel back in old man’s memory to let him live through his wish. Even if only in dreams. The story you will see in this trip is full of emotional moments. Moments that can’t leave you indifferent. Main and credit melodies are unbelievable. And gameplay is easy but interesting. All who loves quest novels with heartful story should play this masterwork of Canadian designer/composer Kan ""Reives"" Gao.			"

												Traveling backwards through time, a beautiful story unfolds as you follow the events of one man's life. It's less of a game and more of a storytelling experience.

It's hard to say how amazing this game is without spoiling it, but I will tell you one thing: At one point, the characters debate how one would get a piano into the TARDIS.			"

												Easily worth the purchase while it is on sale (I actually got this in a Humble Bundle quite sometime ago and only just got around to playing it), but even at full price; I wouldn't regret buying it for a second. I decided to start playing this last night, big mistake on my part, as I could not stop! Even after I finished the game, I just HAD to play the free DLC episodes, set in the protagonists’ workplace. Which were short even compared to the main game, but were enjoyable all the same, and slightly creepy~but enough about those.To The Moon is a great game, it made me tear up a bit with how emotional it gets, it also made me laugh at times. There's a decent amount of humour, mostly in the form of Dr Neil Watt's shenanigans and dialogue, and it takes the edge off the largely sad narrative. That said, the story is not all doom and gloom, it may even surprise you--it did me.I now eagerly await this game's true sequel, while I ponder the strange goings on of the mini episodes, hmm~			"

												To the Moon is a beautiful story driven game, with gameplay taking a backseat. This game is all about story as the gameplay consists pretty much of moving on a 2D plain and solving puzzles. If you are not one for games with little actual gameplay, then I do not recommend this game, but if you enjoy stories, then I highly, highly recommend To the Moon. My only issue with the game were the controls. Using the mouse to move was often a pain, because it either wouldn't register or the character just wouldn't move there. If you can, I suggest using the keypad to move. During the ""Puzzles"" the game also registered me as double clicking quite a lot, which made me miss some of the ideal move numbers.The story is, in my opinion, absolutely brilliant and I will not hide the fact that I did cry towards the end. Its sad, but really sweet is all I can say without spoiling it.The music is also fantastic. I'm a sucker for piano pieces and the main theme and ""Everything's Alright"" are absolutely amazing...I gotta give the vocalist credit as she did a beautiful job. If you can, purchase the soundtrack. You won't regret it.Again, I highly, highly recommend this if you're looking for a good story, because it's fantasticly well done, with a brilliant concept. Just be ready to bawl your eyes out. "

The story is no doubt the strongest point in the game, which is beautifully directed and covers emotion, love, humour and sadness of human life, in a very nice way, The characters in the game are very memorable . And the soundtrack is so wonderful and memorable, the music still plays inside my head and its very pleasant to hear it, again and again. Even the art is great, nothing to complain, even there were a few things like key customization which would been nice, but it didnt bother me, and can easily be ignored and This game is filled with so much emotion that I almost cried towards the end!  Overall this game is recommended for everyone, you just can't avoid this masterpiece, it would be a shame to do so.. ! 10/10.			"

During the ""Puzzles"" the game also registered me as double clicking quite a lot, which made me miss some of the ideal move numbers.The story is, in my opinion, absolutely brilliant and I will not hide the fact that I did cry towards the end. Its sad, but really sweet is all I can say without spoiling it.The music is also fantastic. I'm a sucker for piano pieces and the main theme and ""Everything's Alright"" are absolutely amazing...I gotta give the vocalist credit as she did a beautiful job. If you can, purchase the soundtrack. You won't regret it.Again, I highly, highly recommend this if you're looking for a good story, because it's fantasticly well done, with a brilliant concept. Just be ready to bawl your eyes out. "

												Such an amazing game! I am not into adventure games but this one dragged me into it. The script is one of the best i have ever seen and it fits with the soundtrack perfectly. The game succeeded to create the emotional bond with the player and after 45minutes of gameplay there is no turning back. You just want to see it happens next (or should i say before?)			"

Gameplay mechanics are simple, the music is beautiful, and the puzzles are balanced just enough to keep you interested.An absolute must play and worth every penny.			"

												This game is simply good. It has a story that makes you want to see it through. To The Moon isn't really a game tho. There are interactive bits, but they won't provide anything resembling a challenge. The music is beautiful and the plot makes you think of the people and things closest to you. I'm a bit late to this game, but I'm happy that i played it. I recommend it, if you like games with good stories rather than good graphics.			"

Short version: 96%To the Moon is an RPGMaker interactive movie that is… is…Just… just play it. Just buy it and play it. There should be nothing else said about. Just… play it.Long version:Don’t let the appearance fool you: To the Moon may have been created with RPG Maker XP, but it is an interactive movie through and through. Player input is minimal and it is restricted to walking around, examining things, and two minigames.The main theme of the story is memories. Memories of a lifetime, to be exact: you play as two scientists, whose job is to create an artificial set of memories for a dying old man, so he can reach happiness in his final moments.The memory exploration is twofold: on one hand, we are witnesses to key moments of the man’s life going backwards in time, slowly learning what choices and events led to his final decision.But the journey is also quite symbolic, even allegoric. All memories are tied to small mementos, and as the journey progresses, we learn how much importance a seemingly insignificant object can hold for someone… Something I’m sure all of us are familiar in our own lives.There are two minor problem with the game. Two smudges on this perfect gem. One is the overabundance of slapstick; its purpose is to have small emotional pauses in this story, but sometimes it is misused. The other is the obstacle-passing minigame towards the end that just feels completely out of place and nonsensical.Still, even with these, To the Moon is still probably the best indie game available on Steam. So… just buy it and play it.			"

MAN THE STORY, ALL DEEZ MANLY TEARS MAN...One thing tho: The controls are a bit wonky sometimes and at certain points you can't really see what or if something is blocking your path. Besides, searching clues without the help of a mouse would be a pain in the butt so I'd suggest playing with a mouse, you'll barely need a keyboard btw.			"

To the Moon is a game that truly has a heart to it. The music is fantastic and syncs very well with every moment of the story. The graphic style reminds me of the Super Nintendo era of jRPGs, the likes of Final Fantasy and Secret of Mana.But the game plays very differently from a RPG. It's sort of an interactive story, with some adventure and puzzle elements to it. It's not very long, which is not a criticism, given that the flow of the history is very good and it respects your time (not many ""fillers"" or wasted time on silly things).The history feels very personal and immersive. It can be very touching at times, going through the whole set of emotions (happy, sad, depressive, euphoric, funny). There are a few easter-egg-references to other games and pop/nerd culture in general. Even though they’re, for the most part, hit-or-miss, i think it’s a nice touch nonetheless.Definitely gets my recommendation.			"

												Background: dislike ""Nintendo RPG"" art, love point n clicks. Heard good things about the game.The Good:* Great sound and atmosphere for a game with such limited animation* Outstanding story with humour, sadness and joy* Fun but not difficult mini game puzzles* First rate dialogue with very natural characters and reactions* Superb use of memories in the latter parts* Characters have depth and there's surprising subtly included* Leaves you wanting more and lots of hints at unexplored concepts The Bad:* Bland but well crafted '8bit' art* Very clunky mouse movement and hit n miss hotspots* Clunky speech skipping that stopped working in chapter 3 for me* Short and little to no immediate replay value* Horse riding section is confusingly under explainedImpressions: Much like 'Gone Home' this is a story being unfolded as you move and click. It tugs the heartstrings and plays with your emotions but not in a cynical way that left me tearful and sorely impressed at how well delivered the story was. The high concept plot and natural dialogue raise the game well above it's underwhelming artwork and poor hotspot/movement detection and pathing.Recommended for: People with a heart and a soul for a well told story. Requires pixel hunting and plenty of reading.Conclusion: 8/10. Story of the year that will stay with you for a long time.			"

English Version: Given that I was not convinced about this game's quality, I wanted to try It, and I have to say that I understimated It because of its low price.Is a 2D adventure game with apparently very simple dynamics, but It has a lot to offer to the players. The protagonist, a man with the only wish of reaching the moon, seemingly inexplicable, is dying; so he asks over Doctoress Eva Rosalene and Neil Watts, who belong to the sigmund Agency of Life Generation, in the attempt of reaching his very last wish through artificially implanted memories. However, as the game progresses, the plot thickens and the introspection and the past of the poor elderly protagonist, Johnny Wyles, begins to excite the minds even colder.The graphics do not excell but they offer simple and different scenarios. The plot, at least to me, is very reminiscent of Inception (for those who saw it), even if we are talking about memories and not dreams. Johnny and his poor wife are deeply characterized, so much that the gamers are made aware about the wife's health condition, which is not so rare in today's reality. The soundtracks are very impressive, and in any case always suited to the circumstances in which they find themselves. The gameplay is very simple, but the depth of the story manages to entertain the gamer to everyone for the duration (albeit brief) of the game. Yes, the game, unfortunately, is short-lived, but nevertheless It's an experience recommended to all.Do not be fooled by the low price, as It previously happened to me: It's a MUST HAVE in your Steam LibraryItalian Version: Sono venuta in possesso di questo gioco grazie al consiglio di un amico, che già lo possedeva. Non convinta dell'eccellenza di tale titolo, ho voluto provarlo, e devo dire di averlo sottovalutato per via del prezzo basso. To the moon è un'avventura grafica in 2d che si presenta come un gioco dalle dinamiche molto semplici che tuttavia ha molto da offrire ai giocatori.  Il protagonista, un uomo con il solo scopo di raggiungere la luna, apparentemente inspiegabile, è in fin di vita; così convoca nella sua abitazione sopra una scogliera i dottor Eva Rosalene e Neil Watts, appartenenti alla Sigmund Agency Of Life Generation, intento a raggiungere il suo ultimo desiderio attraverso l'impianto di ricordi artificiali. Tuttavia, man mano che il gioco avanza, la trama si infittisce e l'introspezione ed il passato del povero anziano protagonista, Johnny Wyles, inizia ad emozionare anche le menti più fredde. La grafica, pur non eccellendo, offre scenari diversificati e semplici. La trama, almeno a me, ricorda molto Inception (per chi l'ha visto), anche se qui si parla di ricordi e non di sogni. La caratterizzazione di Jhonny e della sua povera moglie è ben approfondita, tanto da sensibilizzare la gente sulla condizione di quest'ultima, che non è così tanto rara nella realtà d'oggi. Le colonne sonore sono molto suggestive, ed in ogni caso sempre adatte al contesto nelle quali si trovano. Il gameplay è molto semplice, tuttavia la profondità della storia riesce ad intrattenere il videogiocatore allo schermo per tutta la durata (seppur breve) del gioco. Ebbene sì, il gioco, purtroppo, è poco longevo, ma tuttavia è un'esperienza consigliabile a tutti. Non fatevi ingannare dal prezzo basso, com'è successo a me, è un MUST HAVE in libreria.			"

												I was very ""reluctant"" to play this game because the control, resolution and other technical things...

Very simple tracks but very touching. I'm writing this while I'm listening the main theme of the game. I love it. +Characters  I dont want spoil nothing but you will love the main chars and the references that they make to movies, anime, series and more.+Story  This dont need explain. The big point of this game is this, so play it and discover what's hidden in this apparently simple game visual novel with rpgmaker graphics.-Resolution I didn't played this game before because of this. Play with that crappy resolution and that black borders it's very annoying and horrible.-ControlArrows to move? Seriously?... I can not do anything more except recommend you again to play this...

												This is not a game. It's an interactive story where clicking is required to progress from scene to scene and from dialog to dialog.  The fact that from times to times some ridiculously easy puzzles have to be solved in order to progress doesn't exactly make it a game. There's nothing challenging about it.Anyway, its best part is the story. It's a complex story that treats matters of life and death in such way that it gets to be felt quite close and personal. I completely don't recommend this to depressive people. I was on the verge of busting into tears several times throughout its duration. The story is great, very touching and impactful. It's hard to speak about it without spoiling it, but I guess I could say it somehow reminds of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the movie, but only in just a few aspects.Other than the story (but damn, what a story!...), there was nothing I liked about how ""To the moon"" presented itself to me. The soundtrack supports the story pretty well, it enhances the feelings that the story transmits, but it gets cheesy at points, near the end. Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome soundtrack that clearly shows the loads of work it required, but it's just not my type, I'm more into the Bastion-like soundtracks.Many people seem to have found the strength to tolerate the awful graphics, but I still can't ignore them. It's an ""RPG Maker""-like, uber low budget kind of graphics that ruined for me the immersiveness of the ""to the moon"" experience at points. Since the clicking and controlling was also quite imprecise, I think I would've even prefered a slideshow of still images instead of some of the scenes where just moving around was pretty annoying and tedious. It also lacks basic settings like sound volume controls, full screen / window mode toggling, screen resolution settings, all the basic stuff. At least it comes with steam cloud support and a pretty neat, single ""Steam achievement"".Anyway, I don't regret the money spent on it and the 3 hours and a half that it took me to finish it. It's a great experience. It's also, indeed, worthy of still being considered the saddest game of all. I submit to this general opinion as well.			"

												To the Moon is a indie adventure game designed and built in RPG Maker, though it is not actually an RPG in the traditional  sense it looks as if it is, though there is no combat (Except as a joke in one spot) and very little actual gameplay outside of the usual adventure game mechanics of talking to everyone and finding things in the environment.In To the Moon you play as two doctors who are employed by the Sigmund Corporation under a new wish fulfillment service that people may use as they are dying, it lets the doctors alter memories to help someone believe they fulfilled their life long dream, and as such they are called to the house of Johnny Wyles who's dying wish is to go to the moon, but he does not know why, so as the two doctors you must go through Johnny's memories and figure out why while also building things up for Johnny to become an astronaut.Now... I am leaving out key parts to the story here because I do not wish to spoil it but suffice it to say To the Moon may have one of the best stories I have ever come into contact with in a video game, it is beautifully written to the point that I was in tears multiple times while playing it, despite how it looks graphically the writing shines through and delivers powerful emotions that tug at your heartstrings.Although it may seem a bit short, clocking in at about four to five hours long, less if you know exactly what to do, it is well worth it, an amazing experience from top to bottom, polished with very little flaws outside of repeating the same sliding puzzle every time you jump memories.And on a side note the soundtrack is totally worth it, the musical score is memorable to the point that after you finish the game, even just the music will bring back memories of the story, all in all a must play for anyone who cares about an amazing story in a video game.

												Beautiful, emotional storytelling. It's a story first, and a point and click game second. The game is simply the medium. It's funny, serious, dark and hopeful all at once. A simple concept experienced masterfully, games don't normally affect me but this one struck a chord. The soundtrack is only a couple of very basic tracks, but it is hauntingly beautiful, and deserving of the pickup. In many ways, this game is like a movie experience with the added benefit of your own input and interaction. Visually, it's retro look gives it charm, and it's impressive how much emotion can be conveyed with pixelated animation. You take the role of a pair of specialists who enter peoples memories, specifically dying people, to generate an experience from them that they express as a dying wish. In a style reminiscent of Inception they dive into the life of John, to fulfill his wish to go To The Moon. They have great chemistry, with fantastic pop culture references and lots of one liners. The story they discover is touched with meaning and emotion. I can't say what makes this game so great without revealing anything that happens, but it brought me to bittersweet tears.I bought this on a whim, a whim I now very greatful for. It's a truly enriching game, and it will make you cry.			"

												It is rare that I come across a game so charming and with such a stellar story; To The Moon is both excellently written and superbly executed, and I feel like the events of this game will stay with me for years to come.Being a huge fan of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I purchased this game simply because of the parallels I had heard about, and I was not disappointed. As I played, every new discovery left me compelled to uncover more and to find out about the old man's life. At times the dialogue can be a bit silly, but it's much needed comedic relief within a setting that otherwise jumps from tearjerking to heartwarming.The gamplay is extremely basic, and whilst it is more present than any gameplay in Gone Home, for example, I would still put this in the ""interactive novel"" genre as at its core it is simply a story you are uncovering. There are occasionally small puzzles to jump between memories, but I personally found that these became tedious fast and I feel the game would be better without. They do, however, add a little more pacing to the plot and give you some time to think about what you may find next.To The Moon is definitely worth buying, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by such a rollercoaster ride. I am extremely excited to see what Freebird release next!			"

												I had a very emotional reaction. It seems like I wasn't alone. I learned something about myself. And in some ways it helped me deal with some trauma from my past. Would I, laying on my deathbed wish to erase trauma from my past? Knowing that before these thoughts pass through my head I would forget everything that really did happen? I have no idea. I used to think, of course I would. If I could think that I went to the moon. Even if I didn't. Sure I would. But, after beating the game. Although I helped Johnny fulfill his wish. I feel a bit empty. I'd love to go into why I feel empty. But I think I'd be treading upon spoilers. This is a game about a story. Not a game about gameplay. Not a game about competition. This is a game about a story. An experience. Even though I bought this game for only $1.99 I would, and probably will buy it for $9.99 for a friend. I feel like everyone should have the option of experiencing a story as moving as this. This is games as art.			"

												The sticking point for To The Moon is whether or not you would pay thirteen dollars for a movie and its soundtrack.I say this because To the Moon's gameplay has nothing to recommend itself by. There are some puzzles and one segment featuring particularly game-like mechanics, which is much more than something like Dear Esther could say for itself, but it's not far removed from walking simulators. And, ultimately, you can't fail directly. It is also short. I blasted through the game in roughly four hours, though Steam reports less than that compared to my clock estimate.If on consideration you feel these are not issues that dissuade you, you'll certainly get your money's worth from the story, which had me engaged fully about ten minutes in and halfway through had me suddenly mentally revisiting everything I'd seen up to that point, looking at details I had no reason to appreciate before. I will keep maximally mum about anything more. I can't even speak for some of the topics it handles deflty since they would constitute spoilers in and of themselves.Additional sticking points:- There are no options. Not even for resolution, which resulted in harsh letterboxing for me. - It's a sentimental tale, and if you've no stomach for that you'll probably have buyer's remorse.- You'll want the soundtrack. It will not be negotiable.At sale price I've seen To The Moon go for -70%, so $2.99 U.S., without any special daily discount further driving down the price. With soundtrack it was $3.74, and for that price I think it's definitely worth it for anyone.			"

												I have trouble discussing To the Moon. It's not that there's nothing to talk about, actually it's the opposite. The problem is that basically there are spoilers everywhere. I'm gonna tread very carefully. The game is about two doctors: Neil Watts, and Eva Rosalene. However, they are not medical doctors. Their job is to visit the dying, and use special technology to alter their memories to include their final, last wish so they can die happy. Their patient is Johnny Wyles, an elderly man who wants to go to the moon. Here's the kicker, he doesn't know why. Understanding the motivation for a dream is essential in altering the memories for the person owning said dream. This is so fitting the memory in the person's life becomes much simpler. I'm not gonna go an inch farther in terms of discussing the story, it's for your own good. The gameplay is hardly there, it's pretty much a full on visual novel. However, traversing Wyles' memories involves picking up memory links that let the two doctors piece what they know together. You travel back connecting the memory links with a certain memento per memory period. You then complete a very simple puzzle to add in a little bit of player input. But overall you are really just watching a movie. Because I'm choosing to talk about almost nothing, I'm gonna have to cut this short. This game has made a reputation for itself as the home of genuine feels, and I agree. Not only is this game funny, but it is also serious and realistic. This has been said many times before, but it makes my point, ""You don't need polygons to make people."" And that is true. It's been a long time since I genuinely cared about the characters I'm controlling and learning about. If you're not convinced, I beg you, I IMPLORE you, please risk a few dollars to get this game. It's worth a risk.			"

But look pass that because behind all this is a great story (it's a love story) with terrific writing and even better music (can't stress enough how good it is).

												To The Moon is simply one of the best story based games ive played in my entire life.A game that went under the radar for many people, developed by a small studio called Freebird Games, To The Moon is an incredible and heart breaking experience, as it will bring the manliest of men to there knees in tears.In short, its about 2 Doctors traveling through the memories of a dying man to fulfill his final wish, there isnt too much I can give away without ruining some part of the story, so hear this, play this game, buy it and play it, this game is simply incredible.This game was an emotional rollercoaster for me and many others who played this game, as you tie bits and pieces of the story together as you progress, you feel youself becoming weaker and more emotional as realisation sets in and you learn how sad the life of this old man really is.The game consists only of clicking around with your mouse, as there is no action, no fighting and no enemies to face, this may seem as a turn off for many, but in reality it is just a better way to immerse yourself in the game and its story, it simply couldnt be represented in a better way.From the outstanding soundtrack, spectacular story and the brilliant dialogue that this game delivers, its simply a masterpiece, and all that in around 3-4 hours of gameplay.9/10I can see why many people will and have enjoyed this game, but can also see why others may not.

 To The Moon  is a truly beautiful game. It's very essence screams with emotion and you find yourself screaming with it. This game is the kind of game you sit down expecting to try for half an hour at 11:00 at night and find yourself still playing sometime the next morning. It's story proves engaging and litterally enthralls you as you become the game's minion. Entrusting you with simple tasks,  To The Moon  requires one to search in reverse chronological order small memories of a dying man in an attempt to convince a younger reflection of himself to follow a certain path in life, motivating him to fulfill his own death wish. As should be plain as daylight, untrained professionals such as us are provided with every opprotunity by Freebird Games to come in conact, learn about, and fall in love with the characters as we travel backwards through a man's most intimate and poignant moments of living. You spend hours caught up in this man's life, almost understanding him as well as he does himself, and that's where you find you've actually spent hours getting caught up in a magnificent and chancy trap: You slowly realize it as the story progresses, I will not reaveal it here, but you do inwardly question this dying man as you roam his thoughts. It even talks about a topic that is not quite well addressed in media and especially in games, and that is commendable in and of itself. Mental illnesses require the attention of close loved ones. This game explores the ""whens"" and ""wheres"" of unconditional love and just how significant it is in the lives of others. The entire time you are investing in a one-way friendship with this man, you are accompanied by a moving, extremely well crafted soundtrack he soundtrack is so fantastic it makes one wish they could either play, pick up again, or practice these songs on the piano. A mix between simplicity and complexity that complements the story line and the artstyle; everything comes together so thoroughly. If one were looking only for music, this game shines as brightly as any lighthouse. Now, in a sea of drama, the pair of scientists one guides through the memories provide comedic relief and this is where I could see where we lost a portion of the (at the time of writing) 440 out of 16010 people who did not recomend this game and that number could have been cut if there had been the following warning: the characters you play will bicker like siblings and they are present to cut tension. If they were not there, the story would be too heavy to handle. I enjoyed their presence and I laughed out loud a number of times as they allowed the developers over at Freebird to show their humor in a creative way. Actually, I find them reminiscent of certain characters Shakespeare would include in his works (i.e. the Porter in Macbeth) in order to plant some kind of restraint in an otherwise constant flow of deep and taxing storytelling. Please do not let yourself be unwilling to play this game because of them. My only personal complaint are the controls. I will say that this game is a point and click interactive story that one should use the arrow keys and enter/space bar for. I found the point and click clunky and not always accurate. I lost nothing in using the arrow keys, though, so it does work. Also, I found there to be too much delay in the memento puzzles for the amount of computing it should take. That did not detract much either as I was too busy figuring out moves anyway. That's it. The end of my complaints. ""Use the arrow keys and I thought they could have cleaned up the programming for the puzzles. Otherwise, job well done. Fantastic story. Fantatstic sound track. Interesting art. 15571/16011 would play again."" Thank you for your time.			"

												To the Moon is a indie adventure game designed and built in RPG Maker, though it is not actually an RPG in the traditional  sense it looks as if it is, though there is no combat (Except as a joke in one spot) and very little actual gameplay outside of the usual adventure game mechanics of talking to everyone and finding things in the environment.In To the Moon you play as two doctors who are employed by the Sigmund Corporation under a new wish fulfillment service that people may use as they are dying, it lets the doctors alter memories to help someone believe they fulfilled their life long dream, and as such they are called to the house of Johnny Wyles who's dying wish is to go to the moon, but he does not know why, so as the two doctors you must go through Johnny's memories and figure out why while also building things up for Johnny to become an astronaut.Now... I am leaving out key parts to the story here because I do not wish to spoil it but suffice it to say To the Moon may have one of the best stories I have ever come into contact with in a video game, it is beautifully written to the point that I was in tears multiple times while playing it, despite how it looks graphically the writing shines through and delivers powerful emotions that tug at your heartstrings.Although it may seem a bit short, clocking in at about four to five hours long, less if you know exactly what to do, it is well worth it, an amazing experience from top to bottom, polished with very little flaws outside of repeating the same sliding puzzle every time you jump memories.And on a side note the soundtrack is totally worth it, the musical score is memorable to the point that after you finish the game, even just the music will bring back memories of the story, all in all a must play for anyone who cares about an amazing story in a video game.

A Paladin’s Steam Review: To The Moon. A Lot of Feels Story, not a Lot of Gameplay.Genre: Sci-Fi Adventure Comedy/Tragedy Story Driven Experience. Developed & Published by: Freebird GamesPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux.Business Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Story Thoughts & Gameplay MechanicsThe story is about two doctors who provide a service to people on their deathbeds. This service they perform is where they go into the person’s memories and change events in their head so that it concludes how they would prefer. The game is focused on one such patient and uncovering pieces of his past. There’s some interesting subjects brought up in the game, about life and death. About the moral and philosophical questions brought up about what these two are doing and the actions with regards to the patient. That being said, I feel like this is a game best experienced by yourself. It's not a story I really want to get into or dissect, as I feel that takes away from the experience. I won't deny that this is a bit of a cop-out but at the same time, that's why I don't usually cover titles like To the Moon all that often. I find them difficult to cover. The gameplay amounts to you finding certain important items on the level and advancing the story along. There’s not a lot that you, the player, can do when it comes to this game. A lot of the game expects to be watched and read, so there’s not much variance to the experience worth nothing. I get that narrative-driven games are like this, but, it’s getting more and more tiresome. PC SettingsSettings for this game are extremely lacking. No resolution options (it runs in a 640x480 resolution), v-sync option is hidden away in the game properties menu which is only accessible by pressing F1 in-game (not something that’s made immediately clear I might add). Keybindings can be changed for both controller and mouse + keyboard though. There are separate volume sliders as well. The graphics are a 2D pixelated affair, with a top-down jRPG-like camera angle. Music is an instrumental affair with a lot of solo piano and strings. It works well to create a morose sort of weight to the game. Side note: the free DLC story that comes with To the Moon doesn't play on anything but Windows. It's ok, a nice little freebie. Final ThoughtsTo the Moon is pretty good. The story certainly has its feels and the game is laser focused on telling a tight story. I’ll give them credit that despite being a passive observer for the majority of it, they clearly knew what they wanted to tell. It’s not an entirely passive affair but the most you’ll end up doing is finding items to advance the plot along, moving around rooms and talking with people. There’s some interesting philosophical and ethical questions about death that are brought up as well. Other than that, what’s left to say...Read the review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												Regret. Indecision. Joy. Sorrow. Indignation. Anger. Helplessness. To The Moon can and will unrelentingly tug at your heartstrings. It will bring you to the fullest extent of each and every single emotion listed, woven together by the most hauntingly beautiful piano music in the background.The graphics, though simple, will form images that will stay in your mind - and heart - for a very long time. The story seems simple but goes to so many complex details as the game unfolds them delicately, just at the right moments. I enjoyed every bit of it, from the tear-inducing plot (so much onions) to the little bits of comic banter, whether in exploring Johnny's world or playing the occasional mini-game.I must concede that the *only* flaw is that there's little replayability value; after all, it is a story-game. But what you get in the 4-5 hours of completing is a wonderful and emotional experience that forces you to look deep inside you. What do you want most in life? What would you pay for it? From thoughts on society and legal obligations, to forced self-reflection on your own goals and dreams, this game has it all.In summary, do I recommend it? I cannot assent more wholeheartedly - it's the first game that affected me so much that I actually just *had* to write this review. I had received this as part of a bundle; but on hindsight, I would have been willing to pay full price. You have to get it on sale, or grab whichever bundle it appears in. Because it's just that good. Add to cart, process, install and grab a good pair of headphones for an amazingly immersive experience.			"

												Don't judge a game by it's cover. Or in this case, it's engine. You might think that a game made in RPG Maker isn't worth your time. Well, in this case you're wrong. Or at least that depends what you're looking for.'To the Moon' does a lot of things right, but most important and memorable it its writing and atmosphere. Long story short, the game is about exploring a dying man's memories to grant him a final wish. What you get is an emotional ride with both ups and downs, mostly the latter.

The game has no sort of choice-and-consequence system, no fighting (except for one battle, but I won't spoil that!) or nothing that would make this rank as an RPG. The game will always be the same, so there's not much replay value to it.So if you're looking for a game with a great story to invest a few hours into, look no further.

												Do you find yourself with an abnormal lack of the feels? Then this game is just for you, as it's jam packed with so many feels! The soundtrack ALONE contains about a third of the feels, and even though there is minimal gameplay, it actually serves a purpose, in that it will not hinder you from locating each and every one of the feels this game contains!Buy your copy today and get your feels on! 8D			"

												This game is like the book I never wanted to put down. The thoughtful story complimented beautifully with an emotional soundtrack kept me going in a non-stop session as I just fell in love with this game. It only took as long as it did for me because I was taking pause to dance around the room to the theme. More than once I cried. And at a certain part (once you play you'll know which part) I cursed in indignance. This game connected to me by doing more than simply engaging me. This game is a treasure.			"

A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY TALEShort Review:Do not be fooled by the mundane name of the game, i wouldnt call it a game, rather a surreal expeience that kept me awake,thinking and i finished the game in 1 go.  The Story is has a very tight and neatly conceptualized plot(executed very well,may i add) that guides the game to a smooth victorious and beautiful finish. The attention to the small things in the plot is what makes it even more convincing. The main characters Eva and Neil have great chem together,loved the emotional rollercoaster that pans out through the game, the gameplay is fairly linear, but then again it was'nt meant to tense you out.The music is fairly repeatitive but its worth listening to.In the End,all i have to say is,while some of us rarely get time to play games,and hence we become really picky about the ones we spend time on, Let me tell you, THIS IS WELL WORTH YOUR TIME.Free DLCs tooo....yay. 12/10Here's to hoping this becomes the script for Inception 2.0 :)			"

												I had been putting off playing this game for the longest time now, even with all the recommendations I had gotten from known people, needless to say, I understand why they wanted me to play it so bad now. The characters feel real and you can actually relate to them; even though the story itself starts of very scrambled and might confuse you, don't fret, keep going, it will all make sense, reminded me a bit of the move ""Memento"". As a last word so I don't spoil anything, this game is an emotional roller coaster, taking you through it all, nothing had made me feel so much since I finished my favorite book of all time, and that was 4 years ago. Definitely worth a abuy and most definitely worth your time, you will NOT be dissapaointed at all.			"

												To the Moon is one of the most touching games I've played in years. With such a wonderfully written storyline riddled with humerous and nostalgic references alike, TtM really shines with it's interpretation of memories. When I played the first few moments I expected an interesting Sci-Fi interpretation of how the mind works, which was delivered promptly, but I hadn't expected how utterly mind-blowing of a level it would reveal itself to land on. Flawlessly implementing emotional story-telling, point-and-click gameplay, and an ocean of character progression, TtM leaves you on the edge of your seat, yearning for the next act of the three installments. I haven't felt the pressure of tears behind my eyes as a result from a game since Kingdom Hearts and Shadow of the Colossus were released in 2002 and 2005 respectively. Had this game been released during my preadolescence, it would've been just as impacting on my development as those two games were. In all honesty, even at this stage of my life, I found this game to be rather impacting, as well as eye opening on many levels.To the Moon is a game I'd recommend for all ages, as a casual point-and-click story driven adventure RPG, it has so much to offer to every generation. Undoubtedly worth the extra 'dough' for the heart-string-pulling soundtrack as well, especially considering that 50% of the bandcamp proceeds go towards charities.10/10, will play again.			"

												To The Moon is simply one of the best story based games ive played in my entire life.A game that went under the radar for many people, developed by a small studio called Freebird Games, To The Moon is an incredible and heart breaking experience, as it will bring the manliest of men to there knees in tears.In short, its about 2 Doctors traveling through the memories of a dying man to fulfill his final wish, there isnt too much I can give away without ruining some part of the story, so hear this, play this game, buy it and play it, this game is simply incredible.This game was an emotional rollercoaster for me and many others who played this game, as you tie bits and pieces of the story together as you progress, you feel youself becoming weaker and more emotional as realisation sets in and you learn how sad the life of this old man really is.The game consists only of clicking around with your mouse, as there is no action, no fighting and no enemies to face, this may seem as a turn off for many, but in reality it is just a better way to immerse yourself in the game and its story, it simply couldnt be represented in a better way.From the outstanding soundtrack, spectacular story and the brilliant dialogue that this game delivers, its simply a masterpiece, and all that in around 3-4 hours of gameplay.9/10I can see why many people will and have enjoyed this game, but can also see why others may not.

 To The Moon  is a truly beautiful game. It's very essence screams with emotion and you find yourself screaming with it. This game is the kind of game you sit down expecting to try for half an hour at 11:00 at night and find yourself still playing sometime the next morning. It's story proves engaging and litterally enthralls you as you become the game's minion. Entrusting you with simple tasks,  To The Moon  requires one to search in reverse chronological order small memories of a dying man in an attempt to convince a younger reflection of himself to follow a certain path in life, motivating him to fulfill his own death wish. As should be plain as daylight, untrained professionals such as us are provided with every opprotunity by Freebird Games to come in conact, learn about, and fall in love with the characters as we travel backwards through a man's most intimate and poignant moments of living. You spend hours caught up in this man's life, almost understanding him as well as he does himself, and that's where you find you've actually spent hours getting caught up in a magnificent and chancy trap: You slowly realize it as the story progresses, I will not reaveal it here, but you do inwardly question this dying man as you roam his thoughts. It even talks about a topic that is not quite well addressed in media and especially in games, and that is commendable in and of itself. Mental illnesses require the attention of close loved ones. This game explores the ""whens"" and ""wheres"" of unconditional love and just how significant it is in the lives of others. The entire time you are investing in a one-way friendship with this man, you are accompanied by a moving, extremely well crafted soundtrack he soundtrack is so fantastic it makes one wish they could either play, pick up again, or practice these songs on the piano. A mix between simplicity and complexity that complements the story line and the artstyle; everything comes together so thoroughly. If one were looking only for music, this game shines as brightly as any lighthouse. Now, in a sea of drama, the pair of scientists one guides through the memories provide comedic relief and this is where I could see where we lost a portion of the (at the time of writing) 440 out of 16010 people who did not recomend this game and that number could have been cut if there had been the following warning: the characters you play will bicker like siblings and they are present to cut tension. If they were not there, the story would be too heavy to handle. I enjoyed their presence and I laughed out loud a number of times as they allowed the developers over at Freebird to show their humor in a creative way. Actually, I find them reminiscent of certain characters Shakespeare would include in his works (i.e. the Porter in Macbeth) in order to plant some kind of restraint in an otherwise constant flow of deep and taxing storytelling. Please do not let yourself be unwilling to play this game because of them. My only personal complaint are the controls. I will say that this game is a point and click interactive story that one should use the arrow keys and enter/space bar for. I found the point and click clunky and not always accurate. I lost nothing in using the arrow keys, though, so it does work. Also, I found there to be too much delay in the memento puzzles for the amount of computing it should take. That did not detract much either as I was too busy figuring out moves anyway. That's it. The end of my complaints. ""Use the arrow keys and I thought they could have cleaned up the programming for the puzzles. Otherwise, job well done. Fantastic story. Fantatstic sound track. Interesting art. 15571/16011 would play again."" Thank you for your time.			"

												""I'm too manly for this."" -Dr. Neil WattsI usually don't write reviews, but for this game I feel like I must. (Sorry for my English, not my main language)My story is that I was searching for games with easy 100% achievements (Yeah, I'm sort of an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥) and I found this game... Boy, what a game. It had almost everything: The visuals were appealing, the characters were pretty nice, and I got really interested in their stories, the story progression is fantastic, I literally didn't see some of the stuff coming, regarding the events that lead up to the ending which was a little bit predictable and the soundtrack is spot on. A little something that not everyone is a fan of has to be the lack of action; this is a ""Point and Click"" game, so it may not have the best gameplay in the world, heck, even I found it a little bit grindy or boring in the first half hour, but I'm getting used to that since I've been playing more games like that lately. But in my opinion, the things mentioned before makes up for it. The game is a little bit short, but the feels stay...In conclusion, I'd say this game is completely worth your money, and it's even better on a sale, it gets pretty well discounted. I rate it 5 jars of olives out of 5 jars of olives			"

However after playing the game you realise that you have to give the character a fake reality to give him his wish. A sad truth of the game. Some points I thought were a little confusing though, because I still don't know the illness mentioned. This is a great way to show though that one slight difference can completely change a person's life.			"

												If you're looking for a really nice story and are fond of RPGs, you can't go wrong with To The Moon. At a glance, it seems like any old RPG which attempts to fabricate emotion and heart. Yet, To The Moon is without a doubt so much more. A true masterpiece, in my opinion; for it succeeds in using gaming not as a means of the mindless, repetive experiences we all know and love but instead a medium to portray a story. A beautiful one, at that.			"

												To The Moon genuinely hits a high mark; It's truly got one of the most interesting stories that I've ever sat through in video games ever.You play as two doctors Eva and Watts who are traversing through the memories of a dying patient who's final wish is to go to the moon. I won't reveal any more to the plot because it's much better you sit through the events of the story yourself. It's tearjerking; everyone's review that says this truly means it. I didn't understand the story fully the first time mostly out of the fact that I didn't exactly understand the side-effects of some medical conditions mentioned throughout the game, Google anything you're unfamiliar with; it'll help you out, but after the 2nd time it finally made sense, and when you DO understand every piece of the story, it just hurts in a satisfying, remorseful way. There's no easy way to put it; if you don't feel ANYTHING at the end of the gorgeous ride the game takes you through, you're unbelievably heartless.If stories that certainly make you appreciate life and not take it for granted, and a hint of science fiction is your cup of tea, To The Moon does anything but disappoint. The piano-arranged soundtrack is stunning; I still find myself humming the themes 3-years later, the 16-bit graphics are nice, and the mini-puzzles inbetween are a lovely touch to keep you going. I'm super excited for Kan Gao's next installment to the series 'Finding Paradise' later this year, but for now I will continue to love this game to no end.Thanks, Kan.			"

												Very poetic , a bit Donnie Darko-esque and even though it's highly predictable, I still enjoyed it a lot. The graphics are okay, the piano music is nice but I specially liked the main characters - the 2 agents - and their dialogues. The game lasted 6 hours and has a bonus episode that you launch from the games folders. The bonus features a return of the main characters and a very realistic insight of what would happen if what is depicted in this game is possible one day...			"

												To the Moon is not really a game, but more like... interactive fiction. The two Docs are helping this old man who said he wanted to go to the moon, but he can't remember why. By going back in his memory and hopefully by stitching it back together in a certain way, they can reweave the memory to allow the mind to fill in the details, thus allowing the patient to die with a sense of fulfillment rather than regret. Except the Doctors have met their match... as there are some secrets that this man is hiding... and they must search through the catacombs of his memories to locate the clues... Don't let the cute 2D graphics that resemble Japanese console RPG turn you off. This game is MUCH deeper than that. They simply chose to spend the developement time on the story rather than hiring artists to do bazillion illustrations. At its heart, its a love story, about broken promises, unfilfilled wishes and potentials, and about taking chances, and how one encounter can change a life. It is a short game, and you should have no problem finishing it in a few hours. And you may be shedding a few tears at the end.			"

												Full disclosure: this isn't as much of a ""game"" as it is an interactive story; think Ace Attorney or Analogue: A Hate Story. Or Final Fantasy IV. (ZING) So while there are a few mini-games, To The Moon doesn't require your senses of strategy or customization like the 90's-era JRPG's it's designed in the style of. What is DOES require is simply four continuous hours and a box of tissues.To The Moon has a beautifully crafted story. Look no further if you're looking from something that can switch to heartfelt to depressing to shocking to laugh-out-loud hilarious at the drop of a hat. Or several hats, rather.And the story is greatly helped by the fact that the writing is excellent. From John & River's love story told in reverse, to the banter between Doctors Watts & Rosalene, everything simply feels natural. The subtle references to Doctor Who and How I Met Your Mother are the icing on the cake.I was going to put something else - largely to wrap this up - but whatever. Just go play it. (I was serious about the ""four continuous hours"" thing, though. This is the type of game that's meant to be played in one sitting.)Oh, and the music is great too.			"

It's simply amazing and I'd highly recommend everybody that come across this game to buy it. It definitely worth the money. No actually, the game itself worth more than how much it cost. Why? Because it's a shining, sparkling golden game. If I have to come up with one word for this game, it'll be ""Beautiful"". That very one word describe the game to its smallest detail. From scenery to gameplay, each part will consumes you into wanting to play more. Definitely a 10/10. But in my definition, it's 100/10, so seriously. Go buy it you dingus, you're missing out :-)			"

												To The Moon was a heartbreaking game to see through to the end; and contrary to how that statement immediately comes across, I am not referring in any way to the emotion of the story.To The Moon is a Point & Click, narrative driven adventure game where you delve through the memories of a dying man to make his final wish come true. As far as the story goes that’s is all I will say because this games story is an absolute masterpiece to behold for any first time players. However, the way the story plays out is what has me so heartbroken about this title.I had this game in my library for at least a year before I ever even booted it up, and even after first starting I really didn't get sucked in. If anything I was lost and uninterested. It may take you a few hours but please, I beg of you, pick this game up and truly see it through until the end. It is hard to get into, I know. The first 30-45 minutes are pretty convoluted and bland, but I think everyone should experience the beauty of the narrative that forms by the end of the game. To The Moon may be short and lack in any replayability, but it is a masterpiece in its own right and deserves your attention.			"

												This game deserves nothing below a 9, that's the lowest that you can go for a game like this. This game is so well formed, the plot, the characters, how they develop and connect. Given the aesthetic setting, you might assume it's a silly indie game or something that might touch upon deeper emotions and matters without actually going the whole way, deeper and exploring the story completely. However the writers for this game clearly worked very hard on this, with so many connections that it's only up the the player's intellect to actually connect them and evaluate them on a personal level. This game does not force you to do anything, it plays smoothly without anything for the player to worry about missing. Just playthrough and enjoy the game. And if you've paid enough attention, then deeper meaning will be revealed and the greater your appreciation will be for the writing. The game has a few interesting and entertaining moments of comic relief (and believe me, you will need them) and fun cultural references. The timing, presentation and music really manage to hit the right chords.This is a genuinely good game, suitable for everyone to enjoy. Each person will have a slightly different experience but even if you've understood the absolute minimum, it's still a grand game worth remembering when comparing to other future contenders who dare set foot in this very challenging genre.

												If you're looking for a really nice story and are fond of RPGs, you can't go wrong with To The Moon. At a glance, it seems like any old RPG which attempts to fabricate emotion and heart. Yet, To The Moon is without a doubt so much more. A true masterpiece, in my opinion; for it succeeds in using gaming not as a means of the mindless, repetive experiences we all know and love but instead a medium to portray a story. A beautiful one, at that.			"

												Only minor technical issues. Lowres assets (640x480), main menu cursor hover detection is bit wonky, no windowed fullscreen (makes writing a review difficult when each alt-tab takes a couple of seconds), Options menu with F1 - had to figure that out. Sometimes the music is freaking loud compared to the sound effects. Taking screenshots difficult, because no Steam Overlay. External tool gives mostly white frame, needs cutting.Minor tedium sometimes in that you can't click-hold to move, combined with the fact that while left and right image edge is sharp, top and bottom are faded out.Had a little difficulty in one glitchy scene figuring out what to do (had to consult the forums). Might just have been the reloading that eventually made it work; not sure.Unskippable launch sequence, but in this game I can understand it's intended to quickly get you back into the mood of the game. And the game is short enough that this won't be a bother.The frequently reoccuring minigame introduces a little change to the gameplay, probably made to give some more interaction, even if it's a cheap trick for gving a rewarding feeling when the story itself isn't sufficient. (It would have been though. And finding the pieces for the memento is no challenge anyway.)It's OK though. You're basically executing the protagonists' job, and that's not just all-awesome, but also involves routine. This makes the experience more immersive.At first, I was worried the RPG-Makeresque character art style would interfere with the serious style of the story, but that turned out to be no problem. Didn't even need getting used to. (Probably because the character art style is consistently the same throughout the game.)The story has depth and several more and less philosophical aspects worthy of pondering on. Generally not an entirely original theme, but unique in detail. I actually find the writing quite mature and natural. Whatever people complain about in reviews regarding the writing, it must be specifically personal distaste.There might be details to the story though that are worth examining for plot holes. And there's a certain more or less surprising twist that was almost ignored by the story progression, which left me a little confused.If you appreciate beautiful and touching as well as skillful storytelling and would like to experience it with minimal energy investment needed (I myself wasn't very motivated or energetic when playing it, but I'm usually quite thoughtful), then it's definitely a recommendation. Better than watching it as a four-hours movie would have been. In game format, you can occasionally drift off into your own thoughts without freezing the pace, and dialogue speed is in your control, too. So a game is a nice format for this kind of story.The mini-episode DLCs are as thoughtful and entertaining as the main story.P.S.: This game is unsatisfying for achievement-hunters, yet very satisfying for completionists. ;-)UPDATE: After seeing a screenshot on the shop page that I didn't encounter during my playthrough, I realize I should probably try a second one with choosing the other character of the duo. It's a nice touch that you can give at least parts of the playthrough a somewhat more drama or comedy spin based on choices you make. It's not fully linear.			"

												To be clear, this game has a pretty small amount of classic gameplay. You explore and experience a story. It's not walking-simulator tier, but it's entirely focused on the story it wishes to tell, rather than the gameplay aspect.However, the story itself is awesome. Such a great way to spend around four hours. Few places can you get such a concise and well delivered story, with a strong soundtrack to back its heart. You will find yourself able to recall songs in the soundtrack even after only playing for around four hours, that's a very good thing. Memorable and enjoyable soundtracks are something I love in games.Extremely well worth the money. This gives you so much more than watching a great movie, while costing a fraction of the price. Characters are well developed and each have their own personality that are enjoyable to watch. I'm pre-emptively trying to find the sequel that has just been announced so I can wishlist it. There's an overarching storyline that connects the two main scientists to the next game, as they work on multiple ""patients"", this game covers a single patient's story. So in future sequels, we'll get to see a continuation of the development of these characters. I just love that! You don't see direct connections like that often.Only gripes are that the sprite grid is a bit too large, like your position is very here-or-there, you can't always position yourself exactly where you want to be easily. Also, in a couple of places I have to switch from using a controller to a mouse because the controller wasn't able to do what I was required to do. Should support all control schemes (especially in simple setups.)Definitely recommended. A character-focused adventure that just about anyone can relate to and enjoy.			"

												It's hard to describe how much I love To the Moon. I say love, and not ""loved"" because it's one of those games that will stick with me forever. I've never experienced a game that made me feel so sentimental. While it doesn't have much as far as gameplay is concerned, To the Moon more than makes up for it in its intriguing and heartfelt narrative. It intertwines humor and heartfelt drama under a veil of mystery--keeping the player hooked from start to finish. I'm amazed at what this game achieves. If you're looking for in-depth gameplay and top-notch graphics then this probably isn't what you're looking for. However, if you enjoy great storytelling, character development and a soundtrack worth buying and listening to hours after the game ends, then you've come to the right place. Though it's rather short, I loved every second of it and still do not regret spending the money on it. This is the only game I've played on Steam I would urge buying at full price. This is because the creator needs money to support his art of game-making, and seriously, the guy is good.			"

												Do not mistake this for a game. It isn't. The elements that have pretensions to being gameplay are linear in the extreme, and very simple to ""solve"".Do not mistake the lack of gameplay for a lack of merit. To The Moon is an excellent work, which I wholeheartedly recommend. The particulars might not fall into everyone's tastes, but the concept and execution are sufficiently good that it at least deserves a try.Still. There are a few notable flaws. Firstly, the pretensions to gameplay can be mildly distracting, more so the less adept one is at solving the minor puzzles. Secondly, certain parts of the dialogue are highly - and needlessly - intertextually referential, despite this intertextuality having almost no real merit for the larger narrative. Thirdly, the basic point-and-click system used for most of the game is clunky, and may disrupt the pacing of the narrative.A sincere recommendation of an excellent - but not masterful - work.			"

												What do you do when you want to tell an immersive story via the medium of computer games, but you don't know how to program?Kan Gao decided that that was no problem at all and just used RPGMaker. That explains the retro JRPG look of ""To the Moon"", which (WARNING!) is not actually a game. It's really more of an interactive story (and a rather short one at that, with 3 - 5 hours of play time).""To the Moon"" is set 20 minutes into the future where it is possible to change dying people's memories so that they can make the things ""happen"" that they wish they had done in their lifetime.The technicians Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts make these wishes come true. Their latest client, Johnny, has a peculiar goal: He wants to go to the moon. He cannot remember where this desire came from, but he definitely wants to go.As the technicians dive into Johnny's memories, more and more questions arise and mysteries need to be unravelled. I'd rather not spoil the plot to you by telling more - discovering things and figuring out the answers from the clues presented is half the enjoyment here.When I first noticed that this was not a ""real"" game some way into ""To the Moon"", it annoyed me a bit since it had not been said on the box. What won me back is that the story we're told is quite touching and rewarding. I dare you to not care about Johnny, Eva and Neil by the end of events! To keep everything in memory (and for ultimate impact on ""the feels""), it's best played in one sitting, like, say, one rainy afternoon. And do keep a box of tissues and a bottle of water close by, you might need them.(Also, the music is fantastic. The whole soundtrack can be found on Bandcamp under http://freebirdgames.bandcamp.com/album/to-the-moon-ost - give the main theme a try.)			"

												To the Moon tells us a wonderfully written, captivating and touching story of life, death and of a very simple - yet the greatest - thing, called: love. The game does this so beautifully that you are guaranteed to cry many times throughout the course of the events. It's the triumph of storytelling that a game built on an ancient japanese rpg engine (first used by Dragon Quest), with text-only dialogue and without any complex puzzles whatsoever can offer such a deep experience. Because contrary what the engine would suggest, To the Moon is an adventure game and could be best compared to a wonderfully good book.The main concept of the game can be a bit untempting (at least it was for me, even though I do love sci-fi). In the near future people on their deathbeds can order a service with which they can relive their lives in a perfectly ideal way, having artificial memories implanted into their minds. Thus they can pass away peacefully and in happiness. This process requires a specific machine (made by Sigmund Corporation) and skilled technicians who must discover the hidden wish of the patient and fulfill it by taking a different path at certain points of the person's life.The player takes the role of two such technicians, Dr. Eva Rosalene (Senior memory traversal agent) and Dr. Neil Watts (technician specialist). They both have different personalities: Dr. Rosalene being the more serious one (still she also cracks better jokes) and Dr. Watts being childish (and somewhat subordinated to Dr. Rosalene). They also regulary mock each other.Strangely enough they aren't the game's main protagonists. but the dying old man, their current patient, Johnny Wyles and the love of his life, River (who has passed away not long ago). Johnny and River were high-school sweethearts and were seemingly made for each other, still, their marriage wasn't as happy as expected. Johnny now lives alone on a cliff near the ocean, with a beautiful view to a lighthouse, with Lily, the housekeeper and her two children. Johnny's dying wish is a journey to the Moon. The two technicians traverse back through time in Johnny's life via several decisive mementos, that played an important role in his life. With each leap backwards they/we get to know Johnny's life beginning from a few days before to his high school years. In most of these memories, River is also present. When the technicians finally reach Johnny's childhood, they encounter a memory block and therefore unable to travel to the point when Johnny was a small kid. They don't attach great importance to it and begin the installation of his new ""memories"". However it seems Johnny has absolutley no desire to go to the Moon. At this point Eva and Neil must somehow awaken an interest in him towards the Moon.Eventually it turns out that due to a childhood trauma and memory loss Johnny forgot that he and River had met as children at a carnival. They shared a common interest towards the stars and immediately became friends. Then they agreed that if one of them were to ever get lost (or to forget about this meeting), they would regroup again on the Moon (also we get an explanation why River is holding onto that platypus plush toy so much...)Later, after they meet again in high school and then get married, River emotional distance comes from the fact that Johnny couldn't remember their first meeting at the carnival.The gameplay is very simple: by controlling Eva and Neil the player must explore each memory segment (in the upper section of the screen we can always check which segment of Johnny's life we are in), solve some hidden-picture puzzles and then travel back in time to the next memory. In order to do this however, you'll have to find and unlock mementos by collecting memory orbs. These memory orbs can be acquired by clicking on familiar characters, items, or locations. You can't get stuck, as the solution is often intuitional: for example at the ranch where Johnny and River go horseback riding, you have to catch up with the lively and joyous River and ride alongside her to receive the orbs (this segment contains the loveliest tune in the game by the way: Take Me Anywhere).Besides Take Me Anywhere the main theme is also amazing as is the rest of the music in the game, always perfectly reflecting the current tone of the given memory segment. These piano themes are fantastic and further facilitate the brilliance of the game.The ending is lovely but also a bit of a letdown (don't worry, there is a happy ending :)), because it is predictable what Eva is planning to do with River in Johnny's memory. I think it would've been a bit better if it was up to Neil (who actually changes over the course of the story in a positive way) to rearrange Johnny's memory and leave River in the role she deserved to be in.Still that's only a minor lament from my side and hardly detracts from the game's value. To the Moon points it out how beautiful memories ordinary people can have and is one of those few games that should be played by every single person all around the world. I'm sure the world could be a better place after that.PROS+ superbly written, heartbreaking love story+ great, loveable characters+ charming music+ often sad, often hilarious dialogues+ some of the sections are so beautiful, they're worth replayingCONS- River shouldn't have been removed from Johnny's childhood memory- Dragonball referencesRATING9.5/10			"

												Easily among my top 10 greatest games of all time. This game doesn't have a whole lot of gameplay but it brings a spectacular story that everyone should check out. The game's plot is all about people who can go into the minds of a dying person and change their memories to make them think that they achieved their dream to help them die happy. The rest of the story you should experience for yourself. The game has a spectacular soundtrack suiting the mood the entire time and I sat down and played this game all in one sitting because the story was just that good. The gameplay is simple point and click to find things and the game will last you from 3-6 hours depending on how much you explore and how fast you are at reading. I recommend this experience strongly to anyone looking for something new, amazing, interesting, and touching (many people have been known to cry during this game). 99/100			"

												Guaranteed tears; tears of saddness and tears of joy. Tears because you don't want this beautiful game to end. To the moon is incredible if you're into heavily story-based games with minimal gameplay. It's more of a point and click game with the occasional puzzle which gets harder as the game progresses, but it's nothing too mind numbing. What I love about this game is also the comedic relief from the male doctor you play, so it's a good balance of sadness and humour. Whoever wrote the script for this game needs a medal.			"

												Ahem-em... Hrmmm! What? No I didn't cry, I didn't...Okay... maybe just a little ૮´︵ ` აI've... been straying astray from what got me into video games in the first place as a child...Back in the good old days when game developers created master-piece games most of which were in 2D it was all about the original unique trial and error story-telling and new attempts to try out new styles of how to go about making a game since it was something new, cheesy lovable characters, cool/cute characters, character development, albeit this game was short, we learned so much from just experiencing ones past. That goes far beyond deep character development in a new perspective.Now if you will excuse me... I have a very large list of 199x-early 2000 video games to pull out of their dusty retirement.I must reconcile with my already breaking heart and remember what a true game feels like.**Sure, let's go play a game about todays decapitating other players, shooting them, yelling at each other, putting people down. Graphics this, Graphics that! 3Dvs2D This! 3Dvs2D That! Cheesy Dialog this, Cheesy Dialog that.People need to get off their high horses, but then again most of these people with negative reviews more than likely never played any classic JRPGs of the SNES/PS1 eras so it's understandable if they don't get such a moving story.That being said very few developers still create amazing games that FOCUS primarily on character developments and very touching moving storylines, mostly done indie developers.

Presentation is a bit meh (would've love to move in a three-dimensional plane to make it easier), but writing is top notch. For some reason, F12 in this game pauses it instead of taking a screenshot?Pros- Pony rides; Disembodied floating heads, at one point, Zombies at another (I'm serious), Compelling story that made me want to keep going.Cons- Abrupt abandonment of flip puzzles, Story is likely hard to follow on first playthrough; I wish environments were a little bigger as there were some crammed areas.So basically, I said the story was a pro and the story was a con.

 Beautiful. Before going in-depth with my review for the game, I want to sum it up with that one word alone:  Beautiful.Upon purchasing the game, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. Sure, I've heard praises about it some time ago and it was on sale recently for a very reasonable price. So, I bought the game along with its soundtrack bundled in without any idea what to truly expect. And after just finishing the game recently, I can safely say that what I got was an experience worth every penny. Keyword: ""experience"".I'll start off by discussing what I think is the main problem that people seem to have for the game (based on the negative Steam reviews).This game is labeled as an ""Indie Adventure Role Playing Game"". It was also designed through the RPG Maker XP engine. So it is of no surprise that people expect at least a bit of RPG Maker gameplay elements that are typically found elsewhere. But this game doesn't have that. In fact, aside from very simple puzzles, this game doesn't have much else in terms of 'gameplay'. And therein lies the problem. It's hard to call it a 'game' when it barely has any gameplay elements to it. Heck, as long as you keep playing there's no way to lose the game. It's more like a movie with a few interactions added here and there. I personally expected a bit of a challenge too but the game was too easy and too linear. But is that necessarily a bad thing?No. In my opinion, it's not.In fact, because of how straightforward the gameplay is, I was able to progress through the story very quickly in anticipation for what's going to happen next. All I had to do was overcome a bit of a hurdle in order to progress through the story and it didn't bother me at all.That is why I prefer calling it an 'experience' as opposed to calling it a 'game'. It is a  story-driven experience. The lack of any complicated gameplay made all the other aspects of the game shine.The graphics may be your typical RPG Maker stuff, but it's better-looking than most of the games made through the RPG Maker engine. The story...well, without spoiling much let's just say that there are a lot of feels found in this game. One minute I'm laughing at the interactions between the two main characters, and the next minute I'm trying my best to hold back my tears from too much feels (and most of the time failing to hold back said tears; no shame in that). And the music? Oh man, the music...the music in this game is arguably its greatest asset. The music found in the game is very beautiful. Each soundtrack served its purpose in making every scene of the game much more enjoyable and memorable. If you buy the game, I implore you to buy the soundtrack as well. It's worth it.It's a short game; only took me around 4 hours to finish. But every second of that 4 hours was worth it. It was a short but sweet ride.I highly recommend this game.			"

												The Bad:-The graphics are pretty terrible.-There is no real gameplay apart from a few very easy puzzles and your basic explore-and-interact. The Good:+The soundtrack is beautiful and used very well throughout the story.+The story is very well written and extremely emotional. Every detail throughout the game is well planned, every mystery has a great payoff, it all connects brilliantly and the dialogue (Text only, no voice acting) is really good.Overall, you play as 2 scientists who alter dying people's memories to fulfill a wish for them (or, at least, make them believe it came true). In this case, they're out to help an old man called John H. Wyles, who's dying wish is to go (you guessed it) to the moon. What makes this case a bit different to their normal ones is that Johnny hasn't the faintest idea as to why he even wants that. He just knows he does. The game's divided into 3 acts. The first one is mostly about establishing the backstory and leanring about Johnny's life. It's pretty slow paced, and mostly sets up questions to be answered later. The 2nd act picks up the pace, and from there till the end I found the game hard to stop playing.It takes a bit over 3 hours to finish, so I recommend finishing it in 1 sitting for maximum impact.

And the music? Oh man, the music...the music in this game is arguably its greatest asset. The music found in the game is very beautiful. Each soundtrack served its purpose in making every scene of the game much more enjoyable and memorable. If you buy the game, I implore you to buy the soundtrack as well. It's worth it.It's a short game; only took me around 4 hours to finish. But every second of that 4 hours was worth it. It was a short but sweet ride.I highly recommend this game.			"

												SPOILER-FREE REVIEW!In over four decades of playing video games, only a handful have ever elicited strong emotional responses with me. ""Final Fantasy VII,"" ""Ico,"" ""Shadow of the Colossus,"" and ""Journey"" are among the very few that have had such a powerful effect. ""To The Moon"" can now take its rightful place alongside those titles. From beginning to end, I never once turned it off or took a break. It had me hooked in from the very moment I turned it on, and it is still haunts me even after its overwhelming finale. This will be a game that I shall remember many, many years from now. There are so many moments that brought me to tears, probably more than any other game, and I loved it. If you are not touched by the game's beautiful story, you have no heart. By the game's conclusion, you will wonder to yourself if your life would have been better had you taken different paths at different times in your past. If given the opportunity to change it, would you?Graphics: 10/10 - The character design, rich colors, backgrounds, and little details made me feel like I was in this world.Sound: 7/10 - There's not much, but what's there is perfectly suited for this game. The heart beats and distorted laughs are memorable.Music: 10/10 - Every track is flawless.Gameplay: 7/10 - Mostly walking around and touching objects. The puzzles are not challenging, but the product's more of an interactive story than a game. Some people could be put off by its simplicity.Story: 10/10 - You WILL cry.Overall: 10/10 - One of the best games I've played in years. Freebird Games proves that you don't need huge budgets, realistic graphics, buckets of blood, or name brand recognition to produce a great game -- and this truly is a GREAT game.There is no excuse; you must play this game before you die. You won't regret it.			"

												At the begining i wasnt really convinced by this game, but when i tried it i,... i cried at the end.The game is made with RPG MAKER XP, reminds me of old 32bits games. In the game you will mostly(90%) use the mouse but you can use you're keyboard too. The Story is about granting a wish to a certain person.The soundtracks are amazing, i fell in love with them.I personally would love that more people would buy this and would play it.I really cried many times. This game will be one of my favorites. Still i can't forget this story and i can't whait to buy 'A Bird Story', on what i know its the 'sequel'.Please give it a try, it will play with you're feelings.10/10			"

												Built around an old-school JRPG game engine, To The Moon is one of the most tear-jerking stories I've ever played. It eschews a lot of mechanics such as choice and combat in order to create an interactive, exploration/adventure that uncovers the beautiful, sad history of a character on their deathbed.			"

												To The Moon is simply put the most beautiful experience I've ever had in a looooong time. It takes an alternate approach to story-telling by going backwards in the timeline, and really pays off in the end as a result. It only took four hours for me to finish, but by the end I was covered in tears. Despite the lack of gameplay, the simple concept of exploration was enough for me to continue for I felt that any sort of standard gameplay mechanic would draw away from the story itself. It was an unforgettable journey, and if anyone in the world tells you that video games aren't art just shove this game into their face.Brilliant Story. Touching Soundtrack. Gorgeous Pixel Art. Just Play It.P.S. Now I'll never look at a platypus the same way again.			"

												I'd consider myself an averagely strong person that doesn't seem to get overly upset over something, or so I thought, until I played this beautiful and amazing game or... story. The thought of this grief-stricken and heartsick man wanting to indulge into his dream or wish to go the the moon doesn't sound that sad until you actually go ahead and play this game. The intricate and detailed design of the game really hits you hard in the heart. But the thing that really hurt was the music. Kan Gao is an amazing composer when it comes to music, it wouldn't be the same without the beautiful music that he peformed, absolutely stunning. I was attracted to this game not by reviews nor suggestions, but the music that I came across when I was browsing YouTube one morning. That's how beautiful it is.This game has  been nominated for the ""I'm not crying, there's something in my eye award!"" This game certainly fits this breif and deserves to win. I know i'll be voting ""To The Moon"".To everyone out there, I recommend this game. It's not just an average game, it's outstanding.			"

												Man… To the Moon, such a hard game to talk about because I don’t want to ruin the experience for anyone.  And that’s what you get here.  This is an experience.  It’s not a “game” don’t expect much “gameplay”, in you don’t have to beat bosses, or solve major puzzles.  There’s a few no loss puzzles, and a few “find a specific object”.  But for the most part they are not hard, and not frustrating at all.  In fact it’s pretty damn easy. It’s also quite a long game, and I have to be honest, I almost didn’t play it more than about an hour.  But when I went back, I played through the rest and honestly.  I’m glad I did.  The game has a VERY strong narrative, and this is what makes me happy to have played it. Not only is the narrative strong, but it works with the mechanics of the game, and the gameplay.  The game is all about memories and exploring them, and the story works right along with that.  There’s some twists and turns but just about everything the game does is “right”. The only two flaws I’d say with the game is the opening is weak (ish) and doesn’t hook you right away in my opinion.  It’d have been great to see the characters finish a job so you have an idea what their job is.    The other flaw is one point in the “game” where I feel the creator felt he had to make it a “game”.  It honestly feels out of place.   Not that it ruins the experience at all, but really didn’t need to see that. So is it good?  Well There’s a lot of discussion about “games as art” and I HATE that discussion because it promotes pretentious games and says “no this is totally what games could be.”  And often times the story is manipulative and weak, and the game is overly dramatic trying to really hammer you over the head. To the Moon doesn’t do that.  Instead it tells an amazing story, and makes the player care about the story to the point where they don’t mind the lack of “gameplay” and really just want to see where the story goes.  It doesn’t explain everything in a hamfisted way, and in fact leaves some of the story semi open for the player to figure out (through googling, rather than just interpretation) which I liked.   Is it good?  No.  It’s great.  Is it ten bucks worthy?  I don’t know, it’s only about 5 hours, and I don’t know if I’ll replay it, but it does something so different and new, and accomplishes it with SNES style graphics.   I recommend it to anyone who wants something different, who is willing to pay for a story rather than a game, and willing to connect with characters on a different level than most games try to manipulate them to feel.

The least I can say about it is that this is a unique, rewarding experience and well worth the journey.

As such, it was a pleasant surprise through the game when River started seeming a bit like, well... me, and I realised why. It's a very nice comment on women like River and her sister. The story is very sweet. At times I felt quite tearful! There is no voice acting, which is a shame, but the music adds atmosphere, and there is something quaint about the simplicity of it, and the ability to tell such a good story through this medium. I'd recommend this game, especially to women who know who Tony Attwood or Rudy Simone are.			"

												I purchased To the Moon on a whim because it had strong reviews and was on sale. Plus, the game description intrigued me, and I thought if nothing else, it might be a decent way to spend the evening.Four hours later, and I am crying harder than I have in months. I honestly don't know how to describe this game without spoiling the magic of it. This is one of the titles I will point to when people contend that video games cannot be art. They absolutely can be, and this indie might well be considered a masterpiece. The story of To the Moon is tragic, beautiful, and sad. It is often funny and sometimes hilarious. It is the first video game that ever stirred my emotions to the point of tears. And it gave me a newfound appreciation for life. Seriously.Some details would probably be helpful. You play as Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts, two specialists who are hired to modify clients' memories so that the last thing they remember on their deathbeds is the fulfillment of a grand and final wish. This is achieved by working backwards through the patient's remembered life, planting the seed of an idea in their early childhood so that their new, artificial life will play out the way it needs to in order for the wish to take hold. Their latest job is an old man named Johnny, a widower who wants to go to the moon. Only thing is, he doesn't remember why he wants to go, only that he must. So our heroes set up their equipment, enter his most recent memory, and start seeing the man's life in reverse.What begins as a standard point-and-click title quickly weaves into a heartbreaking and simultaneously joyous exploration of life, death, love and its flaws, dreams and the crushing feeling of losing them, promises kept and broken, the future, the past, and the importance of making the present count. It portrayed the shattering realities of illness, financial woes, selfishness, and failure. It captured the grief of not understanding someone you love and the tragedies that befall all of us. It illustrates how love is powerful but also incredibly painful and complex. It makes you think about how each one of us is the hero of our own story, and how much it hurts when we don't live up to the title. It makes you think about how we take so many things and people for granted, and the peculiarities of what does and doesn't stick in our memory. It shows us the importance and the absurdity of chasing after nostalgia, of knowing that something in your possession matters but not remembering why. It shows how easy it is to see other people's mistakes in life while ignoring our own. It pointed out how we would rather act than listen. To the Moon made me think about my own real-life relationships and how I could (should) put more effort into them. It made me think about dozens of chance encounters I've had, the dreaded ""What if?"" It made me smile with its true-to-life depictions of talking to girls, arguing with co-workers, and gently mocking one's friends. And it emotionally wrecked me with its dramatic twists, gorgeous soundtrack, and perfect ending. It's like someone took the first 10 minutes of the Pixar film UP, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and several classic RPGs and threw them in a blender.Some of the dialogue and the mental images that followed it made me think of other, bigger titles, such as Bioshock Infinite. Oh, how we love our lighthouses... But the story here is much more intimate and private, like reading a journal that someone's kept since they were 5. The visuals are charming, going for an old-school RPG look like Link to the Past or the original Harvest Moon. Cinema was obviously a huge influence on some of the particulars, notably Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Inception. Still, this is a truly original work, one that will stick in your brain long after it ends. The story's ability to make you cry, laugh (sometimes at once), and reflect is something few video games can do. It's something few movies or books can do. Get To the Moon, and let yourself be affected.Edit: I've nominated To the Moon for the ""I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye"" Award. There is no other possible contender. Play this already.			"

												Wow. I played this all in one sitting. Start to finish. Absolutely brilliant. Could not put it down. It's like if someone took Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind and combined it with Inception to a create a story about doctors who dive into the memories of the dying to artificially fulfill their dying wish by creatively revising their memories (emphasis on Eternal Sunshine). I was initially (and perhaps unfairly) skeptical of what a story could do with pixel art, but am happy to say I was quite wrong. This was much, much better than I expected. I appreciated all the subtle but extremely significant connections that go completely unmentioned, providing deep rewards for the more perceptive and analytical story-focused players. The story also does beautiful things with an autism spectrum character that left me very impressed. A++ more please.			"

To make this wish a reality, he enlists Dr. Eva Rosaline and Dr. Neil Watts of Sigmund Corp. who are determined to send Johnny to the moon one way or another.To the Moon has an incredible story, fantastic artwork, and an absolutely beautiful soundtrack.

												I always buy Story Rich games and unfortunately, despite other reviews, this is not one of them. Even though the intention of the game and the plot might be good, the execution is terrible. The story is a sentimental melodrama (yeah, I know, there is a hidden meaning to the story but guess what, it is not that deep), you have no option but to follow the path of the plot and the gameplay is awfull. Compared to really story rich titles like Spec Ops The Line, Planescape Torment and Portal, this title is very lame and an offense to the intelligence of the player/reader. If the gameplay was a little bit better or more challenging I would reconsider writing this review. By far the worst game in my library, it is the only one I deeply regret in buying. Overrated, overhyped, not recommended.			"

Es una historia de aventura y ciencia ficción. Muy bueno le doy 9/10.			"

												While this game is certainly not bad, it's not exactly good either. But since most reviews are positive anyway, I might aswell tell you why it just didn't work for me.-The storyIn it's core I thought the overall concept was actually pretty original. You pay as two scientist who travel back through a dying man's memories in order to grant him his last wish artificially: taking him to the moon (roll credits). Though during the story, your original objective is often questioned, as you begin to understand that this wish is not what would make your patient truly happy.So, it's really not the story that set me off, it's rather...-The dialogueYou'd think that in a story that's supposed to make you sad and teary, you wouldn't need a character for comic relief. But damnit, the second main character suplied you with a steady ammount of jokes in all the wrong places. I just couldn't take the game serious anymore. At the first half of the story, whenever there was an emotional moment, that same guy, messed it up over an over again. And by the time the game was starting to get deep, it was just too late for me. You see, the sad moments of the game largely depend on how you attached you grow to the characters over time. And maybe it's just me, but I hated both of them.-GameplayWell, interesting gameplay is virtually nonexistent. But that's really not an issue in a story driven game. As I mentioned before, it has a great outline, but it just feels so unrefined at some places that it just wasn't enjoyable for me.-The lengthYou'll probably finish the game in 3-4 hours. And while I don't want to badmouth the content, you may think that it's been a short ride if you don't even have all the trading cards by the time you are done.All in all, I'd say it's okay if you can pick it up during a sale. But I really don't think it's worth the full price if you take a look at what it offers. Just about 4 hours of gameplay which aren't even amazing. But I assume that most people have a far better time, given that they don't dislike the main characters as much as I do.			"

												When I saw that To The Moon looked like something akin to a game made in RPG Maker, I can't say I had particularly high expectations. After playing it, I can say I've never been more pleasantly surprised. To The Moon is an absolutely beautiful, emotional tale. There isn't exactly much (or any, for that matter) action or challenging gameplay, but frankly it doesn't particularly need it. Absolutely recommended. Bring tissues.			"

To the Moon is an adventure/story that slowly reveals the life an old man on his death bed and the circumstances surrounding his final wish. Your progression leads you to regress through his memories, piecing together the importance of his request and why he chose it. Clever and heart-wrenching, To the Moon promises a bittersweet storyline and a simple, yet beautiful score to accompany it. The game will make you laugh; it will make you cry; it will make you hope for the fulfillment of your dreams.Story: 10/10     It's bittersweet and emotionally-engaging. The dialogue between the characters are often funny and clever, drawing from many modern tropes.Gameplay: 7/10     It features the same type of basic puzzle (with increasing difficulty), intended to give the player some reprieve from just pointing and clicking, and acts as a gate to the next part of the game. Not much variety, but it's what you would expect of a game in its genre.Controls: 7/10     Point-and-click and if you are so inclined, the arrow keys. Movement is a bit clunky, but not terrible.Replayability: 5/10     There are no achievements outside of the completion of the game, so unless you want to relive the story again, I don't see why you would replay it.Fun: 8/10     If your idea of fun is a relaxing game and story time, then this is fun. Think of it as reading an interactive visual novel. That's fun, right?Conclusion:     If getting hit in the feels is your thing, get this game. If the game is on sale, DEFINITELY get this game. Rarely will you come across story that will incorporate so many of your emotions over the span of only a few hours. It's definitely worth the purchase; the music alone is worth the price of the game.			"

												I stopped playing Mass Effect 3 for almost three months before I could finish it when I lost one of my favorite characters towards the end due to my own shortcomings. I leveled Cloud and friends for hours on end to try and keep her from dying (name held for spoiler protection) in FFVII. I replayed the same misison in Wing Commander II over and over to try and save Spirit. However sad I felt, it always was a game to me and never shed a tear. Not even close.Played To the Moon, and cried enough to rival that of my lifetime. Many may have missed the many many nuances of the story, and after completion I suggest reading up on it. This story takes reality by the feet and drags into the realm of Science Fiction. Every element, color choice, and dialogue is carefully placed to further the central focus of this game, the story. This emotional story/journey is the central focus (not gameplay, graphics, or gimmics) and is something so memorable. For me, I felt the tear jerking moment coming... but still caught me completely off guard. Excellent sound track. Bravo. Well done.Will play again when I actually man up and buy tissues.10/10			"

												Great story with terrible graphics (game runs on a stupidly small resolution with no options to change that). The gameplay mostly consists of walking around, clicking on things and reading the dialogue. But the writing is excellent. The story is about a dying man whose last wish is to go to the moon. You play as the employees of a corporation that is capable of altering people's memories to give them the illusion of having a different life thus fulfilling their last wish before they die. The narrative unfolds in a reverse chronological order as you go back in time through the old man's memories, learning about his life and finding a way to make his wish come true. It's an interesting way to tell a story and it's executed quite well here.			"

												This game was truely a great experience, and I very much enjoyed playing it. So I would definietly recommend you to buy it, even for its full price, because this is the kind of developer we should be supporting.The game was a pleasent surprise, as it offered much more than what I had expected from a 2D RPG. The story caught my attention right from the very beginning and it never really went dull. The characters were interesting, and I found the music to be very nice and suiting to the rest of the game. The game mechanics wasn't anything out of the ordinary, and honestly it didn't really need to be either. I found the game to be very well polished, and of very high quality, and I would definietly say its one of the best 2D RPG games that I have ever played on PC.Pros:+ Great storyline, with a very nice paced progression.+ The length of the game is just perfect, and it never feels too slow or too fast.+ Well developed characters.+ Great sense of humor, without being too over the top.+ Nice and suiting music.+ Easy to get 100% steam achievement ( if you care about that )Cons:- I can't really think of anything bad to say.

 This will hit you right in the feels....and you'll be glad it did. Don't be put off by the way this game starts, I was, and I beg you to learn from my mistake.After playing through the first 10 minutes or so i quickly declared the game to be ""boring as hell"" and ""A magnificent waste of my time"", but when I stumbled upon it in my library again late yesterday evening I gave it another shot....and played straight through the night just so I would get to finish it, hell I even played the minisodes while I was at it.I would highly recommend this game to anyone, it might not give you that adrenaline rush some people crave but it will sure as hell kick you right in the feels, and you'll thank it for doing so. During this game I laughed, I cried, and most of all I just had a ton of fun. The graphis aren't great, and yeah, sometimes the controls are a little wonky, but the AMAZING soundtrack won't leave you any time or need to worry about that. From some of the very first scenes to the very end, the music grabbed me and pulled me straight through the just as well written story. I would honestly tell everyone to buy this game, take a day off, and just play through it in one sitting. At the end, you'll almost be a different person. This game tells a wonderfull story, and does so in such a way that no matter what you wanted to happen, what you expected, what you hated, what you liked, you'll still love it, just the way it was.This game definitely got itself a place in my heart, and I hope it'll find it's way to your heart too.

												An amazing game. It's not you're typical game, and it will make you question some things about life: like most empathy games. In about 4 hours, this game took me on a rollercoaster of emotions. From Dr. Watt making me laugh with his relevent comments, to Dr. Rosalene's pure determination to get the job done, and finally the tears that came on slowly from the realization that, nothing you did actually mattered, and John didn't really understand what River was trying to communicate with him. The ending might not make sense at first, but after a while of thought or looking at the wiki will only make the tale more heartbreaking. 10/10. I wish i could expericence it again.			"

												To the Moon is one of those works whose very nature places it at a disadvantage. Like a kicker on an American Football team, this genre (which is most satisfactorially described as an ""interactive experience"") is not comparable to its peers since it doesn't do the same thing they do. But in all fairness its peers likewise cannot match what it does, and you'd better believe it does plenty!The Negs --This title catches you off-guard, withholding the real meat of the gameplay until about 30 minutes in. And even then, that gameplay meat is lean-sliced turkey over a bagel at best. The ""interactor"" (rather than ""player"") functions to only move characters from one cutscene to the next. To the Moon could be outright categorized as a point-and-click game if it weren't for the RPG presentation it offers. The story mechanics are sometimes inconsistent, making the goals unclear, which is especially frustrating when all you want to do is get the characters to the next scene of dialogue. This frustration is not extensive though. There were some bugs in places, and sometimes the ground was just too cluttered with vague textures. Quite literally I continually thought the game was freezing on me simply because my character stopped walking when in reality a small flower, not so different in appearance from another small flower that I walk right over, was just blocking my way. The faults of the gameplay were highly bearable, however, mainly because the gameplay was a minor part of this experience.The Pos --Despite all the underwhelming gameplay aspects, this piece held my attention for 5 hours quite easily. The culprit: the characters. Not the main two doctors - I knew about them. What captivated me were the rest of the cast and their unanswered stories. The writing in this game is keen and well-paced, playing coy about the questions it introduces while not leaving the interactor lost for too long. The dialogue ventures into topics that are realistically gritty and gray. This whole experience works in the first place because the user is immersed enough to accept the story and characters at hand. This immersion is influenced by the detailed artwork, which avoided the half-hearted tiling of textures that RPGs are known for, and by the MIND-BLOWING SOUNDTRACK!!!!! I could not give the ost for this work any more laud than it has already received, but if my two cents count for a thing, the music in this game had me consciously framing each scene to its tone, particularly when the music changed mid-scene.The Verd --To the Moon is definitely one to sit down and just experience one day. It is certainly not the sort of thing that I would do any day to blow off some steam; there is a mood for it. So if you find yourself in the mood to watch The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but in a form that requires you to read a little more, then pick up To the Moon (there are actually very similar tones between the two works, and the atmospheres line up pretty well too). As a video game it merits a [7 / 10], but as its own genre of entertainment it steals [10 / 10]. Touching on troubling topics and tearducts alike, To the Moon earned its place as a title that everyone should play once and discuss for a long time after.			"

To the Moon is an adventure/story that slowly reveals the life an old man on his death bed and the circumstances surrounding his final wish. Your progression leads you to regress through his memories, piecing together the importance of his request and why he chose it. Clever and heart-wrenching, To the Moon promises a bittersweet storyline and a simple, yet beautiful score to accompany it. The game will make you laugh; it will make you cry; it will make you hope for the fulfillment of your dreams.Story: 10/10     It's bittersweet and emotionally-engaging. The dialogue between the characters are often funny and clever, drawing from many modern tropes.Gameplay: 7/10     It features the same type of basic puzzle (with increasing difficulty), intended to give the player some reprieve from just pointing and clicking, and acts as a gate to the next part of the game. Not much variety, but it's what you would expect of a game in its genre.Controls: 7/10     Point-and-click and if you are so inclined, the arrow keys. Movement is a bit clunky, but not terrible.Replayability: 5/10     There are no achievements outside of the completion of the game, so unless you want to relive the story again, I don't see why you would replay it.Fun: 8/10     If your idea of fun is a relaxing game and story time, then this is fun. Think of it as reading an interactive visual novel. That's fun, right?Conclusion:     If getting hit in the feels is your thing, get this game. If the game is on sale, DEFINITELY get this game. Rarely will you come across story that will incorporate so many of your emotions over the span of only a few hours. It's definitely worth the purchase; the music alone is worth the price of the game.			"

												A touching journey through the life of Johnny, a man on his deathbed, who has but one wish... to go the moon. Why the moon? That is explored by Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene via a memory device, reminiscent of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In this case though, the doctors are able to not only view, but take part in the memories.The gameplay is by far the weakest aspect of To the Moon. It is a mixture of finding objects and completing dull puzzles. It's a means to an end, really. At no point would I say the gameplay was enjoyable, but I was compelled to continue by the beautiful story.The story is wonderfully told: it respects the players intelligence, allowing certain realisations to hit quite hard. I still find myself thinking about it, months on. Couple the story with an outstanding soundtrack (seriously, grab the soundtrack edition) and you have something very special.  +Heartfelt story+Great Soundtrack+The doctors have a nice dynamic-Game elements are boring/unnecessary-Movement can be a little awkwardTo the Moon would be better suited to another medium in my opinion. It's definitely not the first time it has been said, but it truly would make a better movie than a game. Even so, buy. "

												This is by far the most beautiful game I have ever played, and I am not talking graphics here (though they are very charming, they are more gameboy-like).  I don't want to spoil anything, but it is amazing.  It is such a delicate and touching story, with so many seemingly random, strange things, that all come together in an absolutely amazing way (by the end of it...mind blown).  A story about life, death, love, sacrifice, it is stunning.  Buy this game, play it all the way through.  It is a masterpiece that far exceeded all of my expectations.  This by far is the most powerful game I have played.  Never experienced anything like it.  Best story in a video game that I have ever seen.  Pure genius and such an inspired story, Free Bird Gaming...<3 River Wyles.			"

												absolutely amazing game, well I guess I wouldn't really call it a game as much as a story. I cried tears of sadness, my heart broke, then I cried tears of happiness. This game is about 2 doctors who give a ""last wish"" in a form of a fake memory to those who are on their death beds. As you dive deeper into Johnny's life you learn so much about him you would never expect. It's very real/true to life on SO many levels. I HIGHLY reccommend this game to everyone. Bring the tissues!			"

												To the Moon is a pretty interesting game. It's short, the puzzles aren't hard to solve at all, and there is barely any gameplay to it. What it does have is an amazing story with a bunch of well written and interesting characters. It also hits a perfect balance between comedic and heart-breaking moments that feel natural as you get to learn the history between all the characters in the game. To the Moon is definatly a game worth checking out.			"

												It's not so much as a game as it is an interactive storybook. One where  you flip the pages to the very end.The wording ""To the Moon"" is truthful in wording and truthful in where it leads. Physically and emotionally tolled, you will be affected as you take on the journey of an ideologically driven man - lying on his deathbed- to his dream of landing on the moon. He wishes it not only for his own sake, but for the women he loved so much as to let her die. His final action and wish is a gift of placation and apology for her sake. You control two scientists who enter dreams in an effort to change the memory of any ailing, near death patient in order to achieve their dreams mentally, but not physically. Their characters are often juxtaposed with the backdrop of the bitter, saddened clients they have, but it serves as a humanizing reminder of the need for human emotion in the times of desperation. They don't serve as the main character, but as (you) -> The person who journeys from the start and to the end of the story, not the creator.There isn't much of a game here to be had besides a few puzzles here and there, scattered as a movement of progression. Each puzzle serves as a pinpoint of interest in the client's life reminding the player of the human aspects of the person's mind they are investigating. May it be a simple baloon or some pickles, each pinpoint from the puzzle has its purpose of showing how human the character is.Verdict: This is a journey, a story of a man's unattained wish and you must complete it. I recommend it to the fullest to whoever enjoys games for their stories and not just for their gameplay. This is purely an interactive story.  "

												This was probably my favorite game ive played this year. It was brutally beautiful, like watching the first thirty minutes of Up backwards repeatedly - in a good way. Also, do not buy this without the soundtrack, which is equally gorgeous. Graphics and art style were very reminiscent of Chrono Trigger, though the controlls were a little clunky, like some of the other less well designed SNES titles, and the few puzzles were far too easy. But the story, art, and music's amazingness completely eclipsed anything that could be found wrong elsewhere. I was completely blown away. You must play this game, if only to watch your soul shed a few scars, and your heart become a little less cold.			"

												""In GameSpot's 2011 Game of the Year awards, To the Moon was given the ""Best Story"" award, which was won against Catherine, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Portal 2, and Xenoblade Chronicles."" Also, this game has Metascore rating of 81 which is pretty unusual for some indie pixel art.I've accidentally found this game in my collection, it was purchased in some bundle and became long forgotten. I decided to start it at least once to see what is it about and reduce number of unplayed games on my steam account.And it definitely wasn't a mistake. The game is a great story, presented in a clever way that keeps you interested for straight four hours. I won't lie - there isn't a lot of choice or freedom in this game, it is more of an interactive fiction that tells you about the entire lifetime of one person, so you could grant him a wish he couldn't get in his real life. You just sometimes press buttons to move to the next story point, but it is nicely told, gives you something to think about and with a plot twist. Everything we love about stories.And one more thing: there is no city, but there is a man. And there is a lighthouse.			"

												To The Moon by Freebird games. This is such a great game. One of my favourites for sure. Don't watch the videos on YouTube, just play it. It might look basic/boring, but play it to the end and you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend playing it if you haven't already. [Overall rating 8.5/10]Gameplay is pretty average. There isn't much exciting about the gameplay. You click to move, search for objects, click objects, talk to NPCs and that is about it. Don't expect a lot from the gameplay but what it lacks here, it excels in storyline and audio. I believe the gameplay is meant to be quite simple so that more people can experience the story. Even though gameplay is a big deal in video games, this game was amazing still. [Gameplay rating 6/10]Storyline was something else. Beautiful. When you finish the game and reach the credits, you want to applaud... after you've wiped away the tears of course. If' you're just starting this game, I can't stress how important it is to play this game to the end just for that experience alone. The story alone makes up for the simple gameplay and graphics. [Story rating 10/10]Graphics are retro style, like something from a SNES time RPG. Don't expect something cutting-edge from the graphics, but they are detailed enough for you to see facial expressions and catch the emotions needed. [Graphics rating 8/10]Audio is amazing. I find that I'm listening to the full soundtrack regularly. The song, ""Everythings Alright"" by Laura Shigihara still gives me the feels when I hear it. Amazing voice, and amazing soundtrack. Audio often helps a great deal with infusing emotions into a story, this is definitely the case with To The Moon. [Audio rating 10/10]Instead of showing gameplay or epic moments in the game. I will leave you with a YouTube link for the full soundtrack. Enjoy.

												An absolutely beautiful story, delivered in a pace slow enough to let you contemplate every moment, but still making you play a second time to fully comprehend all the little details. Clearly, this game has been crafted with plenty of passion and experience.The very introduction reflects the entire game's mood perfectly. The protagonists are having delightful interactions, eventhough they drove over an animal and had a car accident.  Throughout the entire game, you will experience this contrast of cheerful colours, bright music and lighthearted dialogue against cruel reality, shocking revelations and gruesome secrets.As for the story itself, the characters are all congenial in some aspect. There are no uninteresting interactions and no unexplained plot conveniences. Besides some joke content not relevant to the story (instead to brighten the mood), there are no plot holes or unnecessary story elements. Everything of the actual story makes sense in the end, but a few questions about the frame story remain unanswered, probably to be expanded on in the next ""episodes"".If you like story-driven games and don't mind the pixelated graphics, you should definitely consider playing this game!

												I'm not gonna lie, I got a little choked up, but because I'm a real G, I sucked those tears back in. It's a story worth experiencing, and has a soundtrack worth buying. I mean for $15 you get a great game and some great music, whereas for $60 you could get Call of HaloField: Generic Wrfare: Jetpack of the Year Edition: Nazi Zombie Socialists mode (this joke went on for way too long, I apologize). It's all in perspective. But I digress. Get this game. It's a no-brainer. This story is what I can only describe as: one of the few horses that you can't not ride. This, along with TellTales The Walking Dead, and a few others that I can't remember at this late hour, all fall into this stable of must-ride stallions (This joke will make sense once you buy the game). Overall, this game gets, and I can't believe I am saying this, a 10/10. Give FreeBird your money, and dont wait for a sale you cheapskape.			"

To the Moon's strength lies in its story. It pertains to a man on his deathbed named Johnny who wishes to go to the moon via the alteration of his memories. This is done by you, the protagonist, and a partner.  All the other aspects of the game only serve to move the narrative forward. This is often done through puzzles and the hunt for important objects in Johnny’s life when delving into his memories. Despite the rather weak gameplay elements of the game, the more than stellar story make up for any shortcomings. When To the Moon concludes, a tear will likely be running down your cheek.			"

												This is the first game I found the need to review fully.  Probably the best story in game ever.  This is pure art.  Everything about it is perfect. I wouldn't have it any other way.  This is a must play.  11/10!  This game is just beyond words.  Going into plot would completely ruin the experience.  All I can say is how great it was.  First game that made me cry.  Just pure art.  Bravo Freebird Games, Bravo.			"

												I'm not gonna lie, I got a little choked up, but because I'm a real G, I sucked those tears back in. It's a story worth experiencing, and has a soundtrack worth buying. I mean for $15 you get a great game and some great music, whereas for $60 you could get Call of HaloField: Generic Wrfare: Jetpack of the Year Edition: Nazi Zombie Socialists mode (this joke went on for way too long, I apologize). It's all in perspective. But I digress. Get this game. It's a no-brainer. This story is what I can only describe as: one of the few horses that you can't not ride. This, along with TellTales The Walking Dead, and a few others that I can't remember at this late hour, all fall into this stable of must-ride stallions (This joke will make sense once you buy the game). Overall, this game gets, and I can't believe I am saying this, a 10/10. Give FreeBird your money, and dont wait for a sale you cheapskape.			"

												The soundtrack alone is so beautiful and the player knows they are in for an amazing experience when that piano starts to play. The music combines perfectly with the artstyle and there were many times throughout the game when I completely stopped what I was doing to observe the scenery and listen to the music. It probably has one of the best stories I have ever seen in a game and the experience is very emotional. (As was mentioned by previous reviews)Overall, the game has a great soundtrack, that mixes well with the great artstyle, and it's amazing story makes it completely worth the time and money! Buy it!

Simply Amazing!TL;DR? Get this game! You will not regret its purchase especially at its price. For the five hours you will invest in the game, it will leave a mark on you forever!Pros:★ The story is one of the best I've ever experienced.★ Has a seamless feel to the game keeping you engaged.★ Cheap but definitely not nasty.★ The soundtrack is amazing and adds to the story.★ Left me crying like a little ♥♥♥♥♥.Cons:✖ Lack of any real 'gaming' may discourage some.✖ Left me crying like a little ♥♥♥♥♥.'To the Moon' would appear to start off like any other indie video game and may take a good five or ten minutes to understand on how it has been set out. But once you fall into the world of mystery that surrounds this game, you quickly become involved in a story that will leave an impressionable memory and have you wanting to reach for the story once again. Now if you are after action or involvement with a whole heap of WASD key bashing then this game does not suit that purpose. But if you are after a quiet evening and are ready to be involved in an amazing story then 'To the Moon' will be exactly what you are after.The only hiccup I have with this game is the puzzle sequence and found that it is Freebird's way of calling this a game. Whilst I do enjoy walking around talking to people and exploring the environment I found that the puzzle part wasn't exactly needed in the end development. Personally I love the piano and this game hits all of the perfect tones for the emotions it's trying to set. The music to this game plays a big part to each area you walk into and sets the mood very nicely. I don't want to give too much away as the mystery of the game is the gem in itself, but I promise you will find a connection to every single character that you find in the game.This is a game I know I will come back to in years time to come, just so I can listen to its story once again like any great book.

												This game came highly recommended to me, so I purchased it during the Steam 2013 Winter Sale. This little short story game is really touching. This game has all the feels. I recommend playing through the entire game in one go. It has only a few hours of game play altogether.Don't read any spoilers for this game. It WILL ruin the game for you.The gameplay itself wasn't great and rather repetitive. You are basically just walking around collecting items and checkpoints while solving some easy puzzles. But if you can get past that, it is well worth your time to go through it so you can see how this story unfolds.I highly recommend this game.At the very least, you should check out the soundtrack to this game. The soundtrack is amazing.

												This game has been in my library for quite some time, only when a friend recommended this that I started playing it one bored afternoon. I'm quite open to games but nonetheless I honestly thought this game was going to be boring after browsing through the store page. But seeing that it was recommended to me and that it's also got great reviews, I decided to start it. I didn't know what to expect, the game starts off a bit confusing as it's premise was very new to me, and I'm sure it  will be as well for some of you. What caught my attention and....emotions was the characters, their decisions, motivations and story. It all got me curious and I continued on wanting to learn more as I also got attached to them, some scenes are very heartwarming and sweet and others are innocent and depressing. The way the story is laid out in terms of memory links creates a very interesting and strong medium that makes it very easy to relate and observe the characters from. The game was never frustrating and you'll definitely find yourself pausing occasionally, if you're like me that enjoys a good soundtrack whilst revering the scenes and characters.This is certaintly a great game, if you are looking for a great story, short game with a great soundtrack, I'll also highly recommend this to you.

												This game has the BEST story of any game I've ever played. I read a lot of reviews about this game and all of them said that it had the saddest ending of any game ever. At first I was like pfffft yeah right and I was very hesitant to buy it. I randomly bought it yesterday and played through it in one sitting. It's about 4 hours long. Let me tell you this, this game has the saddest, most amazingly written story of any game I've played, any book I've read, or any movie I've seen. If you don't shed a tear by the time you've finished playing this game I refuse to believe you are a human being. The way that everything plays out and the soundtrack the accompany the setting go perfectly together. I know that 10 bucks seems like a little much for a 4 hour game but this is not just a game, it's an amazing piece of art that I think everyone can enjoy.			"

												This game has such a phoneomenal story. The gameplay is fairly linear and simple but it acts as the perfect vehicle for something like this. It definitely could go a lot further with some of its elements but that may be what they intend to do with the sequel that is in the works.When I played this I literally could not stop until it was all over. It was so emotionally charged and engaging that I stayed up all night to finish it and I really love sleep. There were so many moments in this game that made me cry (in both the sad and the extremely happy ways). It has the feel of many SNES RPGs so if you played a number of those growing up it will manage to pull at those nostalgic heart strings as well. Play this game. It's cheap and doesn't take long to complete. It's such an amazing experience that I could not imagine I would willingly pass it up.			"

												A game that has to be experienced, it has more humanity and is more affecting than most movies, music, or literature today - a true diamond amongst rubbish if  you can get past its shortcomings.The gameplay is very tedious and boring, looking objectively, and it was at times frustrating, but for me it was still worth the thousand clicks and badly programmed movement.The writing was a little amatuerish, I can't help but feel like it was on purpose though. I don't think the writing and dialogue was supposed to be adult and mature. I pretty much ignored the, at times, childish dialogue and focused on the main part. I still believe it is worth the tiny investment of time and money. Thumbs up!I think there is a 2 mini episode game Sig corp that has been added to the game, I haven't checked it out yet and I don't know what it is about.			"

But once you fall into the world of mystery that surrounds this game, you quickly become involved in a story that will leave an impressionable memory and have you wanting to reach for the story once again. Now if you are after action or involvement with a whole heap of WASD key bashing then this game does not suit that purpose. But if you are after a quiet evening and are ready to be involved in an amazing story then 'To the Moon' will be exactly what you are after.The only hiccup I have with this game is the puzzle sequence and found that it is Freebird's way of calling this a game. Whilst I do enjoy walking around talking to people and exploring the environment I found that the puzzle part wasn't exactly needed in the end development. Personally I love the piano and this game hits all of the perfect tones for the emotions it's trying to set. The music to this game plays a big part to each area you walk into and sets the mood very nicely. I don't want to give too much away as the mystery of the game is the gem in itself, but I promise you will find a connection to every single character that you find in the game.This is a game I know I will come back to in years time to come, just so I can listen to its story once again like any great book.

												This game is really more than a movie than a game. Well, an interactive movie. The game play itself is rather uninteresting, but the story is this games strong point. It starts at the death of an old man and slowly rewinds his life. You learn about why he is the way he is now. It's truly an amazing story filled with intiguing twists.			"

												This game has been in my library for quite some time, only when a friend recommended this that I started playing it one bored afternoon. I'm quite open to games but nonetheless I honestly thought this game was going to be boring after browsing through the store page. But seeing that it was recommended to me and that it's also got great reviews, I decided to start it. I didn't know what to expect, the game starts off a bit confusing as it's premise was very new to me, and I'm sure it  will be as well for some of you. What caught my attention and....emotions was the characters, their decisions, motivations and story. It all got me curious and I continued on wanting to learn more as I also got attached to them, some scenes are very heartwarming and sweet and others are innocent and depressing. The way the story is laid out in terms of memory links creates a very interesting and strong medium that makes it very easy to relate and observe the characters from. The game was never frustrating and you'll definitely find yourself pausing occasionally, if you're like me that enjoys a good soundtrack whilst revering the scenes and characters.This is certaintly a great game, if you are looking for a great story, short game with a great soundtrack, I'll also highly recommend this to you.

“The ending isn’t any more important than the moments leading to it.”To the Moon is a story driven RPG game, developed and published by Freebird Games. You play as Dr. Watts and Dr Rosaline, employees of Sigmund Corp., a company that invented a machine that can create artificial memories by traveling through the memories of the subject. Their job is offering wish fulfilment to dying people, since implanting memories conflicts with the patient’s real memories, only people near death may request to have the procedure. Their patient today; Johnny Wyles, an old man with hours to live. His last wish; to go to the moon.Story:You know that scene at the start of Up where there’s the 5 minute montage of Carl and Ellie’s life from when they were kids, through their marriage, then when they were old? And it’s the saddest♥♥♥♥♥♥you’ve ever seen? To the Moon is almost exactly that.I’ll say right off, if you’re not into story driven games, don’t buy this game. To the Moon is all story, and light on gameplay. If you’re looking for good characters, great dialogue and a touching narrative driven experience, go ahead and pick this one up.With that out of the way, To the Moon is one of the most sappy, mushy emotional games I’ve ever played. And I mean that in the best way possible. To the Moon had me in tears. And if it doesn’t do the same for you, well, you’re probably just a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. In all seriousness, this is a game that will tug on the heartstrings. This is one giant feels train and a half. The story may be a little cliché at times and some moments are a little predictable, but that didn’t stop the game from being one of the most touching gaming stories I’ve played.One of the things that most caught me off-guard about the game was how funny some of the writing was. I don’t think I’ve ever played a game that had me tearing up in one scene, then laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off the next minute. The writing is great and although some of the humour has varying degrees of success, especially some of the pop-culture references, the vast majority of it resonated with me. “FREE PONY RIDES IN SPAAAAAACE!!!” Also, “You never cockblock someone in the middle of a Kamehameha.” To the Moon is a short game, clocking in at around 3 to 5 hours at most. It’s undoubtedly short compared to most other story driven games, but given its price (a steal when it’s on sale) and incredible story, the length of the game is justified in my opinion. It’s a game that’s as long as it needs to be.


The promise. 
A Screenshot of To the Moon
By: Sergio




Gameplay:Gameplay mostly consists of point and click style exploration and tile solving puzzles. To the Moon is about as minimalist as it gets without being a full-on visual novel. Whether you’re fine with that is up to your personal preference in games. Puzzles were fairly simplistic and most of the hidden objects you need to find to progress to the next scene are easy to find. Controls were somewhat finnicky, mostly down to the fault of the engine the game was developed in. Movement and interaction with objects in the environment at times was awkward, sometimes your character won’t move at all despite on clicking the object.Whether To the Moon is classified as an outright game or interactive entertainment is an argument for another time, but given the limitations of RPG Maker and the small indie team that developed the game, the lacking gameplay is mostly made up for. Just don’t go in expecting revolutionary game mechanics and you can get by it.Graphics and art design:Given the limitations of RPG Maker, it's somewhat understandable that most games that use that engine are hindered graphically. “Every RPG Maker game looks the same” is a common phrase, but still one that rings true. To the Moon is no different, it’s and RPG Maker game that looks like every other RPG Maker game. It by no means looks bad, the game looks perfectly okay. The game uses what it has to work with, and from a graphics standpoint, it’s acceptable. Perhaps it could have looked a bit nicer had the game been able to run on higher resolution monitors (the game is stuck at 640x480 and locked at 30fps, something else you should take note of if that concerns you.)Soundtrack and audio:The soundtrack is fantastic. The “sad piano song playing at heartwarming/sad scene” cliché is true, but the music works so well. There’s great use of leitmotifs, songs that will make you smile, songs that will make you cry. There’s so many tracks on the OST I loved, though if I were to pick the absolute highlights they would be To the Moon – Main Theme, For River, Moonwisher, Moongazer, Take Me Anywhere,  Once Upon a Memory,  and of course the absolute tear jerker;  Everything’s Alright.Conclusion:If you’re looking for a game that is guaranteed to make you cry (unless you’re a soulless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥), To the Moon has you covered. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you might be an emotional wreck by the ending. Though it’s light on gameplay and some will debate whether it’s even a game or an interactive story, To the Moon is an incredible experience. It’s by no means perfect, far from it, but for experience you get, it’s hella worth it. A beautiful story, fantastic script and a great soundtrack, you should give this one a shot.

												There are certain games that leaves a horrific scar, be it for bad or for worse; and there are games which leaves an emotional scar, making the experience sweeter and satisfying. Do not let the RPG Maker tag deceive you -- To The Moon isn't an RPG: if anything, it's on the far-end of the spectrum, simply because the game has no combat mechanics of that sort. Instead, it relies on something triple-A games sorely lack and aspire to achieve: a player-invested story built upon multiple layers. And the game wears it like a proud dogtag. What should be the focal point is always the story. About two ""doctors"" that help a man relieve his dreams again, eventually finding out the entire cause of it, and granting his wish of making it To The Moon. The game straddles the line between hope and despairity; loss and gain; tragedy and happiness -- all in under five hours (counting the 2 minisodes which are absolutely must-plays). To The Moon is an all-round experience that leaves you wanting more, and hopes that after you've gone through all the sobbing tissues right by your side, that you still have a bottle of scotch waiting for you once the game ends. Because trust me: you'll need it. Brilliant story, brilliant soundtrack -- To The Moon is one of the best gaming experiences of all-time.			"

												Breathtakingly beautiful.I have just finished playing through To The Moon and I'm still shaken from the experience. I was in tears for a good 30 minutes. It's hard to describe why it affected me the way it did, just as it's hard to write a review/recommendation for this game.At it's core To The Moon is a very simplistic game. You walk around clicking the spacebar to find out about certain objects or to go through hours of dialogue that this game has to offer. That's it.However, this is some of the finest, best, most emotionally touching dialogue I've ever seen in any game, ever. The themes of death, love, loss, disease and inner battle are all addressed so well, it's actually quite surprising. It proves that video games stand on their own as a wonderful method of storytelling, because this story couldn't be told through another medium.As you can read on the Steam page it tells the story of two doctors trying to fulfill a dying man's wish. The pair travel backwards through his memories to see how they alter the future to make his dream come true... And that's all that can be said without spoilers.Unfortunately this means I'm going to have to leave this ""recommendation"" on a simple ""trust me"" basis.So, trust me, this is a game you want to experience.These are three hours of your time that will impact an touch you emotionally in a way you probably haven't experienced in a game before.And lastly, this game will really make you think about your life and your choices.There is no one I wouldn't recommend this game to. Even if I don't know you personally, I still want you to buy this game and let it affect you the way it affected me. Hope this convinced you to purchase and play through this brilliant story telling masterpiece.			"

												Time spent: 4.6 hours from December 23 to 26 (at almost midnight!) This review however is done at around 12 am on Dec 27.To the Moon is a highly crafted and excellent art game. Its key points are its story and music, which are both well made and very engaging. Starting off with the art design, it feels like a retro RPG with pixel art and illustrations. These things are not terribly different from other games, but drives the point of the story very well. It can feel a bit bland and like a freeware RPG, but the art is for the most part stylized with the pixel art style and great art pieces with a good retro effect and being well connected to the story.Next up is the music. From the start in the title screen, the music is already carrying emotion to it, and the entire soundtrack is done very well. The music carries an instrumental feel with some more ambient or whimsical touches depending on the current mood. Laura Shigihara does have a track in this game, and it also has great emotion and musical quality to it. By carrying emotion and being well composed, the soundtrack of this game is very good and drives emotion in tandem with the story.Last is the critically acclaimed story. Like most people say and what I did, go into this game without reading any spoilers. The game does make you sad like others say, but also laugh, smile, and keep you on the edge of your seat. Without giving any potential spoilers, it is a well done story with many captavating moments for an excellent game. The gameplay is more like a visual novel rather than a pure RPG. Exploration is the bulk of the game, which is good to drive the story and keep you engaged. Now and then, some other gameplay is given like puzzles to break up the story flow a bit. Although the gameplay isn't much, the story is the game's main attraction that is worth the experience for.To the Moon has to be played to experience it in its glory without breaking it with spoilers. The music and story are strong in this game that they evoke many emotions from start to finish. It gives an amazing experience that people should really try out, for its story and music are well crafted in a kind of RPG visual novel.			"

												9.5/10I've always thought indie games were just the cheap way of making a game and after this game, I lost that view entirely. I bought this because it was on sale and I wanted to try something new and short. I did not expect this game to be as great as it was and only started it out of boredom. I'm so glad I did. **The reason my hours are shorter than most is because it was played on offline mode most of the time**The story is unique with many plot twists. The company doesn't put too much work into gameplay because it's the story you are supposed to focus on. If you expect it to be a full shooting and destroy everything game, you'll get a few puzzles for your enjoyment. You play as Johnny and has a very quiet wife, and although she doesn't say much she is one of the most loving characters in the game. The graphics are also quite nice in an indie way. You CANNOT play this game in long breaks, it's one you'd want to continue and even if you didn't, the ending is cute so go play to the end anyways. I've recommended this game to three people so far, and all three love and enjoyed it as much as I did. It's simplistic gameplay with a strong story makes one amazing game.			"

												Honestly before you read this review consider that I have been playing it for 4 hours straight because I got so caught up in the story.First of all the story, kudos to the guy who wrote it. Although it was confusing in the end it all made sense and it turned out to be a very nice story.Second of all the music, very well chosen and it's worth listening to. Even somewhere in the middle of the game I recall I heard a women singing a song and I really want to know what her name is so I can lookup more music from her.Next we have the main characters, the two mains were really the classic combo that this game could use. One of them is very serious and the sentimental type and the other one is the joker, although another side gets revealed later on in the game. At one moment I really felt that I want to scold the gamemakers for one of the decisions made by one of the main characters. But after completing it I felt different and felt like it was better that way.Unfortunately the movement was a bit wonky. Either decide between using point to click or moving with keys but don't use both in a game. Another small downside is that there are some repetitive mini games in the game itself. I found that annoying honestly.But if you want to play a game with a pretty good story with a twist I consider you to pick it up for the cheap price it is.			"

												A little game that could, To The Moon proves that even with humble beginnings one can surpass the best in so many ways that really matter. It's not held back by its RPG Maker roots, short of iffy controls at times because of mouse implementation, and is one of the rare games made with it that actually show just how much can be done when motivated people take things seriously. There is little in terms of gameplay and the game handles like an on-rails adventure, but the story is what truly sells it. I think the highest praise I can actually sing about To The Moon's story is that it's one of very few games that, as far as I remember at least, actually made me take a deliberate break just to process everything. Subject at hand is handled masterfully and emotions overflow throughout the game as things fall into place - so much so that if it doesn't stir SOMETHING in you by the bitter and yet extremely satisfying ending, you've probably completely missed the point. Or you're not a human being.			"

												This game is so very touching. It's not realistic or logical (but it's not meant to be either).It plays like a dream. Imagine how dreams can be rather senseless and illogical, but have that special, mystical feeling to them? Well, that is how this game feels like.This is not to say that the story doesn't make sense, because it does (for the most part).So the story takes off with a patient (i.e. Johnny) at old age - on his deathbed - and wanting to fulfil his desire of going to the moon.But how on earth is a man of such age to achieve such a thing?Well, that's where a brilliant duo of doctors (aka Dr. Neil Watts & Eva Rosalene) come in.They specialize in the art of memory-alteration, through use of a sophisticated machine, which is then connected to a patient's head - via a helmet - so as to grant them access to their patients' memory and alter their memories (as needed).The game is played in a chronological, linear fashion (meaning, there's a certain routine to follow), which involves hopping from memory to memory, by interacting with mementos (i.e. items of sentimental value to the patient) which serve as a 'bridge' between one memory and the next & triggers the time-travelling process, within the patient's mind.It's interesting to note however, that time-travel occurs in a backwards fashion (meaning, as you play you get to see the patient at old age first, and then hop back in time to a younger version - again & again - till a certain age is reached).This is done for the purpose of creating a point of 'ignition' (in regard to Johnny's end-life desire of 'going to the moon'), meaning; the two doctors look for an ideal timeframe within Johnny's past to alter his memories, so as to encourage the fulfilment of his dream.Mementos (encountered within the patient's mind) have to be 'activated' in order for them to serve as a 'link' to a specific memory. This is achieved by touching them & going thru a process of solving a mini-puzzle.The puzzle is of the 'tile'-type (where tiles are flipped in a methodical way so as to have them form an image - this is always an image of whichever memento is being worked on at that moment).Also; these mementos are wrapped inside a protective bubble and have to be 'released' thru a certain mechanism, which is achieved thru the collection of so-called 'orbs' scattered across any area (i.e. school, home, yard, etc., ... ) that is up for exploration within the patient's mind.Whether or not Johnny's dream is eventually achieved is left for the player to find out at the end of the game (no awful cliffhanger there, phew!).The way the story ends, does make way for yet another episode (and hopefully this will be the case!).There was such clever use of sound, music and words that created a beautiful experience and atmosphere maintained throughout the whole game.Admittedly... it had me crying. The music, the story... the characters. Ahh... I love when a game has that effect on me - that's why I ultimately play - to have a good time. And I sure did!NB I played this game with a Steam buddy and that impacted my experience positively (it's one of those games that serves as a great way to bond and share the many 'feels' evoked by the story).UPDATE - NOMINATION:This game should be nominated because:- the plot in itself is very endearing (i.e. clever use of sound, music, scenarios)- the plot unfolds in a very original manner- it touches upon real-life issues with a fun sci-fi twist- gets you thinking about life, stimulates the mind & pulls quite a bit of heartstrings!

												An absolutely fantastic game. I don't care if you like simulators, if you like atmospheric, free roaming, story based, or horror games. I don't even care if you even like games, period! this is, by far, the greatest game I have played yet. It makes you laugh, it can defenitely make you cry. but most of all, it makes you feel things that will lighten up your heart. 20/10, will play many more times.			"

												absolutely amazing game, well I guess I wouldn't really call it a game as much as a story. I cried tears of sadness, my heart broke, then I cried tears of happiness. This game is about 2 doctors who give a ""last wish"" in a form of a fake memory to those who are on their death beds. As you dive deeper into Johnny's life you learn so much about him you would never expect. It's very real/true to life on SO many levels. I HIGHLY reccommend this game to everyone.

												To the Moon is a pretty interesting game. It's short, the puzzles aren't hard to solve at all, and there is barely any gameplay to it. What it does have is an amazing story with a bunch of well written and interesting characters. It also hits a perfect balance between comedic and heart-breaking moments that feel natural as you get to learn the history between all the characters in the game. To the Moon is definatly a game worth checking out.			"

												This was probably my favorite game ive played this year. It was brutally beautiful, like watching the first thirty minutes of Up backwards repeatedly - in a good way. Also, do not buy this without the soundtrack, which is equally gorgeous. Graphics and art style were very reminiscent of Chrono Trigger, though the controlls were a little clunky, like some of the other less well designed SNES titles, and the few puzzles were far too easy. But the story, art, and music's amazingness completely eclipsed anything that could be found wrong elsewhere. I was completely blown away. You must play this game, if only to watch your soul shed a few scars, and your heart become a little less cold.			"

												This game has the BEST story of any game I've ever played. I read a lot of reviews about this game and all of them said that it had the saddest ending of any game ever. At first I was like pfffft yeah right and I was very hesitant to buy it. I randomly bought it yesterday and played through it in one sitting. It's about 4 hours long. Let me tell you this, this game has the saddest, most amazingly written story of any game I've played, any book I've read, or any movie I've seen. If you don't shed a tear by the time you've finished playing this game I refuse to believe you are a human being. The way that everything plays out and the soundtrack the accompany the setting go perfectly together. I know that 10 bucks seems like a little much for a 4 hour game but this is not just a game, it's an amazing piece of art that I think everyone can enjoy.			"

Well, to call it a game, would not do it proper justice, more like an experience that tugs at your emotional and intellectual strings.The experience is short, but well balanced. The puzzles are simple and do not deter from the story. I wish more developers took the time to make experiences like this more prominent!Thank you for making this moving and artistic masterpiece!

Never before has a game gotten me so immersed that I was forced to play half of it through tears. Simply beautiful, I'm still teary-eyed.

												-CONTAIN SPOILERS- This game had one of the greatest storylines added to an 8-bit game. (Short summary, two employers of a company named ""Sigmund Corporation"" help an elderly named John Wyles fufill his desire to go to the moon.) Now these two are to travel through Johnny's memories collecting energy from specific objects to get to his earliest memories. That would allow them to plant artifical memories, making it seem like he had the desire all along and had already acheived it. Understanding this, I had a feeling it would be another typical game, just a bit different than the other ones. Oh how was I wrong.This story had much more feeling to it, much more meaning. It's so weird knowing how it all is going to end, yet looking forward to the process of getting to that point. Looking into a person's dark past is really heart racing, really shocking. I'd have to say a few of the most shocking things in that game were; (not in order)1) Finding out River had Asperger's Syndrome.2) This should have been obvious but I didnt quite catch it, Johnny having a deceased brother.Another great aspect to this video game was the comical moments to sort of relieve the tenseness. Nicely timed, not too silly to ruin the whole development but not too ""ha, not funny"". Eva was so cute in her little battle against a squirrel. hehe.I'd also say the artwork was beautiful, and the backround music was a giant bonus. (Especially because they use the piano as the main instrument, no words needed to set the mood. ) For River (Johnny's Version) & For River (Sarah and Tommy's Version) is definitely a recommended song! The only unsatisfying part to the game is the ending. I felt pretty empty and left confused at it. Episode 1? What is there going to be a series of games? Is this Final Fantasy? (It's never final, lol.) And how the screen flashes like they are still in a memory, whaat? Well, it was intended to confuse the audience but it left me irritated. Well enough of me rambling, I conclude that this was a wonderful game and I definitely recommend.Yup.			"

												To The Moon...It was short; it only took me around 4 hours to complete. Despite being an RPGMaker game, there's no combat anywhere; it's almost entirely story driven, with a handful of puzzles here and there. Said puzzles were simple, yet rather entertaining. The story is very unsual, though not entirely unique; these sorts of ideas appear from time to time.But above everything else...the feels!I got quite emotional at times, which is rare nowaday.I'm very much glad I decided to play this; it's lovable and memorable.

												Although the gameplay is not the best around, I can safely say it accomplishes what it wants to. To tell a story.The music is as great as it gets and the language - the characters' dialog, even their body language - offer a unique story-telling experience, backed up by the simplest game mechanics a game can have. I'd primarily tag it as a novel, always leading only to one possible outcome-ending, thus no choices are made by the player.Great game. Can't express enough how much I loved it. I recommend it for all the people to experience it, though I believe the story itself targets the more grown-up, or, might I say, mature gamers.			"

The music, the atmosphere, the witty dialouge and the heart-melting story of Johnny and River is one that I will not forgot. The ending left me speechless as I was in tears. Never has that happend to me before from a game, nor a movie. The events have made me think about my own life what I should do with it. I found myself relating to Johnny's memories, wishing I had talken a different path. This game is augmented by a breathtaking soundtrack that sets the tone for scenes. The song ""For River""/""To the Moon"" will be one I listen to over and over while I contemplate my life as I am reminded of this game. This probably sounds very corny, however I speak the truth. Give this game a chance, play it alone and turn up the volume. It will grow on you and you will not forget the story of Johnny and River.			"

												This isn't my typical game. Between stealth games, first-person shooters and action RPGs, I don't frequently delve into the ""interactive story"" game genre. I was almost embarassed to put the game on my wishlist, given how cheesy and pretentious the trailer looked.With that out of the way, I have to say that To The Moon does its job really well. The premise is interesting and the execution is even better, with a strong plot throughout that feels unique. The characters are especially well-written. Some have complained about Dr. Watts disrupting the feels, but I enjoyed his humor and I think he kept the game from becoming too full of itself. (Whenever I thought something was cheesy or pretentious, Watts was there to back me up). The later parts of the game were mind-blowing and very emotional. The story is great!The graphics look old and ""nostalgic"" (which actually ties into the story, if you think hard enough), but are still quite detailed and very pretty backdrops for the key story moments. The soundtrack repeats itself a lot, but is still very good and always fits well with what is currently happening in-game. Actual ""gameplay"" is mostly minimal, but there are several special sequences where gameplay is used effectively to convey emotion. Every part of the game strengthens the story in a big way.9/10Wear a helmet			"

												Great story with terrible graphics (game runs on a stupidly small resolution with no options to change that). The gameplay mostly consists of walking around, clicking on things and reading the dialogue. But the writing is excellent. The story is about a dying man whose last wish is to go to the moon. You play as the employees of a corporation that is capable of altering people's memories to give them the illusion of having a different life thus fulfilling their last wish before they die. The narrative unfolds in a reverse chronological order as you go back in time through the old man's memories, learning about his life and finding a way to make his wish come true. It's an interesting way to tell a story and it's executed quite well here.			"

												I was fortunate enough to aquire this game for free using Playfire Rewards. What a steal. I installed it and played around with it for about 15 minutes and thought it was just going to be a silly little RPG game that would be mildy entertaining. I was mistaken. ""I hate being wrong but love it when I am set straight"" - Harlan EllisonThese words proved to be true for this game.  To start off, I will say this game is less of a game and more of a story. A beautiful, masterfully told story. It is challenging to go into why this game is so great without spoiling it but I will say that it has much more depth than it would seem from some simple screenshots. So I'm going to try my best to describe the story without spoiling it. It is a very memorable adventure, featuring it's moments of grandeur, happyiness, silliness, and sorrow. The soundtrack accompanying this game is beautiful, yet a little repetitive. However it works for the game. The gameplay itself, or lack therof, is my main gripe. It consists of very grindy ""puzzles"" and tends to detract from the story rather than add to it. I found myself often rushing through them just to get on with the story. All this being said, it is still a near perfect game. The director, Kan Gao, did an extraordinary job making sure the game flowed well and felt satisfying at the ending. I would highly recommend this game as a short and sweet distraction from the world. It was much more fun than I was expecting. I await the sequel with great anticipation			"

												To The Moon is a game about 2 scientists/doctors who help grant the wishes of people on their deathbeds by altering their memories. They respond to a call from the caretaker of a man that wants to go to the moon, and so the scientists travel through his memories in order to alter them. It's very heartwarming and has a lot of depth. I would recommend it to people that love plot, a good soundtrack and science fiction that has to do with technology. It took me a little over five hours to finish it, so there's a good amount of gameplay and things to do.			"

												To The Moon is one of those games you instantly fall in love with. With it's simple, but elegant design, incredible writing, and thrilling, heartfelt tale. Beauty is a perfect word to describe it. The storytelling is masterful, and complex, and charming. The characters are lovable. You play as the two scientists who assist the man in the pursuit of his dream, and often act as the comic relief for emotionally tense situations. Much of the gameplay is a variation between puzzles and ""point and click"", however, I advise you buy the game on sale, as its only a good solid 3-4 hours when playing normally without guides.To sum eveything up, To the moon is a game I highly reccommend for people who love a detailed and great storyline, while also having a complex and incredible experience of emotions.

												This isn't my typical game. Between stealth games, first-person shooters and action RPGs, I don't frequently delve into the ""interactive story"" game genre. I was almost embarassed to put the game on my wishlist, given how cheesy and pretentious the trailer looked.With that out of the way, I have to say that To The Moon does its job really well. The premise is interesting and the execution is even better, with a strong plot throughout that feels unique. The characters are especially well-written. Some have complained about Dr. Watts disrupting the feels, but I enjoyed his humor and I think he kept the game from becoming too full of itself. (Whenever I thought something was cheesy or pretentious, Watts was there to back me up). The later parts of the game were mind-blowing and very emotional. The story is great!The graphics look old and ""nostalgic"" (which actually ties into the story, if you think hard enough), but are still quite detailed and very pretty backdrops for the key story moments. The soundtrack repeats itself a lot, but is still very good and always fits well with what is currently happening in-game. Actual ""gameplay"" is mostly minimal, but there are several special sequences where gameplay is used effectively to convey emotion. Every part of the game strengthens the story in a big way.9/10Wear a helmet			"

												I really enjoyed this one. It's more of an interactive story than a game, but it's kind of brilliant how that perfectly fits the story. It's about memories that have already happened and you're meant to observe with minor input. It's charming all around and when everything ties together you'll♥♥♥♥♥♥bricks... or maybe cry if that's a thing you do.Now to the complaints! The concept is bold and it's a great accomplishment that it mostly works as a video game. But while the dialog itself has personality, there are parts of it I really dislike. All of the characters (children and elderly) speak at an 18 year old age level. It's supposed to take place in the future, but they use lots of contemporary nerdy video game and anime references. I like how they try to mix jokes in with the sadness, but the out of character meta jokes feel lame and take me out of it.So I'd recommend it to people who already like games and are looking for something story oriented, heartfelt, and different. I'd like to recommend it to people who are less in to games (because they'd easily be able to cope with the limited gameplay), but I think the in-jokes would be too off-putting for them to take the rest of it seriously.TL;DR - Memento + Inception + The Notebook. There's a 1 hour demo, so give it a try!			"

												Yes, this is a sad but thoughtful game. After playing it, I don't even know whether I should be happy or not. Perhaps makers of this game want this reaction. When I entered the house and hear the song 'For River', I can feel the sad inside it. When I finished the first time leap in the old man's memory and meet the old man behind the house, I can even feel his loneliness. He just stand there watching the light tower and maybe he was thinking the old time he spent with his wife. Then every time I leap the memory, I come closer to the truth why the old man wants to go to the moon, and in the last memory, when the old man was a child and went to the festival with his mom and brother, when he went to that cliff far from the noisy party, saw the stars and moon and finally met River, my tears went out, just an accident changed the old man's life. Because that accident his mom lost her mind, he also lost his brother, and the most important thing, he forget the first time he met River and the promise he made with her. River had mental illness but she tried her best to let Johnny remember her. The rabbit, the moon, the light tower, even that toy and bag, every thing was shown to Johnny but he still didn't remember anything. Though at last two doctors finally achieve the old man's dream, but we all know this is just a fake. The past cannot be changed, the story of Johnny and River is still there and two doc can still remember that sad story. And of course as the player I can also still remember their hard and sad life. Two poor patients finally leave this world, but their story won't leave this world. Ehh, I seldom write a article but this game deserve a long article. I strongly recommend everyone play this game and listen to the song 'For River', which full of Johnny's love to River. And at last, just like River said, 'I'm happy now, that's enough.' I hope everyone can find their own happiness through their lives, no matter how hard life is, just don't give up, do what you most want to do, just like River and Johnny.			"

												Achievement hint: Play last chapter in English.This game is an excellent example for those ""graphich are trivial"" games. Basically, you do not much in the game, but it has a lovely and tragic story at the same time. What is more, it is like a movie more than a game. After I finished the game, I started to wonder about lighthouses. You experience an elderly man's life memories in this game from his last days to very childhood days, like the movie Memento. Yet, it is not that simple that it looks. The story has some surprises for you which make the game more interesting. Sometimes you may see yourselves in the game, or a scene you have. But I will not tell more about the story not to make any spoiler. I can only say that you need to be careful about some little details to multiply the pleasure. In addition, this game has beautiful music. I would recommend it for only the music even if the game was not that good (which it is by the way). Finally, its price is also reasonable. It is more reachable in sales. Additionally, I bought it with a bundle for a very low price. So, with a nice story and a suitable price, I would definitely recommend you to play this game.			"

												Fancy being punched in the heart without the pain? Then this is the game for you. 10/10This game will make you cry. Seriously, I tell people about it and well up while telling them about it. The way it tells its story is so good you will walk away feeling like you have seen a film. Buy it, play it, you wont regret it.			"

												I've played a lot of games, and I have to say this one had BY FAR the best story. no game has EVER commanded my emotions with powerful music and artistic elements in such a way before. playing this game, I cried harder than I've cried in a long time. and I laughed too. the gameplay was solid, the music was beyond perfect, the story was better than most movies, and the art was beautiful. 10/10. you need to play this game.

												There are certain games that leaves a horrific scar, be it for bad or for worse; and there are games which leaves an emotional scar, making the experience sweeter and satisfying. Do not let the RPG Maker tag deceive you -- To The Moon isn't an RPG: if anything, it's on the far-end of the spectrum, simply because the game has no combat mechanics of that sort. Instead, it relies on something triple-A games sorely lack and aspire to achieve: a player-invested story built upon multiple layers. And the game wears it like a proud dogtag. What should be the focal point is always the story. About two ""doctors"" that help a man relieve his dreams again, eventually finding out the entire cause of it, and granting his wish of making it To The Moon. The game straddles the line between hope and despairity; loss and gain; tragedy and happiness -- all in under five hours (counting the 2 minisodes which are absolutely must-plays). To The Moon is an all-round experience that leaves you wanting more, and hopes that after you've gone through all the sobbing tissues right by your side, that you still have a bottle of scotch waiting for you once the game ends. Because trust me: you'll need it. Brilliant story, brilliant soundtrack -- To The Moon is one of the best gaming experiences of all-time.			"

												An amazing game. It's not you're typical game, and it will make you question some things about life: like most empathy games. In about 4 hours, this game took me on a rollercoaster of emotions. From Dr. Watt making me laugh with his relevent comments, to Dr. Rosalene's pure determination to get the job done, and finally the tears that came on slowly from the realization that, nothing you did actually mattered, and John didn't really understand what River was trying to communicate with him. The ending might not make sense at first, but after a while of thought or looking at the wiki will only make the tale more heartbreaking. 10/10. I wish i could expericence it again.			"

												I stopped playing Mass Effect 3 for almost three months before I could finish it when I lost one of my favorite characters towards the end due to my own shortcomings. I leveled Cloud and friends for hours on end to try and keep her from dying (name held for spoiler protection) in FFVII. I replayed the same misison in Wing Commander II over and over to try and save Spirit. However sad I felt, it always was a game to me and never shed a tear. Not even close.Played To the Moon, and cried enough to rival that of my lifetime. Many may have missed the many many nuances of the story, and after completion I suggest reading up on it. This story takes reality by the feet and drags into the realm of Science Fiction. Every element, color choice, and dialogue is carefully placed to further the central focus of this game, the story. This emotional story/journey is the central focus (not gameplay, graphics, or gimmics) and is something so memorable. For me, I felt the tear jerking moment coming... but still caught me completely off guard. Excellent sound track. Bravo. Well done.Will play again when I actually man up and buy tissues.10/10			"

If you're looking for a short, easy-going game with charming characters and a heartwarming narrative, you can't miss this game. The gameplay itself is enjoyable, and although it's in some ways repetitive, it keeps you engaged with the fantastic storyline right until the end.Highly recommended.			"

 This will hit you right in the feels....and you'll be glad it did. Don't be put off by the way this game starts, I was, and I beg you to learn from my mistake.After playing through the first 10 minutes or so i quickly declared the game to be ""boring as hell"" and ""A magnificent waste of my time"", but when I stumbled upon it in my library again late yesterday evening I gave it another shot....and played straight through the night just so I would get to finish it, hell I even played the minisodes while I was at it.I would highly recommend this game to anyone, it might not give you that adrenaline rush some people crave but it will sure as hell kick you right in the feels, and you'll thank it for doing so. During this game I laughed, I cried, and most of all I just had a ton of fun. The graphis aren't great, and yeah, sometimes the controls are a little wonky, but the AMAZING soundtrack won't leave you any time or need to worry about that. From some of the very first scenes to the very end, the music grabbed me and pulled me straight through the just as well written story. I would honestly tell everyone to buy this game, take a day off, and just play through it in one sitting. At the end, you'll almost be a different person. This game tells a wonderfull story, and does so in such a way that no matter what you wanted to happen, what you expected, what you hated, what you liked, you'll still love it, just the way it was.This game definitely got itself a place in my heart, and I hope it'll find it's way to your heart too.

Also, you may like to have a box of tissues sitting next to you because you'll become snotty and face watery and it won't be pretty, but you'll love every second of it.

I cannot really tell you much about the game since the story should be experienced as a whole without any hints, but I can say that it is the journey of a man's life and how two scientists figure out why he wants to go to the moon, hence the title.This game probably could be beaten in one sitting, 3~4 hours.It gets you very emotionally invested in the characters, and the plot is very thick and rich with cool details and sequence of events of things that will tie in later that eventually come back to support an idea of the story. The use of the flashback and the overall mood and tone the game creates is unique and special.9.5/10, very worthwhile. Definitely buying the sequel when it comes out.			"

“The ending isn’t any more important than the moments leading to it.”To the Moon is a story driven RPG game, developed and published by Freebird Games. You play as Dr. Watts and Dr Rosaline, employees of Sigmund Corp., a company that invented a machine that can create artificial memories by traveling through the memories of the subject. Their job is offering wish fulfilment to dying people, since implanting memories conflicts with the patient’s real memories, only people near death may request to have the procedure. Their patient today; Johnny Wyles, an old man with hours to live. His last wish; to go to the moon.Story:You know that scene at the start of Up where there’s the 5 minute montage of Carl and Ellie’s life from when they were kids, through their marriage, then when they were old? And it’s the saddest♥♥♥♥♥♥you’ve ever seen? To the Moon is almost exactly that.I’ll say right off, if you’re not into story driven games, don’t buy this game. To the Moon is all story, and light on gameplay. If you’re looking for good characters, great dialogue and a touching narrative driven experience, go ahead and pick this one up.With that out of the way, To the Moon is one of the most sappy, mushy emotional games I’ve ever played. And I mean that in the best way possible. To the Moon had me in tears. And if it doesn’t do the same for you, well, you’re probably just a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. In all seriousness, this is a game that will tug on the heartstrings. This is one giant feels train and a half. The story may be a little cliché at times and some moments are a little predictable, but that didn’t stop the game from being one of the most touching gaming stories I’ve played.One of the things that most caught me off-guard about the game was how funny some of the writing was. I don’t think I’ve ever played a game that had me tearing up in one scene, then laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off the next minute. The writing is great and although some of the humour has varying degrees of success, especially some of the pop-culture references, the vast majority of it resonated with me. “FREE PONY RIDES IN SPAAAAAACE!!!” Also, “You never cockblock someone in the middle of a Kamehameha.” To the Moon is a short game, clocking in at around 3 to 5 hours at most. It’s undoubtedly short compared to most other story driven games, but given its price (a steal when it’s on sale) and incredible story, the length of the game is justified in my opinion. It’s a game that’s as long as it needs to be.


The promise. 
A Screenshot of To the Moon
By: Sergio




Gameplay:Gameplay mostly consists of point and click style exploration and tile solving puzzles. To the Moon is about as minimalist as it gets without being a full-on visual novel. Whether you’re fine with that is up to your personal preference in games. Puzzles were fairly simplistic and most of the hidden objects you need to find to progress to the next scene are easy to find. Controls were somewhat finnicky, mostly down to the fault of the engine the game was developed in. Movement and interaction with objects in the environment at times was awkward, sometimes your character won’t move at all despite on clicking the object.Whether To the Moon is classified as an outright game or interactive entertainment is an argument for another time, but given the limitations of RPG Maker and the small indie team that developed the game, the lacking gameplay is mostly made up for. Just don’t go in expecting revolutionary game mechanics and you can get by it.Graphics and art design:Given the limitations of RPG Maker, it's somewhat understandable that most games that use that engine are hindered graphically. “Every RPG Maker game looks the same” is a common phrase, but still one that rings true. To the Moon is no different, it’s and RPG Maker game that looks like every other RPG Maker game. It by no means looks bad, the game looks perfectly okay. The game uses what it has to work with, and from a graphics standpoint, it’s acceptable. Perhaps it could have looked a bit nicer had the game been able to run on higher resolution monitors (the game is stuck at 640x480 and locked at 30fps, something else you should take note of if that concerns you.)Soundtrack and audio:The soundtrack is fantastic. The “sad piano song playing at heartwarming/sad scene” cliché is true, but the music works so well. There’s great use of leitmotifs, songs that will make you smile, songs that will make you cry. There’s so many tracks on the OST I loved, though if I were to pick the absolute highlights they would be To the Moon – Main Theme, For River, Moonwisher, Moongazer, Take Me Anywhere,  Once Upon a Memory,  and of course the absolute tear jerker;  Everything’s Alright.Conclusion:If you’re looking for a game that is guaranteed to make you cry (unless you’re a soulless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥), To the Moon has you covered. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you might be an emotional wreck by the ending. Though it’s light on gameplay and some will debate whether it’s even a game or an interactive story, To the Moon is an incredible experience. It’s by no means perfect, far from it, but for experience you get, it’s hella worth it. A beautiful story, fantastic script and a great soundtrack, you should give this one a shot.

												This is the best story in a video game I have ever experienced.  The story made me feel so many emotions, whether it be laughter from the banter between the two scientists, sadness from the multiple depressing moments, or happiness from the ending.  The soundtrack is brilliant, fitting the scenes perfectly with virtually no lyrics except for the song ""Everything's Alright"" which appears near the end.  With subtle hints throughout the story, this game's story is just perfect.  The gameplay is weak, mostly just walking and clicking on things.  If you want a short game with an amazing story, buy ""To The Moon"".  If you want a game with lots of fun features and lots of variety in gameplay, this may not be what you are looking for.			"

												The following contains NO spoilers:A nicely told love story about an old man... a man... a teen... a boy and a girl... a teen... a woman... an old lady. The story follows two scientists that travel backwards through a man's memories while trying to find a way to input a new memory.I was surprised by the way the developers proved that telling the story backwards was the right way to do it. It's not only a thing of finding out how it all started but also understanding some bits of dialogue that although they didn't seem out of place, you couldn't truly understand at the time (even when you had no idea that they were important)I finished the game in about three hours and the lenght was spot on, it's well paced and frankly really good. Ps: I really think this could become a good short anime series (about 5 or 6 episodes long), I know it hardly has to do with the review, but it's just a thought that came to me.			"

												10/10 - One of the best gaming experiences of my life.This morning, I was browsing the Steam Store and spotted that To the Moon was on sale. Actually, I didn't know anything about this game, only that I remembered I had heard the title before and that it had received many positive reviews. So after a little hesitation, I bought it for a mere 1,59 Eur.Six hours later, the game is finished, its only achievement unlocked, and I can safely say that no game has ever touched me so deeply than To the Moon. At the end, I have to admit, I cried like a baby.The beginning was a bit of a struggle: To my taste, the game starts slowly. The visuals are ok, but too old school. There are many conversations between characters I don't know, and I have to move around with those characters a lot and touch items to activate events I don't really understand or care about. After a couple of minutes I thought I would quit, but there were two things that kept me in: the aforementioned positive reviews (I was still curious as to what this game would unfold into), and the music, which is brilliant and beautiful. So I stayed, listening to the music, and moving my characters around, touching items and making conversations.And then, the story started to unfold. Through the eyes of Eva and Neil, I was watching the memories of the old, dying John's life: love, sadness, mistery, tragedy, missed opportunities. And then it hooked me. By the time I reached the fair and watched River and Johnny meet for the first time in their lives, I was filled with so much emotions that I had to stand up and take a walk before I could continue.Maybe when I'll be lying on my death bed, I will call Sigmund Corp. and ask them to grant my last wish: make me go back in time so that I can pay the full price for this fantastic game.Edit - Two years have passed, and my opinions hasn't changed a bit, so I just nominated To The Moon for the “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award.

												I am a fan of old school games, pixel/8bit/16bit graphics, but this game just looks awful... Resolution is somewhere along the lines of 640x480, and when put to fullscreen, looks so pixelated... Other than that, it is nicely drawn, and could've been much better...Interface is also catastrophic, almost unusable... Controls are awkward (don't even try playing it on controller, although it does work), and irritating...So, after all that, why do I recommend it...Because it has a beautiful and touching story... And interesting soundtrack... But story is, just fantastic, and it is a game that should really be played for it...To bad, it doesn't shine on graphical and UI fronts, because it could've been a masterpiece...			"

When i started the game i was thinking of it as a same old school 2D game but oh when the piano music starts, that just touches your heart and you begin your journey as Johnny. Its a must play game for every indie fan out there. You'l never get bored and every memory will be stored in your mind for a very long time.

												The reason mainly why I recommend this game is because of the truly amazing and original storyline it has along with the character development regarding the introduced characters. This game (story) just never bores you. It has something that wants you to keep playing, something that wants you to explore more of the things that lay ahead of you. Humor, romance, adventure, puzzles and fantasy it has it all. Really worth the pocket money exchanged for the game. Not to mention the soundtracks. They are BEAUTIFUL. The soundtracks are just so overwhelming and so well placed in every scene, that you can't help to live with the characters. To have feels so deep that somehow your heart will bump against your chest painfully along with the pixelated tears that drop down your cheeks. It is unimaginable how much work was put into everything to create this splendid game of artwork, but what I can say is that this was truly one of the best games I've played on the Steam Community. To the RPG and Adventure lovers like me: surely try this out, especially if you're in for tearjerkers.			"

""But when I'm gone... Who is going to watch over us?""If you have a human heart that beats, then you need this game. The emotion you will have playing this game is intense, it seems so real. The way everything connected in the end, nothing was left unanswered. The message it provides also goes extremely deep, making me rethink everything. Saddest game I ever have played, and I can say without a doubt, the saddest game I ever WILL play. On sale or not, 10/10 would completely recommend. And I don't mean 10/10 as in a lot of people do with reviewing other games today, when they say that to every game that is good. I mean it sincerely, there's very few games like this out there, and I'm glad I got to experience this one. Even the soundtrack is amazing, which I 100% recommend getting along with the game. Anyone giving this a thumbs down just doesn't truly understand the gem that this game is.PS: Be ready to cry. And I mean really cry, not just have tears come to your eyes.			"

But re-loading solved the problem.I also recommend the two mini-episodes that come with it, which concentrate on the scientists. I don't think there's any way to load the game from Steam, but google it and you can find where they're saved on your PC.			"

												The music, which has been received very well as far as I've heard (pun!) since its release, alongside the storyline going along themes that people can relate to worldwide no matter the culture and age especially with the underlying themes of the game brings, for this reviewer, a connection or at least the prominent idea of the importance of many things everyone has in common in life--and the simplicity of experiencing existence, and memory.Personally, before playing this game amongst many other things, I felt cloistered and numb to most feelings (primarily due to depression), and coincidentally amongst many other things playing this (or at least listening to the music) helped quite a lot, and felt like breaking this 'shell' of being able to feel less, maybe because of the simplicity of its presentation or the humor [which may be different from person to person, as Dr. Watts can sometimes be a bit too silly], but all these add to the wholeness of detail in the game; lighthearted comic relief, and witty insight in turn. This game would be 'personal' too, on many levels with many people, as far as many reviews can note. Personally, I loved being able to feel--and personally, reflecting on the memory from all exposure within this game brought me to tears.Happy tears.Alongside touching experiences that are coming to society's eyes in recent note (Asperger's/Autism, etc), the game is also presents and showing its stuff rather than telling it all (given the dialogue and such) by letting you experience everything through the eyes of characters themselves, or at least those nearest to them to get their story.The Developers and their team are also very spirited and communicative folks! That's a major plus--including how they treat people, fan and otherwise alike.Would recommend this game fully--alongside recommending it for generations to come. The DLC (including the comic) are also worth the experience! (Wordless--picture only comic)E: My English may not be that good in writing this review! Apologies ahead!			"

The gameplay mechanics are simple that anyone can easily pick up and play. The graphics are simply wonderful and the music is literally enchanting. The game reminds me of Chrono Trigger with heart. To the Moon touches on themes that games haven't explored before in such narrative expertise. In a sea of games that claim to be ""experiences"", only a few have really pulled it off and most have left a sour taste in ones mouth afterwards. To the Moon destorys and prenotions you had about games with story and then wrecks your heart with amazing creative flow.I feel ashamed that I did not give this game a look before, and if you haven't played it yet, I deeply suggest you do.Verdict: WORTH IT.

												To the moon is a very nice 'visual novel' kind of game with a couple of puzzles, but with the main focus on the story.The story is about a dying man that has a final wish (yes, you guessed right, he wants to go to the moon). In this story there is a way to make this happen, but not in a 'story' kind of way, but as if you actually went to the moon.To make this happen two doctors travel backwards through the patients life to find his major 'triggers' that made his life happen the way it happened to ultimately change them to another path.I really enjoyed 'playing' through this game, because the writers not only wrote an excellent story, but also made sure it had emotion, humour and drama.For me this interactive kind of 'books' are a welcome addition to my library.

												Some of the negative reviews, or I should say most, are really petty and aggravating.  People complain about graphics, when graphics have nothing to do with a game at all.  If you get caught up on how many pixels are one the screen, you don't deserve to play a game like this anyway.  The story line is really addictive, the music is peaceful and relaxing, and the gameplay is smooth.  Not only did this game make me laugh on many occasions, it also mad me feel sad, angry, and delighted.  With a great story-line that keeps you wanting more, aesthetically pleasing scenes and artwork, and an ending that is all I can ask for in a game; I would have to say get this game.  Some other people said the $10 is not worth it, and I'll be honest, it might be too much for such a short game.  Though if you are willing to spend a little money on a great game, or can get it on sale, do it!			"

												This game really made me stop and think about my life. Where am I today? Where have I been & where am I going? I'm really questioning myself here...About this game: This game has a nice soundtrack, heartfelt story to boot but there is a lot of reading. Luckily I like to read and this game plays straight forward so it will progress smoothly for your pleasure. Definitely worth the money for a medium length game (depending how quickly you read & pick up on things).  Only con:  Sometimes when I pointed and clicked, the character didn't move, but it was minor. Tip: Have a box of tissues nearby....for um, your nose. No, I wasn't crying. Ok, I was :(			"

												A heartbreaking and beautiful story, and an absolute must play in my mind.  This should be made into an film...As for the gameplay itself... The controls aren't the best ( it is worth noting that it's clearly made for mouse play, so don't fret it when your gamepad doesn't work ) and at the start the gameplay isn't fully clear with the links and mementos (which again.. it becomes pretty intuitive), but none of this should stop you from playing this game.  It is absolutely worth playing despite any minor flaws.  As a side note.. there is only one achievement, and it is granted simply for completing the game.  This is actually quite perfect, because the only thing that is important about this game IS the story.  Enjoy it.  Don't expect a lot of gaming as this is just the chosen vehicle for the narrative.  Don't stress about missing anything.. you won't.  Just enjoy the story.  Also.. the music is great.Bonus points for all the nerdy pop-culture references.See you on the moon.			"

												Very interesting little game. It got a considerable amount of press when it was just launched, and deservedly so, as being an oddity in the market. An RPG Maker title without real RPG elements, without a usable inventory, without quests, without fighting mechanics (no, THAT part does definitely not count), and completely story-driven... no wonder many have erroneously tried to argue that ""it's not a game"".Well, it is and it isn't, I guess, if you use a restrictive and limited definition of what a game is. You certainly won't have a good time if the only thing you care about is graphic resolution or gameplay innovation. But it is certainly an experience that's worth having if you care about storytelling, infancy dreams, the mistakes we make as we grow and how our past and present are inextricably linked.			"

												I went into this game not expecting much out of it. It was cheap and I was bored. A lot of my friends had played it and said good things about it, and there's not much I can say in detail without spoiling, however, here are some criticisms and praises of the game.Criticism:The control scheme takes some getting used to, and you'll find yourself getting stuck on objects you didn't know you could. You can move by either clicking an area, or using the arrow keys on your computer (I didn't try playing with a controller or game pad). The game also tends to be a bit repetitive in gameplay, where you are continuously, until the end, doing the same thing over and over again to get more and more of the story. It's also a pixel art game, so if you're looking for amazing graphics, look elsewhere.Praise:The score for this game is absolutely amazing. I love all of the music from the game, and it is used to fit ambiance of the scenes very well. The game is very immersive in its story, where, if you take the time to care, you'll develop a bond with the characters as you traverse time. The overall story is absolutely amazing, and where the game lacks in overall gameplay, it makes up for in this story. If you're looking for an emotional, story oriented game to spend a couple hours on, this is definitely not a bad purchase. I'd most certainly recommend this game to anyone who wants a heavily story oriented game.			"

There are some mild puzzles but beyond that it's just you the player the story you are presented with, and what a story that is! I won't spoil anything but if your life is affected by the same thing in the story you will pick up on it before the reveal.Great simple (read catchy) music, fantastic story telling and pace and short play time with a price to match leads this game to being highly reccommended.Nominated for the “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Steam award			"

												*sigh*What can I say about this game. Well, I expected more, I feel empty.The story is good, it keeps you interested enough to keep on playing. It has some really interesting and totally unexpected plot twists. The characters are likeable, you can get attached to them. It also has some awesome references that I'm pretty sure everyone loves. Music is also great.Now, there are some small mistakes like I wanted options in the game. On fullscreen the game was slightly to the left, resulting in a black area on the right, wanted to switch resolution to solve the problem. The game also a bit loud, being able to control the volume would be nice. Controls are a bit clunky.Other things I didn't like. There are some holes in the story, I feel there are parts that requires explanation, things that the game doesn't tell you, where I feel it's necessary. I also don't get emotionally attached to River and John, at least not much. I honestly do not believe that they loved eachother. River was cold all game not even caring about Johns feelings, and I think she is selfish, while I don't think John really loved River, looking at the not looking up the illness of River, the girl was just a person who is not like everyone else for John. Since I felt no real love between them, I couldn't really grew to them. The story itself is emotional, but mainly because of the two doctors.I built up emotions, I wanted to cry but I couldn't. I'm not attached to John and River, so I'm not really touched by their death, despite the fact that I'm insanely emotional and it's easy to get me crying.Anyhow, all in all, the story is not bad, if you can buy that the two of them loved eachother, you are going to enjoy it a lot more than I did. It's not a Professor Layton: Unwound Future(the story that touched me the most), but it worths that 4 hours it requires to play it through.			"

Posted: June 2, 2014
												I recommend this game whole-heartedly.  I feel like I should say that before stating that I don't think it's much of a game at all.  There are definitely occasional game elements - puzzles, plants and zombies (oh, I get it now), and I'm very proud of the 97% hit rate I got on whack-a-mole - but To the Moon isn't built around any of that.  To the Moon is simply a story: an intricate, emotionally honest, well-crafted story that is an utter amazement to experience.  The rest of this (non-spoiler) review is entirely about the story.First off: the construction.  I have one criticism here, and it's that the beginning felt like it stretched a bit too long before diving into the meat of the plot.  Other than that, the story is uniformly excellent.  Characters are relatable and flawed and real, and they are expressed organically through the story - shown rather than told.  The pacing of the plot is excellent, as is the rhythm of the frequent beats of humor against the somber moments.  And the overall arc is deftly woven: nothing happens in the end that isn't earned in the beginning, and it is rather amazing how recurring jokes such as the jar of pickled olives are transformed into something far more meaningful by game's end.Second: the content.  At its core To the Moon is a story about the faith required to have any sort of relationship with another human being.  This is not a point that is hammered in; instead it is subtly expressed in moments spread throughout the game.  Moments where a character is lonelier with someone he loves than by himself.  Where a debate is held over the notion that caring for another can also be selfishness.  Where two people with an asymmetric understanding of each other (and aren't all understandings between two people fundamentally asymmetric?) struggle forward into the future based on nothing more than. . . faith.I don't think I can go into any more detail without dipping my toe into spoiler territory, and To the Moon deserves better.  I will say that it feels like the story has changed me, colored my notions of the world in ways I can't quite define.  Any game that does that deserves to be played.I have developed an (unfortunate) habit of including a fairly inane story at the end of my reviews on Steam.  I'm going to pass that up in favor of - again - simply recommending that you enjoy the story of To the Moon.  Here's an attempt at a topical haiku instead!-----------------------------------------The moon is an eyeAlways watching from aboveNothing else sees all------------------------------------------Yeah, you do better.

												To The Moon is more a story than a game. It's all about love, regret, sickness, sorrow, guilt, memories, hell even fun all those themes that gather around the pursuit of happiness for a real fairy tale. To The Moon is not expensive, it's worth giving it a shot and the money you use for the soundtracks goes to associations.For those who have tried or at least played old school games/RPG Maker, they'll find a true masterpiece here. Graphics, lights, mapping, musics, scripts, pictures, minigames... All you want is more of that but don't worry this is only the 1st episode.I greatly recommend this game for those who don't know what movie to watch at night, it longs about 3 hours, it's funny, interactive and lovely, just don't expect an action game, you'll have to be in the mood for some poetry.I thank all the team for the wonderful time I spent on this game and I can't wait to play the next episode. Keep up the good work.			"

												Time spent: 4.6 hours from December 23 to 26 (at almost midnight!) This review however is done at around 12 am on Dec 27.To the Moon is a highly crafted and excellent art game. Its key points are its story and music, which are both well made and very engaging. Starting off with the art design, it feels like a retro RPG with pixel art and illustrations. These things are not terribly different from other games, but drives the point of the story very well. It can feel a bit bland and like a freeware RPG, but the art is for the most part stylized with the pixel art style and great art pieces with a good retro effect and being well connected to the story.Next up is the music. From the start in the title screen, the music is already carrying emotion to it, and the entire soundtrack is done very well. The music carries an instrumental feel with some more ambient or whimsical touches depending on the current mood. Laura Shigihara does have a track in this game, and it also has great emotion and musical quality to it. By carrying emotion and being well composed, the soundtrack of this game is very good and drives emotion in tandem with the story.Last is the critically acclaimed story. Like most people say and what I did, go into this game without reading any spoilers. The game does make you sad like others say, but also laugh, smile, and keep you on the edge of your seat. Without giving any potential spoilers, it is a well done story with many captavating moments for an excellent game. The gameplay is more like a visual novel rather than a pure RPG. Exploration is the bulk of the game, which is good to drive the story and keep you engaged. Now and then, some other gameplay is given like puzzles to break up the story flow a bit. Although the gameplay isn't much, the story is the game's main attraction that is worth the experience for.To the Moon has to be played to experience it in its glory without breaking it with spoilers. The music and story are strong in this game that they evoke many emotions from start to finish. It gives an amazing experience that people should really try out, for its story and music are well crafted in a kind of RPG visual novel.			"

												Honestly before you read this review consider that I have been playing it for 4 hours straight because I got so caught up in the story.First of all the story, kudos to the guy who wrote it. Although it was confusing in the end it all made sense and it turned out to be a very nice story.Second of all the music, very well chosen and it's worth listening to. Even somewhere in the middle of the game I recall I heard a women singing a song and I really want to know what her name is so I can lookup more music from her.Next we have the main characters, the two mains were really the classic combo that this game could use. One of them is very serious and the sentimental type and the other one is the joker, although another side gets revealed later on in the game. At one moment I really felt that I want to scold the gamemakers for one of the decisions made by one of the main characters. But after completing it I felt different and felt like it was better that way.Unfortunately the movement was a bit wonky. Either decide between using point to click or moving with keys but don't use both in a game. Another small downside is that there are some repetitive mini games in the game itself. I found that annoying honestly.But if you want to play a game with a pretty good story with a twist I consider you to pick it up for the cheap price it is.			"

												A little game that could, To The Moon proves that even with humble beginnings one can surpass the best in so many ways that really matter. It's not held back by its RPG Maker roots, short of iffy controls at times because of mouse implementation, and is one of the rare games made with it that actually show just how much can be done when motivated people take things seriously. There is little in terms of gameplay and the game handles like an on-rails adventure, but the story is what truly sells it. I think the highest praise I can actually sing about To The Moon's story is that it's one of very few games that, as far as I remember at least, actually made me take a deliberate break just to process everything. Subject at hand is handled masterfully and emotions overflow throughout the game as things fall into place - so much so that if it doesn't stir SOMETHING in you by the bitter and yet extremely satisfying ending, you've probably completely missed the point. Or you're not a human being.			"

My OpnionThis is by far one of the best games I have ever played. Dispite being a shorter game then most, it pulls at your emotions more then any other game ive seen.Pros:+Graphics that compliment theme+Amazing music that pulls you into the game, expressing the feeling that the characters feel+Storyline that has sad, happy, and WTF momentsCons:-The space shuttle isnt capible of flying to the Moon, unless you refueled in orbit and had backup tanks on launch. Even then, its a stretch.FinalGet this game. You will not be disapointed.			"

												This game is so very touching. It's not realistic or logical (but it's not meant to be either).It plays like a dream. Imagine how dreams can be rather senseless and illogical, but have that special, mystical feeling to them? Well, that is how this game feels like.This is not to say that the story doesn't make sense, because it does (for the most part).So the story takes off with a patient (i.e. Johnny) at old age - on his deathbed - and wanting to fulfil his desire of going to the moon.But how on earth is a man of such age to achieve such a thing?Well, that's where a brilliant duo of doctors (aka Dr. Neil Watts & Eva Rosalene) come in.They specialize in the art of memory-alteration, through use of a sophisticated machine, which is then connected to a patient's head - via a helmet - so as to grant them access to their patients' memory and alter their memories (as needed).The game is played in a chronological, linear fashion (meaning, there's a certain routine to follow), which involves hopping from memory to memory, by interacting with mementos (i.e. items of sentimental value to the patient) which serve as a 'bridge' between one memory and the next & triggers the time-travelling process, within the patient's mind.It's interesting to note however, that time-travel occurs in a backwards fashion (meaning, as you play you get to see the patient at old age first, and then hop back in time to a younger version - again & again - till a certain age is reached).This is done for the purpose of creating a point of 'ignition' (in regard to Johnny's end-life desire of 'going to the moon'), meaning; the two doctors look for an ideal timeframe within Johnny's past to alter his memories, so as to encourage the fulfilment of his dream.Mementos (encountered within the patient's mind) have to be 'activated' in order for them to serve as a 'link' to a specific memory. This is achieved by touching them & going thru a process of solving a mini-puzzle.The puzzle is of the 'tile'-type (where tiles are flipped in a methodical way so as to have them form an image - this is always an image of whichever memento is being worked on at that moment).Also; these mementos are wrapped inside a protective bubble and have to be 'released' thru a certain mechanism, which is achieved thru the collection of so-called 'orbs' scattered across any area (i.e. school, home, yard, etc., ... ) that is up for exploration within the patient's mind.Whether or not Johnny's dream is eventually achieved is left for the player to find out at the end of the game (no awful cliffhanger there, phew!).The way the story ends, does make way for yet another episode (and hopefully this will be the case!).There was such clever use of sound, music and words that created a beautiful experience and atmosphere maintained throughout the whole game.Admittedly... it had me crying. The music, the story... the characters. Ahh... I love when a game has that effect on me - that's why I ultimately play - to have a good time. And I sure did!NB I played this game with a Steam buddy and that impacted my experience positively (it's one of those games that serves as a great way to bond and share the many 'feels' evoked by the story).UPDATE - NOMINATION:This game should be nominated because:- the plot in itself is very endearing (i.e. clever use of sound, music, scenarios)- the plot unfolds in a very original manner- it touches upon real-life issues with a fun sci-fi twist- gets you thinking about life, stimulates the mind & pulls quite a bit of heartstrings!

There's simply no way of explaining the feelings it invokes without giving away the story. It's warm, inviting and full of charm, but at the same time, it's honest, germane and very relatable. It's a five hour or so emotional rollercoaster that may well have you questioning your own life and aspirations. A true masterpiece.			"

And this piece of art doesn´t need these things. It has charm. It has a wonderful soundtrack. And most of all it has a magnificent story. It´s heartwarming and yet oh so heartbreaking! (heartwarking?)  From the way the story is told to the way the characters interact it´s beautiful and just amazing. Especially how the two characters Neil and Eva interact is oh so wonderful. Their relationship is dynamic, organic, human and so funny. Their dialogs are always a pleasure to read. And don´t get me started about John and River! Really I shouldn’t tell more. I made my point clear. You should totally buy this game. It´s worth it. It really is.			"

												Like many others, I bought this game because so many of my friends insisted it was a masterpiece. At first, I thought I'd made a mistake: while it had an interesting beginning, it seemed to go downhill from there. Up until the end of Act 1, the gameplay was repetitive and, of course, the story didn't make sense at the time.Act 2 and beyond changed all that. Suddenly, the story made sense! The story and the meaning behind it pieced themselves together in such a beautiful manner and in a way that I had never expected. Initially, I thought that going through a story backward was gimmicky and would make the story incredibly convoluted, but it didn't. Going through the story in the way it's presented gives everything new shades of meaning. It essentially functions as foreshadowing in reverse and it's incredibly effective. You see the pieces of a man and a woman's life come together. It's so interesting because you know where they end up before you know all those tender or tense moments that led up to them coming together.By the time the story had ended and the game was over, my heart was officially touched. The characters I had thought a little boring at first grew as characters by the end. Every single character had personality, even the minor characters that the main story isn't about. To me, the ending was satisfying. It brought up ethical issues over what the doctors in the game were doing and those issues are brought to light even further in the holiday special. To some, it's probably a happy ending, but to others it's bound to be a concerning ending. It all depends on how you feel about the events as they unfold.I have zero regrets about purchasing this game. It's been over a week since I've played it, and even just thinking about the game fills me with happiness and reminds me of all the great moments the game had. The story, the music, the humor and charm behind the game -- all of it creates such a positive experience that I honestly don't feel words are enough for it.Sure, this game isn't for everyone, but even if it's not your cup of tea, you'll probably get something out of the experience. And, even if it turns you didn't like it in the end, it's obvious how much love Kan Gao and his staff put into this game. It's definitely a game worth getting.			"

												Where do I start... At first, I thought this game was just going to be some cheap indie that wasn't fully functional and had very little detail to the story... Boy was I wrong about everything.Synopsis: The game is based around Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts who are employees of a company that goes by the name Sigmund Corp, the whole idea behind the Sigmund Corp is Fulfilling the wish of those on their death bed using technology that is capable of constructing artificial memories, and their challenge of fulfilling Johnny's wish of going to the moon. Throughout the story, you meet some quite extravagant and lovable characters, such as River. As the story progresses, you can't help but feel distraught about the struggle that River and Johnny had gone through in their life. If you're a fan of Indie RPG's with a hint of Adventure, Mystery and Drama, I really recommend you try this game out :). The genres work well together which ultimately makes the ending of this game a work of art which I absolutely loved.9/10			"

To even call it a game is an insult to the perfection radiating from it. To anybody who understands this reference (The Fault In Our Stars), I understand how Hazel felt about the ending to An Imperial Affliction. I need to find out what happens; to Lily, to Neil and Eva, to the *platypus*. I cannot wait for Finding Paradise, despite it being a different patient, we still get Neil and Eva, and their story gets to continue. I can only hope that they get a happy ending as well.			"

A touching, heartwarming story with an ending that is sure to leave everyone in tears of joy followed by blank stares at the screen in contemplation of your own life. It will improve you and your relations to people around you, and get you to appreciate every little thing there is, because you wouldn't want to change a thing.I've never cried at the end of a game before.

												To the Moon is one of the most unique, beautiful, and heartfelt game that I have ever played. I enjoyed every second of the game and found it to be perfect in length for the price. The music and scenery was relaxing and one of a kind. The characters are likeable and the feeling of seeing how someone's life unfolds is a different experience while playing a game. What was really nice was seeing the new locations and scenarios. 9/10			"

												To The Moon is beautiful. It is not about the visual itself that is beautiful but rather, how the story is presented. In this game, you play as two scientist/doctors who have have a very peculiar job, in which they give people another chance to live, all the way from the very beginning... but only in their patients' heads.In this game, they are tasked in fulfilling the dream of an elderly man, Johnny, who last wish is, obviously, to go to the moon. In order to grant these wishes that the duo needed to travel within Johnny's memory in order to rewrite it according to his wish, all the while learning on why he wanted that wish in the first place.The gameplay for this game is minimal at best. While using the 16-bit JRPG visual from RPG Maker, it is definitely not a RPG game. It strip down any reference to a RPG and can be more related to a Point-and-Click game, or a visual novel. They only gameplay it has is mostly memento finding and some puzzle solving and even then, it is simple.While it lacks in gameplay, it definitely make up in the story, which is told in reverse. It starts with Johnny on his deathbed, with more explained through his memories. As you learn more about your client, you will definitely feel more attached to him and starting to understand his feelings. Through this, various emotions such as joy and sadness can be felt by the players themselves, especially once they understand the whole story in the end. To put it in simpler words: The story is awesome.The game soundtrack is also very beautiful. Nothing can be said to the soundtrack besides the fact it fits the story very much. It does not only fits it but also enhance the experience of the game very much, making it very memorable.To The Moon is definitely not just a game. It is a storytelling medium in the form of a video game, and definitely one piece of evidence in showing that video game can be an art.			"

												A very beautiful game. Many call it ""story-rich"", and it's story is truly what makes this game. There are some flaws, of course, but the narrative of this game earns its rating. Lots of symbolism to be had, and hearts to be touched, but there's a good amount of humor to balance it all. Worth its keep.			"

												English Review :""To The Moon is a briliant simple game""Previously, several game sites rate this game for its beautiful story. And the game won awards for an indie game category. Come with curiosity, I'll tried the game ... and ... To The Moon becomes one of the melancholy and emotional game I've ever played. There is laugh, there is love, there is sad and sacrifice. Sometimes the game make me smile, sometimes make me sad and cry. For a game, To The Moon becomes one of a tearjerker title that ever exist.This simple game had premise with a sci-fi element become complex & brilliant from the begining. There is a dying old man had a one last wish before he die, he want to go to the moon. So this is a job for Dr. Rosalene & Dr. Watts, they can enter the memory of the patient looking for memory fragment and manipulate it. From the present time to the past until his child era. Reverse driven-story like this, remind me of a french movie directed by Gaspar Noe entitled Irreversible. For the gameplay, this one made by RPG Maker engine but diffrent. This is not a Fantasy RPG like the other one. But becomes an adventure game with briliant soundtracks and story-driven plot. Characterization in this game is so powerful and can give an emotional impact to player. Maybe, if this one not a game. Plot of this game can be a novel. And I can predict, its become a best seller title. But, if this one become a movie. I can predict, its become a box office movie which won several award if made seriously.Rating : 10/10 - ""A Perfect Game""Indonesian Review :""To The Moon adalah game sederhana dengan kemasan dan isi yang sangat brilian.""Sebelumnya banyak yang mengatakan bahwa game ini memiliki cerita yang sangat bagus. Dan juga menang beberapa award untuk kategori game indie. Dengan rasa penasaran, sayapun mencobanya ... dan ... To The Moon, menjadi salah satu game paling melankolis dan sangat emosional yang pernah saya mainkan. Ada tawa, ada suka, ada duka, ada cinta maupun pengorbanan. Beberapa kali sempat tersenyum dengan plot jenaka, namun di adegan yang lain mampu membuat air mata menetes. Untuk kategori games, To The Moon mampu menjadi salah satu tearjerker yang pernah ada.Premis cerita game berbau Sci-Fi ini sangat sederhana namun eksekusinya menjadi sangat kompleks dan brilian. Seorang pasien lelaki tua yang sudah akan meninggal dunia memiliki permintaan terakhir dimana dia ingin pergi ke bulan. Dan ini merupakan pekerjaan dari Dr. Rosalene dan Dr. Watts dimana mereka bisa masuk ke dalam pikiran si pasien mencari kepingan memori dan memanipulasinya. Dari masa tua, sampai kembali ke masa lalu di masa anak-anak si pasien. Cerita yang berjalan mundur ini, mengingatkan saya pada film perancis yang pernah disutradari oleh Gaspar Noe yang berjudul Irreversible. Plot cerita di film itu berjalan terbalik.Untuk masalah gameplay, game ini dibuat dengan engine RPG Maker namun sangat berbeda. Ini sama sekali bukan game fantasy rpg, seperti yang ada kebanyakan. Namun menjadi game adventure yang dibumbui dengan soundtrack serta plot cerita yang brilian. Bukan hanya itu, karakterisasi tokoh yang cukup kuat mampu memberi impact yang kuat terhadap player secara emosional. Mungkin jika tidak menjadi game, plot cerita di game ini mampu diangkat menjadi sebuah Novel yang saya prediksi bisa menjadi Best Seller. Dan jika menjadi sebuah film mampu juga mendapatkan Box Office maupun Award jika digarap secara serius.Rating : 10/10 - ""Game Sempurna""			"

												Great concept for a game, and decent excution but the controls and the main characters felt lacking.  I appreciated the humor provided by the scientists but I found the story of River and Johnny to be very forced and not relatable at all, when I found out why she actually died  (being autistic, she wanted to build a house next to a lighthouse instead of get medical treatment for some other life threatening condition)  i lost it...as someone in the medical field, this is the first time ive heard of someone with the condition dying from the idocy of their relatives...the premise behind the game is fantastic, i just hate the story that they decided to go with...the DLC fixed this issue largely by providing a new storyline but it is unfinished and is being released in small packages, I cant wait for the next installment for the DLC!

It was really unlike anything I had played before, and giving any details to the story would ruin the fun. Just buy this game when it's on sale, and it's quite a nice experience. If you don't like investing in short games, however; don't get it. I beat it in about 4 hours.			"

												I highly recommend this game to  everyone . Picking this very inexpensive $10 game is a guaranteed instant favorite. You will want to play this game start to end in one playthrough, and the next, and the next, and the next. A touching, heartwarming story with an ending that is sure to leave everyone in tears of joy followed by blank stares at the screen in contemplation of your own life. It will improve you and your relations to people around you, and get you to appreciate every little thing there is, because you wouldn't want to change a thing.I've never cried at the end of a game before. This was a first. It's no joke when I say 10 / 10. I would most definitely play again. And again. And again.			"

												Ahhh, To The Moon. The single best game I have ever had the great honour to have the privilege of playing. Such a short game, and yet so many hours I have spent replaying the masterpiece. To even call it a game is an insult to the perfection radiating from it. To anybody who understands this reference (The Fault In Our Stars), I understand how Hazel felt about the ending to An Imperial Affliction. I need to find out what happens; to Lily, to Neil and Eva, to the *platypus*. I cannot wait for Finding Paradise, despite it being a different patient, we still get Neil and Eva, and their story gets to continue. I can only hope that they get a happy ending as well.			"

												So, you're on the fence about buying ""To the Moon."" It's understandable, money doesn't just grow on trees. But, let's pretend you've got some money floatin' around, and you're looking for something good, something stimulating, but most importantly, something relatively cheap.""To the Moon"" is the game for you.Assuming the ending hasn't already been spoiled for you, this game will lead you through a (mostly) text-based adventure, wih plenty of twists that will more than likely cause you to finish it in one sitting. However, the brief nature of the game detracts nothing from the story - and believe me, the story is worth experiencing.If you're looking for something to think about, something to make you feel, or just something to immerse yourself in, ""To the Moon"" is a great game with plenty of suprises, incredible characters, and superb writing that will pull you inside it's world. This is one of the few games that I can truly say is worth playing and experiencing.			"

												This game i would recommend to any gamer that likes a good story since this have exactly just that. The story is well written with a good OST. Many that played this game have gotten emotional after the ending or right out cry just like me.The story is about an old man on his deathbed and his wish is to as the title of the game implies to the moon. Your job is to fullfill that artificially, by doing that you have to dive into his memories to find the reason as to why. You start with his memories when he is a old man then as you progress you get to the memories of when he is in his 50s and then 40s and then 30s and so on. But the further back you go the more you learn about him but you also learnt something that will change the whole thing. Well i won't spoil it, you got to play it for yourselves in order to understand.Pros:- Really good story- Simple but interestingly smooth- Beautiful OST. You get the feels each time you hear the OST again just like Key Visual Art's game.Cons:- Not a game for anyone that doesn't play games for a good story.- Can take some time to get into.9.5/10 This game is a hidden gem. If it had a high budget or got a remake with a much better engine i believe this game would get a lot of attention.P.S this game is 3-4 hours long.			"

												A game with a touching story and some goofy content. Although, there is a RPG element, there is no battle in this game.At first, you may think this is just a story about sending a man to the moon. Nope, this is more than that. For spoiler-avoiding purpose, i won't tell it here.There are mini episodes (free DLC) to keep you busy a little. But, it's unexecutable from the main game, so you have to search it inside the game folder.I'm looking forward for the sequel that based from ""A Bird Story"" called ""Finding Paradise"", it's still in development, though.

Get on the Feel-Train!Normally I do not play those ""little"" (2D) games, but I thought that this game won't dissappoint me, when it is on sale - And I was right.(without spoiling) ""To the Moon"" is about the dying, old man John Wyles who has the last wish to fly to the moon. The two scientists Dr. Roselene und Dr. Watts have an equipment with which they are able to project a memory in John's mind - to fullfill his dream. And while the two doctors put together the puzzle pieces of John's life, they try to figure out why the old man just wants such a thing as a last wish.At the beginning the story is a little bit confusing but that disappears after some time - so don't get unmotivated!++ beautiful story++ very nice soundtrack (worth to buy)+ nice design+ funny elements+ unexpected changes+ feel-train+ worth the moneybad aspects:- really short (4-5 hours)- the humor is sometimes a bit exaggerated- first and maybe also the second hour is a bit ""slow""- 1 achievement (will only unlock if you play the last part in english)To conclude:""To the Moon"" is one of the best Indie-Games in my opinion! This game actually triggered something in me, what made me think about it. But not for a hour. No. I was so touched, that a week later, it still brought tears into my eyes. I would be really happy if somebody of YOU will buy this to share this nice experience. A game which is beautiful and sad at the same time deserves: 8,5/10 "

I was totally blown away by the brilliant and delicate music and history of this great little rpg game.I have played through the story twice, and gonna go for my thierd time aswell. The emotions that builds up while playing this game, just forces you to shed some tears for especially one of the characters. The fine balance between too much and too little story-play is so fine tuned you rarely see such a good of a story in other games, both of this genre, and other.This recieves a good 10\10 from me, and 10\10 would definately play it over, and over, and over.Kudos to the developers of this game who truly knows how to make and tell a good story, and a big kudos to the music composer. This was truly a experience i would love to relive again not knowing what to expect.Warning: do not play through this in public, because you will shed some, if not many tears playing this game !			"

First of all, it's a point and click game, which can make it a little boring at times, and the controls and resolution options can be a little wonky. The small amount of puzzles were quite simple. The whole game is easy, but i really don't think the difficulty is the point of this game; rather, its strength lies in its story and character. The story kept me going even when i got bored of it, and there is just the right amount of suspense and curiousity in it. Perfect amount of suspense, because in the end it all fit perfectly. I got rather attached to the characters and setting. I finished this game in about 5 hours, so i will tell you this game is definitely worth your time, short playthrough as it is.

This is the type of game that gets you engaged with the story and characters and makes you feel the emotions that they express to each other. The plot of the story was thought out well and the events in each act were designed to keep you thinking. The story is very touching and heartbreaking but it’s totally worth experiencing this, with To the Moon. The soundtracks are so heartwarming that it’ll make you want to buy the soundtrack if you didn’t in the first place. This is a game that you can never go wrong with and has to be played and completed to believe in it.			"

												This is NOT a game. It is a story that is played through, without much action by the player. Think of it as more of a slide show on steroids where you get to click the conversation along. Very good storyline, I will rate the story a 10/10, which speaks alot. On the other hand, as it is like a movie, the actual playtime is averaged at 1 hour per playthrough and since it is story based, there is no replayability. My take? Get this if you are buying it on discount, but I definitely wouldn't pay a full 10 bucks for a 1 hour game with no replayability. Very interesting note - This game was made using the RPGMaker engine which can be bought as a separate program for people to make their own games.			"

												This is NOT a game. It is a story that is played through, without much action by the player. Think of it as more of a slide show on steroids where you get to click the conversation along. Very good storyline, I will rate the story a 10/10, which speaks alot. On the other hand, as it is like a movie, the actual playtime is averaged at 1 hour per playthrough and since it is story based, there is no replayability. My take? Get this if you are buying it on discount, but I definitely wouldn't pay a full 10 bucks for a 1 hour game with no replayability. Very interesting note - This game was made using the RPGMaker engine which can be bought as a separate program for people to make their own games.			"

												""To The Moon"" is an indie story-telling game.  It wants you to experience the events through The Good+ Deep Story-telling experience using 2d RPG-style gameplay with cute nostalgic pixel art+ Soundtracks+ Characters were fun and sometimes can be relatable.The BadThe game really has no major problems since it is focused on story. So the following are probably minor issues that I think could've been improved for perfect game design.- The controls are not customizables and are configured weirdly. For one thing, you can move the character using the ARROW keys on keyboard. That feels awkward when you want to use the mouse as well (since the mouse can be used to highlight the items you can interact with).(UPDATE) There is a way to customize the keys by pressing F1 during playing.- Character movement on the level is stiff. When you press once on an ARROW key to move, the character will move precisely one tile for example. You can't stop in mid movement so sometimes it feels hard to take turns.- Gamepad uses analog only. Would have been a lot better with D-PAD option.Final VerdictI highly recommend this game if you are interested in story. It is not a long game and might take you 4-6 hours at most. So you could probably think of this game as an interactive pixel art movie. If you are looking for gameplay only, then I do not recommend you to get this game.			"

												First of all, this is a very informal review. These are my thoughts after taking some time to take everything in.Alright. I have played a lot of games over the years. Be it on steam, console, mobile devices, anything really. Some for more than 10x the amount of hours I spent on this game. But there is no other title that I've played that deserves a full 10/10 rating. From the story to the soundtrack and everything in between, I absolutely love this game. And much like some of the other reviews, I really can't explain why without spoiling the story. At first, I was a little bit skeptical about getting the game. But the reviews I saw were amazing, and all in all it's only $11 CAD. Let me tell you, if you've got this far into this review and haven't got the game yet, buy it RIGHT NOW. It's so cheap and really is something to remember.**As a note, if you buy the game, plan on setting aside about 3-4 hours of your day. Once you get into the story, it really consumes you and you wont be wanting to stop till you complete your goal**			"

												A brilliant example how to tell a touching story in an indie game. Gameplay is lacking and along with visuals are very simplistic, but actually it's not bad for a small indie game made with RPG Maker. What really stands out in this game is the deep and memorable story about two doctors, who try to fulfill the last wish of a dying man. Characters are interesting, although there are no voice acting, but dialogs are well written and full of funny humour. Let's not forget the music, which is fenomenal and lets you really feel the story.ReDiR`s rating: 9.1			"

												The music is great, the concept of memory travel is interesting (Inception like).I wasn't expecting much, but it was on sale and reviews said it would be an emotional game (which grabbed my attention after Life is Strange).However, the story isn't good enough for me to feel invested, I could predict most of the memories and the writing was weak, which is problematic for a game who focus on storytelling with mediocre controls.I would give it a neutral score if I could, it's still much better than most games, but not compelling enough for me to recommend.

For the years I've known about the game I've heard nothing but great things about it, and while my expectations weren't high, even things I didn't have standards for were disappointing.The gaming mechanics were terrible, within the first ten minutes I had to navigate my way to the house because I kept bumping into flowers. A flower blocked my path. And this continued for most of the game, small objects blocking my way and I couldn't tell what would block me and what wouldn't. Lining up to interact was also hard as most things were off-center.The pacing was entirely too fast, I get that it's a short game, but there was no time to take anything in. Most of the gameplay is walking around and interacting with things hoping to find orbs to break an orb to do a puzzle to get 2 minutes of ""character development"" (I use that VERY loosely) and you do it over again.  This lasts for 16 memories.  There's literally nothing else to do in this time.The humor and dialogue between the doctors is extremely weak. For 2011 omnomnom and weaboo jokes were probably the norm and funny, but in 2016 I'm just cringing. Neil is extremely unlikeable and it got to the point where I started skipping most if not all of his dialogue because I couldn't stand to listen to him anymore.The horse part with no explanation kept me trapped for a good five minutes,  as did the Zombievas. I didn't realize I could keep using the attacks and got trapped in a corner, incredibly frustrated. The way the game treated River was also pretty terrible.  She had autism yet they talked about her as if she were a bug. With her ""condition"" and if she would ever be ""normal"" and to tiptoe around her, I hated John for most of it because he refused to try and understand his wife. He was offered many opportunities to understand her autism and what it meant for her socially, but refused the help. All he wanted was a nice ""normal"" wife and you could see him get frustrated with River for a mental disability she couldn't control or help. I couldn't take their love story at all seriously because John was such a terrible husband to River. She's autistic, possibly high functioning, talk to her for once instead of hoping it'll just disappear. I just couldn't feel any emotion for anyone because of all these things. I'm disappointed that I didn't like the game as much I thought I would, however I'm glad I only paid $2 instead of the full $10, it's definitely NOT worth $10.However, the pros are: The music is wonderful and River was the only character with somewhat of a personality and she was the only character I could really feel for, despite John constantly bringing her down. If I'd replay this for any reason, it'd be to study River's character more.Update after playing the minisodes: Even more boring and a waste of time, none of the characters developed and the open ended ending  with the possibility of Eva dreaming it all  was extremely underwhelming because nothing was done with it. There's a million unanswered questions and there's never going to be answers to them. I played out of curiosity when I should've just left it alone.			"

												I really tried to like this game; I had heard nothing but praise towards this for years so finally this sale I decided it was time to get it but I really just did not like it at all. So here is why:First lets start with the surface level reasons, the stuff that hurts enjoyment but could be looked over by those who enjoy it:Controls: The controls are just plain bad, if you use the keyboard the map is designed in a grid (as in 1 press up goes one block) however the actual design of the area does not make this clear, causing keyboard controls to feel floaty, as if when you let go of the button the character will continue moving until they reach the next grid block. The mouse controls a little better with characters auto moving to where you click, but when switching surfaces or rooms they will randomly stop despite having more to move towards; overall it just controls poorly.Art Style: I know this one is just an opinion and I'm sure many will disagree but I just really don't like the art style; I can't really put a finger on why but it just rubs me the wrong way.So now for the more pressing reasons why I don't like this:Dialogue: This game isn't funny; the character's say cutesy jokes and puns so so often (especially Dr. Watts) but they just arent funny, I cringed through so much of it. Overtime these characters progress and make jokes less often but it just feels like a blatantly obvious way of showing chracter progression, take a bland character and make them say jokes then stop saying jokes and it will make it feel like they differed greatly.Emotion: All of the big emotional moments felt pointlessly manipulative; often having important bits of information or character motivation hidden simply for a twist later.Theme: I also disagree with the point the game tries to push about manipulating the past to be happy but I wont go into detail because spoilers.Ludonarrative Dissonance: The primary gameplay mechanic is finding these glowing orbs to go deeper into memories, but how does wandering around looking for glowing orbs relate to the themes of manipulating the past or memories what so ever? These things are completely arbitrary, if there aren't enough inspectable objects in the room to attach orbs to the game will literally just give you them for walking around.Overall I really disliked this game, I really wanted to like it, and I have heard nothing but positive regard from others but I just cannot see why. And it isn't just a matter of me not usually playing this sort of game, all of my favorite games are the artsy slow type that your 'average gamer' would hate (Her Story, Gone Home, Pathologic, etc) but this just did not click with me.

												I'm generally not a fan of these types of games. When I first discovered this, I debated about getting this game for a few months, And only decided to when the game went onsale over the Steam Summer Sale.The game itself is very nice, I was intially intrigued by the idea of the game, I only further came to like the plot by having the perspective from the two doctors. The only thing I'm dissatisfied with is the cost of the game. Generally what I'd like to think is for every dollar you spend on a game, You will in turn get at least that many hours of lifetime on it. That being the case, The lifetime on this game is only going to span about 3-4 hours. For that reason I find it's rather expensive, The sell price should have been something around the $5 range.So while I would recommend this game to other people, And maybe even a few who aren't normally fond of this genre, I wouldn't advice buying it unless it goes onsale.

												A lovely jewel of an indie game. I've played it through three times, and with each subsequent playthough you'll form a deeper attachment to the characters once you fully grasp their initally mysterious motivations. If you enjoy a game driven by heartwarming sentimental narrative, beautiful music, and charming dialogue, then you should definitely buy To the Moon.			"

This game ... or better: story ... has a powerful magic to draw you into life ant it's meaning for the very basic things in life. Don't be surprised to cry when you follow the history back to when he first met this little girl - it's heartbreaking.

												One of the best RPG Maker games I've ever played, with some heavily emotional moments. If you're looking for an actual RPG, you won't find one here.This is a story driven point-and-click mystery game, with great music, and with some creative usages of the scripting tools that the software offers. Well worth the money, for an average of 4 hours to complete the game. Shame that it didn't offer multiple endings, especially given that the game keeps track of your overall score for the minigames, but doesn't end up doing anything with that. An extra scene at the end, as a reward for having a good record, would've been nice. Maybe that's something to consider for the upcoming sequel?10/10, right in the feels.			"

												Wow, this game is brillaintFirstly, don't be put off by the graphics. It looks like an RPG, but plays like an adventure game.While there are puzzles, which are somewhat basic, they aren't the focus in this game. This game is all about story.You take on the role of two people basically performing Inception on a client; jumping back through his memories to make him think he went to the moon. It's strange seeing the events play out backwards, but it's fun piecing it all together. There were a few moments where they game had thrown me off completely about the context of some events, making it all the better when they were revealed later in the plot. It's apparently also part of an episodic game so I want as many people to play it so we can get the rest sooner.Only bad thing to say about it; DAVID'S MAIN MORPH IS A LION.			"

												To be 100% honest.. I did not know about the game untill I bought it on steam by ""accident"".I bought it and tried it and I was stuck in the story after the first 5 minutes of the game.During my stream (I stream on twitch daily) I told my chatters that this could actually be a really good game.What I did not know was that the game had already been out for about 2½ year before I started playing.I will give the game following Puppy-Points after playing through the story twice:Story Mode: 10/10 - A really sad story that made both me and most of my chatters cry like kids who just lost their candy.Game Interaction: 9/10 - The way you move around, talk to other characters, playing around with the ""puzzles"".. Is amazingly well done / created. Good Job!Graphics: 9/10 - The animations, characters looks and the anumals in the game were really good looking. Animations on the main characters were stunning and you could actually FEEL what they were saying. Not just read it.Feelings: 10/10 - The feelings were following: Happyness!Start of the game was as it was supposed to be. Very humoristic and you got stuck in both Watts and Rosaline at first view. It made me really happy in the beginning that they had humor in this dark story (Yes I read the game info before I started playing). Sadness!The sad feelings came in at around 15 min mark when we started to know what was actually going to happen. When we realized that (SPOILER!!) the Lighthouse had such a big part in the story. Also that ""For River"" was a song that was going to be stuck inside you for the rest of your gameplay. AMAZING!Anger!Anger was something I felt during late-mid/late gameplay when I was thrown around the feelings for Rosaline and Watts when they were getting so close to their goal. What was I to belive? Happyness again!When we at the ending realized what has happened through the WHOLE story.. I couldn't bare anymore.The feelings fly throu me like a bullet and hit the heart twice.I have never been so sad about something happy ever and I will hopfully never be. Because thatf eeling was to be honest really damn scary.My Total points of the game will however end at 9/10.Why not 10/10? WHATS WRONG?!Following:The game is actually a game for kids / teens. This makes me wonder.. Is the story really going in at younger ages?I belive that people between 10 - 16 will have a hard time following the time-warps that takes place in-game. Even I (25 years old) had a hard time following this. (Hence why I played it twice).Also.. The story ends with (Sry.. no spoiler here).. and I am wondering.. What had actually happened here?Did it turn out well/good for both parts? Or was it just the one main character that actually had anything good out of this?After I played the game I went over to youtube in a flash and started reading about what people were actually thinking about the ending. And my god! So much argumentations about what was actually happening.I have however decided to belive that the good part of all of this belongs to myself.I have never played a game that short who has inspired me or touch me like To The Moon did.If you have not yet played the game.. Just do it. It will take you a maximum of 3 hours (depending on how much you will cry).If you have played the game.. What do you give this game as in points? I am intrested in knowing that. Maybe I can learn something that will make me put that last point into a full 10/10.Worth the money?No doubt - Hands down.Worth the time?Skip a movie.Worth the tears?Yes. Thank you, my dear developers, for making this game. I will play the rest of the games in the series very soon.You will hear from me again./ PuppyStream.net™ "

												Recommendations are usually based around opinions of the subject matter at hand. For games it has become common to break down the subject matter into categories. Things such as Story, Controls/Gameplay, and Graphics. Each one of these is discussed before giving a general overview or perhaps even an opinion, thus the recommendation. ""To the Moon"" was both designed/composed by Kan ""Reives"" Gao, with the help of his development team Freebird Games and Laura Shigihara who also helped compose some of the music. The game was made around the RPG Maker Xp engine. Simple controls and graphics accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack. So, why do I recommend this game? Despite it's simple look and controls ""To the Moon"" has an incredibly moving story. I won't go into too much detail about it since you are more than capable of reading the game synopsis yourself but It revolves around Johnny and his dying wish. Going into too much detail would do the story an injustice, because to date it might be one of the most memorable visual novels I have played. Don't ruin it for yourself by watching any video or reading too much into the story. ""To the Moon"" is an incredible experience and I highly recommend it.10/10 ~ Would cry again.			"

The gameplay itself isn't exactly ""Top-of-the-line"" But the way they made it, it doesn't need to be. Most games that rely this heavily on the story that I've played (ex: Heavy Rain, PS3) Had little to no replay value, but this one, I kinda just wanna play it over and over again. I cannot reccomend this game highly enough, whether you're old, young, a major gamer, or even if you hate games (why you'd be reading this in that case, I have no idea) you will fall in love with this one.

												An absolute triumph in storytelling. It feels real - not in the setting, of course, but in the emotion. The people, what they feel and what it makes you feel is all so real. It is touching, sweet, sad, uplifting and poignant.  I laughed - the game's moments of humor are really spot on. More importantly, I cried - at times due to sorrow and even at times with bittersweet joy. I connected with the characters and with the story in a way few games have managed to induce in me.  There's no fantastical elements here - besides the general structure that allows the story to be told. The important parts are all very human and relatable. It's a deeply personal story.Do you like storytelling? Then you MUST play this game. Its ability to tell a story is up there with The Longest Journey and Bastion. Don't care that much about story? Play the game anyway. In four hours (it's quite short), To The Moon may just change your mind about that.			"

												In my life of devouring stories, many different mediums have emotionally touched me over the years. Video games are among that list, but to this day they have never made me cry. I have cried over books, TV series, animes, webcomics, movies... And now, I can add video games to that list.This is not a game for those after gameplay. It is simplistic and very short, simply two or three hours. But that is not the point. The point is the story--and what a beautiful and moving tale it is. For the price? It's beyond worth it. Check this out, especially if it's on any sort of sale.			"

												What an amazing video game. I adored the charming 16-bit RPG graphics that reminded me of Final Fantasy VI. The story is interesting and full of emotion. The dialog is as poignant as it is entertaining. The soundtrack absolutely drips with feeling. I laughed, I cried. This is an experience not to be missed.			"

												Really good story. If someone spoils it for you, they are your enemy. Though dont expect a lot of user gameplay besides treasure hunt and puzzles which arn't difficult. Totally worth 10$ and since its on sale. You should get it.  Don't know about you but its hard to find a really good emotional game like this. Also its it is short but every moment wont feel like a waiste of time.			"

												Think a hidden object/puzzle game presented in a SNES RPG format. That's a good way to describe To The Moon.The main story is pretty much the highlight of this game. It mixes a good amount of comedy and drama/feels here and there, and the playable characters are pretty interesting that you'd get at least a few good laughs out of them.While the game will probably last you around 3-5 hours at most, it's still worth getting. I recommend anyone who loves an interesting story to purchase this, especially during a sale.			"

												Make time for this game, when you can. Set aside five or six hours - preferably at night. You'll agree with me when you finish that it was worth the single sitting, and when you're done you may want to look at the moon.I can't describe the plot without stealing the discovery - relax and go in with no expectations. Just enjoy the story, like every nice narrative deserves.			"

												What do Roadkill, a dying man and zombies have in common? Nothing! And yet To The Moon crafts these elements together to form such a seamless and beautiful experience that will remain with you long after the credits roll.To the Moon follows the story of two scientists whose role is to visit the dying, and alter their memories of their life so that they can die fulfilled. In this instance, they visit a comatose old man, ""Johnny"", whose final wish is to visit the moon - the only issue is that he has no idea why he wants to do so. Admittedly this may sound depressing, but the dialogue between the two scientists is refreshingly full of humour to keep things perky.To The Moon is an absolute masterpiece of a game - the soundtrack is unique and accompanies the story perfectly, and although the graphics are in 16 bit style and the actual 'gaming' aspect of it is more point-and-click than anything, none of this detracts in the slightest from the genius and depth of the whole experience. I cannot recommend this game highly enough - worth every last penny. You owe it to yourself to play this.			"

The humor was placed in just the right moments, and it has the right amount seriousness to balance out the two. There are many moments where you can connect with the characters, and wish you were there to comfort them, or slap them, haha. Even without the action, this game makes me want to play more games like it, in a similar art style (if there are any).			"

												In general everything about this game has been said already. It's a charming looking game made with the RPG-maker. It's focus is definitely the story and not the gameplay. The gameplay ist pretty simple, collect some things, search the area talk to people and at the end of each area solve a little puzzle.However, the story it's really really good. It's creative, sad, funny, heartwarming, a bit confusing and very enthralling all at the same time. Just buy this game, you will not have a bad time playing it through, which can be done in one evening (that's why I won't spoiler a single thing).If there was a movie or a book to this game I would definitely watch/read it.P.S: And I really enjoyed all the little references to other games, books or movies :)			"

												One of the ever rising problems with modern games is their simplicity. They're short, utterly simple, and rarely worth finishing. What makes a game worth it? Is it complexity? Pretty graphics? Reward-factors? Difficulty? Absolutely not, because To the Moon is a short, utterly simple game... and it's definitely worth it.To The Moon is much less a game than it is an experience. Although simple in design, the depths of what it achieves is hard to surpass and simply cannot be passed up. You owe it to yourself to play it.Despite being made in RPG Maker XP, I can't say anything more than that it's simply what's used to pass on the story to the player. It's there, but never really makes the player feel like it's an RPG... it's more of a visual novel, with RPG Maker visuals instead of pictures. Is this a bad thing? Maybe, but what if there's something inside this game so powerful that it'll let one overlook anything iffy about its design? What if it's possible to lose yourself in a different aspect of the game? If it's the story, wouldn't it be like getting lost in a really good book? Yes, yes it would.The game's story is easily its most prominent aspect. There is some side-dialogue you might miss out on, but nothing else is going to sneak by. The story in To the Moon is amazing, sure, but are there any problems with it? Possibly. You see, To the Moon, if it suffers from anything, is its simple dialogue. Sentences are often short and consice. There isn't the same amount of detail you'd get in a novel. However, the pacing of the story, the characters, the plot twists, and everything that comes flying at you like a shuttle makes this one possible issue forgivable, if there really is an issue at all. Because in all of its greatness, I have to find something wrong with it. Honestly, it's a struggle...In addition to its great story, To the Moon has an absolutely amazing OST. Again, like the story, it's also simple. I could delve into detail about this like in the above paragraph, but I'll just stop and tell you that it fits perfectly. Every track only adds to the scene. There is absolutely nothing wrong with its simplicity. I'm done talking about that. Its best to hear the music while playing the game. The music and writing combine to deliver something fascinating, so revel in the simple beauty of the arts.And that's exactly what makes To the Moon an amazing game. Its simplicity. It's a short, to-the-point, and beautifully written story. At the end of it all, yes, I cried.In this world full of AAA games that suffer in some regard from being too simple, is To the Moon a game that stands out among the rest? Yes.Should you play it? If you value what makes video games worthwhile, then yes, you should.			"

This game also invelops you in its amazing soundtrack that puts you in a mood unlike any other. This game truely toys with your emotions, and that isn't a bad thing.

												What 'To the Moon' isn't: an action game, a role-playing game, an adventure game.What 'To the Moon' is: a beautiful interactive novel that tells a poignant, human story.Using wonderfully retro pixel art (reminicient of the SNES), To the Moon tells the story of a man's life in reverse, spinning a tale that is equal parts melancholy and uplifting.  The gameplay interacions are absolutely minimal - there are some light hidden object mechanics, and a realitive easy recurring puzzle..... but that's not really the point of the game.  To the Moon is a schmultzy (in a good way) story set against a lovingly-crafted canvas and set to some utterly captivating piano scores.  The game looks and sounds amazing, and if you don't get misty eyed at least a few times then I don't know what's wrong with you.If you loved 'Gone Home', or other recent pieces of interactive fiction, then you should nsap this gem up right away.

												To the Moon is a great story (arguably cliché, but well executed) that is told in the form of a 16-bit RPG. No combat, only simple puzzles and exploration. Expect about three hours of play and pay accordingly.Recommended for casual play (perhaps together with an SO) or for those that enjoyed the old Squaresoft classics.			"

												A friend of mine gifted this game to me and told me that I should give it a go. But when I was to give it a go I should close down skype and any other distractions, turn the volume to comfortable levels and enjoy it.It's not that long of a game but rather look at it as a well written book.The music, the atmosphere and the story is just such a joy which immerses you into the game.I had some technical difficulties with the game but it was completely worth the hassle to working around it for this game, and the only real issue you will be having with it, is that you want MORE games like this of such quality story and execution of how they tell it.Simply a must have game if you like story, don't let the graphics be the thing which you decide on.

												One of the best RPG Maker games I've ever played, with some heavily emotional moments. If you're looking for an actual RPG, you won't find one here.This is a story driven point-and-click mystery game, with great music, and with some creative usages of the scripting tools that the software offers. Well worth the money, for an average of 4 hours to complete the game. Shame that it didn't offer multiple endings, especially given that the game keeps track of your overall score for the minigames, but doesn't end up doing anything with that. An extra scene at the end, as a reward for having a good record, would've been nice. Maybe that's something to consider for the upcoming sequel?10/10, right in the feels.			"

												Wow, this game is brillaintFirstly, don't be put off by the graphics. It looks like an RPG, but plays like an adventure game.While there are puzzles, which are somewhat basic, they aren't the focus in this game. This game is all about story.You take on the role of two people basically performing Inception on a client; jumping back through his memories to make him think he went to the moon. It's strange seeing the events play out backwards, but it's fun piecing it all together. There were a few moments where they game had thrown me off completely about the context of some events, making it all the better when they were revealed later in the plot. It's apparently also part of an episodic game so I want as many people to play it so we can get the rest sooner.Only bad thing to say about it; DAVID'S MAIN MORPH IS A LION.			"

												It only takes two or three hours to play through this game, but wow how good it was.  Two scientists take a patient through his life, attempting to rewrite his memories so that he lands on the moon.The writing which starts out hokey, really tightens up once you get into it.  There are some minor translation issues which keep it from being perfect.The mechanics are simple.  Root around in his memories and find spheres that eventually lead to a tile-switching puzzle game.  Eventually you will reach the end, which hits you right in the feels.The brilliance is the build up of the man's life.  Mysteries reveal themselves, odd quirks explain themselves.  Really excellent.			"

												Recommendations are usually based around opinions of the subject matter at hand. For games it has become common to break down the subject matter into categories. Things such as Story, Controls/Gameplay, and Graphics. Each one of these is discussed before giving a general overview or perhaps even an opinion, thus the recommendation. ""To the Moon"" was both designed/composed by Kan ""Reives"" Gao, with the help of his development team Freebird Games and Laura Shigihara who also helped compose some of the music. The game was made around the RPG Maker Xp engine. Simple controls and graphics accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack. So, why do I recommend this game? Despite it's simple look and controls ""To the Moon"" has an incredibly moving story. I won't go into too much detail about it since you are more than capable of reading the game synopsis yourself but It revolves around Johnny and his dying wish. Going into too much detail would do the story an injustice, because to date it might be one of the most memorable visual novels I have played. Don't ruin it for yourself by watching any video or reading too much into the story. ""To the Moon"" is an incredible experience and I highly recommend it.10/10 ~ Would cry again.			"

												A recommendation isn't enough for this game, simply put, it's a masterpiece. It deals with the subjects of death, tragedy, buried memories and so much more and although some of the twists may be pretty easy to guess, the way in which the story is told ensures that this does not lower the quality of the game whatsoever. Easily the greatest element to this game though, is the way it creates emotion in the player. The humour is top notch, when something good happens for someone you are genuinely happy for them and most of all, this game is SAD. I have seen many different reactions about the ending, personally, I think it's tragic, but it works and it brings the game to a fantastic close.Presentation wise, the first thign you may notice is that the graphics are very similar to the style of the SNES (in my opinion, it is particularly reminiscent of Chrono Trigger). This works perfectly and after playing through the game, I can't imagine it with another art style. However, despite all this, the one thing I haven't mentioned yet is easily the games greatest asset, which is saying a lot considering everything else. The music in this game is just... stunning, probably my favourite soundtrack of all time, or at least in the last few years. A great mixture of instruments, mainly piano, adds to the games already fantastic environment, and each song sets the tone amazingly and is absolutely perfect for what is happening in the game. Should you buy it? If you're a fan of heavily story based games, then yes and if not, give it a go anyway. 10/10			"

												Beautiful. Simply...just...This is a game. Yet it doesn't do what a game is supposed to be. For you to play it.I would describe this as a 2D RPG Visual Novel. Since the strongest point of the game is it's story.Usually I would make lengthy reviews...but this is an exception. And normally I would criticize the menu, game mechanics, but no...other than being a game made in RPG maker as a reason to get past that, the story simply blows everything bad about it away.""Words cannot express nor describe how beautiful this is.""I would talk about the story, but it's a whole spoiler-fest if I do, which it is the main reason why this is so good.I don't know if I could recommend this for everyone. But I will recommend this to people who likes romance, visual novels, and point-and-click adventure games. This is  must-try, as reviewing this, without you trying it would just be little help.Please try this amazing game. Simply one of the best, and easily favorite story-based games I ever had.10/10			"

Might get around that later), where Act 1 has the longest duration with mostly exploring and solving a puzzle at the end of every memory, Act 2 is mostly story with less interaction and Act 3 has some interaction. It was also an emotional rollercoaster which was also the best thing about it.			"

YouTube™ Video: TO THE MOON REVIEW - GAME GALAXY 

			Views: 907		

			To the Moon Trailer = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqkJuSV-23U Freeboard Games = http://freebirdgames.com To the Moon is an amazing emotional adventure PC game with a touching story and the best...		

This is one of the most emotional games I have ever played. My wife happened to be sitting next to me during my play session last night and we both were in tears at the end of this game. The story of “To the Moon” is so incredibly sweet and has such great writing it’s incredible. The reason I love video games as we know them today is not only are they fun, but I love getting told REALLY good stories that are interactive. A good story will transcend any graphical style or not having millions of dollars behind you. This gets the label of an “indie” game which initially puts a bad taste in some people’s mouths but I don’t why  - It just means these are games not made by a giant conglomerate or corporation. This year I’ve found myself trying more Indie games out as I’ve been thoroughly impressed- For example - I have always loved the Call of Duty games for their camapaign modes - I thought they were interesting, put you in an action movie, and had some good writing - particularly Black Ops 1- But I just played Black ops III and this story was so terrible - This is supposedly a AAA game but you know what I had WAY more enjoyment with To the Moon and the writing in TO THE MOON BLOWS this out of the water. Seriously. This game was designed on the RPG Maker XP engine - and really holds that 16-bit RPG feeling intact that I’m in love with - Just the other day I was talking to my wife and I was telling her how We will never see another AAA RPG title in the 16-bit style of old Final Fantasy Games, Chrono Trigger, or Dragon Quest games - and that I really prefer that art style when there is a really good story. There is something to reading dialogue apposed to voice actors. I love where voice acting has reached in video games, but a story like this is just really potent when you’re reading it and internalizing it. In this world there exists a technology that allows doctors to implant artificial memories. This is sort of like a mix of the films Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind and Inception - The idea is that a patient will ask for these memories to be created and when they wake up they will have memories of things that didn’t actually happen to them. The catch is that this process interferes with the the patients real memories and the result of receiving this new set of memories means your mind and body will shut down as a result; ultimately the patient will die. This procedure has been legalized for patients on their deathbeds to help fulfill their wishes they never accomplished in life and so they can die without any regrets.The Story begins with you taking control of two doctors. Dr. Eva Rosalene & Dr. Neil Watts as they arrive at a house on a wooded cliffside of the dying Johnny Wyles to fulfill his wish which is To Go to the moon. Although he does not know why he wants to. The machine they bring with them allows the doctors to enter into the mind of Johnny and traverse backwards through his memories with the goal to plant the seed of desire that would alter his life into becoming an astronaut and ultimately getting him to the moon. During each memory sequence you control the doctors and you collect memory links which will allow you to unlock a mementos that tie back to an earlier part of the Johnny’s life which will allow you to jump further back into his memories. Unlocking a memento also includes a mini game where you have to reconstruct the image of the item before making the jump. Although the doctors are meant to remain professional and not get emotionally involved - Both Dr. Watts & Dr. Rosalene get emotionally invested in their own ways as Johnny’s past is revealed. Throughout the game as much emotion as there is Dr. Watts is always there for comic relief and there is a lot of tongue and cheek humor that will keep things light. But the subject matter is wrapped in a mix of nostalgia, sorrow, love, and desire that it still overwhelms you and this is reinforced by the INCREDIBLE Music in this game. Just like I talked about old RPGs having power in you reading the dialogue there is power in the music and the MUSIC really propels and drives this story and will tug on your heart strings. Kan Gao & Laura Shigihara did an unbelievale amazing Job on the music. Seriously guys - it’s incredible. A complete side note I wanted to say is there is one line that really struck me in this game and it’s said in passing, but it really struck a cord with me. As you travel through the memories strangers and other people will be representing as ghostly figures as Johnny doesn’t remember what they looked like and Dr. Rosalene says “The World would be a lot more beautiful if people just remembered faces more.” That’s really such a great line.This game is drenched in love and you can complete the story in about 4 hours. It’s an incredible story and I am definitely going to be shouting this from the mountain tops and telling everyone I know to play it. All I can say is Kan - Thank you for creating this beautiful work of art. I will definitely be checking out your other game A Bird Story next. - If 16 bit graphics can move you emotionally - that’s a stamp of approval that it is a great story. Of all the games I talk about this is my HIGHEST recommendation. Go Grab it on Steam - It works Windows, Mac, or Linux - and get ready to Go TO THE MOON -			"

												I wouldn't so much call it a game.  Even if there are a few 'game' elements thrown in towards the earlier parts of this, well, lets call To the Moon, a ""Visual Novel"" rather than a game.  This overall, is simply beautiful.  Wonderful piano pieces that capture mood and emotion of the scenes perfectly.  Even though its told through 16bit RPG style graphics.  The storyline has been so very touching. I'm tossing my 'man card' out the window, but sincerely. There was some comic relief, but the majority of the story was beautifully touching romance, alternating with tragic loss.  Imagine watching a 4 hour long first 15 minutes of Pixar's ""Up"".  Not really a game per se, but just a phenominally done, emotionally gripping story.  "

												The game is so good I don't really know where to start.To start, the game is fairly repetitive, you walk around interacting with objects, and at the end of each stage you solve a fairly easy puzzle.The gameplay is nothing to be amazed about.However this game's strong point is it's emaculate story. It's like reading a great book, once you get sucked into it, you'll never want to stop. I believe this game has to be played at one shot, it ends around 3~5 hours anyways. It's a great trip with this game, and you'll probably shed some tears in the end. The game has one of the best endings I've ever seen in a game.It's one of the best indie games out there, and you should definitely get one if you're a fan of indie games. "

												I got this in a humble bundle, not really knowing what it was. As my internet is quite slow, so, seeing that the filesize was tiny, I decided to download it.I was first struck by the music. The sound design, throughout the game is incredible, so I would definitely reccomend the soundtrack. The next day, I decided to binge play it, and discovered that the story was incredibly moving, at times funny and, at times, brought on man-tears.Some would debate its classification as a game. They have a point. The mechanics ar minimalistic, to say the least, and the only real challenge is finding 'mementoes', to progress.However, if this does not worry you, it is most definitely reccomended, and is one of my favourite games that I have played this year.

												4/4 thumbs upThis is a nice story-oriented game about two doctors traveling through the memories of a terminal patient to piece together a perfect memory before he dies: to go to the moon.  The story itself is about 5 hours long, and because it's so well-scripted you'll be hard-pressed to put it down and not finish in one play-thru.It's heart-wrenching at times, funny at others, and though some incidents might seem disjointed it all comes together beautifully in the end.  Wrap this up with nice classic SNES era visuals, an inexpensive price-tag, a few little fun puzzles, and quality soundtrack and you have an excellent game to play through in a rainy afternoon lazing about the house.The only thing I feel could be improved is including a little more direction in hunting for clues; sometimes you'll find four of the five and find yourself wandering around clicking on everything to try to find the last one.

												 From the storyline to every detail of graphics of this game, I would say that this is one heck of a game! A great game does not have to have amazing graphics; FreeBird Games proved it through this game. Indeed I understand how this game got of awards for its story, and no wonder there are so many people who are recommending this game to others. This game is a real tear-jerker – but in a good way. It made me reflect about all my wishes and how most of it were forgotten when I got older. Not only was the story well written, but also the music throughout the game was really good. I would say that one of the most memorable items of this game is probably its music because it has this strong emotional content to it that makes the people fall in love with it even though they were not able to play the game. I'm going to be honest now, I thought that this game will be boring at first even though it had an overwhelmingly positive review in Steam, but when I actually played it, I just ate all the words I said. Overall, I would give this game a 10 out of 10. If someone really wants to know why I gave it a perfect score, well, try playing the game. #BestGameEver			"

												""Because one day.... I'm going to befriend one of them""To The Moon is honestly one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. The story is among the best in any form of entertainment and will simultaneously break your heart and move it. With its amazing 16-bit graphical art style, To The Moon is a beautiful story about love and grief, reminding us how easy it is to overlook the simple, yet beautiful moments in our lives.Also the music is phenomenal and stands among the best in video games! Just starting up the game and drowning yourself in To The Moon's main theme is an experience in itself. The piano piece ""To the Moon/For River"" is arguably one of the most beautiful, albeit repetitive, songs I have ever listened to.In terms of gameplay, there isn't much to do. You can tell the doctors where to go and what to interact with (kinda like a point and click adventure game) but besides that, gameplay is fairly lacking. However, your main reason to play this amazing gem should be because of its poignant story, not its gameplay. To The Moon is easily one of my favourite games and is hard not to recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good story. I applaud Kan “Reives” Gao for writing such a beautiful story, for composing an elegant score, and for creating such an emotional, touching experience.			"

												I can safely say there are very few games that have touched me so deeply. I'm proud to say this is one of them. The game made me laugh, cry (both from joy/relief as well as from sadness), and panic. It also made me ponder the meaning of life and the inherent fallibilty of the human brain, as well as the long-lasting effects that everyday choices can make.Granted, this isn't really as much of a game as it is a visual novel, one of which has little to no branching paths therein, but I digress.I truly enjoyed the game's narrative and characters. The chemistry between the two main characters is infectious, and there was more than one time I'd burst out laughing from the banter between them. The references (for the most part) are relevant, recognizable, and genuinely funny. The plot was riveting, and had several startling and brilliant twists. I can honestly say I NEVER would have seen the Joey/Johnny twist coming (and I'll leave it at that, so as not to spoil it for prospective players), and I'm VERY good at predicting plot twists.There are some flaws in this game, as there always are. Nothing's perfect. The list of my gripes follows:1. I wish a lot of the items I picked up served any real purpose through the game. Maybe leading to a secret ending or something? I had that origami rabbit in my inventory the whole game. Not once was it utilized.2. As far as I know, the memento puzzles are nothing but busywork and your amount of moves doesn't affect the game in the slightest.3. The health monitor for your client is apparently just there for window dressing, as I never saw it change unless the plot demanded it, and even then, the effects in the memory, as well as what other NPCs say, tells you of his change in condition, leaving the health monitor to be rather superfluous.4. The game essentially boils down to ""hover your mouse over things until you find something to click on"". Granted, sometimes you find things that are merely there to set the scene, and that's a good thing, but I'd prefer some indicator on things I can click on.5. Targeting for the mouse seems really wonky at times. In the whack-a-mole minigame, the highlighted box that shows where the hammer is supposedly going to impact seems remarkably imprecise and highly unpredictable. Also, if, on the memento flip puzzles, you click another row before the first one finishes flipping, the next row to flip will be whatever row your cursor is over at the moment the first flipping finishes, and it often isn't one you wanted clicked.6. The animorphs puzzle is wrong. Then again, it's a really minor thing that (as far as I can tell) bears no real effect on the story, so that's a minor gripe.7. They never go into how or why River died. They mention how there's an operation that can be performed, and that it's expensive, but they never really go any further into detail.8. They made River's disorder rather ambiguous. Granted, it was kind of obvious to me, seeing as Human psychology has always fascinated me, but they never mention the disorder by name. I was playing the game alongside a friend, and had to explain to him what River's disorder was, because he thought she was just awkward. Many people probably had to google the author of the book River's doctor gives to Johnny, just to know who Tony Attwood even is.Despite these shortcomings, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who's willing to take the time to get invested in the story and characters.

												When I read about this game, I thought it would be some kind of anime story with some memory exploring. Oh boy was I in for a surprise, I had never expected how much this game would affect me.There aren't enough words to describe how amazing this game is. The story is excellently weaved together. The characters all have very distinct personalities, even the two scientists have such distinct personalities you can clearly tell how they would react in situations. (The male one being the sillier and quirky) Exploring the old mans past makes you relate to him as if he was a person you knew in your real life. It's so easy to like him, but also relate to all of his struggles. There are many moments of sadness where my heart aches for him.The most striking character for me is potrayed with a disability in the autism spectrum. Usually when you see these kind of characters, they are either stereotypically good at math (autism) or they are self-absorbed ragers (aspberger). As I have high functioning autism myself (basically between autism and asperger), there are so many ways I could relate to this character and her perception of what love and friendship is. People in the game are also portrayed in the way they view her, because she really stands out as strange and emotionally distant. But the main character, Johnny, just likes her so much he won't let the things get in the way. He spends enough time with her to understand how she works, instead of others that look at her and think she just refuses to be civilized. Excellent portrayal of this disability.The soundtrack is fantastic. Especially ""Moonwhisher"". I have spent hours and hours crying to this lovely track. It's so incredibly touching. There are few wordless tracks which moves me in the way this one does. It really sets the mood when you are watching a sad scene in the game. Many of the other musical pieces are also great. One of them, ""For River"", even has a background story in the game as to why the musical piece is so simple at the beginning with just two notes. So when you follow the story to the end, then hear the musical piece in the various adaptions, it really fills my eyes with tears. I liked the graphic of the game. The old school pixels were all very well done and the areas portrayed all feels like they spent a good time to make sure it wouldn't be repeatetive. Nowhere do I remember feeling myself lost. Each area has their own uniqueness, so it is easy to find your way.I love the way the story is told. It literally starts you near the end, then you tread your way back slowly until you reach the start of Johnnys life, then it is like climbing back up again to find parts that were skipped over during the transition there. It doesn't just end there though, the game offers a final piece to the puzzle with a great plot twist. The game starts out by making it seem the issue is easily solved, then it builds up and you realize there is so much more to the game.The only possible complaint I could make about the game is a mini-game you play each time you transistion in a memory. I just thought it was distracting and not fun. It's over quite fast though.This is a game I would recommend to everyone to play at least once. Especially if you enjoy deep, emotional stories that truly explores the personalities and life of the characters.			"

												Man, this game...I very rarely write reviews for anything, let alone Steam games. If I wrote a review for every steam game I owned, I'd be here a long time.I originally fired up this game because it has steam cards. I don't even remember how I ended up with a copy. Probably from a Humble Bundle. Regardless, the steam cards enticed me to open it up. With every game I've ever opened for steam cards, I gave it a spin, and I am happy I did.Initial thoughts were ho hum as it took a little bit to get into the game. It was also very focused on trying to get me to use the mouse. Let me say right now to anyone thinking of playing this game, only use the mouse to try and identify items to click on. Move around with the keyboard, it'll make things much easier on you.Initial thoughts aside, I trudged on as I watched my steam inventory tick up on the cards collected. However, as I got deeper and deeper into the game, I found myself fascinated as story events started to reveal. There was quirky humor, shocking reveals, and sad moments. However, the story wraps itself up well and I found myself amazed as I looked back, picking up on small things that happened with no reasoning until things revealed through the ending.The story flows together well. The soundtrack fits in perfectly. The characters have enough depth to keep them interesting, without being overbearing. Overall, this game is fantastic and I recommend it to anyone. I'm not normally an artsy fartsy story telling game kinda guy, but this one was fantastic. Just get ready for tears, because holy crap that reveal.Now if you excuse me, I need to go play 12 hours of Street Fighter to make up for the emotional carnage this game has played on me. :D			"

VirtuesTo the moon is a story about the life a couple has shared and all the friends, love, hardships and ceremony that entails. This game has it's sights set on your feels and you may find a few things quite touching.The gameplay is generally watching canned bits of plot, proceeding to explore the area to find 5 colored orbs, & locating a memento. Once you've done this and located the memento you break a barrier around the memento with the orbs and finish things off with a tile flipping puzzle. You then move on to the next area and repeat the whole process.I enjoy the humor in this game quite a bit. It's a good mix of cornball, referential, and just plain odd.PitfallsThe game doesn't seem to support multiple resolutions or even the steam overlay. Screenshots don't work well because of this. I'm used to taking an excess of screenshots during gameplay and constantly found myself missing the ability to do so easily.I experienced an odd glitch during the course of my playthrough in which I became capable of walking on any surface of the current screen. I was forced to reload due to inability to interact with anything at that point though.The controls feel a bit loose an imprecise on a wireless xbox 360 controller. The D-pad cannot even be used in an attempt to counter this frustration. You are limited to the left analog joystick. It's necessary to utilize the mouse for the tile flipping puzzle sections. Near the end of the game there's some different gameplay mechanics that I just switched entirely to keyboard in order to better aid in progression.Spoilerific ShortI felt the game could've ended appropriately shortly after finding out about the death of the twin brother. Instead the game continues trying to right wrongs Quantum Leap style inside the dying seniors brain. This makes sense only in the context of the altruistic attitude of Dr. Rosalene. I don't feel it actually helps the story. Instead of just discovering what actually had happened in the past and bringing it to the surface to be faced she retcon's the past and tries to remedy it with a pretty bow of modified memories. This left the ending feeling kind of lame and predictable to me.All told I rather enjoyed this game despite any issues I had with it.70\100			"

												To the Moon is an engaging, original, and emotional story delivered in game form using the RPG Maker engine. The player follows along as two scientists delve into a dying man's mind in order to fulfill his last wish of going to the moon. It is told very well with good music, enjoyable writing, and some lackluster humor. Altogether, it's an enjoyable ride that I recommend to those less interested in a typical game, but playing along through a good story. "

Shout out to Kan. R. Gao, Laura Shigihara and all the other who composed this masterpiece!The games is takes approximately 4-5 hours to complete. It is worth both your time and money5/5			"

												I don't usually enjoy these sort of games, but I just couldn't stop playing To The Moon. By the end I was overwhelmed with feelings. Only problem I see is that I can't think of a reason to replay this, except maybe after many years. The ""game"" elements of this are quite weak, it's mostly just following a story. But what a story!			"

												A truly emotional game. More of  a story really. It's entertaining, the dialogue is phenominal(thanks to Neil Watts), and it is somehow able to pierce into the very center of our hearts. A tale of a boy named Johnny and a girl with {SPOILER ALERT} Aspergers {SPOILER OVER} called River. When one first plays the game. They expect a small fun RPG. They get MUCH more.I reccomend this game to everyone who wishes to buy it, however one note of warning, IT IS EXTREMELY SAD!that is all.No seriously, buy this game.			"

												To the Moon is less of a game and more of an experience.

To the Moon does neither have crazy gameplay nor does it have a visually stunning appearance, but the journey is surely going to make you cry unless you're completely unempathetic. It's a beautiful and absolutely unique story about an old man who wants to go to the moon as his last wish told in a ~5 hours long 2D indie game.			"

												""Because one day.... I'm going to befriend one of them""To The Moon is honestly one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. The story is among the best in any form of entertainment and will simultaneously break your heart and move it. With its amazing 16-bit graphical art style, To The Moon is a beautiful story about love and grief, reminding us how easy it is to overlook the simple, yet beautiful moments in our lives.Also the music is phenomenal and stands among the best in video games! Just starting up the game and drowning yourself in To The Moon's main theme is an experience in itself. The piano piece ""To the Moon/For River"" is arguably one of the most beautiful, albeit repetitive, songs I have ever listened to.In terms of gameplay, there isn't much to do. You can tell the doctors where to go and what to interact with (kinda like a point and click adventure game) but besides that, gameplay is fairly lacking. However, your main reason to play this amazing gem should be because of its poignant story, not its gameplay. To The Moon is easily one of my favourite games and is hard not to recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good story. I applaud Kan “Reives” Gao for writing such a beautiful story, for composing an elegant score, and for creating such an emotional, touching experience.			"

												""To The Moon"" is very much a game that is a greater than the sum of its parts. Individually I don't think they are uniquely powerful in anyway. But as a whole this game is brilliant. Its a well put together experience with the narrative and music really capturing you and taking you on an adventure as you go through the world and story in the game. This is a game I really can't reccomend enough and I assure you that you will have some kind of emotional response. My response from the game, was that I actually had to stop the game maybe a third of the way through and call my mother. I just felt compelled to do it, and I'm pretty sure anyone who plays the game is going to get a similarly strong reaction to the game.If you want to read a longer review you can find it here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/09/to-moon.html.

												When I read about this game, I thought it would be some kind of anime story with some memory exploring. Oh boy was I in for a surprise, I had never expected how much this game would affect me.There aren't enough words to describe how amazing this game is. The story is excellently weaved together. The characters all have very distinct personalities, even the two scientists have such distinct personalities you can clearly tell how they would react in situations. (The male one being the sillier and quirky) Exploring the old mans past makes you relate to him as if he was a person you knew in your real life. It's so easy to like him, but also relate to all of his struggles. There are many moments of sadness where my heart aches for him.The most striking character for me is potrayed with a disability in the autism spectrum. Usually when you see these kind of characters, they are either stereotypically good at math (autism) or they are self-absorbed ragers (aspberger). As I have high functioning autism myself (basically between autism and asperger), there are so many ways I could relate to this character and her perception of what love and friendship is. People in the game are also portrayed in the way they view her, because she really stands out as strange and emotionally distant. But the main character, Johnny, just likes her so much he won't let the things get in the way. He spends enough time with her to understand how she works, instead of others that look at her and think she just refuses to be civilized. Excellent portrayal of this disability.The soundtrack is fantastic. Especially ""Moonwhisher"". I have spent hours and hours crying to this lovely track. It's so incredibly touching. There are few wordless tracks which moves me in the way this one does. It really sets the mood when you are watching a sad scene in the game. Many of the other musical pieces are also great. One of them, ""For River"", even has a background story in the game as to why the musical piece is so simple at the beginning with just two notes. So when you follow the story to the end, then hear the musical piece in the various adaptions, it really fills my eyes with tears. I liked the graphic of the game. The old school pixels were all very well done and the areas portrayed all feels like they spent a good time to make sure it wouldn't be repeatetive. Nowhere do I remember feeling myself lost. Each area has their own uniqueness, so it is easy to find your way.I love the way the story is told. It literally starts you near the end, then you tread your way back slowly until you reach the start of Johnnys life, then it is like climbing back up again to find parts that were skipped over during the transition there. It doesn't just end there though, the game offers a final piece to the puzzle with a great plot twist. The game starts out by making it seem the issue is easily solved, then it builds up and you realize there is so much more to the game.The only possible complaint I could make about the game is a mini-game you play each time you transistion in a memory. I just thought it was distracting and not fun. It's over quite fast though.This is a game I would recommend to everyone to play at least once. Especially if you enjoy deep, emotional stories that truly explores the personalities and life of the characters.			"

												Man, this game...I very rarely write reviews for anything, let alone Steam games. If I wrote a review for every steam game I owned, I'd be here a long time.I originally fired up this game because it has steam cards. I don't even remember how I ended up with a copy. Probably from a Humble Bundle. Regardless, the steam cards enticed me to open it up. With every game I've ever opened for steam cards, I gave it a spin, and I am happy I did.Initial thoughts were ho hum as it took a little bit to get into the game. It was also very focused on trying to get me to use the mouse. Let me say right now to anyone thinking of playing this game, only use the mouse to try and identify items to click on. Move around with the keyboard, it'll make things much easier on you.Initial thoughts aside, I trudged on as I watched my steam inventory tick up on the cards collected. However, as I got deeper and deeper into the game, I found myself fascinated as story events started to reveal. There was quirky humor, shocking reveals, and sad moments. However, the story wraps itself up well and I found myself amazed as I looked back, picking up on small things that happened with no reasoning until things revealed through the ending.The story flows together well. The soundtrack fits in perfectly. The characters have enough depth to keep them interesting, without being overbearing. Overall, this game is fantastic and I recommend it to anyone. I'm not normally an artsy fartsy story telling game kinda guy, but this one was fantastic. Just get ready for tears, because holy crap that reveal.Now if you excuse me, I need to go play 12 hours of Street Fighter to make up for the emotional carnage this game has played on me. :D			"

												I loved this deeply emotional and philosophical game. The themes are very accessible in terms of the common human experience they explore, yet they are presented with very interesting nuance and complexity. The Memento-like mechanic of moving backwards through time in vignettes works really well to create a solid narrative suspense.The minisodes are not as good. They explore the social implications of the technology that is at the base of the game as well as some mystery about the main characters, which is interesting, but the gameplay is weak, involving a lot of back and forth between screens.

												I always liked pros and cons lists for reviews.  Here's my attempt at a good one (sorry about the crappy formatting, I can't figure out how to clean it up):Pros: Tear-jerker.  I cried.  Most people that played this cried.  Those that say they didn't cry, probably cried. Creative story telling!  It's such a well-written game.  Because of it's unorthodox approach it keeps you interested throughout the game.  Simple game mechanics.  It's practically a point&click adventure.  Retro graphics pull you in.  The game is simple but looks beautiful.  A lot of love went into piecing this game together.  Short.  You can finish this game in one sitting.   The music is fantastic.  This game has such a great soundtrack.  Some games have good background music, then there's those rare gems where the background music might as well be another character in the game since it plays such a huge role.Cons: Clunky unresponsive controls at times.  I got stuck a lot. Humor just didn't work with me.  The game presents such a beautiful premise about love and regret so the humor at times felt out of place and awkward.  Specifically the male doctor.  I feel like the game would've been much better without Dr. Watts.  Gameplay, because it's so simple, feels repetitive by the time you reach the final act.   I don't really think this is a con, but I can't list it as a pro:  The game isn't suited for younger audiences.  I feel like quality of story-telling this game provides would be wasted on a younger person who can't relate to the themes in this game.   The ending of the game will leave you with questions and you will want to know more about the characters, and realizing they're not real people will make you sad.All-in-all, this game was a treat.  It got such good reviews and I'm glad I finally tried it.  Definitely recommend it. "

The story is touching and heartwarming as you uncover Johnny's past, and I particularly like Dr Watts' amusing and entertaining character who serves as the comic relief in this game to ensure you don't actually shed tears. 9/10 - Would definitely recommend for a chill game.

Then the music - very calming and pleasant. Hilarious humour - many references to popular (if you're at least a little nerdy, like me) TV shows...Very, very enjoyable game.

There was some witty dialogue from Doctor Watts throughout the story, and then there were times were the dialogue spoke to your heart. This game is a true example of how you don't need good graphics to make a good game, it's all dependent on the story. I would buy the soundtrack if you like sad piano. On another note, the creator said that he is working on the next ""episode"" of this series, so we might see episode 2 soon.			"

												+ Good Story+ ""My eyes are just sweating"" Ending+ Great Music+/- 8-bit images- The Story doesn't really pick up until the near ending- Corny Dialogue- Not Challenging GameplayOverall: 9/10It has some issues here and there, but the positives really do weigh for the better. The game does focus on the art aspect rather than the actual gameplay, but it still does an okay job as a game. This is one of the most memoriable games I will ever play, and I definitely recommend buying it full price to help the developers.			"

												A strange combination of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""Citizen Kane,"" and a push puzzle game. Which might sound terrible, but the results are pretty awesome. Although there are mini-puzzles to solve, it's really more an ""interactive story"" than a game, per se, but the ""story"" elements are top notch and even kind of revolutionary, considering that this was made in RPG Maker. It's rare that any piece of storytelling uses its medium to the fullest to achieve its ends so well.It is heavy on the sentimentality at times, but usually it's smart enough to pull back with a bit of humor, or a non-sequitor, or just a genuinely well observed piece of writing before things venture into ""maudlin"" territory. Over all, though, it is very well written.			"

												This is an extremely underrated indie game. The characters are great, the humour is funny and light-hearted, and it is also extremely emotional and sad. Best story/plot for an indie game ever. Only bad thing is the controls. I don't know why, or if it was just me, but I found the controls are horrible. This is a great game for anyone who is looking for a good indie game with an amazing story.			"

												This game, really, is just one notch above a visual novel in terms of all round interactivity.  However, I don't see that as a bad thing. The story is worth the price of admission here.  Without spoiling anything, the writing has all the tenants of a professionally honed story.  Comedy, tragedy, mystery and a strong narrative that constantly makes the player want to know what will happen next. Thankfully beatable in one sitting, as you will very likely not want to stop once the game has its talons in you.The characters are fantastically realized, with some subtle and very subtle details for the eagle eyed player to pick up on some of the finer details of things. The true power, in my opinion, of a great story is not only to make the audiance feel; but also to reflect.This charming, masterful jewel of a game should be played by anyone who claims games are an artform.  It shines on its own. However, in a sea of macho frat-boy shooters and gritty action games, it's all the brighter.			"

												This game is one of the most beautiful games I have every played. If you have not yet experienced this wonderful, heartfelt story, then get your butt in gear and play it. Let me be upfront and say this. I am not an emotional guy. I don't every cry. Over anything. But, this game had me crying by the time the credits rolled. They were legit tears. Now, onto the game. This is not like any other game you have played. There is no action, no battles. Instead, all you have is an absolutely breathtaking adventure though a man's life. Never before have I experienced such a beutiful thing. I felt like he was a real person with an actual life. And not just another character sprite. The character design in this game is fantastic. Everyone is so well thought out and everything is so well written that you can't help but love all of the characters. This music in this game is also beautiful. Every song is wonderful. When you buy this, don't forget to add the soundtrack. It is well worth the money.In conclusion, this game is more than a game. It is a journey through a man's life. You see his happy times. His sad times. And everything inbetween. You need to buy and play this game. It will make you laugh and cry. Even though this game is only 10 dollars, I would have happily paid 60 for it. It is that good. Please, but this game and enjoy.			"

												To the moon, is an indie game that will take you on an emotional roller coaster. This game with it's story, and execution will make the biggest of gaming men choke up with this beautifully story. Are you ready to ride this roller coaster of feels?Game play: 5While this game is a very story driven, it kinda of lacks in any real game play. You run around as one of the two main characters either in the dying old man johnny's memorys or around his house and outside of it.While inside the his memorys you are task to find key pieces to his memorys after each scene that plays out to unlock earlier memorys. Pretty simple, you look for the “shines” that shows up. After each memory chapter you are given a small puzzle of flipping tiles of a picuture to complete the memory. Overall the game play isn't the main focus here.Story 10The story takes place with an the old man named, johnny, who is on his death bed with only one wish. To go to the moon.  The two main characters you follow are, Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts who are from the Sigmund Corp. who has technology that altar the memory’s of people. They usely use the technology on people who are dying to grant them one last wish. It is the job of Rosalene, and Watts to altar johnny's memory to send him to the moon. While digging deep into the memory’s of Johnny you find out about his wife who passed away years ago. Who has had mental problems who befriends a light house.  You also find out more about his pass on why he wants to go the moon even though he doesn't know himself. You'll end up meeting other characters from his, from his childhood to his aduit life who plays a big role in his life. With some dark twist.This game proves that sometimes isn't not always about having the best game play or graphics to have a compelling story to get you immersed in whats going on.Graphics: 9This game goes with a 16-bit graphic style, with mostly bright and colorful graphics mix with some dark looking graphics to set up each scene nicely. Ir's like playing a classic Super Nintendo game. They paid attention to details to make sure they where fitting for the story thats unfolding in front of your eyes.Music: 9The music is well placed and helps to set the mood for each scene. The music goes hand and hand with the story. They did a great job in matching the music to how they wanted you to feel at that current moment. They also did a great job on the music overall. Having a great story and music can mean all the difference on how well a game like this could do, over all the music mixes well with the story and adds a unique experience that you wont find in many other games. Final Though:I found this game one of the best story driven indie games that I have ever played. The story gets really deep and it will touch most peoples hearts, While giving you a lot of overwhelming feelings that you though you didn't have. The story is a sad story, and can make almost anyone cry or at least choke up. I can safely say that I can compare this to the aeris death scene in final fantasy VII when it comes to emotional feelings.As soon as I started playing. I was immersed in the story with in the first 15 minutes or so. I didn't even want to get up for anything. I only got up one time to use the bathroom, even then I was holding it in for at least an hour before hand. I beat this game in one sitting from start to end. I won't lie to you. I was crying by the end. I remember walking out of my room and my roommates asking why are my eyes so red and I said back to them “im just really tired I didn't get much sleep last night”.If you are wanting a heavy story driven game, then this game WILL be for you. There isn't any real amazing game play here but the story makes up for it ten fold. So for the people who are more about action style games, don't bother in picking up this game you'll most likely find it boring and not to your liking. This game is just overall amazing plain and simple! It's a MUST buy for any story driven game fans out there.Final Score: 10For more reviews and other fun stuff check out my tumblr. www.rogue32807.tumblr.com "

												To the Moon is a fantastic game. It's a story about two people named Dr. Rosaline and Dr. Watts and they give people a last chance to live out their final wish through their memories and make them think they actually did it. The patient they are currently working on is a man named Johnny whose final wish is to go to the moon. He doesn't remember why, but that's all he wants to do.Simple right? No, his story goes far back to his childhood and you must travel through the years of his life, find out why he wants to go to the moon, and give it to him.The story is fantastic, the soundtrack is great too, and characters are likable and memorable. It is also a game that will tug at your heart strings as you journey along. It is a very emotional game, and I bet you will be tearing up at the end at how good it is.Pick it up now and play through a fantastic experience. Also get the soundtrack too because it too is also great.			"

												I first came across this game when I was younger, when I watched PewDiePie play it four years ago. I was 14 and completely moved, marathoning the entire series in one night, until about four in the morning. The song that Johnny plays stuck with me for days afterwards, along with the heartbreakingly bittersweet story.Then, a few years later when I was 16, I remembered the game fondly but I had mostly forgotten about it when I saw in my subscribtion feed that Markiplier had begun playing it, and I was overwhelmed with emotion. I was older, and some things that happened in the game had begun to happen in my life, and the game went from ""completely moving"" to ""soul crushing masterpiece"". My brother and I watched the game together, and despite only being in piano lessons for about three months, I began learning the songs.Now, at 18, ""For River"" is a song that my entire family asks me to play at every gathering, especially my Nana, whose husband is very ill. I wish I could tell her what that song means, because everyone, especially her, should know. This game is brilliant. It's heartbreaking, bittersweet, and emotional. It manages to crush your soul while also providing light comic relief, until you're left sobbing with a smile, gasping for air through your laugh-crying while you text your loved ones that you love them.

												This game is so awesome, it is just near impossible to put into words. The story is so awesome, it has such a great structure with its happy, sad, and funny moments. The music is great and I highly reccomend the addon for the music. The music in this game just adds so much to it, it is so beautiful. I often find myself humming the tunes from this game. The pixel art is just gorguous, and the characters are so well drawn. To really understand why this game is so awesome, you need to play it for yourself. :)			"

												An amazing, touching story for anyone, including non-gamers, to play. While the ""gameplay"" isn't the its best feature, the story and music are the shining treasures of this game. The story will definitely touch you in some way. Don't watch the ending first. This is one of those games where you just have to watch it from the beginning as everything has meaning to it. Watch a Let's Play if you have to, but I recommend supporting FreeBird Games by purchasing it yourself. Especially since one of the artists for the game is currently hospitalized. The music is one of my favorite parts of the game. I've learned most of the songs from this game on the piano. Definitely get the soundtrack with it. It hits the right mix between calm yet emotional. Just play the game before you listen to the soundtrack. It will make the music more memorable. All in all, definitely get this game for the story. If you like Mother 3 or sad stories, this is the game for you.			"

 To the Moon  brings forth laughter and tears: it is at once light-hearted and heart-rending; its ambivalence, its fancy, its tame obscurity are remarkable; it is witty and laden with quaint allusions and references that produce at least a few smiles; the game's music is beautiful and truly interwoven with its scenes and emotions; visually, it is aesthetically and emotionally fitting (I think) to the story it tells; because of its great human depth and winged fantasy, it feels almost palpable, as though its depiction of joy and sorrow (mingled with high wishes and hopes, and a bit of life's complexities, ambiguities and contradictions) made up its soul; the characters feel very much alive, and the fact that one must imagine their voices (with their subtle intonations) gives it a special charm, especially when softly directed by the superb score; the narrative and its gentle windings, the tender symbolism and the plentiful details throughout (some telling, some cryptic) are also excellent; (the two minisodes are especially revelatory, intriguing and puzzling); doubtless, a most memorable piece.

												A short, story-driven RPG-maker XP game. Never before have a stuffed Platypus, a hacky sack, the Animorphs, pickled olives, and origami rabibits made me feel so emotional. I can't say much other than it is a very good and sad/sweet experience. There are minor puzzles and only one ending, so don't worry about your choices (the very few that are there). And I should emphasize that it is 4 hours or so. The two minisodes should be played as well, as they slightly set up the sequel which should come out later.			"

												To the moon is simply a great game which focuses more on the story instead of the game play,  which is okay considering that is isn`t a very long game. The story is fantastic and heart warming and that is imprssive since it's a really short game that you can complete in a couple of hours, but if you`re looking for gameplay rather than a story then i can`t recommend this game since it is really lacking at interaction and in things to do. The characther are memorable and fantastic which is really important in a game like this. Gameplay:4/10(not beacuse it`s bad, but beacuse there isn`t much of it), Story: 10/10, characters: 10/10.

												This game is simply humorous and enlighting. The fact the you get to make an elder man's goal become ""reality"", or at least change his past for the better, is just beautiful. I also love how this game is named after a heavenly body, which in this case is the moon, and how this game includes things to do with astronomy! This game is certainly an outlier from every other video game I've played throughout my life. The OST is beautiful and FABULOUS! The piano music is amazing and very grand. I also love the music box version of Everything's Alright. There's nothing to hate when it comes to its OST and sound FX. Everything blends in amazingly and correctly. The graphics are better than what I expected! HQ graphics. The way Johnny's grand piano was designed is so mind blowing and perfect in every way. The way the lighthouse, ""Anya"", was designed was also giving it the perfect touch to the outside scenery of the cliff. And the characters didn't look crippled, they seemed normal and ""human like"". The animals were so cute and so life-like, too. They all had perfect figures and their limbs were proportionate. This is game is honestly my favorite game! The best storyline, OST, graphics, and characters in all of gaming history! Worth the price! :D I'm very happy with my purchase! :D :) Thanks for making such a great game!! :D :)			"

To The Moon is a game that I didn't expect much of, but ended up being quite possibly my favorite game. This game is absolutely worth full priceI could say some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t here about how ""To The Moon tells a masterfully orchestrated tale of humanity: Remembering who you are and what you mean to those who love you"" and, to be fair, it does. The problem is that there's just nothing I can really say to make you play this game other than this: Trust me. It's short, it's sweet, and maybe a little salty from all the tears, and it should be at the very top of the ""To Play:"" list for anyone that enjoys a good story. Hell, for anyone because it tells a story that's relevant to all of us. The StoryThis game doesn't have a story. it is a story, but that's what makes it so great. The story focuses on a man named Johnny, and his final wish: to go to the moon. Now, that's all the detail I'm going to tell you, because [insert ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about experiencing the story here]. I mean, yeah, that's what makes a good story, a great story. It's also probably why I liked this game so much to be honest, because I went into it fully blind. I picked it up in a hmble bundle, like, years ago, and just played it. I have to say, it was not what I was expecting. I was originally gonna put this in that last paragraph, but went on a tanget that I just dont want to take the time to move it somewhere else. ANYWAY, let's move on. This story is one of humanity and unconditional love. Well, kinda. At least on the unconditional love part. It is most definitely a story about humanity. One that teaches that you need to remember who you are and what you mean to those who love you (which, conviniently, is the same fluffy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that I said I wasn't gonna put in here. So I'm a liar. Sue me.). Something that I know that a lot of people need to hear.And it's just ♥♥♥♥ing good.The GameplayIt's not much. RPG Maker isometric perspective. It doesn't need much though. It's a story. A good one. (see above)I don't even know why I added this sectionThe MusicYes.In all seriousness, the soundtrack is great. One of the best things about this game. You can get it on steam  or on Bandcamp[freebirdgames.bandcamp.com]My personal reccomendations are Everything's Alright and any version of For RiverRantI. ♥♥♥♥ING. Love. This game. That is all.Hey, and if you like this there are other games from Freebird on steam. You can get Bird Story here  or, next summer, you can get Finding Paradise here.  "

												After almost two years, I finally got around to playing ""To the Moon"". It's billed as an adventure game, but is really just a wonderful story told through JRPG mechanics.  Great pixel art, good scripting and a wonderful soundtrack all make the experience enjoyable and very touching.  It's a bit of a slow burn, at first, but once you get past the story setup, you'll be hard pressed to stop playing until the end.""To the Moon"" will tug at your heart in surprising ways.  What are we and what is life, but the sum total of our memories and experience?  And, at the end of your life, if you could change something from that experience, would you?  And at what cost?It's really thought-provoking stuff, and is told in a way that will make you smile, make you reflect on your life...and break your heart.  Start to finish is only about three hours and, at the end, you'll get that same bittersweet feeling as when you finish a wonderful novel.			"

Gameplay is quite linear and a bit repetitive, but I really enjoyed the ride. It is also a bit on the short side, which is good, considering the mechanics. The story makes it worth it, and I really hope there is a sequel or a new chapter in the future. Definitely one of the best indie games I've played in a while. Just remember the game is more of an interactive story than anything else (and I happen to like interactive stories), so if that's your cup of tea, then this is definitely recommended.

												This is such an amazing game. It's beautifully written making you fall in love with the characters as the game progresses. It's intresting plot that goes backward in time makes you almost think John's life will end differently. With some moments that just make you want to cry (usually you do) To the Moon is a well paced that game that although appears to go slowly goes just the right pace for you too fall inlove with the story of this wonderfull man. Not only does the graphics appear to be beautifully created in it's own way. Don't let the fact it has an rpg game style push you away. The soundtrack to come with it links perfectly to the mood it's tying to show and gives an amplified effect to the storyline. Not only does this game have those heart warming moments the narration between Dr Watt's and Dr Rosalene even makes you laugh at the best of times wanting you to know more into their own story. - I absolutly recommend this game it shows a story in a way you have never seen before.

												In a nutshell, ""To the Moon"" is the story of two doctors looking to fulfill the wish of a dying man named Johnny. His wish is to go, you guessed it, to the moon. The problem with that is he doesn't know why and it's up to the two doctors to find out and they do this by going into his memories. I won't spoil any of the plot for you but the journey is one well worth taking. I wouldn't exactly call ""To the Moon"" a game per se. You basically look around the level for fragments of a memory which trigger a memento that helps you reach the next memory. After you trigger the memento, you have to do some light puzzle solving. Sometimes, you will have to do other things but this is the definiton of a casual game. There's no time limits, no right or wrong way to do things and you WILL eventually fulfill Johnny's wish to get to the moon. That's why I'd call this more of a visual novel than a game. The story is really what sucks you in. It's almost a nuisance to go through the gameplay because you just want to find out what happens. And I will say, this game about 80% in throws you a massive curveball I didn't see coming. Like System Shock 2 - SHODAN type curveball. Overall I'd recommend ""To the Moon"" for it's wonderful story of love and loss and the superb soundtrack. Yes, you can loosely call this a ""game"" but it's definitely worth a playthrough if you enjoy good stories. 7.5/10 from me.			"

												To the Moon is a beautiful short story game where you work through the main protagonists memories, heading back to when he was a child to grant him his last wish of going to the moon. Your time is spent searching for memory links to learn parts of the main protagonists life and his counterpart, in an 8 bit world. The game itself is simple and yet that is all it needs to be as the narrative is told wonderfully and the story shines on through and speaks for itself. This game is guaranteed to hit you right in the feels and give you goosebumps, so what are you waiting for?			"

												What do Roadkill, a dying man and zombies have in common? Nothing! And yet To The Moon crafts these elements together to form such a seamless and beautiful experience that will remain with you long after the credits roll.To the Moon follows the story of two scientists whose role is to visit the dying, and alter their memories of their life so that they can die fulfilled. In this instance, they visit a comatose old man, ""Johnny"", whose final wish is to visit the moon - the only issue is that he has no idea why he wants to do so. Admittedly this may sound depressing, but the dialogue between the two scientists is refreshingly full of humour to keep things perky.To The Moon is an absolute masterpiece of a game - the soundtrack is unique and accompanies the story perfectly, and although the graphics are in 16 bit style and the actual 'gaming' aspect of it is more point-and-click than anything, none of this detracts in the slightest from the genius and depth of the whole experience. I cannot recommend this game highly enough - worth every last penny. You owe it to yourself to play this.			"

												What 'To the Moon' isn't: an action game, a role-playing game, an adventure game.What 'To the Moon' is: a beautiful interactive novel that tells a poignant, human story.Using wonderfully retro pixel art (reminicient of the SNES), To the Moon tells the story of a man's life in reverse, spinning a tale that is equal parts melancholy and uplifting.  The gameplay interacions are absolutely minimal - there are some light hidden object mechanics, and a realitive easy recurring puzzle..... but that's not really the point of the game.  To the Moon is a schmultzy (in a good way) story set against a lovingly-crafted canvas and set to some utterly captivating piano scores.  The game looks and sounds amazing, and if you don't get misty eyed at least a few times then I don't know what's wrong with you.If you loved 'Gone Home', or other recent pieces of interactive fiction, then you should nsap this gem up right away.

												I've recently played a few games that are story-driven experiences with puzzle elements. This is one of those. ""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"" is another. ""Brothers"" concentrates on conveying emotional story through traditional gaming conventions and unique ways of interacting using a controller. It is also presented in beautiful 3D with excellently crafted character models. In contrast, ""To the Moon"" uses a simple RPG engine with basic sprites but manages to pack in such a compelling, unique story through written dialogue that only being able to walk in four directions and not actually having the threat of death or overly complicated puzzles fades away.The story of ""To the Moon"" is front and center. And it is good. It is hard to explain without spoilers but suffice to say that it would appeal to fans of romantic movies, sci-fi and specifically the movie ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" There is enough mystery to keep you plugging away until you finish and this can be done in one sitting fairly easily. The game clocks in at around four and a half hours.Unfortunately I have a few minor complaints. As I said, you can only walk in four directions. Unfortunately, too often you get stuck in strange terrain or are blocked by a plant or grass you thought was background. Also, at times, the walking pace seems painfully slow. To the game's credit, it often is because you can't wait to get to the next story-element and often it feels appropriate given the pacing of the story but the fact remains when you aren't dashing by default, a run option would have been nice. Also, at times the graphics are a little rough and it strikes me that there is one cut scene that utilizes the pixel art of the main game and another two that make use of hand-drawn animation. I would have liked the cut scenes to use the same style throughout.Really, my complaints are minor so I will end with one last noteworthy positive aspect of this game: the music. It's appropriate everywhere it appears and it is very good. This is a soundtrack that puts you in the mood for the story that is told and as I said before, the story is worth it. I recommend this game as an experience. It's not terribly expensive or much of a time commitment so give it a spin. I think you'll love it if you're into creative story-telling experiences.			"

												holy. Flunknugget. Where to start?First of all, as a fan of them old RM2k games I'm glad to see myself taken back to those times.Secondly, this story. This effin Story. as they say in the game ""its like watching an accident"". but in a good way. Since you start on the End and slowly inch back towards Johnnys Childhood you can practically see where things go wrng. and allways that one question: Why does he want to the moon?Well, even tho the Story and presentation are well made theres some small things to nag upon. 1st: the 2nd act really feels out of place after the owerful and kinda feel-heavy first act. You'll see what I mean. and 2nd: sometimes the gameplay is counterintuitive. Let me elaborate: To advance you have to find 5 memory links and a Memento. But those memory links arent really that obvious to find. Often its just ""stuff lying around"" but then, in bigger areas or areas without interactable stuff, its kinda hard to figure out where they are or why they are there.Noneoftheless, To The Moon is a great Story Experience.

												To be 100% honest.. I did not know about the game untill I bought it on steam by ""accident"".I bought it and tried it and I was stuck in the story after the first 5 minutes of the game.During my stream (I stream on twitch daily) I told my chatters that this could actually be a really good game.What I did not know was that the game had already been out for about 2½ year before I started playing.I will give the game following Puppy-Points after playing through the story twice:Story Mode: 10/10 - A really sad story that made both me and most of my chatters cry like kids who just lost their candy.Game Interaction: 9/10 - The way you move around, talk to other characters, playing around with the ""puzzles"".. Is amazingly well done / created. Good Job!Graphics: 9/10 - The animations, characters looks and the anumals in the game were really good looking. Animations on the main characters were stunning and you could actually FEEL what they were saying. Not just read it.Feelings: 10/10 - The feelings were following: Happyness!Start of the game was as it was supposed to be. Very humoristic and you got stuck in both Watts and Rosaline at first view. It made me really happy in the beginning that they had humor in this dark story (Yes I read the game info before I started playing). Sadness!The sad feelings came in at around 15 min mark when we started to know what was actually going to happen. When we realized that (SPOILER!!) the Lighthouse had such a big part in the story. Also that ""For River"" was a song that was going to be stuck inside you for the rest of your gameplay. AMAZING!Anger!Anger was something I felt during late-mid/late gameplay when I was thrown around the feelings for Rosaline and Watts when they were getting so close to their goal. What was I to belive? Happyness again!When we at the ending realized what has happened through the WHOLE story.. I couldn't bare anymore.The feelings fly throu me like a bullet and hit the heart twice.I have never been so sad about something happy ever and I will hopfully never be. Because thatf eeling was to be honest really damn scary.My Total points of the game will however end at 9/10.Why not 10/10? WHATS WRONG?!Following:The game is actually a game for kids / teens. This makes me wonder.. Is the story really going in at younger ages?I belive that people between 10 - 16 will have a hard time following the time-warps that takes place in-game. Even I (25 years old) had a hard time following this. (Hence why I played it twice).Also.. The story ends with (Sry.. no spoiler here).. and I am wondering.. What had actually happened here?Did it turn out well/good for both parts? Or was it just the one main character that actually had anything good out of this?After I played the game I went over to youtube in a flash and started reading about what people were actually thinking about the ending. And my god! So much argumentations about what was actually happening.I have however decided to belive that the good part of all of this belongs to myself.I have never played a game that short who has inspired me or touch me like To The Moon did.If you have not yet played the game.. Just do it. It will take you a maximum of 3 hours (depending on how much you will cry).If you have played the game.. What do you give this game as in points? I am intrested in knowing that. Maybe I can learn something that will make me put that last point into a full 10/10.Worth the money?No doubt - Hands down.Worth the time?Skip a movie.Worth the tears?Yes. Thank you, my dear developers, for making this game. I will play the rest of the games in the series very soon.You will hear from me again./ PuppyStream.net™ "

I can't say much other than it is a very good and sad/sweet experience. There are minor puzzles and only one ending, so don't worry about your choices (the very few that are there). And I should emphasize that it is 4 hours or so. The two minisodes should be played as well, as they slightly set up the sequel which should come out later.			"

												I literally just finished the game less than a minute ago, and my first thought was to write my first review.  I'm a sucker for games that have an impressive story.  For example, Bioshock Infinite had plenty of action and a killer ending to go along, and I loved it.  Same with The Last of Us.  But this game, To The Moon, is the first that made me cry.  I'm not ashamed to admit it because this game is truely a gift.To those of you wondering whether it's a worthy investment, it is.  If you are fine with tons of dialogue and a bit of puzzle solving, then by all means, purchase as soon as possible.  This is by far the best game I've played in my life story-wise.  And the music...I don't think the game would have been nearly as good if the music was different.Overall, amazing and perfect game.  I will probably replay it just to try and experience it again, but there is nothing like the first time.			"

												Wow, this game is brillaintFirstly, don't be put off by the graphics. It looks like an RPG, but plays like an adventure game.While there are puzzles, which are somewhat basic, they aren't the focus in this game. This game is all about story.You take on the role of two people basically performing Inception on a client; jumping back through his memories to make him think he went to the moon. It's strange seeing the events play out backwards, but it's fun piecing it all together. There were a few moments where they game had thrown me off completely about the context of some events, making it all the better when they were revealed later in the plot. It's apparently also part of an episodic game so I want as many people to play it so we can get the rest sooner.Only bad thing to say about it; DAVID'S MAIN MORPH IS A LION.			"

But clearly I was wrong!This game has no real action, no shooting or fighting...NOTHING!! Yet this game is magnificent.it's a really short game, i can tell you that but you'll wish that this game would last longer. From the moment the game really starts you're pratically hooked. I highly recommend that you play this game in one go.This game can bring up more emotions than any AAA game out there! From the funny moments when you're laughing due the hilarious dialogues all the way to the very sad moments in the story (believe me there are A LOT of them, so be prepared!).This game alos has one of the best soundtracks ever that can emotionally touch you very deeply and also the artwork is magnificent if you consider their very small budget they had to work with. People who liked the chrono trigger artwork will definitely fall in love with this game.recommended: play this game in one go and don't forget to bring a box filled with tissues because there will be tears that shall be shed! #demFeelzfor the bonus level i recommend you read the guide here:

												How could I possibly put into words anything that would even remotely come close to an accurate representation of my thoughts on this?This is simply one of the greatest experiences I have ever had in my 22(at the time) years. Trying to pinpoint specific things that made it such would be difficult. Just a wonderful experience. The music, oh lord the music. The combined talents of Laura Shigihara and Kan Gao make this one of the most, alright i'll say it, beautiful soundtrack in a game that is based entirely on its narrative story. The fitting music is comforting when it needs to be as well as dark and unsettling in times where you truly feel worried. However then you have moments like Laura Shigihara's ""Everythings Alright"" that just bring all the emotion, struggle, hope and everything you've been obsorbing the whole time and lets it all out with you.The simplistic yet perfect medium.Using what could arguably be a simple medium for the presentation of this game, the story and music brings it to the player in a way that far surpasses some more elaborate and higher budget projects. Its just simple, raw, true storytelling. When finishing you can't help but wonder what these writing talents could do given the support of some AAA titles. However at the same time I think a lot of the magic would be lost. Which brings me to my belief that the current method works just fine.The story keeps you going.The biggest drawback people might face is the gameplay. This is where you notice the time focused more on story/music rather than gameplay elements. It is point and click at its finest. More of an interactive story than an adventure. But don't that make you think its so easy *cough* horseback riding memory *cough*. There are things that require thought. Which are kind of speed bumps on your way but provide a good way of pacing the story.Onward and upward.This is not all Kan Gao and Freebird Games have done. They have other projects worth looking into which can be found on their site. There is also an extra holiday episode that fills a gap between To the Moon and the upcoming Bird Story. All of which I highly reccomend looking into.Must do's.Others can feel free to edit in their own thoughts here, but how you play this game is a very important deal in my opinion. I should start by explaining how I came across this game. I came home from work to log into Steam and do my daily ""what are my friends up to?"" check. I see just one friend in game. An unfamiliar title to which I instantly message him asking what it was. I got no reply so I simply shrugged and went about my evening until about 3 hours later I finally heard the all too familiar ping of Steam messaging. Now this friend is one i've known and grown with for years. We are very alike. His reply was simply ""get this game."" Luckily I had money and before I even replied it was downloading.I jokingly asked something to the effect of ""what the hell did I just buy."" He basically told me to shut my door, disable Steam overlay, put my phone away and just play the game. So I did. Roughly 3.5 hours later I emerged after the wonderful thing I just sat through. So in playing this, I HIGHLY reccomend do it in one sitting and far from the distractions of the world. In short, this is one of the greatest things I have ever seen. All who wish for an amazing story pick this up. You can ask any of my Steam friends, I think i've bought it for almost all of them			"

												If you like retro styled games that are based fully on the story, this is for you. While playing this game it felt like I was reading a book, a book that takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. My emotions changed from being sad, happy, and to creeped out just from a single scene change. I recommend playing this game when no one will disturb you, it helps you get into the game.Now however, while this game's story was good, the gameplay was lacking. The minigames seemed to serve no purpose other than to exist. They were short, and didn't give much entertainment if any. I would have either not include them, or implement them in a way that fits the story better, instead of having them get you to the next part of it. ( Another thing, did how well you did on the minigames even affect anything? From what I have seen they don't do anything.)Besided this, the game had a good soundtrack, had no bugs/glitches (atleast for me), and it presented it story well, you never knew what was going to happen. I would rate this game at a 8/10.			"

												A beautiful gem of a game. Despite not liking RPGmaker type games, I decided to give this a try and don't regret it at all. A whimsically wonderful, yet sad, storyline accompanied by a remarkablly haunting and soul-touching soundtrack. I found myself very engrossed in the the telling of the story and came to tears a few times thinking about the loves and losses in my own life. Despite the underlying theme it is a truly beautiful piece of work one shouldn't miss. My hats off to the developer and especially the composer of the music. Synergy at its finest.			"

												holy. Flunknugget. Where to start?First of all, as a fan of them old RM2k games I'm glad to see myself taken back to those times.Secondly, this story. This effin Story. as they say in the game ""its like watching an accident"". but in a good way. Since you start on the End and slowly inch back towards Johnnys Childhood you can practically see where things go wrng. and allways that one question: Why does he want to the moon?Well, even tho the Story and presentation are well made theres some small things to nag upon. 1st: the 2nd act really feels out of place after the owerful and kinda feel-heavy first act. You'll see what I mean. and 2nd: sometimes the gameplay is counterintuitive. Let me elaborate: To advance you have to find 5 memory links and a Memento. But those memory links arent really that obvious to find. Often its just ""stuff lying around"" but then, in bigger areas or areas without interactable stuff, its kinda hard to figure out where they are or why they are there.Noneoftheless, To The Moon is a great Story Experience.

												First thing that attracted me to this game were the soundtracks, worth buying the OST bundle. The game is like reading a novel, but with pictures and sounds, and the story is amazing. It's got funny moments, happy, sad, creepy moments and you would not stop reading/playing the game until you're finished. You can always give a try for free for 1 hour on their main website, I personally love this game and would like to read/play the game again in the future :). I don't read a lotta books and i think if they've got a book for this story i'd read it. I give it a 10/10, for the people who simply want to read a story that really catches your emotions should really give this game a try!! Amazing storyline.			"

												What 'To the Moon' isn't: an action game, a role-playing game, an adventure game.What 'To the Moon' is: a beautiful interactive novel that tells a poignant, human story.Using wonderfully retro pixel art (reminicient of the SNES), To the Moon tells the story of a man's life in reverse, spinning a tale that is equal parts melancholy and uplifting.  The gameplay interacions are absolutely minimal - there are some light hidden object mechanics, and a realitive easy recurring puzzle..... but that's not really the point of the game.  To the Moon is a schmultzy (in a good way) story set against a lovingly-crafted canvas and set to some utterly captivating piano scores.  The game looks and sounds amazing, and if you don't get misty eyed at least a few times then I don't know what's wrong with you.If you loved 'Gone Home', or other recent pieces of interactive fiction, then you should nsap this gem up right away.

Yes, there's some cheesy jokes and some nerd humor, also many references to popular (early) 90s items. Not recommended for your typical fps gamer, this is for the more refined whack-a-mole crowd (play the game to get the joke). BE WARNED: NO REPLAYABLILTY AT ALL.

												AT A GLANCE: A gem among the visual novels.[A more detailed review follows below.]Game Name: To The MoonOriginal Release Date: November 1, 2011My Overall Rating: AEstimated Playtime: 2.5 to 4 hours (Campaign)Multiplayer: NoneRecommended To: Visual novels lovers and those players looking for movie-like game with a great story or a good weekend pass-time game, and casual players.REVIEWTo The Moon is a example of a good indie VN game, with some RPG-ish mixed with it. It feels truly like a gem among so many VN out there. It is not a true game,yet if offers a story-rich, which you may get immersed in itself. Well, that's might sound like a bit of exaggeration, however this game is a really polished visual novel with a great story and soundtrack. Great atmosphere and aesthetic.It has got a great emotional aspect. The game blends realism greatly with human psychology. Sometimes, there are times when we humans try to do something unique even at the last stage of their life. And this game amazingly engages you in the story that you might not even remember trying to check out the menus of the game but keep on playing. It is deeply engaging that charms you to complete it in a single playthrough. I also played it non-stop for about four hours and didn't even realize there was a power cut. This is a great experience-giving game and will surely make your weekend good after all your hard work or study.Regarding the gameplay, being a visual novel, it includes a point-and-click like mechanics and keyboard support. You can play as two characters (scientists, to be precise) on a quest of fulfilling a... (Well, let's not spoil the game, shall we?) I say that you play it at least once by yourself. In summary, a great VN, which I truly recommend for any VN lovers and those looking for a short game with rich story,pleasing soundtrack,and aesthetic game contents.			"

												It is very infrequent that I play a game that I consider truly beautiful, and nothing less than genuinely lovely. To the Moon is entirely story based, and the only gameplay to be found is in the form of tile puzzles and a later (apalling) action sequence. Yet the story involved is so heart-wrenchingly engaging that I found myself playing through the 4/5 hour process in merely a few hours. Along with a few intelligent twists, this story reaches a satisfying conclusion. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with To the Moon, despite the terrible controls, and would recommend it to anybody with a heart.			"

												I loved it. Technologically the game was kind of mediocre (noticeable screen tearing, fixed 640x480 resolution, etc.) and the gameplay got pretty tedious at times, but the actual art - graphics, music and story are all absolutely amazing.As an autistic person I found the girl's part of the storyline kind of.. cliche, I guess? I think they pushed it just a *little* bit too hard. Christ, I get it, autistic people are often socially inept. That doesn't mean every scene with the girl has to revolve around that.Anyway, in terms of story, this is one of the best games I have played in a long time. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, assuming you aren't expetcing it to be a traditional RPG just because it uses the same format.			"

												First of all i'd like to say this isn't much of a game, it's more of an interactive storybook. The game is mainly dialogue between characters, with some small bits of gameplay in between. But i wouldn't have it any other way. This is something you MUST experience. It will tug at your heart strings, make you look at yourself in a different light and even give you a different view of is important in life. I can't tell you any more than that without spoilers, just do yourself a favour and set aside 3 hours of your time to experience this beautiful masterpiece. :)			"

												While I can't say this is a game I cried over, To The Moon is a game that will probably linger in my mind throughout the rest of my life. The story is impactful, light-hearted, and most importantly, interesting enough to keep playing through to the end.What To The Moon shows without spoiling much is that life can bring about very unfortunate circumstances, but even under them, people are determined to find happiness, and will use any means to have it. We don't live for what brings us down, but for what keeps us up and fighting to our last breath. Where it shows best is its unbelievable narration and character dialogue. You will remember the happy and humorous parts as much as you would the sad and depressing parts, but neither of the parts affect each other no matter how close they are together in the story.The music? While some may call it repetitive, I find it far from it. It fits many of the situations in the story, and uses the piano as a distinct theming tool. And let me not forget that wonderful piece by Laura Shigihara. I haven't heard a lot from her, being one song from Plants vs. Zombies. But this song is simply stunning, and even moreso in where it plays.Its gameplay can be somewhat excused considering the engine it's built off of, RPG Maker XP. So yes it does look and feel like an old JRPG, but that's not what the game's about anyway. The puzzles were intuitive, but a little too easy (maybe it was intentional so it could be enjoyed in 4 hours?). The mouse controls are convenient especially during sections where it's difficult to find pieces for mementos (which for me almost turned into a pixel-hunt without them).To conclude the review, To The Moon is a game that takes life's meaning and puts it in the hands of the player. Where it takes you is your decision alone.			"

Yes, there's some cheesy jokes and some nerd humor, also many references to popular (early) 90s items. Not recommended for your typical fps gamer, this is for the more refined whack-a-mole crowd (play the game to get the joke). BE WARNED: NO REPLAYABLILTY AT ALL.

												I like to try out indie games with positive reviews to see how they can keep up with big titles. Last I played was Dear Esther which disappointed me within like 10mins of playing. There was zero interaction in it.I had doubts about To The Moon since I haven't played any top-down pixel graphics game probably since PokeMon. But just when I double-clicked on the icon and heard the intro soundtrack while loading the main menu, I got my first impression, and it definitely made me wanna play the game. Few minutes into the game, you'll find yourself fully immersed in the story. Whether you like it or not, trust me, it will happen. Despite the short 6 hour duration of the game, it's one amazing journey which will probably remain in your memory for a long time. Top reasons why you MUST play this:+The amazingly driven storyline +Splendid humor+Heart-touching soundtrack that matches the story perfectly+Has a lot of interactions for a simple-style gameDo play this game.

												To the moon – ♫ Fly me to the moon♫ To the moon was released in 2011. I first acquired the game as part of a humble bundle and paid it no mind! Man was that a mistake!!The game is listed as an Adventure RPG. But i would call it an interactive short story told backwards. Its not so much a game as it is a great story in a game. It will make you laugh, it might make you cry, but it will certainly show you how a great story can be told through a game. Mostly To the Moon is a treasure hunt, the goal is to find clues to unlock the next stage. With even a few mini games thrown in for good old fun. The story can be hard to follow at times, so make sure you read all the clues at the start. It will not make sense at first but they soon will. This game does have high repeatable play value, because of the complexity of the story.As to the game itself, well it has the feel of an 8-16 bit JRPG.  With simple point and click movement  throughout most of the game play. There is no real combat,  unlike most RPG’s.  And you play as one of two characters, both being doctors. Your goal is to replace a dying mans last wish. It is hard to go into further detail without giving out spoilers.    I would give this game a top rating due to it is an ingenious way to tell a great story while drawing the reader in for more. You cannot beat the price, and it is a no contest debate, whether or not I will buy the next short story game from FreeBird games. I just hope you enjoy this game, err story, um ah game as much as I did.  -TheBad300			"

												Wow. I literally tripped over this game looking through the store, and I couldn'y believe the reviews. People were saying 10/10 best game ever, and I was like ""there's now way this rpg maker game is a 10/10."" I was wrong. This game has very little actual gameplay, so don't come in expecting that. Rather, it is musically and narratively driven. This is one of those games that is so intriguing that you think about it for days, weeks, years after you play it. The story is just fantastic, and the music is superb. The only con I would list for this game is that the dialogue for the scientists is pretty cringy. Nevertheless, the story and the music blows that minor complaint out of the water for a solid 10/10 and one of my favorite games ever. BUY THIS GAME. SHARE THIS GAME. PLAY THIS GAME.			"

												Okay, first of... I dont even have enough words to describe how good this game is... i think that by now many of the persons that will actually read this review would have played it, but i feel the need to write this anyways. If you dont know, this is a pseudo 2D game that its mainly a love story of a dying man and her deceased wife, in which you will have to alter his memorys to grant him his last wish (read below for more info)Lets first talk about the lenght of the game: you must probably be saying ""what the heck, he only played for 3hs"". Yes, thats enough to complete the game. Maybe the correct term for this game is an interactive movie, sort of. If this game you play as 2 ""doctors"" that change the memories of the persons to grant a last wish for them (as dying persons). In this case, as the title of the game says, its about making a patience go to the moon. Having that into account lets go to next part of my review.Emotional review: Oh my god... this game is a hurricane of emotions, they make you laught, they make you cry, they scare you at some points. Just to place this into context, i was playing the game while i was in the office, and i honestly cryed a couple of times... its just beautiful... WHICH brings me to the next point ->Music review: The music for the game (as they well say) its repetitive BUT its a good repetitive, not an annoying repetitive. The use of the music is just perfect, the emotional music, the scary, the ""funny tracks"", everything... it just fits every single part of the game.Gameplay review: You must already be tired of me saying its perfect, but it really is, the game is well polished, and i didnt enounter any problems moving through the game world. They set you up in a kindof straight map in which you have a couple of puzzles from time to time to resolve. Nothing that can take you more than 5 minutes each.------------------------Personal comments about the game: Even with the pseudo 2D graphics, the game plays with you emotions, without even the need of using real words. The dialogs are all written.I dont really know how much the game is right now, but even for the 3hs of gameplay I had it was worth whatever price I payed. It is probably on my top 5 of best games and it shall remain there for a very long time.Have no doubts on buying the game, you will not regret it.			"

												A very bittersweet story. I cannot believe I put off playing this game for so long (despite listening to the OST so many times prior). It plays very much like a visual novel with interactive elements and is very linear, which I do not consider a negative at all. Do not let the graphics put you off as the story and dialogue will more than entertain you! I very much enjoyed the simplicity and, honestly, it was refreshing in this age of complex/layered gaming. Very much recommended for gamers of any background.			"

												This review will be short because I do not want to ruin the story. The main thing I can say is it is a game I would consider perfect the music always fits the scene, the gameplay is simple and minimal but at the same time briliant, the story is great that all I will say to avoid spoilers and the final reason and, the one I thing is the most importent is River she is so well written and to top it off though out the story you find out she has aspergers and other then a couple of points in the story which I think do not represent aspergers to well like calling it a disability, but overall she is probably the best charcter with aspergers in gaming and as someone with aspeger that is a huge plus.Overall this game is Amazing and worth a play so just great it already.

												This is quite possibly one of the most beautiful games I have ever played story and graphics wise. The few puzzles in this are relatively simple but fun to figure out.  Fair warning that playing this produced quite a few tears, especially around the midpoint of the game. (And the music is so hauntingly beautiful, moreso after that point that I almost always had tears welling for the rest of the game.)Also, I definitely recommend playing through the whole thing in one sitting. It's short enough that it is entirely worth it, and while I found quite a few places that could make decent stopping points, I was so invested in the story that I wanted to find out what was next. I'm also definitely going to play through the story again just to find out what I'll see differently now that I know the end.And I haven't even started the two minisodes that are dlc, but I've got some high expectations based on the quality of the main story!

												A strange combination of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""Citizen Kane,"" and a push puzzle game. Which might sound terrible, but the results are pretty awesome. Although there are mini-puzzles to solve, it's really more an ""interactive story"" than a game, per se, but the ""story"" elements are top notch and even kind of revolutionary, considering that this was made in RPG Maker. It's rare that any piece of storytelling uses its medium to the fullest to achieve its ends so well.It is heavy on the sentimentality at times, but usually it's smart enough to pull back with a bit of humor, or a non-sequitor, or just a genuinely well observed piece of writing before things venture into ""maudlin"" territory. Over all, though, it is very well written.			"

												I had some monumental expectations for ""To the Moon"". Seeing all of the reviewers claiming they cried, had me hope for a story that would keep me enthralled and emotionally invested the entire time.While the story is emotional, dealing with a husband's struggles in living with a wife with a mental condition, there was one thing  with the writing that kept bothering me...the doctors.They pulled me out of the story almost every time they interacted. From snarky banter, to pop culture references, to pointless ""mini-games"" involving  zombies??! . I think they weren't written with the same serious tone as the rest of the story.There is a major twist towards the end that I suppose is there to pull your heart strings, but there was no real build up to it and was in a completely different direction then where I thought the story was going.  I thought Anya was going to be a lost child, which would have suited the build up more and been a great cataclyst for River's change in condition. I must say that you should complete this in one playthrough to get the impact of the story. I can see someone missing the emotion if they left the game and came back later to finish it.I recommend people play this as it is a decent story. For a little more then the cost of a movie ticket and time to devote to it (it's 4 hrs long), it's something to experience, but I wish the writers had made the script hold up as maturely as the material.

												This is such an amazing game. It's beautifully written making you fall in love with the characters as the game progresses. It's intresting plot that goes backward in time makes you almost think John's life will end differently. With some moments that just make you want to cry (usually you do) To the Moon is a well paced that game that although appears to go slowly goes just the right pace for you too fall inlove with the story of this wonderfull man. Not only does the graphics appear to be beautifully created in it's own way. Don't let the fact it has an rpg game style push you away. The soundtrack to come with it links perfectly to the mood it's tying to show and gives an amplified effect to the storyline. Not only does this game have those heart warming moments the narration between Dr Watt's and Dr Rosalene even makes you laugh at the best of times wanting you to know more into their own story. - I absolutly recommend this game it shows a story in a way you have never seen before.

												What do Roadkill, a dying man and zombies have in common? Nothing! And yet To The Moon crafts these elements together to form such a seamless and beautiful experience that will remain with you long after the credits roll.To the Moon follows the story of two scientists whose role is to visit the dying, and alter their memories of their life so that they can die fulfilled. In this instance, they visit a comatose old man, ""Johnny"", whose final wish is to visit the moon - the only issue is that he has no idea why he wants to do so. Admittedly this may sound depressing, but the dialogue between the two scientists is refreshingly full of humour to keep things perky.To The Moon is an absolute masterpiece of a game - the soundtrack is unique and accompanies the story perfectly, and although the graphics are in 16 bit style and the actual 'gaming' aspect of it is more point-and-click than anything, none of this detracts in the slightest from the genius and depth of the whole experience. I cannot recommend this game highly enough - worth every last penny. You owe it to yourself to play this.			"

												Don't let my measley hours on this game fool you. I have played this game to death on another account. And let me tell you; it's worth every minute I spent on it. To The Moon is one of those games where you either take to the story right away, or you won't care much for it. But give it a try. Please. The story and the direction that it takes the player is such a good one. I'm not a cryer, but I teared up more than once playing this game. And honestly? I consider it one of my favorite games of all time. Gameplay wise... there's hardly any meat to it. But if you want some great writing, a good laugh, a good cry, and something to think about, experience this for yourself.			"

												This game tugs at the heart strings; who would have thought that a pixel game reminscent of Dragon Quest and other point-and-click games can? The witty banter between our scientist duo Eva and Neil makes for more personal characters as well as the curious wish of Johnny. With nods to various pop culture references and puns, the script as well as plot is what keeps you interested.The music is lovely, definitely recommend buying the game + OST bundle. My own negative was the lag but then again, could be my laptop. Otherwise, please check this game out!			"

Pair that with a spot on piano soundtrack and To The Moon is one of the best stories I've witnessed in video game format.			"

It will evoke a deep, poignant feeling that comes up every so often in our short, but memorable lives. And years from now, while you may forget what happens in To the Moon, you will never forget how it made you feel.No matter what your age, I encourage you to experience what this game has to offer.

												The good with the bad. In the end, an excellent experience.Good: Fantastic story and concept. The music is wonderful. The graphics are full of life. The early levels are detailed and magnificent to explore.Bad: Some terrible, occasionally dreadful writing. Most of the characters are written the exact same all the way through the game. There's little differenciation between the different eras of the story. Lots of incidental ""internet"" humor and references to pop culture that should have been deleted after the first draft. Many eras' memory links are reused from previous levels and the game starts giving up on the memory link structure about halfway. This all adds up to a scattershot and amateur tone that any editor worth his/her salt could have corrected in an hour.Do I like the game? Definitely. Is the end result effective? Sure. But I hope chapter two is better.			"

This game isn't about gameplay, it's about story. In fact, it's much more story than game. The actual ""gameplay"" elements are there, but barely at all. I'd call it more an interactive novel.Anyhow, pick it up if you're a story type. The dialogue can be a little clumsy and the controls a little wonky at times, but this is still a very good game with an extremely engrossing story.And the music's great, too.			"

												This is a FANTASTIC game. You play as one of two scientists who go to dying people and allow then to ""relive"" their lives, with modifications to their memories. You are able to grant a deathbed wish.You follow the life of a man and his love by tapping into his memories by using the same machine that you are using to alter his memories. You are but a ghost, observing the unfolding story and history of the man's life though his memories. You gain great insight and develop an emotional connection to the characters in the game to your own benefit to connect with them and really feel their stories, their happiness, and their sadness.There are YouTube Let's Plays of this game. Someone made a compilation ""Players react to To The Moon"" - specifically the ending. Even some of the most famous and comedic Let's Play broadcasters have been brought to a serious, quiet, somber demeanor as the game unfolds, and brought to tears at the end.Don't look at any reviews (well, except this one, it's too late!), don't watch the reaction video until you've beaten the game, don't listen to the music until you've completed the game. Just play it. It will take you in and immerse you. It will be one of those games you categorize in your mind as the most memorable and emotional stories in a video game ever.All this from sprites in a Final Fantasy esque presentation (but no random encounters!). It shows you don't need high definition, state of the art graphics to have a powerful game play experience. The music however is real, no midi synth or FruityLoops. Everything from a real simple piano piece (which you will find yourself YouTubing to listen to for years after playing it, if you don't outright buy the OST) to fully scored songs, one with (great) vocalization.Buy it. If you love a game for it's story over mindlessly running around killing things for XP, you will love To The Moon.			"

												It's so hard to say why this game is so good without spoiling it....I guess the main thing I love about it is how well-crafted the story is. There are many layers and details to consider, and I feel like there would be more to think about with each further playthrough. I've only just finished it and my mind is still reeling a bit, going over everything, connecting all the pieces, and thinking a bit beyond the visible aspects of the game. Just...wow.			"

												I bought this game on a sheer whim, looking for something new to add to my library and hoping to have some fun. I never expected to fall in love with it. From the first 20 minutes in, I was hooked. As implausible as the plotline sounds on paper, the game developers and writers have done an immaculate job of sucking you into this world where it's not only totally possible, it's commonplace.  It's cleverly written, intelligent, and the characters feel like real people.  There are so many gems in the dialogue that made me laugh out loud -- especially a particular TV show reference early on. And I can't say enough good things about the soundtrack. It is so, so lovely.While the gameplay itself is very simplistic and easy, the story is what will keep you rooted to your seat. The pacing is perfect -- moments of sadness, elation, and well-timed comedic relief are placed very well throughout the whole story. And that ending...well, I wouldn't dream of spoiling it, but just hang onto yer butts, kids. And bring the tissues.			"

												To the Moon is a visual novel rather than a game. I've heard the term RPG used to describe it but that would be incorrect as there are no unique mechanics, form of progression or indeed any aspect of your characters to progress. What might be considered puzzles or game play is nothing more than the game stubbornly folding its arms and barring you from the next chapter until you have collected all five macguffins in each tiny area and a breif bullet hell section at the very end. However, in spite of what I just said, I am recommending To the Moon because it tells an amazing story that kept me interested form beginning to end. As a game designed soley to tell a story it does so in spades with an intrigueing plot, relatable characters, and an ending I didn't see comming. I'm looking foreword to A Bird Story.			"

												A nice, sweet, touching game (~4.5 hours). The story was really cute, gameplay unique, dialogue amusing and music captivating. I really enjoyed playing through this game. The scenes with actual art was nice too. Overall, a beautiful yet sad story was the main reason why I managed to finish the game so quickly (2 sittings), and I'm sure whoever reads this will enjoy it just as much as I did. ^^			"

												I know it's already been said over and over again, but I'll say it again: To The Moon is a fantastic achievement in storytelling that weaves an intricate and fully engrossing tale through the medium of games. The pixel graphics are charming and suit the game well. The music is beautiful and perfectly timed, tugging at the player's emotions at just the right moments. While there are a few kinks here and there, the story is so entrancing that these can be easily overlooked.Actual gameplay is pretty minimal, with players simply exploring areas to progress the story and solving some easy puzzles, but it's an enjoyable experience nonetheless, and despite having a linear story, the game never feels too confined. I very quickly became invested in the plot and wanted to delve deeper and discover the answers to all the questions each new progression raised. To The Moon is a story that deals with a great range of emotions and takes the player along for the ride to experience the ups and downs of life. If you're the sensitive type, be prepared for tears. I cried like a baby.In short: I'd recommend this game to anyone and everyone who can appreciate a good story, regardless of what your actual taste in video-games is. You might be surprised.			"

												I literally just finished the game less than a minute ago, and my first thought was to write my first review.  I'm a sucker for games that have an impressive story.  For example, Bioshock Infinite had plenty of action and a killer ending to go along, and I loved it.  Same with The Last of Us.  But this game, To The Moon, is the first that made me cry.  I'm not ashamed to admit it because this game is truely a gift.To those of you wondering whether it's a worthy investment, it is.  If you are fine with tons of dialogue and a bit of puzzle solving, then by all means, purchase as soon as possible.  This is by far the best game I've played in my life story-wise.  And the music...I don't think the game would have been nearly as good if the music was different.Overall, amazing and perfect game.  I will probably replay it just to try and experience it again, but there is nothing like the first time.			"

												There is so much to say about this game. I absolutely do not want to ruin it however, so I will cut this down and keep it short. I am going to rate it for its seperate quilities and come up with an overall rating. Music: 10/10Graphics and art: 9/10Storyline: 10/10Overall gameplay: 7/10OVERALL GAME EXPERIENCE: 10/10.This game successfully had every aspect of a good story. It was incredibly sad at parts, yet was able to throw in humor ever so often. It made me connect with each character, and feel attached to them. They all reacted to problems the same way I feel I would, and probably most of you would. The makes of this game most likely did this on purpose to humanize the player and make them feel the emotions the characters are feeling. I would abosutely reccomend this game to anyone. For $ 10.00 you can have an incredibly interactive story, that will truely drive the experience. The only problem I ever thought of in regards to To The Moon, was the gameplay wasnt very full. Manly, the entire game is you collecting mementos to go to a new memory. However, if you feel a good story is worth it, then BUY THIS GAME NOW. I LOVED PLAYING EVERY MINUTE OF IT.			"

												Let's get the bad out of the way first.- Graphics have major issues.  At least it did for me.  I had two modes of playing.  Windowed mode (hit alt-enter) which means I was playing in a tiny window, or full screen mode, which on my screen for some reason meant a lot of the things were cut off.  Put it this way when I went to the load screen instead of ""Load File"" it said ""ile""  I had to play it in windowed mode.- Graphics were also not very good considering how low the resolution was.- Engine / path finding was a bit clunky.- Not much ""game"" in it.  There's a few minor puzzles.  That's about it.  - The dialogue felt a bit out of character sometimes.Now that doesn't sound like a very glowing review but if you'd notice there's a big ""Yes"" recommendation.  Why is that?  Well the music was quite beautiful (though it did get slightly repetitive at times).  But the most important thing...The story is beautiful.   It's almost ridiculously beautiful.  It's moving, sad, touching, and happy all in one package.  And in all honesty, if a good director got his hand on this story, I can see one heck of a great movie.  I mean you have to realize they did all of this with no voice acting and graphics that belong to the NES era (we're talking early 90s!).Highly recommended for people who enjoy melancholic stories (it starts a bit slow of course).  If you're into graphics or action or tough puzzles, this isn't the game for you though.			"

												Words can't be enough to describe how brilliant this is.Even though the gameplay is quite thin, focusing on collecting mementos and solving fairly easy puzzles, we're not here for that.It's the fantastic story, the brilliant musical score and the clever dialogue that steals the show immediately.The story tells about technology, which makes it possible for doctors to connect into patients' minds, see their memories and change them as they match their dreams.This corrupts though the ""real"" memories, so these have to be done when they're on their deathbed. I'm not getting the story any further, as you have to experience it on your own.The music is absolutely terrific, it fits to the mood of the story and enhances it at the same time.And the dialogue is both hilarious and thoughtful, it balances the game for not being too depressing or too jesting. The playful chit-chatting of doctors, the sad thoughts of Johnny (the ""main"" patient) and shy statements of his now-deceased autistic wife River.Now for hardcore gamers, this isn't one of your ""action thrills"" of the year, nor the longest games you've ever played (took me 5 hours to complete it).To The Moon is more like an interactive story than a game, but it doesn't hurt the in-game content.There are also sometimes a bit inconsistent pacing, turning suddenly from puzzling to throwing pot plants at zombies (Plants vs. Zombies?)Asides of these problems, it's hard to forget this game. It was completely different experience, and it deserves more attention than it currently has. It's one of those games that keeps reminding of what is truly important in life. From the beginning's lighthouse to the touching conclusion, it really is worth your money.			"

												To the Moon is an incredibly depressing game, and I loved every second of it. As a bit of a disclaimer, if you are sensitive, have at least 5 tissue boxes with you. Trust me, you will need them. Anyways, this game is about a dying man named Johnny, who has hired people to into his memories and fulfill one wish, which will be the last thing the patient remembers. Johnny's wish: to go to the moon. This is an unforgettable experience and is worth $10, the game will make you laugh with many pop culture references and its general sense of humour, and make you cry with its sad story and ending. Anyone longing for a good story NEEDS to play through this game... I promise you will not regret it.			"

With varied and insightful characters and a plot of could-have, would-have, should-have-beens that will make even the most pragmatic mind wonder about all the different paths life can take, there is plenty to love here.A wonderful, touching story of an individual life that is just one among the many.

												To the moon – ♫ Fly me to the moon♫ To the moon was released in 2011. I first acquired the game as part of a humble bundle and paid it no mind! Man was that a mistake!!The game is listed as an Adventure RPG. But i would call it an interactive short story told backwards. Its not so much a game as it is a great story in a game. It will make you laugh, it might make you cry, but it will certainly show you how a great story can be told through a game. Mostly To the Moon is a treasure hunt, the goal is to find clues to unlock the next stage. With even a few mini games thrown in for good old fun. The story can be hard to follow at times, so make sure you read all the clues at the start. It will not make sense at first but they soon will. This game does have high repeatable play value, because of the complexity of the story.As to the game itself, well it has the feel of an 8-16 bit JRPG.  With simple point and click movement  throughout most of the game play. There is no real combat,  unlike most RPG’s.  And you play as one of two characters, both being doctors. Your goal is to replace a dying mans last wish. It is hard to go into further detail without giving out spoilers.    I would give this game a top rating due to it is an ingenious way to tell a great story while drawing the reader in for more. You cannot beat the price, and it is a no contest debate, whether or not I will buy the next short story game from FreeBird games. I just hope you enjoy this game, err story, um ah game as much as I did.  -TheBad300			"

												Highly Recommended.This is the best game of this genre I have ever played. Not because there's so much action or so many choices but because the story is just so beautiful. I found myself relating to some of the characters very well and understanding why they did what they did throughout the story. It's an extremely emotional game, if you pay attention to the story (Which is a must, if you wish to enjoy the game). While it is a rather sad story, the game doesn't leave you alone and sad as the two characters that discover the story are very close and understand each other. They often bicker and it ends up as a perfect mix between story, emotion and humor. I found it extremely enjoyable.The soundtrack is also brilliant! It gets a little repetitive if you spend to much time in one area but other than that, the detail in the audio of the game (Including sounds) is of a high quality.My recommendation: If you haven't got this game yet, make sure to add it to your ""To-Play"" list. It really is a story worth hearing.			"

This game has even more simplistic gameplay.To everyone else: get ready to experience a fantastic story that is very emotion, occasionally funny, and *may bring out some tears.*unless you are a sociopath or simply dead inside, tears are guaranteed.

												I'm generally not a fan of these types of games. When I first discovered this, I debated about getting this game for a few months, And only decided to when the game went onsale over the Steam Summer Sale.The game itself is very nice, I was intially intrigued by the idea of the game, I only further came to like the plot by having the perspective from the two doctors. The only thing I'm dissatisfied with is the cost of the game. Generally what I'd like to think is for every dollar you spend on a game, You will in turn get at least that many hours of lifetime on it. That being the case, The lifetime on this game is only going to span about 3-4 hours. For that reason I find it's rather expensive, The sell price should have been something around the $5 range.So while I would recommend this game to other people, And maybe even a few who aren't normally fond of this genre, I wouldn't advice buying it unless it goes onsale.

												I know it's already been said over and over again, but I'll say it again: To The Moon is a fantastic achievement in storytelling that weaves an intricate and fully engrossing tale through the medium of games. The pixel graphics are charming and suit the game well. The music is beautiful and perfectly timed, tugging at the player's emotions at just the right moments. While there are a few kinks here and there, the story is so entrancing that these can be easily overlooked.Actual gameplay is pretty minimal, with players simply exploring areas to progress the story and solving some easy puzzles, but it's an enjoyable experience nonetheless, and despite having a linear story, the game never feels too confined. I very quickly became invested in the plot and wanted to delve deeper and discover the answers to all the questions each new progression raised. To The Moon is a story that deals with a great range of emotions and takes the player along for the ride to experience the ups and downs of life. If you're the sensitive type, be prepared for tears. I cried like a baby.In short: I'd recommend this game to anyone and everyone who can appreciate a good story, regardless of what your actual taste in video-games is. You might be surprised.			"

												This isn't a game, but it is a touching story told in reverse which still makes for a worthwhile experience. As the player you control the speed at which the story unravels but not much else and at times it all gets a bit repetive. Thankfully the 'experience' is short otherwise it could have ended up becoming tedious.Perhaps acknowledging that people will be expecting some sort of gameplay there's a single repeating image puzzle element, but it's so easy and without any risk that it doesn't qualify. It's arguable that the developer should have had the courage to stick with their vision and omit the puzzles, they add nothing to the story and feel out of place.So, this is a story, I should be reviewing that then. Well I don't want to give anything away about the ending, or should I say beginning since it's told in reverse? It's a slight love story, one of small coincidence, endurance through hardship and personal tragedy. It's not life changing or all that original, but if you have a shred of empathy and compassion then you will probably enjoy it. It's unclear whether the player has any control over the outcome, but I saw no point at which this was likely so there is no replay value.			"

Pair that with a spot on piano soundtrack and To The Moon is one of the best stories I've witnessed in video game format.			"

												To the moon. This game. This fricken game is amazing. I must start off by saying this isnt much of a game, its more of an interactive storytelling with tangents for extra information, nonetheless this game is amazing. To the moon is a 2d top down sprite game that tells the story of 2 young doctors whos job is to recreate a patients wish using a machine that recreates it in thier memory. Now thats done, lets get down to it. To the moons story. one - the writer is a genius he created each interactable character with a deep and relatable storyline. This is also the first game I have ever felt so tear-jerked. It was beautiful. The story was told so well from beginning to middle to end, each with impressive plot twists that are hard to see coming. I think that was the art to this story, it was incredibly hard to predict. Now music. One - the soundtrack was beautiful with large amounts of subtle orchestra music playing to create constant ambience at the right moments. There was also some very heavy songs amoung to create unease and funnily enough they sound like they are out of a horror game. two. I bought the OST the minute I finished the game. The graphics - like I said before 2d but this works perfectly, This game is so engrossing you will soon create faces for the characters yourself imagining the perfect emotions for the characters when its really needed. Gameplay. Now the gameplay was a bit weird, the game characters handled a bit like any click to move game, you collect ""momentos"" to move onto new memorys generally finding a final one to move back to another memory. There were also mountains of media refrences throughout the game. I will leave you with my favourite quote. ""Not cool Eva. You Never cockblock someone in the middle of a kamehameha.""			"

												I am still very impressed, it's one of the most beautiful experiences and storytelling I have ever played. It's not JRPG or anything like that, it's wonderful story about fulfilling the last wish of dying man called John - to be an astronaut and visit the Moon. Our two scientists are slowly travelling backwards through his memory, through his life. They watch his very deep personal moments in his life, the people, the places, the hardships and joys. But don't think it's absolutely serious, our two scientists love making gags and fun from themselves. Also, every scene and place is backed with wonderful background music. Music is complementing every scene; if people are happy, you're happy, if they are sad, you are sad, if they are in love, you are in love too. And I can't forget beautiful pixel graphics. To The Moon is not just an ordinary game, it's very unique experience. It's beautiful piece of art.			"

												What is worth anything in the end, are fake memories better than real ones? What would you want to remember from your life when it’s nearing it’s conclusion if you had the possibility to choose? Does it even matter if the memories are real if they make you happy? Such questions together with one of the saddest relationships in gaming history makes ”To the Moon” one of my absolute favorite experiences ever in the gaming medium. It’s also not everyday the word neurotypical is used in a game narrative. If you have any connection at all in your life with high functioning autism this is probably one of the only games that discusses the topic in a relatable, albeit heartbreakingly sad way. I can’t say much about the game itself as everything is overshadowed by the tale told. It has some beautiful music and vintage graphics but also the clunky gameplay style of an old school JRPG. Some of the dialogue is rather retro as well, but the storytelling is excellent to a point where anyone even slightly interested should experience it.A huge experience in a very small, limited package it's hugely recommended!

												I was never into visual novels, but after experiencing this one - I think I might have missed on many memorable games from the genre. To the Moon is certainly one of them.Don't judge the book by its cover. Being made in RPG Maker shouldn't be a reason to avoid this game. To the Moon involves some simple mechanics to keep you engaged and let's you take an active part in the whole story. Pixelart is beautiful, every sprite is very detailed and locations are unique. Music is one of the strongest points of the game - sets the mood perfectly everytime.Throughout the game I experienced whole spectrum of feelings. It made me jump from sadness to the joy and back to the sorrow again in a blink. It also makes you curious, makes you think about current events and doesn't stop until the very end. Your main characters add humorous aspect without breaking the overall tone of the story and are easy to get along with.You won't find hardcore gameplay here, but mature story about fulifilling one's dreams.

												To the Moon is easily one of my most cherished games. There is such a wonderful story that unfolds over the course of ~4 hours that continues to resonate with you for a very long time. Although the gameplay elements are minor, essentially used to keep gamer's hands busy, the emotional impact that the story delivers vaults this game into the realm of art--a feat rarely achieved in this medium. If you're searching for something to make you bawl your eyes out, yet still be an enjoyable experience, then look no further. There are so many feels present here that just listening to one of its wonderful musical tracks, even several weeks after completing it, will result in the uncontrollable flow of tears. I cannot recommend this game highly enough.			"

												While I can't say this is a game I cried over, To The Moon is a game that will probably linger in my mind throughout the rest of my life. The story is impactful, light-hearted, and most importantly, interesting enough to keep playing through to the end.What To The Moon shows without spoiling much is that life can bring about very unfortunate circumstances, but even under them, people are determined to find happiness, and will use any means to have it. We don't live for what brings us down, but for what keeps us up and fighting to our last breath. Where it shows best is its unbelievable narration and character dialogue. You will remember the happy and humorous parts as much as you would the sad and depressing parts, but neither of the parts affect each other no matter how close they are together in the story.The music? While some may call it repetitive, I find it far from it. It fits many of the situations in the story, and uses the piano as a distinct theming tool. And let me not forget that wonderful piece by Laura Shigihara. I haven't heard a lot from her, being one song from Plants vs. Zombies. But this song is simply stunning, and even moreso in where it plays.Its gameplay can be somewhat excused considering the engine it's built off of, RPG Maker XP. So yes it does look and feel like an old JRPG, but that's not what the game's about anyway. The puzzles were intuitive, but a little too easy (maybe it was intentional so it could be enjoyed in 4 hours?). The mouse controls are convenient especially during sections where it's difficult to find pieces for mementos (which for me almost turned into a pixel-hunt without them).To conclude the review, To The Moon is a game that takes life's meaning and puts it in the hands of the player. Where it takes you is your decision alone.			"

												A wonderful game.The story is well written and compelling, the characters have distinct personalities - each with their own appeal, and the musical score is composed beautifully and supports the game perfectly.It may be a bit simplistic in it's graphical presentation and gameplay...but don't let that turn you away from this game, as those factors serve the story, a story that will grab your attention and keep it for the duration of the game.I think in the end, To the Moon is like a good book; you sit down to read for a while, and then you find yourself saying, 'Just one more chapter...' Next thing you know it's hours later and you've lost all peception of time.So yeah, great game. Totally recommended. "

To the Moon is less of a game and more of an experience, exploring the complexities of memory and long term relationships in a really emotive, compelling and beautiful way that kind of forces you as the player to question your own feelings on the subject.

I used to seek action and special effects, adventure, fights and stuff... and there I was, wandering around that two-dimensional world where all the action had been happening in the dialogs... But I gave it a chance and had no regrets. First - the story, it's so heartwarming that even the toughest zombiekiller would possibly break out in tears at the ending. Then the music - very calming and pleasant. Hilarious humour - many references to popular (if you're at least a little nerdy, like me) TV shows...Very, very enjoyable game.

												This is a weird game to recommend. It doesn't even really feel like a game, but more of an interacive story. So let me say this first, if you want to play something and not ""play"" a ~3 hour story, DO NOT BUY this title.So yeah, the gameplay consists mostly of walking around and experiencing the story with a few mini-games here and there and a small puzzle after every section. The story takes a while to unfold and at times does feel like it's too dragged out, but it keeps you guessing and after act 1 the pacing gets fixed a bit. Eventually going to the great bittersweet ending with kind of an moral question imbued.All in all, I do recommend it for the story, the beautiful art and the amazing soundtrack, but not at the original price point. Definitely get it at a discount and enjoy the story :)			"

												What wonderful storytelling! The less you know about this game beforehand, the better the experience will be. When you start playing, make sure you have a few hours to yourself; To The Moon is best consumed all at once or only in few sessions.I'm glad that To The Moon was brought to my attention by someone who sang its' praises but spoilt nothing, but you don't always have the trusted recommendation of a person close to you. In that case, how do you know it's for you and worth buying? What is so special about To The Moon and why does it make everyone cry? If you're reading the reviews for an answer to those questions, something about the way the game looks or what you've heard of it creates doubt.If a sob story within an indie game that looks like an old-school JRPG doesn't sound like your usual thing, or conversely if you're thinking that you've seen this already because it's ""just another artsy indie game"", then that's even more of a reason to buy To The Moon. It goes beyond the boundaries of game genres and will expand your idea of how a story can be told. It's not unique in the sense that it's the first or only one of it's kind doing that, but To The Moon is so original in content and perfectly fitting in its delivery that you're in for an unfogettable experience.

												Okay so I am not into the whole interactive story genre, nor am I into anime, pokemon-esque or similar art styles. But a friend of mine, not knowing this, gave me this game. I let it sit in my Library undownloaded for a few months, then, when I was finally bored, gave it a try.I entered the game with the preconception it was entirely a puzzle game with some love backstory. Fine. Bits of Humor here, Flamboyant love there, cute. Puzzles that are relatively easy, minigames thart would be dorky and simple. Wrong.Instantly I was hit with humor and mystery, enough so to just grab my curiosity. After some modest investiagtion of my surroundings and enviroment, I gained a vague context to a problem that delved much deeper than I ever imagined. Love is not isolated, it is connected, resilient, and defiant. Memory is fragile, warpeable and unstable. Dreams are wavering, unclear, yet hold a certainty unexplainable to them. In this game, where mystery and curiousity pulls you deeper, and the story developes unpredictably yet smoothly, you are not a player. You are not an interaction. You are a human, exposed to all weakness humanity can suffer, from life to death, from happinesss to misery, and from isolation to open compassion. This game, which is by absolutely no means in any format I care to try or enjoy, has rendered me utterly wordless from start to finish, and is without any amount of doubt the best game I have ever played. Yes, this small indie game to me surpasses what Assassin's Creed, Halo, Call of Duty, Walking Dead (telltale), Uncharted, Far Cry, or even Last of Us have ever achieved. Few games make me care for its characters, its plot, its enviroment, or its purpose. Fewer games I enjoy afterward and replay again to try to experience again, like reading an old book. This game resonates so strongly, concludes so dramatically, that it IS the best game I have ever had the honor to experience, participate, and immerse myself in. Thank you developers for creating sucha wonderful and intimate interactive experience.(11/10 5 stars Would Recommend to any Human who loves Games for the Games)(That is a serious rating)UPDATE: I recently went back to this game and replayed it for the story. Just like rereading a great book, I love this game, and strongly encourage anyone and everyone to play it!			"

												I don't normally write reviews for games. Most games I play are well known and don't need me to say whether they are good or not. I'd never heard of this before though.. it sounded interesting, and then it was on sale, so why not?My god... I don't think I've ever experienced a more touching story that was told so eloquently. Tugged at all the heartstrings. Sad moment, happy moments, even hilariously funny moments. The two main characters are wonderfully animated (in personality that is) and make adventuring through the story amusing and fun. The story itself is just magnificent and if you don't get hit with a full force of the feels by the end you either weren't paying attention or you weren't quite human.This game isn't really about space travel despite its name and ending, it is about people, love, and relationships through the ages. I could play tons of games with the latest graphics and the highest price points that don't match the story this one tells. If you buy this, you'll enjoy it.Highly Recommended.			"

												To the Moon is a great story with limited game elements. Maybe it's because I have a soft spot for 16-bit games due to growing up on the SNES, but this game made me care about the characters like few modern games can. Think of it like Chrono Trigger or Mother 3 without the grinding RPG elements. I'd play both of those games just for their stories and as long as you would too, then this game is for you even if you don't typically like interactive stories. I don't compare games to CT or M3 lightly, as I consider them to be two of greatest games ever made, so I'll let that be the highest praise that I can offer this wonderful game.*Obligatory Steam Awared Update*			"

												I have finally discovered the brain drug that I was so badly missing for my entire life.  For the past 2 nights, before slipping into sleepville, I crawled into bed with my cute purple baby macbook Air, turned out the lights, turned up the backlit keyboard, put my space heater on timer for 1 hour, and entered the wild and wonderful world of ""To the Moon.""This was the first video game that I have ever played to completion (the last was ""Leisure Suit Larry"" which I played with my brother when I was 8 years old).  It took me three evenings (maybe 4-6 hours), and was almost entirely brain pacifying in the best way ever.  There was a brief zombie encounter at one point (I HATE ZOMBIES) but my virtual life was never truly in danger, and there is no way to ""lose"" this game.  Here's why I loved it:1. I couldn't die2. I didn't have to kill anyone (except a few powerless zombies)3. the background music throughtout the entire game (almost) was sweet, lovely, gentle, comforting, dreamy, and everything nice, and set the tone of the whole game into the zone I am so desperately trying to make into my life4. the story had depth, much of which I missed prior to reading online game analysis5. it was more like a comic book or particpatory visual narrative than a game, which I liked.  My lIfe is too competitive as it is....6. there are no losers7 there was no stress...only curiousity and intrigue8. Love story!9. the plot was about making someone's dreams come true, and making life better  I am open to more recomendations for sweet and lovely love filled games with good music.  No zombies or killing please.  and preferibly no way to ""lose"".  I guess I just like pretty interactive meaningfilled stories. "

												""To the Moon"" is a beautiful game with great soundtrack and a beautiful story. I've finished the game for quite some time, but while I was scrolling through my library, I remember the good feelings (and tears) that it has brought me - and I just wanted to leave a word of thanks and how much I appreciate this game/this story. Well, there are some minor harmless glitches, and some gameplay elements which may not be very perfect - but the dialogue contains enough humour and creativity to make me laugh, and the story kept me going without leaving me feeling bored or confused at all. I would recommend this to anyone who like a good story-driven game.			"

It had great character development and you really felt that you were part of the story. And the soundtrack was awesome and very fitting.The only negative comment I had on this game was that, everything wasn't explained. It could have added a bit more gamplay to explain that. Otherwise, no complaint.If you aren't interested in games with only story then I advise you to skip this game.

												A bittersweet adventure clicker with some minor puzzle mechanics and a beautiful soundtrack, but it's the story that keeps you going. To the Moon is relatively short but full of mystery and intrigue, while also being a nice casual game with some fun pop culture references (including Doctor Who!). A sequel is implied and passionately anticipated.			"

												Searched up saddest game ever because I wanted to have a game with some feels. I was surprised by the games graphics, they were pretty bad and at some points you could really see the pixels. Thankfully this didn't really have much of an impact on the game as it was more of a reading and watching sort of game then actually playing. The game has great music and it helps you really get into it. I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't really care about gameplay or good graphics, but enjoys a great and well written story.			"

												There are no words to describe the last 4 hours of my life. I bought an indie bundle several years ago that contained this game, and it wasn't available on my current platform, so I never got around to playing it. Found the Steam code a week ago, and saw that a mac version had been released, so I thought, why not? I cannot tell you how much regret I have for not playing this game sooner. What a rollercoaster. Would I rcommend this game? Hell yes. To who? Everyone. If you can't appreciate this game, then you aren't human, and society is doomed. Please play this game all the way through, it is only a few hours, and I can garuntee at least one tear and a whole lot of smiles.This game has a big spirit, and an even bigger heart.			"

												Ok, here's the thing : To the Moon is not a typical 'game'; There's no leveling, there's no monster fighting/killing, and no HP or MP. In fact, it's kinda like a highly interactive visual novel where the characters get to walk around and perform certain actions to enable the story to move forward. While the 'gameplay' might not be everyone's cup of tea, I highy suggest this game for its great soundtrack and story.Con : Not a fan of the game's point-and-click controls; Requires 2 clicks at times to get the characters to move to the require spot or walk through a door/next screen (not that big an issue but a mild annoyance nonetheless)Pros : Where do I start??1. AWESOME soundtrack (I immediately bought the Game + Soundtrack bundle after the trailer finished playing)2. Great storyline3. Nostalgic graphicsTo the Moon is a great example of an extremely well done game. There's no need for flashy graphics or high requirements; All that is needed is a great storyline and soundtrack.  Now excuse me while I go hunt down the damned ninjas who were cutting onions in my room.			"

												This whole game is just...I don't even know exactly how to put it...for me at least I found it probably one of the most touching and heartwarming games out there that truly proves that games are a form of art. There is humor at times that lighten the mood amongst most of the sad parts, but even then, it doesn't really take you away from the story. Heck I can even relate to it a bit, losing people...wanting to be able to fufill a promise...even wanting to go back and correct mistakes, but in the end it shows that even if things change, some things will always remain the same...even if it doesn't look like it now.

												I don't even know where to begin with this game. Everything about it just works. From the very beginning I knew I was going to cry, but I had no idea just how much. To The Moon is more than just a game, it's a story with a life of it's own. You grow to love the characters, you get invested in them, and you feel their pain as your own. I have honestly never had such an emotional ride before. If you are wondering whether you should get this game the awnser is always YES! Play this game just once and you'll understand just how amazing it is. The art, the music, everything. It's just a work of art.			"

												A very bittersweet story. I cannot believe I put off playing this game for so long (despite listening to the OST so many times prior). It plays very much like a visual novel with interactive elements and is very linear, which I do not consider a negative at all. Do not let the graphics put you off as the story and dialogue will more than entertain you! I very much enjoyed the simplicity and, honestly, it was refreshing in this age of complex/layered gaming. Very much recommended for gamers of any background.			"

												To the moon is a kind of game that will make you wanna close your room's door and just sit there, stare aimlessly and lost in thoughts, and possibly shed some salt water off your eyes. I would say it's not just a game that you play to kill time, you play 'to the moon' to learn something that you, yourself, might not even be able to put it into words. There will be a mix of feelings and emotions that will run through your little beating organ which occasionally will make it skip or crack, but the other time it will warm you up from the inside.  "

												To the Moon from Freebird games is quite simply a work of art! In the game you play as Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts as they try to make a dying man’s wish to go to the moon come true.I simply fell in love with this game, from the start to the end I was going straight from laughing until my belly hurt to sobbing like a giant mess on the floor. The characters all seem very real, they all have unique personalities and flaws which are essential in a story-driven game like this one.The story itself was very well written, every scene and action added to the story which is probably the reason it only had 3-5 hours of gameplay; depending how quickly you went through the game. There was however very little actual gameplay, mostly you walked around finding objects with memories attached to them so you could go further back into Johnny’s life. However these objects never felt random and always told you more about the characters.The soundtrack for this game is absolutely breath-taking, it really adds to the emotion of the story and River’s Song will get stuck in your head (I was humming it for weeks). I would definably recommend buying the soundtrack bundle on Steam.My one flaw is that I feel it is overpriced for £7, for this kind of game I would usually spend £3-£5 so I would recommend waiting for a sale. However Freebird have released two ‘minisodes’ for free as a holiday special.Overall I would proudly give this game a 9.5 out of 10If you want gameplay, I’d stay away. But if you want to experience a truly heart-wrenching story, you must pick this up! "

												Feel free to read this, I won't include any spoilers, if you're thinking of getting the game. This game is beyond amazing, I picked up simply cause I heard nothing but good things about it, so I gave it a shot. Where to begin... I didn't think much of it at first, kind of expected the ordinary, but it was beyond my expectations.- 8/10 Graphics: For it being an Indie game, I enjoy the sprite animations, since it's limited to what can occur throughout the game.- 10/10 Music: It does get a bit repetitive at some points, but it doesn't lose it's values within the sentimental emotions in the scenario. There is a lot of memorable soothing songs the game lives up to express.- 7/10 Characters: As much as I enjoy watching Dr. Watts having his moments and Dr. Rosalina correcting him, even if he's right, I felt like Johnny could have been displayed differently to ""understand"" him more, personality and characteristic wise.- 8/10 Gameplay: This is a game where you want to play in a single run-through to grab a bigger feel of what's going on as you put the pieces together. I didn't enjoy finding items that ""stick out"" to progress, but it was pretty straight-forward anyway even if you're a casual gamer.- 10/10 Story-Line: This game is all story-line based, and was creatively done. It's completely original and met it's expectations. This game will make you feel every single emotion, I kid you not. Happiness, Anger, Sadness, Confusion, Regret... in fact, this game makes you think about your life as well. It expresses that any small thing you say or do can be the difference between you and your future.= 10/10 Cost: Is the game worth the money? For me, it was, and I'd even consider re-playing, even if I know what to expect, it's just one of those games where you might find something new and put reason to it.4.5/5 Overall: I loved this game and it's really inspiring. If you've played Ib, Witch's House, or Mad Father type of games, this should be very similar gameplay. I recommend it, just be sharp with every little detail, it'll help understand the characters' feelings it truly conveys.			"

This game isn't about gameplay, it's about story. In fact, it's much more story than game. The actual ""gameplay"" elements are there, but barely at all. I'd call it more an interactive novel.Anyhow, pick it up if you're a story type. The dialogue can be a little clumsy and the controls a little wonky at times, but this is still a very good game with an extremely engrossing story.And the music's great, too.			"

												The game was better than i thought it would be. I thought it would have been a game of choices, but it's a game of puzzles and finding clues with a rich story. The puzzles to get to the next level made me think before clicking since it gave clues to the least about of tries one could take to solve them. The game has a great story that would have also made a great book. i really liked the humor of the doctors; it helped to not make the game seem too serious or too sappy. The plot twist really got to me and the game tried to make me cry, but I held out ... I think .. I might have altered my own memories ...			"

												Even if this game wins the “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” award, you're being lied to.You'll most likely cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ during this game.3-4 hours for a playthrough and obviously not really much replay-value. Combined with the lack of options menu and actual gameplay-elements this might seem bad. But To The Moon tells a story and does it so incredibly well. Which is amazing since storytelling is something only very few games actually do a good job on (the only other example I can think of is Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons). That great story and the amazing soundtrack which always sets the mood perfectly makes for a real gem of a small indie game.			"

												This is definitely one of the best games in terms of story and music. Both are beautifully written and exceedingly emotional. All main characters are fully fleshed out and they work perfectly together. Prepare some tissues, though - you will cry - sooner or later (or almost throughout the whole game). I can't tell you more about this game because everything would be a spoiler.If you had only one game to play in your life this is the one. Don't get put off by the retro/JRPG graphics, even if you aren't into these kind of game you'll enjoy To The Moon.Please support this game - for all the Rivers out there.**Actually 50% of the revenue made through sales of the soundtrack sales go to autism organizations.

												It's hard to define this as a ""game."" While it does have a few game-like elements in it, it feels more like a story than anything else. However, that is not a bad thing. The story is amazing. You learn the ending to an old man's story and you gradually learn how he got to that point. I kept wanting to go back further to learn more as the story went on. There is certainly more to the story. However 90% of what I could say is a spoiler. The soundtrack is also quite outstanding. It helps convey the mood to help you feel what if wants you to. However, the gameplay itself is not a a reason to buy. There is no replay value, and once you play it once, you don't need to again. Furthermore, the story, while good, it won't last you long. I beat the game in three hours. For that reason, I do not reccomend paying full price for this. Buy it when it is a cheaper price and buy the soundtrack bundle. To reiterate, the story and soundtrack make up for the lack of a real game mechanic, but the asking price is unfortunaltely too expensive for such a short and story diven game.			"

												Someone once said (I think) that the meaning of tragedy in narrative is to let us channel our sadness, sorrow, into something far greater: an escape or an elevation. To consume a tragedy and shed tears because of it is to see our own shortcomings and faults, to understand the human condition and, while feeling sorrow for it, to overcome the mere sadness of unpleasant and unwanted things. The goal is to understand that while we are ""only"" human, each and every life story in the context of humanity is an epic in itself. Sounds grandiose, doesn't it?Well, I think that if we agree with what I said before, To the Moon is one of the great tragedies of modern gaming. It is a story monumental by itself: it is mostly the story of a single man and his love and memories, but in its execution it brings us to the shore of nostalgia, fondness, appreciation and - most of all - empathy for our fellow man. This is one of the greatest stories I have experienced. I recommend it for everyone.			"

												In general everything about this game has been said already. It's a charming looking game made with the RPG-maker. It's focus is definitely the story and not the gameplay. The gameplay ist pretty simple, collect some things, search the area talk to people and at the end of each area solve a little puzzle.However, the story it's really really good. It's creative, sad, funny, heartwarming, a bit confusing and very enthralling all at the same time. Just buy this game, you will not have a bad time playing it through, which can be done in one evening (that's why I won't spoiler a single thing).If there was a movie or a book to this game I would definitely watch/read it.P.S: And I really enjoyed all the little references to other games, books or movies :)			"

												“To the Moon” is a simple but remarkable around four hour story-first game. That is somewhat limited on actual gameplay. Yet, makes-up for this fact with its extremely well-written and emotionally driven storyline. This game will tug at your heart strings one moment and make your side split with laughter by making fun of itself on the next. Each of the main characters are wonderfully written, even though they are a bit simple and stereotypical at times. I highly recommend this game to anyone who does not mind a little reading and enjoys a good story in their games.The gameplay is realistically only a few steps above a traditional visual novel. As you spend a lot of time reading its plotline and/or exploring the various locations to find triggers to advance the story. As a means to break-up the large amount of reading there are puzzles thrown in, which are relatively limited in difficulty. With some mini-games latter on comparable to virtual dodge ball and classic tag. Music-wise this game tends to repeats its few pieces over and over again. But what songs it does use are of high quality and really add to the emotional storyline. Particularly, the game loves playing its main theme: a wonderful piano piece throughout the course of the game during its various emotional scenes. Although, the limited selection is kind of to be expect to a certain point, since this is an indie game and was most likely developed on an extremely small budget; if any.Graphics-wise the game is retro Super Nintendo/Sega Genesis (16bit) era JRPG style. The artistry used is truly top-notch and would have been considered AAA quality in the heyday of 2D sprites. Which of course will strike a nostalgic vibe with older gamers.			"

												Fantastic story, soundtrack, and characters that will tug at your heartstrings. Easily one of my favorite indie games. It is a short game, but last as long as it needs to to tell a conniving story. If you want to extend your play time the short free holiday specials are also worth playing as it dose expand the lore of the game. As well the follow up game looks promising but only time will tell. The only problems I have with it are incredibly superficial. As a artist I do see some miner flaws in the hand drawn images as its missing some basic fundamentals. Such as composition, detail separation, anatomy, perceptive, line weight, and so on. but it almost docent matter, As it still works fine for telling the story at hand. and the average viewer probably wont notice the minute details. (and if you follow the creators it also shows just how much the artists has grown since this game was made, so it takes your on a artistic journey though there games as well as a literal one)			"

												Gorgeous piece of art. This is not just a game but an experience. Its meant to make you feel. Even though its short but its dense. There wasnt a single moment where  I felt as if I was getting bored or anything. Throughout, the story felt dynamic and the plot was very original. Being a completely story driven game, the little gameplay and puzzles it had were good enough to make you feel as if you were doing something but they never came in the way of the story or its interesting plot twists. The entire game is well balanaced and the writing and the plot itself is very original and doesnt feel like cliched at all. And the music is amazing too.I would definitely recommend it. Its one of those games that you play and you never forget. The experience lives with you.			"

												This is the best game I have ever played. If I had enough money, I would buy a copy for everyone on Steam that doesn't have it, just so they can experience this. The gameplay itself isn't exactly ""Top-of-the-line"" But the way they made it, it doesn't need to be. Most games that rely this heavily on the story that I've played (ex: Heavy Rain, PS3) Had little to no replay value, but this one, I kinda just wanna play it over and over again. I cannot reccomend this game highly enough, whether you're old, young, a major gamer, or even if you hate games (why you'd be reading this in that case, I have no idea) you will fall in love with this one. Don't play it without a box of tissues, because it WILL make you cry if you have a heart.			"

It's more of a visual novel, but regardless the artwork, music, and story are incredibly well done.  All the characters had unique personalities and the developer kept it consistent throughout.  Neil could of been turned a little down on his personality though.  I recommend it to anyone who has a few hours to kill and wants a good love story.			"

												AT A GLANCE: A gem among the visual novels.[A more detailed review follows below.]Game Name: To The MoonOriginal Release Date: November 1, 2011My Overall Rating: AEstimated Playtime: 2.5 to 4 hours (Campaign)Multiplayer: NoneRecommended To: Visual novels lovers and those players looking for movie-like game with a great story or a good weekend pass-time game, and casual players.REVIEWTo The Moon is a example of a good indie VN game, with some RPG-ish mixed with it. It feels truly like a gem among so many VN out there. It is not a true game,yet if offers a story-rich, which you may get immersed in itself. Well, that's might sound like a bit of exaggeration, however this game is a really polished visual novel with a great story and soundtrack. Great atmosphere and aesthetic.It has got a great emotional aspect. The game blends realism greatly with human psychology. Sometimes, there are times when we humans try to do something unique even at the last stage of their life. And this game amazingly engages you in the story that you might not even remember trying to check out the menus of the game but keep on playing. It is deeply engaging that charms you to complete it in a single playthrough. I also played it non-stop for about four hours and didn't even realize there was a power cut. This is a great experience-giving game and will surely make your weekend good after all your hard work or study.Regarding the gameplay, being a visual novel, it includes a point-and-click like mechanics and keyboard support. You can play as two characters (scientists, to be precise) on a quest of fulfilling a... (Well, let's not spoil the game, shall we?) I say that you play it at least once by yourself. In summary, a great VN, which I truly recommend for any VN lovers and those looking for a short game with rich story,pleasing soundtrack,and aesthetic game contents.			"

												It is very infrequent that I play a game that I consider truly beautiful, and nothing less than genuinely lovely. To the Moon is entirely story based, and the only gameplay to be found is in the form of tile puzzles and a later (apalling) action sequence. Yet the story involved is so heart-wrenchingly engaging that I found myself playing through the 4/5 hour process in merely a few hours. Along with a few intelligent twists, this story reaches a satisfying conclusion. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with To the Moon, despite the terrible controls, and would recommend it to anybody with a heart.			"

This is a sweet story and you'll love every minute of it.Edit: Four months later and noticing this title in my game list still makes me a little teary-eyed. The soundtrack combined with the story and lovely gameplay has made this one of my favourite games of all time. I cried so hard at the end because it was so very lovely. Still even now I think about this game whever I see or hear about a lighthouse.			"

												I'm going to be completely honest. I installed and played the game only for the trading cards...And I was going to leave it as soon as I got all the cards I needed...However, things...didn't go as planned.The game is simple beautiful. I'm a fan of pixel graphics thus I fell in love with the design. Although the game is almost purely story driven, it kept me hooked (which rarely happens with these kind of games).The story begins with all kinds of weird doohikeys. Secrets in the basement. Attatchment to a lighthouse.And the strange wish to visit the moon...As the story unravels, things start to make sense. And just when you think you've got everything sorted out...it hits you. The mandatory ""right in the feels"" scene. Even though I rarely cry, I was weeping during this game. I do not remember the last time I cried this much during a 4 hour period. The fun fair scene and the ending were the two main manhood killers. And the soundtrack didn't help either. Simply magnificent. On the lighter side, I had quite a few good laughs during the game. I especially enjoyed references made through out the game, even though that gets thrown around too much nowadays.A magnificent game. 10/10, bring tissues.			"

I cant give it a 10 based on graphics or sound or any usual concept that we measure games on but in this particular case and this particular game, If you dont like click and point games, or games with outdated graphics, outdated music, and a story that has very chick flick like elements than you shouldnt like it just like i should not have liked it but I absolutlely love this game. it goes against everthing that i ever enjoyed as a gamer. It is almost as if this is not a game but a visual novel that is extremely interactive. Puzzles can be tedious but with all of the plot twists and the great easter eggs that eventually lead to a dramatic larger than life ending. This game has a ending that is more than just a resolution but a reminder of what it means to be human. I never have played an indie game that i felt could contend with a big time game but this has to be on of my favorite games of all time. i give it a 10 because anything else would make you question if you should give this game a try.

												So this game was one that I had boughten when it was on sale a while back and I had almost no idea what I was getting into other than what the video showed but oh was this game so much more than anything I had expected. This game has one of the most beautiful stories I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing and I would absolutely play it again and again. This game is patience and anticipation, loss and gain, grief and happiness all in one. The simplistic way you move through the game allows for you to focus on the story and the puzzles are simple but placed perfectly to give your brain a break from all the emotions. If anyone is looking for a game where they can interact and be pulled into one of the most terrific stories of love and dreams, it would be through this game. It's a very linear game but going into it with no expectations is what should be done because having too many options in this game would ruin the story. There might be more to say here but all I keep thinking is 'wow, that was amazing."" Sometimes we just need stories like this.			"

												An amazing, touching story for anyone, including non-gamers, to play. While the ""gameplay"" isn't the its best feature, the story and music are the shining treasures of this game. The story will definitely touch you in some way. Don't watch the ending first. This is one of those games where you just have to watch it from the beginning as everything has meaning to it. Watch a Let's Play if you have to, but I recommend supporting FreeBird Games by purchasing it yourself. Especially since one of the artists for the game is currently hospitalized. The music is one of my favorite parts of the game. I've learned most of the songs from this game on the piano. Definitely get the soundtrack with it. It hits the right mix between calm yet emotional. Just play the game before you listen to the soundtrack. It will make the music more memorable. All in all, definitely get this game for the story. If you like Mother 3 or sad stories, this is the game for you.			"

												the game is beautiful.the story drives you forward.and the game playes with your emotions.when i played the first time i cried my heart out (not literally)and i can easily say that ""to the moon"" is still my favorite game of all time.(i found the game in 2013. but i only got to play it the first time in 2014.)and the best thing is about this game,is that i never get tired of playing it.(or i did play it for 50+ hours, even if the game is only ~4.5 hours in gameplay Length,)in other words i've played To The Moon from start to finish more or less 11 playthroughs, and i'm planning to play even moreand i also can say more about the game, like for instance the game is only ~70 Megabyte in storage space,in other words, you can play the game on virtually any computer you can find.and only to say that sometimes on breaks in school i've played To The Moon on the school computers and it worked as good as my home desk computer and also my laptop.

												There are very few games out there that can take a simple mechanic and tell an engrossing story. To The Moon is an amazing approach that balances between an interactive novel and an early console RPG. The way the game expands on its characters and grows as you play it still warms me to this day. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!			"

												A recommendation isn't enough for this game, simply put, it's a masterpiece. It deals with the subjects of death, tragedy, buried memories and so much more and although some of the twists may be pretty easy to guess, the way in which the story is told ensures that this does not lower the quality of the game whatsoever. Easily the greatest element to this game though, is the way it creates emotion in the player. The humour is top notch, when something good happens for someone you are genuinely happy for them and most of all, this game is SAD. I have seen many different reactions about the ending, personally, I think it's tragic, but it works and it brings the game to a fantastic close.Presentation wise, the first thign you may notice is that the graphics are very similar to the style of the SNES (in my opinion, it is particularly reminiscent of Chrono Trigger). This works perfectly and after playing through the game, I can't imagine it with another art style. However, despite all this, the one thing I haven't mentioned yet is easily the games greatest asset, which is saying a lot considering everything else. The music in this game is just... stunning, probably my favourite soundtrack of all time, or at least in the last few years. A great mixture of instruments, mainly piano, adds to the games already fantastic environment, and each song sets the tone amazingly and is absolutely perfect for what is happening in the game. Should you buy it? If you're a fan of heavily story based games, then yes and if not, give it a go anyway. 10/10			"

I bought this before Freebird Games added the achievement on a recommendation from some others. Once the achievement was added, I had no problem replaying the game to earn it.

												This game is hard to review because it has so many faults and yet I still recommend it. The controls are beyond awful, the ""puzzle"" and ""action"" sequences are worse than amateur attempts you'd find on Newgrounds and in fact detract from the game itself, and worst of all: the ""humor"" that is non-stop present in the game is so idiotic and childish that it undermines the rest of the experience. The ""humor"" is essentially the dumbest smartass comments I've ever heard spewed so nonstop I felt like I couldn't go a minute without it being displayed. I laughed maybe once and I don't believe humor in a story based game that is about something so deep and serious is necessarily a bad thing, just done very poorly in this case. Also as a composer, I feel the music is very tacky ""pop art"" and poorly composed, as well as repeated nonstop (but I suppose that goes well with the theme of the game) and overall it also undermines the story for me.However, I feel that this game still has a very deep and interesting story that brought about a lot of emotions in me and I feel the overall writing was superb. It's cheesy in all of the right ways...by actually delving into serious real life issues and being bitterwsweet about it the entire time. And on top of that, it personally struck home with me both because of the story and because of the surrealistic aspect of the entire game. I consider all video games as art but for the sake of categorization, I would call this an ""art game"" in the sense that it clearly tries to be more than simple mindless entertainment.I recommend it to anybody but it should probably be played in short stints to avoid frustration at the issues mentioned.

												To be clear, only the first couple hours at most have anything resembling 'gameplay', with a 'search the level for things' puzzle and 'flip tiles' puzzle coming up every 5 to 10 minutes. After those first two hours, the remainder of the experience is all one long 16-bit era RPG-like cutscene.That said, I still enjoyed the story that unfolded. It touched on a few issues I hadn't seen handled in a video game before and the central premise (as described in the flavor text on the store) is an interesting concept that I could really imagine being turned either into a series of stories or a movie someday. But probably the most compelling aspect is how the narrative explores what a profound difference one moment in time can make on the trajectory our lives take. This is always interesting food for thought to contemplate for ourselves, so being reminded of that via this game was nice.The soundtrack is soothing and fits the game perfectly.The controls are the only thing that had me grimacing from time to time. There are a lot of path blockers that serve no actual purpose and make navigating around them a bit tedious either by keyboard or mouse controls. This wasn't a major detraction, but was mildly annoying from time to time.Overall, quality experience, took about 3.5'ish hours. If you enjoy '90% story/10% game' style games as I do, you should appreciate this one.			"

												When I read about this game, I thought it would be some kind of anime story with some memory exploring. Oh boy was I in for a surprise, I had never expected how much this game would affect me.There aren't enough words to describe how amazing this game is. The story is excellently weaved together. The characters all have very distinct personalities, even the two scientists have such distinct personalities you can clearly tell how they would react in situations. (The male one being the sillier and quirky) Exploring the old mans past makes you relate to him as if he was a person you knew in your real life. It's so easy to like him, but also relate to all of his struggles. There are many moments of sadness where my heart aches for him.The most striking character for me is potrayed with a disability in the autism spectrum. Usually when you see these kind of characters, they are either stereotypically good at math (autism) or they are self-absorbed ragers (aspberger). As I have high functioning autism myself (basically between autism and asperger), there are so many ways I could relate to this character and her perception of what love and friendship is. People in the game are also portrayed in the way they view her, because she really stands out as strange and emotionally distant. But the main character, Johnny, just likes her so much he won't let the things get in the way. He spends enough time with her to understand how she works, instead of others that look at her and think she just refuses to be civilized. Excellent portrayal of this disability.The soundtrack is fantastic. Especially ""Moonwhisher"". I have spent hours and hours crying to this lovely track. It's so incredibly touching. There are few wordless tracks which moves me in the way this one does. It really sets the mood when you are watching a sad scene in the game. Many of the other musical pieces are also great. One of them, ""For River"", even has a background story in the game as to why the musical piece is so simple at the beginning with just two notes. So when you follow the story to the end, then hear the musical piece in the various adaptions, it really fills my eyes with tears. I liked the graphic of the game. The old school pixels were all very well done and the areas portrayed all feels like they spent a good time to make sure it wouldn't be repeatetive. Nowhere do I remember feeling myself lost. Each area has their own uniqueness, so it is easy to find your way.I love the way the story is told. It literally starts you near the end, then you tread your way back slowly until you reach the start of Johnnys life, then it is like climbing back up again to find parts that were skipped over during the transition there. It doesn't just end there though, the game offers a final piece to the puzzle with a great plot twist. The game starts out by making it seem the issue is easily solved, then it builds up and you realize there is so much more to the game.The only possible complaint I could make about the game is a mini-game you play each time you transistion in a memory. I just thought it was distracting and not fun. It's over quite fast though.This is a game I would recommend to everyone to play at least once. Especially if you enjoy deep, emotional stories that truly explores the personalities and life of the characters.			"

												Man, this game...I very rarely write reviews for anything, let alone Steam games. If I wrote a review for every steam game I owned, I'd be here a long time.I originally fired up this game because it has steam cards. I don't even remember how I ended up with a copy. Probably from a Humble Bundle. Regardless, the steam cards enticed me to open it up. With every game I've ever opened for steam cards, I gave it a spin, and I am happy I did.Initial thoughts were ho hum as it took a little bit to get into the game. It was also very focused on trying to get me to use the mouse. Let me say right now to anyone thinking of playing this game, only use the mouse to try and identify items to click on. Move around with the keyboard, it'll make things much easier on you.Initial thoughts aside, I trudged on as I watched my steam inventory tick up on the cards collected. However, as I got deeper and deeper into the game, I found myself fascinated as story events started to reveal. There was quirky humor, shocking reveals, and sad moments. However, the story wraps itself up well and I found myself amazed as I looked back, picking up on small things that happened with no reasoning until things revealed through the ending.The story flows together well. The soundtrack fits in perfectly. The characters have enough depth to keep them interesting, without being overbearing. Overall, this game is fantastic and I recommend it to anyone. I'm not normally an artsy fartsy story telling game kinda guy, but this one was fantastic. Just get ready for tears, because holy crap that reveal.Now if you excuse me, I need to go play 12 hours of Street Fighter to make up for the emotional carnage this game has played on me. :D			"

												I got this in a humble bundle, not really knowing what it was. As my internet is quite slow, so, seeing that the filesize was tiny, I decided to download it.I was first struck by the music. The sound design, throughout the game is incredible, so I would definitely reccomend the soundtrack. The next day, I decided to binge play it, and discovered that the story was incredibly moving, at times funny and, at times, brought on man-tears.Some would debate its classification as a game. They have a point. The mechanics ar minimalistic, to say the least, and the only real challenge is finding 'mementoes', to progress.However, if this does not worry you, it is most definitely reccomended, and is one of my favourite games that I have played this year.

												The game is so good I don't really know where to start.To start, the game is fairly repetitive, you walk around interacting with objects, and at the end of each stage you solve a fairly easy puzzle.The gameplay is nothing to be amazed about.However this game's strong point is it's emaculate story. It's like reading a great book, once you get sucked into it, you'll never want to stop. I believe this game has to be played at one shot, it ends around 3~5 hours anyways. It's a great trip with this game, and you'll probably shed some tears in the end. The game has one of the best endings I've ever seen in a game.It's one of the best indie games out there, and you should definitely get one if you're a fan of indie games. "

												To The Moon is a good game. However, its mostly an interactive novella but then again, this aint a new formula in gaming. Others like Heavy Rain have tried it before so it shouldn't dismiss it as a ""game"" but rather I tell you what to expect. This game has a pretty simple yet good soundtrack and a solid story. The story's problem to me was mostly due a few lines that seemed out of place and the first quarter of the game feeling a bit slower than the rest. It did use a couple of clichés but that didn't make the experience less enjoyable in the end. The last two minutes of the game however, works against the mood set up prior to its ending. If this genre is for you, then To The Moon is a must play for you. 82/100			"

												Pros:-It's an excellent narrative driven indie adventure. -Well done soundtrack that seems to take its inspirations from classic slice-of-life animes.-Will make you cryCons:-There were some real pork tenderloin moments that felt a tad too cliché for my liking, however; these moments had minimal negative impact on the effectiveness of the overall story because the story as a whole was so well realized.-Low resolution and a lack of graphical options conspire to keep this game from unlocking its full visual potential.-Will make you cry.I recommend completing it in a single sitting.-Jack			"

												There is so much to say about this game. I absolutely do not want to ruin it however, so I will cut this down and keep it short. I am going to rate it for its seperate quilities and come up with an overall rating. Music: 10/10Graphics and art: 9/10Storyline: 10/10Overall gameplay: 7/10OVERALL GAME EXPERIENCE: 10/10.This game successfully had every aspect of a good story. It was incredibly sad at parts, yet was able to throw in humor ever so often. It made me connect with each character, and feel attached to them. They all reacted to problems the same way I feel I would, and probably most of you would. The makes of this game most likely did this on purpose to humanize the player and make them feel the emotions the characters are feeling. I would abosutely reccomend this game to anyone. For $ 10.00 you can have an incredibly interactive story, that will truely drive the experience. The only problem I ever thought of in regards to To The Moon, was the gameplay wasnt very full. Manly, the entire game is you collecting mementos to go to a new memory. However, if you feel a good story is worth it, then BUY THIS GAME NOW. I LOVED PLAYING EVERY MINUTE OF IT.			"

												Let's get the bad out of the way first.- Graphics have major issues.  At least it did for me.  I had two modes of playing.  Windowed mode (hit alt-enter) which means I was playing in a tiny window, or full screen mode, which on my screen for some reason meant a lot of the things were cut off.  Put it this way when I went to the load screen instead of ""Load File"" it said ""ile""  I had to play it in windowed mode.- Graphics were also not very good considering how low the resolution was.- Engine / path finding was a bit clunky.- Not much ""game"" in it.  There's a few minor puzzles.  That's about it.  - The dialogue felt a bit out of character sometimes.Now that doesn't sound like a very glowing review but if you'd notice there's a big ""Yes"" recommendation.  Why is that?  Well the music was quite beautiful (though it did get slightly repetitive at times).  But the most important thing...The story is beautiful.   It's almost ridiculously beautiful.  It's moving, sad, touching, and happy all in one package.  And in all honesty, if a good director got his hand on this story, I can see one heck of a great movie.  I mean you have to realize they did all of this with no voice acting and graphics that belong to the NES era (we're talking early 90s!).Highly recommended for people who enjoy melancholic stories (it starts a bit slow of course).  If you're into graphics or action or tough puzzles, this isn't the game for you though.			"

												To the Moon is one of the best story telling games out there. You can easily finish the whole game in one sitting and it really makes you think about deep stuff. The soundtrack in this game is also one of the most memorable soundtracks I've ever heard.However the game has a very linear plot and thus a lower replay value due to the limited choices you can make. Of course  you can easily play it again after a while and it will feel as good and heartbreaking as in the first playthrough. It might not suit you if you're very impatient because the game is really slow. But hey, it's meant to tell you a story and it really gives you one of the best stories out there.10/10			"

												I first came across this game when I was younger, when I watched PewDiePie play it four years ago. I was 14 and completely moved, marathoning the entire series in one night, until about four in the morning. The song that Johnny plays stuck with me for days afterwards, along with the heartbreakingly bittersweet story.Then, a few years later when I was 16, I remembered the game fondly but I had mostly forgotten about it when I saw in my subscribtion feed that Markiplier had begun playing it, and I was overwhelmed with emotion. I was older, and some things that happened in the game had begun to happen in my life, and the game went from ""completely moving"" to ""soul crushing masterpiece"". My brother and I watched the game together, and despite only being in piano lessons for about three months, I began learning the songs.Now, at 18, ""For River"" is a song that my entire family asks me to play at every gathering, especially my Nana, whose husband is very ill. I wish I could tell her what that song means, because everyone, especially her, should know. This game is brilliant. It's heartbreaking, bittersweet, and emotional. It manages to crush your soul while also providing light comic relief, until you're left sobbing with a smile, gasping for air through your laugh-crying while you text your loved ones that you love them.

												It is very infrequent that I play a game that I consider truly beautiful, and nothing less than genuinely lovely. To the Moon is entirely story based, and the only gameplay to be found is in the form of tile puzzles and a later (apalling) action sequence. Yet the story involved is so heart-wrenchingly engaging that I found myself playing through the 4/5 hour process in merely a few hours. Along with a few intelligent twists, this story reaches a satisfying conclusion. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with To the Moon, despite the terrible controls, and would recommend it to anybody with a heart.			"

There wasnt a single moment where  I felt as if I was getting bored or anything. Throughout, the story felt dynamic and the plot was very original. Being a completely story driven game, the little gameplay and puzzles it had were good enough to make you feel as if you were doing something but they never came in the way of the story or its interesting plot twists. The entire game is well balanaced and the writing and the plot itself is very original and doesnt feel like cliched at all. And the music is amazing too.I would definitely recommend it.

												What wonderful storytelling! The less you know about this game beforehand, the better the experience will be. When you start playing, make sure you have a few hours to yourself; To The Moon is best consumed all at once or only in few sessions.I'm glad that To The Moon was brought to my attention by someone who sang its' praises but spoilt nothing, but you don't always have the trusted recommendation of a person close to you. In that case, how do you know it's for you and worth buying? What is so special about To The Moon and why does it make everyone cry? If you're reading the reviews for an answer to those questions, something about the way the game looks or what you've heard of it creates doubt.If a sob story within an indie game that looks like an old-school JRPG doesn't sound like your usual thing, or conversely if you're thinking that you've seen this already because it's ""just another artsy indie game"", then that's even more of a reason to buy To The Moon. It goes beyond the boundaries of game genres and will expand your idea of how a story can be told. It's not unique in the sense that it's the first or only one of it's kind doing that, but To The Moon is so original in content and perfectly fitting in its delivery that you're in for an unfogettable experience.

												To the moon is a kind of game that will make you wanna close your room's door and just sit there, stare aimlessly and lost in thoughts, and possibly shed some salt water off your eyes. I would say it's not just a game that you play to kill time, you play 'to the moon' to learn something that you, yourself, might not even be able to put it into words. There will be a mix of feelings and emotions that will run through your little beating organ which occasionally will make it skip or crack, but the other time it will warm you up from the inside.  "

												Honestly i wasnt expecting much from this game but I have to say that this was the best $3.49 purchase I have ever made.  The entire story is an emotional roller coaster of happiness and sadness, and using the shuttle to go to the moon is completely justified (because in real life it doesnt have enough fuel to go to the moon but I digress) all scientific mumbo jumbo aside this is the only game in my steam library to ever make me cry. We need more games like this!10/10			"

												This bloody game, man. Where do I even start? Play it with tissues at hand. Story is incredible, the soundtrack is incredible, just... this whole game is incredible. Play it through the end, it's not a game you just play - you experience it, you feel it. Probably the best way to put it is: ""your heart will break but you'll love it."" It's like the first four minutes of Disney-Pixar's 'Up' but extended for four hours.I would write a better review but I have to go cry in the shower now, so yeah: Play this game.			"

												This game is a must play for everyone who has a heart beating in their chest. The story is heartbreaking/heartwarming, and it even has some funny moments, which is absolutely amazing. The music just brings it to a whole new level, it is so beautiful, though I don't usually like this kind of music, I never wanted it to stop. Four hours only, but it was probably the best 4 hours I've ever spent on a game. I'm so glad I bought it. Well done Kan Gao, well done sir.			"

												This game is hard to review because it has so many faults and yet I still recommend it. The controls are beyond awful, the ""puzzle"" and ""action"" sequences are worse than amateur attempts you'd find on Newgrounds and in fact detract from the game itself, and worst of all: the ""humor"" that is non-stop present in the game is so idiotic and childish that it undermines the rest of the experience. The ""humor"" is essentially the dumbest smartass comments I've ever heard spewed so nonstop I felt like I couldn't go a minute without it being displayed. I laughed maybe once and I don't believe humor in a story based game that is about something so deep and serious is necessarily a bad thing, just done very poorly in this case. Also as a composer, I feel the music is very tacky ""pop art"" and poorly composed, as well as repeated nonstop (but I suppose that goes well with the theme of the game) and overall it also undermines the story for me.However, I feel that this game still has a very deep and interesting story that brought about a lot of emotions in me and I feel the overall writing was superb. It's cheesy in all of the right ways...by actually delving into serious real life issues and being bitterwsweet about it the entire time. And on top of that, it personally struck home with me both because of the story and because of the surrealistic aspect of the entire game. I consider all video games as art but for the sake of categorization, I would call this an ""art game"" in the sense that it clearly tries to be more than simple mindless entertainment.I recommend it to anybody but it should probably be played in short stints to avoid frustration at the issues mentioned.

												I know it's already been said over and over again, but I'll say it again: To The Moon is a fantastic achievement in storytelling that weaves an intricate and fully engrossing tale through the medium of games. The pixel graphics are charming and suit the game well. The music is beautiful and perfectly timed, tugging at the player's emotions at just the right moments. While there are a few kinks here and there, the story is so entrancing that these can be easily overlooked.Actual gameplay is pretty minimal, with players simply exploring areas to progress the story and solving some easy puzzles, but it's an enjoyable experience nonetheless, and despite having a linear story, the game never feels too confined. I very quickly became invested in the plot and wanted to delve deeper and discover the answers to all the questions each new progression raised. To The Moon is a story that deals with a great range of emotions and takes the player along for the ride to experience the ups and downs of life. If you're the sensitive type, be prepared for tears. I cried like a baby.In short: I'd recommend this game to anyone and everyone who can appreciate a good story, regardless of what your actual taste in video-games is. You might be surprised.			"

												One of the best RPG Maker games I've ever played, with some heavily emotional moments. If you're looking for an actual RPG, you won't find one here.This is a story driven point-and-click mystery game, with great music, and with some creative usages of the scripting tools that the software offers. Well worth the money, for an average of 4 hours to complete the game. Shame that it didn't offer multiple endings, especially given that the game keeps track of your overall score for the minigames, but doesn't end up doing anything with that. An extra scene at the end, as a reward for having a good record, would've been nice. Maybe that's something to consider for the upcoming sequel?10/10, right in the feels.			"

												To the Moon is a great story (arguably cliché, but well executed) that is told in the form of a 16-bit RPG. No combat, only simple puzzles and exploration. Expect about three hours of play and pay accordingly.Recommended for casual play (perhaps together with an SO) or for those that enjoyed the old Squaresoft classics.			"

												I'm sorry I bought this on sale for less than $4 (less than one beer)! How do I give the devs more money so they can make eps 2?Either way fully recommend this ""game"", think of it as a semi-interactive 3-5 hr visual novel. Yes, there's some cheesy jokes and some nerd humor, also many references to popular (early) 90s items. Not recommended for your typical fps gamer, this is for the more refined whack-a-mole crowd (play the game to get the joke). BE WARNED: NO REPLAYABLILTY AT ALL.

												I don't even know where to begin with this game. Everything about it just works. From the very beginning I knew I was going to cry, but I had no idea just how much. To The Moon is more than just a game, it's a story with a life of it's own. You grow to love the characters, you get invested in them, and you feel their pain as your own. I have honestly never had such an emotional ride before. If you are wondering whether you should get this game the awnser is always YES! Play this game just once and you'll understand just how amazing it is. The art, the music, everything. It's just a work of art.			"

No game has moved me so much emotionally, in terms of mechanics, there really isn't much, I really don't think this can be considered a game, I want to call this an artwork. It is so shocking how people can tell a story like this one within just pixelated graphics. I came close to dropping to tears at the end, and its sad because I haven't shed a tear over anything in years. This game accomplishes things that no game has even come close to. 10/10 Would Recommend.			"

												To the Moon is probably one of my favorite games that I have ever played. This game is one of those rare gems that has everything you want in a game. A powerful and meaningful story, some comic relief, and many likeable characters.  Sure there wasn't really exciting gameplay but the amazing story made up for it many times over.  Eventhough it didn't make me cry,  it will still affect your very being and soul for the better. and if someone were to make a movie based on this game I would definately go and see it. So without a doubt, 10/10 Kan Gao is a genius :]			"

												I always liked pros and cons lists for reviews.  Here's my attempt at a good one (sorry about the crappy formatting, I can't figure out how to clean it up):Pros: Tear-jerker.  I cried.  Most people that played this cried.  Those that say they didn't cry, probably cried. Creative story telling!  It's such a well-written game.  Because of it's unorthodox approach it keeps you interested throughout the game.  Simple game mechanics.  It's practically a point&click adventure.  Retro graphics pull you in.  The game is simple but looks beautiful.  A lot of love went into piecing this game together.  Short.  You can finish this game in one sitting.   The music is fantastic.  This game has such a great soundtrack.  Some games have good background music, then there's those rare gems where the background music might as well be another character in the game since it plays such a huge role.Cons: Clunky unresponsive controls at times.  I got stuck a lot. Humor just didn't work with me.  The game presents such a beautiful premise about love and regret so the humor at times felt out of place and awkward.  Specifically the male doctor.  I feel like the game would've been much better without Dr. Watts.  Gameplay, because it's so simple, feels repetitive by the time you reach the final act.   I don't really think this is a con, but I can't list it as a pro:  The game isn't suited for younger audiences.  I feel like quality of story-telling this game provides would be wasted on a younger person who can't relate to the themes in this game.   The ending of the game will leave you with questions and you will want to know more about the characters, and realizing they're not real people will make you sad.All-in-all, this game was a treat.  It got such good reviews and I'm glad I finally tried it.  Definitely recommend it. "

												I would certainly consider this more of an interactive movie than a game, but with that being said- I'm incredibly impressed! The amount of feel and sentiment the authors were able to evoke so seamlessly shows a lot of raw talent. Also, the story progressed quite naturally. It has all the proper elements to keep you interested and hooked. You really want to find out what's going to happen next! This is really refreshing because so many times the games I play with dynamic, super-interesting plots don't make a profound impact on me due to a lack of flow and direction. Call me crazy, but I feel a lot of time games with a super huge production team can give you that copy and paste feel. I guess having so much different influence under improper guidance makes it difficult to craft something coherent. Anyways, this game isn't like that at all. It's touching, beautiful, and wonderful. I wouldn't exactly recommend this romantic epic to all of my friends since it's more in the touchy-feely realm of things, but to those who are more intune with their emotional side, this game (movie) is a must play (watch). ;) <3			"

Story 10/10Gameplay unfortunately is not as interactive and this IS more like a movie but it deserves a 7/10.			"

												To the Moon is a fantastic game. It's a story about two people named Dr. Rosaline and Dr. Watts and they give people a last chance to live out their final wish through their memories and make them think they actually did it. The patient they are currently working on is a man named Johnny whose final wish is to go to the moon. He doesn't remember why, but that's all he wants to do.Simple right? No, his story goes far back to his childhood and you must travel through the years of his life, find out why he wants to go to the moon, and give it to him.The story is fantastic, the soundtrack is great too, and characters are likable and memorable. It is also a game that will tug at your heart strings as you journey along. It is a very emotional game, and I bet you will be tearing up at the end at how good it is.Pick it up now and play through a fantastic experience. Also get the soundtrack too because it too is also great.			"

												Very emotional and fascinating adventure about two professors who attempt to fulfill the last wish/dream (...going to the moon) of an elderly man on his deathbed and enter the memories of his life time to manipulate it.Great storyline, but feels more like reading a book than playing a game.Good dialogues with cheap jokes ^.^Satisfying Ending =DBased on the ""RPG-Maker""-Engine.Unfortunately it has a very short playtime !

												To The Moon is probably one of the best games I have ever played. This game manages to hook the player in right from the very start with its lovable characters and amazing story. Its probably one of the only games I admired in terms of its music as it fits perfectley well with the game, and just sounds damn beautiful. For those of you who are wondering, although the game was made by RPG Maker VX, this game isn't an RPG. There is one scene where it is turned based, but this is a mere joke. The game itself is an adventure point and click game. I reccommend anyone who loves a good story and great music to get this game immedietley. There isn't much more beyond I can say at this point without ruining the story.I also advice anyone who got this to get A Bird Story.			"

												To the Moon is a visual novel rather than a game. I've heard the term RPG used to describe it but that would be incorrect as there are no unique mechanics, form of progression or indeed any aspect of your characters to progress. What might be considered puzzles or game play is nothing more than the game stubbornly folding its arms and barring you from the next chapter until you have collected all five macguffins in each tiny area and a breif bullet hell section at the very end. However, in spite of what I just said, I am recommending To the Moon because it tells an amazing story that kept me interested form beginning to end. As a game designed soley to tell a story it does so in spades with an intrigueing plot, relatable characters, and an ending I didn't see comming. I'm looking foreword to A Bird Story.			"

The journey is anything but. Amazingly written characters, gorgeous art (both drawn and in-engine), one of the best soundtracks you will ever hear in any game, and a compelling funny at times, sad at others, and ultimately overall stellar story make To the Moon an experience like no other. The game starts off a bit slow but quickly engages the player. I heartily recommend this master piece for anyone looking for a deeper experience than what today's triple A gaming industry has to offer.			"

												Prior to experiencing this literary masterpiece, I've read countless reviews of To the Moon and often wondered if it was overrated. I'm glad I was proven wrong after finally being able to finish it.To the Moon is a visual novel through and through. There's very little in the way of standard gaming, save for a few puzzles. Don't let this deter you though; To the Moon is a fantastic, emotional trip graced by smart (and often humorous) writing, coupled with a sweeping soundtrack. The whole experience is a bit short - I delayed a few sections, and I've only managed to put in 4 hours. But that's part of the charm - To the Moon is excellently paced that those 4 sweet hours feel natural and rewarding already.Play alone, specially during the half and towards the end - if you don't like people to see you get teary eyed over a ""game"". Most of all, prepare for an unparalleled emotional journey.			"

												 From the storyline to every detail of graphics of this game, I would say that this is one heck of a game! A great game does not have to have amazing graphics; FreeBird Games proved it through this game. Indeed I understand how this game got of awards for its story, and no wonder there are so many people who are recommending this game to others. This game is a real tear-jerker – but in a good way. It made me reflect about all my wishes and how most of it were forgotten when I got older. Not only was the story well written, but also the music throughout the game was really good. I would say that one of the most memorable items of this game is probably its music because it has this strong emotional content to it that makes the people fall in love with it even though they were not able to play the game. I'm going to be honest now, I thought that this game will be boring at first even though it had an overwhelmingly positive review in Steam, but when I actually played it, I just ate all the words I said. Overall, I would give this game a 10 out of 10. If someone really wants to know why I gave it a perfect score, well, try playing the game. #BestGameEver			"

												High on story, high on emotion, low on game play. Though this may not be the perfect choice for someone looking for the next fully immersive experience to test their gaming chops, it is a must-experience for anyone who wants to explore more of what the videogame medium can do and those who appreciate stories of life, love, and loss similar to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or Tuesdays with Morrie. TL;DR: This is a wonderfully beautiful piece of artwork that is worth the price of admission.			"

VirtuesTo the moon is a story about the life a couple has shared and all the friends, love, hardships and ceremony that entails. This game has it's sights set on your feels and you may find a few things quite touching.The gameplay is generally watching canned bits of plot, proceeding to explore the area to find 5 colored orbs, & locating a memento. Once you've done this and located the memento you break a barrier around the memento with the orbs and finish things off with a tile flipping puzzle. You then move on to the next area and repeat the whole process.I enjoy the humor in this game quite a bit. It's a good mix of cornball, referential, and just plain odd.PitfallsThe game doesn't seem to support multiple resolutions or even the steam overlay. Screenshots don't work well because of this. I'm used to taking an excess of screenshots during gameplay and constantly found myself missing the ability to do so easily.I experienced an odd glitch during the course of my playthrough in which I became capable of walking on any surface of the current screen. I was forced to reload due to inability to interact with anything at that point though.The controls feel a bit loose an imprecise on a wireless xbox 360 controller. The D-pad cannot even be used in an attempt to counter this frustration. You are limited to the left analog joystick. It's necessary to utilize the mouse for the tile flipping puzzle sections. Near the end of the game there's some different gameplay mechanics that I just switched entirely to keyboard in order to better aid in progression.Spoilerific ShortI felt the game could've ended appropriately shortly after finding out about the death of the twin brother. Instead the game continues trying to right wrongs Quantum Leap style inside the dying seniors brain. This makes sense only in the context of the altruistic attitude of Dr. Rosalene. I don't feel it actually helps the story. Instead of just discovering what actually had happened in the past and bringing it to the surface to be faced she retcon's the past and tries to remedy it with a pretty bow of modified memories. This left the ending feeling kind of lame and predictable to me.All told I rather enjoyed this game despite any issues I had with it.70\100			"

Witty, charming and cute - To The Moon is a heart breaking story of love and loss. Though it may be lacking a little in the gameplay side, it more than makes up for this with the story alone.

												To the Moon is the simplest, shortest, most emotional game that I've ever played. The only other game close to meeting that description is Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, but that game requires more effort than To the Moon, and therefore does not get ""simplest."" Nothing else that I've played has really gotten near these attributes.I went into this game expecting it to be highly overrated. My main reasoning for that is because I have played many RPG Maker games before, years and years back, and never found any to be really great. Therefore, I was extremely surprised to hear this RPG Maker game getting so much praise almost universally, for so long.And surprise hit me again when I realized how much I agreed with everybody else. To the Moon has very great artistic style for something made in RPG Maker. The maps are simple but very well-made, with lots of thought in organization and layout. The characters actually have nice movements to fit their actions. The animations and designs work with the premise of the story - all are done well.The story itself, so unexpectedly emotional. Learning about the old man in reverse time is, theoretically, a simple idea in such a sci-fi / futuristic type of story, but it was so efficiently planned. There are so much questions that pop up along the way, and as you slowly get your answers, they just make you feel more attached to the story, to the characters, despite only being invested in them for a few hours. Every little 16-bit person seems like they are real. They seem more natural than many people I've ever seen in such a simple video game.The music and sound fit in so well with all of their scenes, and only serve to help the emotions you get as you play. It all made me smile, laugh, get angry, want to cry - you name it. The ending of the game and the song played there... I think many people have gone to listen to the soundtrack long after playing this game, and I understand why.As I said, the game is the ""simplest"" - and really, it is a story. You have control of the characters; you explore to learn; you solve puzzles to continue. But the game does not require much effort to keep moving, and in many ways, it makes sense that this choice was made. The story would not be so touching if you had to spend a lot of time trying to get past difficult puzzles, as you would only get more angry at the game itself.I definitely wish that I could experience this game again, without knowing anything about it. But of course that is not possible... unless Neil and Eva were to help me out.			"

												I'm not used to do that kind of things and actually it's the first time that i do a true evaluation for a game but, on this one, clearly it deserve it.To let you know, i'm not that you can say a ""big fan"" of retro or pixel games but, clearly developpers and game designers have done an amazing job, graphics are really well done. I often say that ""pixel games are hurting my eyes"" but this one has been made a sort that my eyes were perfectly fine with it and i can ensure you that it is something pretty difficult to do.Now, the soundtrack... I'm a guy that love when there is some good soundtrack on a game and actually, even tho it could have been repetitiv, it fit well with the game + actually there is some others songs, like the one at the end when they're with ""river's case"" (to not spoil) is just wonderfull ! Clearly sound designers have done a great job too.Now, the best part : the story. Clearly on this one, people can't argue, it has been well made too. Main story is interesting with every important settings needed for a good story. Main characters are interesting and quite appealing, there is also some background that is nice, even tho i'm pretty sure we could have like some more but on the actual state it's quite nice and probably enough.  There is comedy, some drama, some suspens, etc... i would say that's a complete story with every good components that we like (and yeah, i had a tear at the edge of my right eye at some moment while laughing at other ones).I'd like to congratz the ""french traduction team"" because it has been majestic, even some ""triple-A"" games has worse trad that you have.Like, seriously, we can feel that every person that worked on this masterpiece has put into the game their soul and not takings shortcuts. To do a great game, that's what you need to do.Actually, i can't only be positiv or it wouldn't be a real evaluation... I only have one issue with this game, is about the ""gaming"" itself. I don't know if it's because of the 2.5D but some textures have bad hitbox and so characters have often some difficulties to use some specific objetcs when you directly click on the item to let them go and use it, you have to manually put them right in front + even worst, sometimes even if you're in front of it, the characters can't use it, because some part of the ""hitbox"" is not working...But don't worry, it is not that much of a problem because the rest of the game really make this small cloud something that don't stay in mind ; but yeah, because of that i can't say that i gave a 10 to this game, but clearly i give it a 9.5/10.To everyone that wonder if it's a good game, yep it is ! Clearly it's worth to buy it but not buying it when there is some huge discount on him, it's probably criminal (i'm joking, but yeah, i don't like to do some ""free advertizing"" but this game really deserve at least your attention).

												I bought this game on a sheer whim, looking for something new to add to my library and hoping to have some fun. I never expected to fall in love with it. From the first 20 minutes in, I was hooked. As implausible as the plotline sounds on paper, the game developers and writers have done an immaculate job of sucking you into this world where it's not only totally possible, it's commonplace.  It's cleverly written, intelligent, and the characters feel like real people.  There are so many gems in the dialogue that made me laugh out loud -- especially a particular TV show reference early on. And I can't say enough good things about the soundtrack. It is so, so lovely.While the gameplay itself is very simplistic and easy, the story is what will keep you rooted to your seat. The pacing is perfect -- moments of sadness, elation, and well-timed comedic relief are placed very well throughout the whole story. And that ending...well, I wouldn't dream of spoiling it, but just hang onto yer butts, kids. And bring the tissues.			"

												""To the Moon"" is a simple story based and enigmatic RPG that will:- Surprise you;- Keep you glued to the monitor screen just to see and understand how the plot develops;- Break your heart and leave you on the corner of the room crying while shiverring.Highly recommended as the product is innovative in its mini-games and way of proceeding, not to mention all the awesome puns and humour in the dialogues combined with strong sarcasm and irony of the two main characters, which will amuse you for sure.Perhaps ""To the Moon"" might not be very long, as a matter of fact you should be able to complete the game in a maximum of 4 hours if you are going to check carefully every single dialogue and click on all the things possible and imaginable to find more information, but it is pretty much understandable that this game made success for a reason, being the amazing experience this emotional story can actually provide you, making every cent you spent on the product acceptable, as myself can assure you that you are not going to forget it any time sooner either.

												The story is beautiful and unique. The art style, well, it is a pixel art, which i'm not a big fan of, but it was fine and they've managed to even get some subtle emotions with this technique. The gameplay.. well, it just proves, that i won't be playing any of these ""telltale"" ""games"". You are hunting some pixels (and usually you don't even know what exactly, you have to just stumble upon it) and you solve a simple puzzle many times (though it doesn't matter how well or fast you do it). And you have a lot of dialogues without options. That's it. This is just some interactive stoty and as it is it deserves 10 out of 10, but as a game.. there is not much. Still giving it a positive review for all the work and a story and the music.			"

Instead, he made a game out of it, one with lacklustre gameplay and interactive elements that don't add anything to (and can sometimes halt) the wonderful narrative.			"

												This game really does hit that spot in all people that have a soul...you will cry with many emotions running through you. Has its funny, sad, happy, and tragic moments...enven all at once so if you like emotional games this is for you.			"

												Short game with a breathtakingly beautiful and emotional story, and with the music combined it will make you tear up like only real men do. (Kappa) Even though its a 5 hour long game with like zero replayability, it's probably the best game I've played in a very long time.			"
