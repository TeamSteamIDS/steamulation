												Thirty minutes in:So I'm about thirty minutes into NaissanceE and it's as atmospheric and otherworldly as you might have hoped. The environments are expansive, monolithic, not in terms of being open to exploration but in terms of sheer scale. You feel small, lost and utterly alone in this world. It's a world that feels alien and weird, not in the twisty Escher-esque sense that Antichamber had, but like you just don't belong in this place. Even though it isn't a horror game, there's a distinct feeling of tension and apprehension of the unknown, and the unsettling sound effects add to this. It's been a linear journey so far, but I don't mind that. It's a world I want to venture further into and discover more about.--Two hours in:2 hours into the game and it continues to impress. There have been a few challenging platforming sections interspersed between the traversal and light puzzle solving, but for the most part, it's all about the experience. Some might say it's boring, too much walking, but if there's one thing the game has excelled at since the start, it's making you feel small, insignificant within the massive alien spaces. That has been the highlight for me, just traveling through this mysterious complex. You exit from a narrow corridor into a gargantuan space that makes you tense just looking over the edge, and then you realize you have to find a way down. The game doesn't hold your hand, doesn't direct you where to go, besides the visual environmental cues. The game is certainly linear, don't expect a sprawling world, but you do have to find your way and it's easy to get disoriented, lost, turned around. The game has a fantastic atmosphere: mysterious, engaging, ominous, otherworldly. As for negatives, there's one mechanic that at the moment feels more extraneous than integral to the overall experience. It complicates a simple action, and while it kind of feels almost Receiver-esque in the sense that you have to focus on an action that is usually automatic, I don't think it has really added anything to the gameplay yet. One platforming section was quite frustrating and I ended up just turning up the gamma to complete it. Also I found some checkpoints can be bit too spread out, but that's only been an issue two or three times.--Three hours in:The developer said that the game's four to five hours long, but I'm thinking that's only if you know exactly where to go, how to go there, not die (repeatedly). I'm still on the second chapter. Probably should shave about twenty minutes of my overall play time, because I got stuck on a puzzle with a solution that was annoyingly obvious once I figured out what I was overlookingMy gripe about the checkpoints still stand. Some of them are just too spread out. You'll do some difficult platforming, get a safe area, start another difficult section, die, and then the checkpoint is back at the start of that first section. While you're just traveling and exploring, it's not an issue, but once you're dealing with sections where you can die because of a missed jump after making some progress, it can be frustrating.But despite this issue (or at least I consider it an issue), the game has not lost any of its luster or mystery. I think the world in this game is by far one of the most alien and atmospheric I've experienced. It's not alien in the way that Avatar's world was, but alien in the unsettling sense that this is truly not a place made for or by humans.New mechanics are introduced, mainly to offer interesting platforming and puzzle scenarios. It's great when you just have to stop and admire some cool sight, and NaissanceE has had moment after moment like that so far. The sound effects are as well great, really adding a sense of place and tone.---Seven hours in:Yeah, 7 hours and I finally reached Breath Compression. I guess me, first person platforming, and keyboard/mouse controls don't mix well.But I'm still absolutely loving this game. It does something very well, that I've usually only experienced in sprawling open world games and it's the feeling of seeing something interesting in the distance and then after 10, 15, 20 minutes of traveling, turning the corner and seeing that landmark before you. NaissanceE accomplishes that so well, enticing the player with weird and intriguing architecture and structures far away and then later, you exit a corridor and you're there.It's a great feeling, that makes the game seem less like a linear adventure and more a journey where you're discovering the path. You never feel pushed or pulled in a direction, the game never takes control of your camera to direct you or tell you to head that way or in this direction. It's masterful in that aspect, subtly driving the player forward not through objective markers or compass arrows but with cues in the environment and the reward of exploration and discovery.Now while the game is linear, it's certainly not tight corridors. Many areas have surprised me with how open they are, and all have been interesting to explore and just be in. Beside the exploration aspect, the gameplay seems to favor more platforming over puzzles, with a few light based puzzles and several challenging platforming areas.			"

												I want to recommend this game. Aesthetically, it's perfect. A dark, forbidding, brutalist world to explore. I've lost count of the times I've just been stunned by the game's architecture, and stopped to look around.Unfortunately, here are some other things I've lost count of:The amount of times I've died and thought 'Really? There hasn't been a checkpoint for THIS LONG?'The amount of times, a few seconds after I respawn or load in, the game has frozen for a second (this happens every time).The amount of times I've been able to see through walls while moving quickly - and come on, this shouldn't happen in a game with textures this simple, should it?The amount of times I've been killed because of how poorly the character movement controls and how short a drop can kill you in this game.The amount of times I've foolishly tried to use the Steam overlay, which crashes the game for me every single time.Aside from actual glitches which I hope will be ironed out in an update, the gameplay itself simply doesn't help. The proportion of the game spent trying to complete absurd platforming challenges instead of being allowed to explore this fascinating environment is unbearable. As for the puzzles, they're essentially fine, but as previously mentioned, falling off a ledge halfway through them is pretty un-fun. And then there's the weird breathing mechanic, which frankly adds nothing to the game.What ultimately stopped me from wanting to continue with the game at all was a section where the player is expected to walk along a lengthy pipe, parts of which are  rotating, others of which move up and down - in what appears to be a wind tunnel. In the particular part of the pipe I was up to, you first have to walk along a series of moving, floating cubes to reach the next section. Then you have to run past some rotating obstacles. Then you have to run along another section with a series of cubes being thrown at you which instantly kill you if you are hit. Then you have to run along some beams that move up and down. Then you die, because a gust of wind has at some point during the aforementioned series of challenges, picked you up and blown you away. Why does this happen? Not sure. How is the player expected to know when the wind is going to become dangerous to them? Don't know. What is the player supposed to do to survive this? No idea. Sometimes the wind simply blows you into a wall, which doesn't hurt, but the wind seemingly never stops once it begins, so you're forced to re-load a save anyway.If I'm missing something blindingly obvious here I apologise, but at the moment I have to treat this game as simply being broken.I can't emphasise enough how much I love the way this game looks and sounds. It really makes you feel small, and the abstract electronic music complements that feeling perfectly. It's just a shame that a game so seemingly great should be so keen with its gameplay to stop me from playing it ever again. NaissanceE is a beautiful art game trapped inside an alpha-release standard puzzle-platformer.UPDATE: So with this review climbing up the store page a bit, felt it was worth updating. I've played a bit more of the game since my initial review, having FINALLY managed to progress beyond that awful platform section. Apparently, the fan automatically blows you away after a certain amount of time, not just at random. I don't know how you're supposed to know this, but there it is. I made it through the area in time, EVENTUALLY.Anyway, the couple of levels after that have actually been fairly simple and enjoyable (and, it goes without saying, aesthetically impressive). I got up to the desert section and haven't played more since, but at this point, the game is no longer throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥in my face constantly, so I feel like I will continue and finish the game when I have time. For this reason, and a couple of others, I'm changing my review to a cautious recommendation.The other reasons are that 1: the developer has announced plans to fix bugs and include more checkpoints in the next patch, which would be a great improvement, and 2: the developer has made clear that the platforming sections were 'old-school' and difficult by choice, not accidentally. And if it's a design choice, I can't exactly treat the game as broken.So it's a reserved recommendation - if you're a fan of atmospheric exploration games, pick this up but be aware that there'll be some real challenges (hopefully more reasonably checkpointed in future) to struggle through unless you're a master platformer. And if you're looking for a hardcore platformer, maybe pick this up but be aware there's a lot of wandering around lost in-between.			"

												Do you remember the feeling you got when you saw the strange, grand architecture of Cloud City in The Empire Strikes Back? Or the impossibly huge geometry of V'ger in Star Trek: The Motion Picture? Or the cityscape in Blade Runner? Well, NaissanceE will bring back that feeling with incredible intensity.No other game does grand environments like this, I promise you. It's mind-bogglingly huge and familiar and alien all at once, and when you start moving around it you realize that yes, you can get to that bright point on the horizon, it's not just scenery. It's a linear game but the city-type environments are surprisingly open, with optional paths to find here and there. The sound design does an amazing job of supporting the atmosphere, bouncing you between slack-jawed wonder and a creeping unease.The catch is that's only about half the game.The other half is split between claustrophobic halls and cubist nightmares. There are a lot of surreal, nonsensical rooms to run through that don't really mesh all that well with the cityscapes they break up. Chapters 5 and 6 (the game is broken into seamless Half-Life-style chapters) seem to double down on the weirdness, which was a little disappointing because of how much I enjoyed the city bits. The puzzles are also rather hit or miss, generally being rather easy and not very clever. I will say that there are some jumping puzzles in Chapter 4 that were pretty frustrating in how little sense they made, and an eye-searing puzzle in Chapter 5 that almost made me quit the game entirely.The second-to-last chapter is pretty interesting and very wide open. It makes me think there's even more to find in the game, though there's no real payoff for exploration besides seeing what other weirdness the world contains. The last chapter is a little frustrating until you figure out what it wants you to do and the ending is pretty blah. I think there's something deep going on with the story but I haven't picked up on it. I just feel like there's something there. I honestly think the atmosphere is good enough to justify the purchase, but be aware there are more than a few flaws.			"

												NaissanceE hits the ground running – or rather, its protagonist does. The opening moments serve as a compressed summary of all that the player is about to experience. Disoriented, panting, lungs pumping air like every moment could be their last. Rows and rows of identical hallways swoosh past. Are the walls really shrinking in on us or is it just a trick of the camera? A glimpse of the assailant giving chase causes the pace to quicken, accentuated by a sickening electronic noise trill. Before long, we come face to face with the creature just moments before falling into a pit that carries us to safety. Safety being relative. As the world we’re introduced to is anything but friendly and familiar.In a way it’s the older brother of Kairo, one who transitioned from Eno to Lucier while attending college. Second cousin twice removed to Antichamber, losing almost all of its puzzle genes while retaining the mind-twisting level design. NaissanceE stands proudly next to other modern takes on the puzzle adventure. Progression, while linear, always fits within the massive scope of any particular area. You’ll get lost in the larger maps, poking around in the corners feebly in hopes of finding direction or a sign of life. What plot there is to be told is presented entirely through the environmental clues left behind by whoever came before you. There’s no dialog to be heard, no monologuing audio diaries or scraps of paper to pick up. The only text ever seen is the chapter titles and the main menu options. Everything remains a mystery.Most of the time is spent simply navigating the large maps with occasional platforming segments to break things up. A breathing mechanic comes into play while sprinting for a short time. Every few seconds while sprinting, a circle will appear on screen. Hitting the right button (defaults to Mouse 1) while the circle is there will make your character take a breath and they will continue running a little longer. Fail to do so and they become winded and slow down drastically. Not something you want happening in the large maps or while jumping from cube to cube. On the note of platforming, I found some of the sequences to be irksome. Some involving awkwardly shaped landing areas and altered physics took me out of the moment if only briefly. I feel like the game could have been better off without those or with a little more care taken with them. You’ll also get to play with some cubes that are sensitive to light sources for a few puzzles, but none of them are particularly difficult.NaissanceE expertly grasps the concepts behind what makes lonesome wandering compelling. The lights are on but nobody’s home. An expansive view of an area could show thousands of lit windows though you never get the sense that anyone is ever sitting behind them. A few poorly spaced checkpoints and unintuitive platforming segments annoy but don’t detract from the overall experience. As challenging of a play as it is a listen, your hand is never held in the labyrinth. The atmosphere is stifling, mysterious, beautiful. I felt compelled to explore as much as I could even if I knew there was a dead end ahead. In the 5 hours it took me to reach the incredible last moments I remained entranced.Though, I don’t really know what it all means.And it terrifies me.			"

												Such a conflicting game and NOT one I can recommend sadly. The atmosphere, mystery and exploration elements are FANTASTIC and it has some remarkably unsettling imagery and design but it's crippled by TERRIBLE gameplay decisions. The checkpointing is AWFUL and made significantly worse by some of the worst 'first person platforming' elements this side of Xen, incorporating instant-death booby traps, fiddly jumps, narrow walkways and areas where progression is not sufficiently telegraphed resulting in some stupidly unneccessary deaths. By some accounts there may also be some bugs with the various ""windy"" locations that make the game nigh-on unplayable in places, but I personally never encountered any of those problems.Special mention needs to go to the completely pointless side corridor that warns you ""not to continue this way"", and when you (of course) *DO* continue in that direction the game eventually just unceremoniously quits to desktop. Ha. Ha. Funny. *sigh*Also, unless I missed something (which is very possible) don't expect any sort of payoff or even an ending to the game. Upon reaching the end you just get dropped back to the main menu with nary an explanation of what just happened or why.* * * In the end, I personally have a particular love of exploring strange, alien places and abandoned locale's in games, so I still feel like I got my moneys worth out of it. The visuals and sound design feels like a modern interpretation of an ancient long-lost Lovecraftian cityscape. BUT unless you can be equally forgiving of some incredibly bad ""game"" elements then I'd suggest you steer clear or wait for a sale.Two wibbly wobbly cuboid snake monsters out of five. "

												Lasting about 3-5 hours, NaissanceE is a surreal exploration puzzle game that is appropriately atmospheric and moody, strange and surreal, sometimes puzzling and confusing, but most of the time something that feels like a trip into a strange, foreign, isolated world that runs by its own rules, rules that you have to figure out to progress and survive.Only the most abstract of plots exists in the games; You start off the game running from some sort of shadow thing, and fall down to what can easily be compared to the rabbit hole. Your only given slight clues of a narrative, mostly coming from the chapters titles themselves, but the story is fairly simple... Lucy, our character, needs to go down deeper into this abyss and figure out what's down there. However, even without a strict narrative, the game manages to have a lot of personality and engagement. The loose narrative structure, surrealism, strange tripping moments, slight yet odd puzzle solving, and the strange world run by its own rules, remind me a lot of something like Yume Nikki or LSD: Dream Emulator, while it's a very different sort of game than either of those it in many instances can give off a similar otherworldly feel, and like those games, a strange inner-joy to try and explore and learn what you can about this strange, foreign, yet somewhat familiar place,One super minor complaint is that I thought it'd be interesting if the game had developed more of its mechanics further, the game has the tendency to introduce an interesting concept and keep that concept to but a single section of the game, and never mixes and matches concepts like it could. However, the sheer number of ideas on display, how they're handled and presented, and how many of them strike the mark and work, more than make up for it, and also helps in the element of always guessing what may be coming next.Besides that, the only complaint I have comes from a few moments. What you're supposed to do and where you're supposed to go is sometimes kind of obtuse, there's a few instances of trying to figure out what is the correct course of action to move forward that feels less puzzle solving and either trying to spot some obscure passage you missed or a guessing game with little hint, but again, minor in the grand scheme of things. There is one instance involving a wind tunnel and fans that I found to be a bit too trial and error, and sort of forced you to learn the breathing mechanic timing the character has while running to progress. There are some sequences the game turns more into a timed platformer, and these segments are notably weaker than the times the game moves at a slower pace, while I didn't find these segments bad, it is of note that they did strike less with me than most of the other sections of the game.The game has several secrets to find, which were a joy to look for and uncover. Each of the chapters felt very different without breaking the flow of the game to what we learned before.The flaws the game has are minor because the experience during its 3-5 hour run time is thoroughly gripping, strange, yet interesting, atmospheric, a sense of alone, sometimes dips into madness, and I'd even dare to say at times magical. It's a game that managed to capture a series of raw emotions of me whole playing with no dialogue or concrete story. It made me think deeply about things in the human psyche as I questioned my interpretations of things by mere suggestion, it can sometimes be mind-bending in the best possible way, and despite its short length, managed to be gripping from beginning to end. I'd say completely worth it for those who want to take a trip into a strange, interesting world.			"

Posted: December 27, 2015
												I really wanted to like this, but if I’m entirely honest with you, I’m not all that impressed.I love first person puzzle games, and I love the abstract and the surreal. From the reviews I read, it seemed like it had enough to fit that bill. But in honesty it felt lacking to me. It’s labelled quite clearly an “exploration” game, which that within itself is probably where my fault lies. You do explore surreal and abstract settings, but bar a very few odd bits and puzzles here and there, that is about it. The label “walking simulator” has been a tad bit controversial but if I had to label this game anything, it’d be that. As far as I am aware, there is no story. It clues you in at the start that you’re a little girl and you’re lost. But if I’m remembering correctly that is pretty much it in terms of anything being handed to you. You can make of it what you will, and at times I love that kind of thing, but I don’t think they built much of a foundation for you to go off of. The world in itself is massive. Or at least, it feels that way. Which, props to them, that’s what you want in an exploration game! But here is the catch: the world is pretty minimal and barren. This probably doesn’t apply to the people with more than four brain cells to rub together to create an attention span, but for me I was in awe with my surroundings for 5-10 minutes or so before I got bored of the emptiness and wanted to move on to the next setting. It almost feels as if you spend half of the game within tight corridors and small spaces and the other half in massive open spaces. The changing between the two is quite nice as it switches things up a little, but for me both still had that empty, minimal and barren feeling to it.Traversing the very big and barren surroundings you found yourself in was made more difficult by the fact you have to control your characters breathing whilst running.Don’t get me wrong, I was and still am quite impressed by the originality of that feature and how they incorporated it into the more lively bits of the game. But taking 5 minutes to get up a staircase or being dumped into a massive desert and having to turtle your way around a massive world looking for what the hell to do next, wasn’t made any more fun with your character constantly needing you to click the mouse so she’d remember to breathe.With all that said, I think the thing I was disappointed most about was the lack of puzzles. Again, it’s not labelled a puzzle game so I can’t moan too much. But I think some more puzzles in this game would have given it a lot more substance and made it a lot more enjoyable as well as bringing out its full potential as a game. “Kairo” for one being an example of that. It too is an abstract and surreal first person game with little direction or story. But in Kairo the puzzles are challenging and impressive enough to redeem the game. Or at least that was my opinion. But alas! I feel like I’m moaning a lot here, so how about some positivity?The graphics in this game are wonderful, it really is a beautiful game to look at and I was quite impressed with the art style. If this game has any redeeming qualities, the graphics are definitely it.As I mentioned before, despite the breathing being a little tedious at times, it was impressive. Certain chapters of the game were very reliant on you being able to control your breathing to get by and the concept being used in that way was great. It bought out the games potential a little bit and made moments that were supposed to induce fear actually make you worry. I must have gotten through 90% of the game cool as a cucumber. Then the very last chapter had me genuinely scared and my heart going ten to the dozen. Which I can’t lie, I loved!All in all this game is a nice experience, but I don’t feel like it has much to it. You can think of it what you will, but when I weigh up the pros and cons for myself, if I were to ask myself if it was worth sinking 6 hours into I’d have to reluctantly say no. None the less, feel free to experience it for yourself! This isn’t a resounding “NO”. It’s not like I feel obliged to warn you about the forthcoming horror that awaits before you if you buy this game. If anything this is a just-teetering-over-the-line-towards-a-no kind of no. TL;DR : This game is a walking simulator if anything, with no apparent story, minimal and barren surroundings and not much in terms of puzzle or challenge. Redeeming features if any being the graphics, which are beautiful and a unique feature, which includes you needing to control your breathing, which could have been used to bring out the games full potential. That being said, it’s a nice experience but in my opinion not one worth £10 and 6 hours playtime.			"

												NaissanceE is a game that doesn't know what it wants to be -- as many have noted, it begins as an exploration game, with truly amazing use of light, sound, and architectural design to give the sense of an vast, chill, abandoned underground landscape. In the early parts of the game, you find yourself wanting to hide from nothing more than light and shadows moving about in an indescribably sinister way. In the midgame, there's an astonishing underground city, which brings to mind Blade Runner, Brazil, with a bit of 2001 thrown in.And then it suddenly turns into a frustrating ""hurry up before you die"" platformer, where there's no exploration, and you have to struggle even to reach the next checkpoint. If you get past that section of the game, it wanders even further afield, losing all sense of the atmosphere and enjoyment with which it started. Which is REALLY, REALLY disappointing -- I very much wanted to play the endgame that the first half of this game was hinting at, a steady progression into Antichamber-like distortions of reality. But it lost sight of that goal, and lost me in the process. So as brilliant as the beginning is, I can't recommend this game because it just doesn't follow through on its initial promise.			"

												This game seems to have pretty good reviews.  Honestly, I dont really know what game they played, because it was not the one I played.  Exploration is nil for most of the game, its majority is fairly linear paths.   The character movement itself is imprecise.I cant even count how many times the jump button didnt work as I am trying to jump over a pit.   It actually seems to like doing it more at specific instances than others.A number of the ""puzzles"" are just waiting for light to shine on your path, otherwise everything is pitch black and you dont know where your going.  Its not a particularly grand looking game either.  Definitely gonna cause some eye strain. Story is nonexistant. At certain points it requires you to do some very precise timed platforming sequences that the game really isnt suited for it which can be frustrating since you are waiting more on luck than refining your own movements.  I did not have a nice time with this game, but played it all the way through trying to give it the benefit of the doubt because of how many positive reviews it has.			"

												Imagine having a fever dream, in which you  are submerged in a universe where space and time is made out of an unknown grey solid material. Matter is space, light is time and you are the only sentient being in existence. As you slowly unravel the dream, you pass through phases of ease and unease, and in your psychedelia and hallucinations spawned by a broken brain, you dream up senseless rules, quests and objectives, in order to turn the tides of terror and bliss and slowly progress through your illness.If you like psychelic experiences, this game is for you. The above contains no spoilers, but is simply the best way I could describe the game. I played through Naissancee in more or less one sitting (about 5 hours), and I'd argue this is the way the game is meant to be played, as it gives that feeling of going ever and ever deeper into the rabbit hole.tl;dr: totes worth €15Note that while the game is generally easy on the eyes, it has a couple of sequences (5-10 minutes in total at most) that will break any person with epilepsy. This is no joke, I had to cover my eyes because I was getting dizzy.			"

												NaissanceE is a game of light and shadows, or at least that's what it wants you to think it is. In reality it's a little harder to describe; an experience constantly evolving, that at it's core doesn't quite fit into any one genre. It's a game about exploration; about discovery and self interpretation that requires you to find your own way and make sense of your surroundings without the funneling and hand-holding we have become accustomed to. It's an incredibly ambitious project for such a small development team, one with numerous jaw dropping moments and incredible artistic direction, but it's abundance of anomalous design decisions and a handful of seemingly minor but highly frustrating problems leaves it hanging somewhere in the middle of ""fully recommended"" and ""proceed with caution.""NaissanceE is in essence an art project with scraps of gameplay taped to it at odd angles. Making your way through the alien structure you find yourself in is largely a hands-off journey, but for what it lacks in interactivity is made up for by the sheer amount of visual and audio stimulation. The architecture is incredible in scope, from massive chasms to the many mind-bending hallways that mess with your head before rearranging their framework to form a new path forward. NaissanceE is at its strongest during the moments that bewilder and amaze without an accompaniment of confusion, moments which begin to occur more and more rapidly and on a grander scale the deeper into the world you get.Interspersed between the wandering and sightseeing are occasional platforming and puzzle elements. Neither encroachs upon or disrupts your progression for more than a moment, but serves as a nice supplement to the experience and fleshes out the gameplay to be something more engaging and further immersion (an unusual mechanic involves you needing to time your breathing to keep sprinting for long periods of time, which while odd at I actually came to appreciate for making me feel like I was playing a person and not a camera on wheels). While many self described ""exploration adventure games"" consist of nothing but walking from point a-b, NaissanceE actually has quite a bit of ""traditional"" gameplay that, while basic and secondary to the overall focus on exploration and player defined narrative, makes it hard to dispute that it is indeed a ""game"" and not just an ""experience"".Having played NaissanceE to completion, I have no doubt of the very clear and focused vision the developer obviously had when creating this game. It's unlike anything else I've played and at many times simply a wonder to behold. But along with this vision came an abundance of technical and design missteps, the most prominent and unacceptable of which is the checkpoint/save system. The only way to save are at checkpoints purposely placed at points in the game, but the problem is that these checkpoints are much too far apart from one another. Death is an annoyingly common occurrence do to how easy it is to slip off a ledge as well as the general trial-and-error method of solving many of the puzzles, and because of this you are largely required to replay large sections of the game because of how sporadic the checkpoints are. I spent at least 1-2 hours going through the motions trying to get past a handful of troublesome sections, a tiresome affair that at times made me want to stop playing and never look at the game again. I can't say it strongly enough how much frustration would have been avoided had there been a way to manually save, and I can only hope that the developer reads this and the complaints on the forums and adds it in. In its current state it's almost bad enough for me to not recommend the game at all, as those less determined than I may find themselves giving up early on and not at all unfairly. A handful of other less prevalent technical problems also cropped up (a bothersome fan being the most aggravating), but updates seem to be on the way so they hopefully won't be a problem much longer.NaissanceE's other problems are mainly a fault of its inherent design of having the player figure nearly everything out for themselves, with no guide or clearly marked route through levels to guide them. Many areas are almost too big for their own good, leading to a lot of dead ends (some intentionally misleading by design) and wasted time running in circles because I didn't see the staircase on the side of a wall or mistook a doorway for a meaningless gap. This becomes less of an issue the longer you play, as certain patterns begin to reveal themselves and you get better at spotting the fakes passages for the real ones, but early on it's definitely a problem and one that will discourage a lot of players from continuing as they are literally left walking in the dark.Ultimately, no matter how exasperated I got at the save system or the time spent entirely lost in the maze like structure, I kept returning to NaissanceE because regardless of these issues the world it creates is so remarkably compelling. When everything clicks it's an experience unlike anything else, captivating and creative in ways I have rarely seen in any game. It asks a lot of the player, more so than it has a right too (namely to stick with it past the awkward first few hours and its abomination of a save system), but if you can accept those issues it becomes something that you need to see and play for yourself...after a few patches.Full disclosure: This game was reviewed using a code provided by the developer.

												***SEIZURE WARNING as others have mentioned, this game has some crazy black-white flashing section(s)***NaissanceE probably took me 7-8 hours. There may be secrets, and I'd like to hear about them, but I don't know if I found any. The enormous scale of surreal architecture is great to explore.The downsides are that you can't see your feet, you don't have a cursor to aim where you are jumping, and the checkpoints are SUPER annoying in places.  One section had an unskippable cutscene of almost exactly 2 minutes, every time you died.  There were  maybe 1-2 hours that I think could be cut completely. This section mostly consists of crazy shader effects where the difficulty comes of not being able to see anything.There was another interesting normal section in a couple of cool environments, and then a final really annoying sequence with crappy checkpoints (and jumps you apparently can't complete if your computer isn't running near the full 60 fps rate since the Steam discussion forums mention that the wind physics are broken with lower framerate, fun times!). There is literally no ending, nor even any credits as far as I can tell, since the game kicks you back to the main menu.I would say maybe 6.5/10. The art and exploration were great and I imagine would be awesome with the Oculus Rift. On the flip side, the horrible sections with flashing lights, or crazy shaders, or near complete darkness, would be even WORSE. I would probably not recommend it at $20, maybe $10 unless you absolutely love the architecture.			"

												Ok.. When i randomed this little indie game to play i didn't expect much at all.. Seems just like a basic survival exploration/horror game but boy was i wrong...You are a little girl that running in a mysterious building and falling a huge black/white world...This is a game with very few colors and you have to help guide this little girl to her final destination...Sound is wonderful, control is quite responsive... no bug that i can tell and fun light and darkness manipulation puzzles...Nothing is very hard to solve but does take quite a bit to get use to.As you play on.. strange emotion will begin to surface... emptyness.. darkness..,. despire... loneliness... terror of light.. terror of dark.. Lost.. I lost quite a few points of Sanity scores for myself by playing this game. And this game is not for the weak minded and weak souled... Visual, sound and game play matched up quite perfectly to create this unique and awesome experience....The end is just the beginning!!!8.5/10.. wonderful indie game... not for everyone and really don't have any replay value.

												Poorly placed checkpoints and an infuriating wind mechanic combine with mundane platforming to turn an incredibly atmospheric and visually pleasing game into a poor experience.When the tag line for a game emphasizes the look, experience, and exploration mechanics you would not expect platforming sections to be a main focus. The first real platforming sequence is alright, you interact with a unique aspect of the environment and rely on very basic timing to make it to your destination. The second real platforming section though... it just looks so unlike the rest of the game. The fan blades, axels, and gear boxes seem out of place when compared to the environments that you have previously gone thorugh. Combine this with a wind mechanic that will pick you up and throw you to your death if you do not move fast enough and it becomes very apparent very quickly that you're expected to complete these sections at a sprint. Any slow down inveitably results in you being picked up by the fierce wind and thrown into the fan blades which immediately kill you.I would not recommend this. I came here expecting to experience and explore a unique world made by the develoeprs of this game. I did not come here for a poorly implemented mirror's edge clone.			"

												This game has a few sequences that are truly breathtaking. The dynamic light when actually used is just utterly brilliant as a tool to both look fantastic and work as a platforming mechanic. The style of the world you explore through is so unique and compelling.However 90% of the game is either incredibly linear or utterly stupidly open with zero direction leaving you to wander, sometimes unluckily dying after 30 minutes of confusion which leads to my next point. The checkpointing is probably the worst I think I've ever seen. The platforming and one shot kills from trial and error sequences will look stunning but be unbelievably frustrating because there is no skill or strategy to anything that Isn't walking, bar one or two instances. The puzzles work okay but are just not there, maybe three in the whole game.The way the game introduces itself and its very minor mechanics is inspired. However the quirkyness, imagintion and beauty of this game will quickly grab you then slowly loosen its grasp as the frustration grows. I've never gone between the peak of enjoyment to utter resentment of a game so many times in such a short space of time after starting the second half of the game.I got to what I imagine is the ""last boss"" of the game, bearing in mind this is a exploration/platforming/puzzle game. The boss is just a trial and error grind where I still don't know what your objective is supposed to be to defeat it(get used to that in this game). The checkpoint is about 20 seconds before you're allowed to do anything with your character. After 3 deaths I finally lost the will to play anymore.Play until the desert and then quit. Other than that this is a cardinal sinner of bad game design and aesthetics cannot overcome its gigantic design blunders.Try harder France.			"

To call NaissanceE just a “game” would be a disservice to it. It’s an exploration of light and value, an abstracted treatise on loneliness and silence, and an experiment with architecture and puzzles. My favorite aspect of this title is how well it maintains a “spacious claustrophobia”. The game shifts among moderately sized rooms, tiny spaces, vast expanses, and extreme heights that can elicit an acrophobic response (fear of heights). I would love to play this game on Oculus Rift for sure. The size relation according to the player’s movement and perspective/value shift effectively convey the monstrous spaces and architecture. But what creates the dichotomy of “spacious claustrophobia” is that, despite the looming heights and open spaces, there’s a ceiling – the player can only guess what this ceiling is part of. Later on this contrast is intensified in the desert chapter.  The spaces and architecture create an enormous feeling contained within a very claustrophobic feeling. On top of all that, there are all these buildings and objects and strange machines, but where are the inhabitants? The world is empty of any kind of sentient creature (except perhaps the host...perhaps). This compounds the odd feeling of ""spacious claustrophobia” and lends to a constant sense of unease and creepiness.Graphically the game is gorgeous. Fantastic value combos and muted color schemes add to the game’s atmosphere. There are too many opportunities for screenshots. Most of the textures in the game are smooth, but they blend perfectly with the other aspects.    There’s a lot of music in this game, but also plenty of silence. The selection of music is very appropriate, many eclectic tracks and many selections from Deep Listening by Pauline Oliveros, Stuart Dempster, and others. I actually picked up the Deep Listening CD as a result of the game, and also discovered some of Dempster’s other meditative work. The times of silence in the game are poignant and at times downright crushing. Play the game in a quiet place with no background noises and the silence in the game will definitely assault the ears. Mechanics involve mostly running and jumping. There’s no “interaction button”, but walking into lights and cubes sometimes triggers environmental reactions. Running includes a breathing button-press mechanic, which must be timed properly to be able to run without trouble. This is important in later parts of the game where the player must continue to run without interruption or die. Speaking of dying and reloading, there's a lot of that at times, which occasionally becomes a mild irritation. As to the meaning of the game…the developer states on the game’s website that it’s open-ended and intended to be looked at through different perspectives. For me, the game is about the cyclical nature of life: run, run, look where to go, look how to go, look when to go, run some more, get pushed and pulled by various forces, experience all the different values of emotions, run some more, and then rinse and repeat. Overall, an oddball gem that will hammer a stake into your mind if you let it. An easy 10/10 for those who want a surreal experience. "

												Naissance is a first person exploration/platforming game that really tests your dexterity, patience and above all else, it tests your mind.As a game, naissance will throw a myriad of light shows and spectacular vistas at the player, the scenery here is some of the most atmospheric you're likely to come across in any game to date. These vistas are seriously grand in scale, traveling through massive industrial emptiness to an abstract and claustraphobic dome that seems to defy the very laws of physics, the game will test your perception and direction as light flickers through shapes and obtuse angles resulting in, at times a very disorientating and uncomfortable experience. Atmosphere is the strongest element in Naissance, it reminds me of the cold confines of H.R.Gigers biomechanical art, it also reminds me of Blade runners dystopian cityscape and Halo's towering architecure. I can certainly see the influence on Naissance.Platforming and exploring, plus a few puzzles here and there is really all this game is about. Its the world you inhabit that, to me personally, is one of the most interesting and original ive had the pleasure of witnessing. The gameplay revolves around moving through what can only be described as some sort of machine, from pont A to B there will be some tricky platfoming and the odd mind bendingly strange puzzles to contend with, this is the pattern each chapter takes, you are clueless as to why you inhabit this world and the story never explains itself beyond what you interpret yourself. The first half of the game is a lot more open than the second half, which places you in smaller confines with considerably harder platforming sections. These section will frustrate the player and the checkpoint system is far too spread apart resulting in some annoying repetition. All in all though, Naissance is certainly unique and definitely warrants a journey into its hautingly vast abyss.+ Amazing and atmospheric world+ Simple and responsive gameplay+ Interesting platforming and puzzles- Checkpoint system is poor- Non existent story- Navigating world can be frustrating.Overall: 8/10			"

												Highly recommended (for a certain kind of player)!(Slipped off a ledge, then fell for 10 minutes. 10/10) It's hard to review this game without making pretentious comparisons to other games, but bare with me! In a nutshell, I would put this game somewhere in the space between the later part of the Myst series (or perhaps even Obsidian, if you are more traversed in the puzzle-adventure genre), Antichamber and Half Life (1). The atmosphere, scale and foreboding sci-fi loneliness is fantastic. No doubt, the designers made a smart move by holding back on fancy textures in order to concentrate on what makes the particular graphics of this game so spectacular. The soundtrack is to die for, think Blade runner meets Prometheus with a hint of Akira. In four words - synthesizer sci-fi film noir. The story is minimalistic, at best. But for me, this was in no way a bad thing. Simply put: you are lost, deal with it. The game play in itself is quite straight forward, first person platforming with occasional environmental puzzles. Although when you happen upon a an “actual” puzzle you will know it, the traversal of the world itself can in many cases present like a form of puzzle solving. Some of these specific platforming puzzles can be straining (read: frustrating) due to the inherent problems with the “first person platforming” medium, but these moments are (according to me) few and far between.If you like the sense of scale and loneliness from Myst, the type of first person platforming made famous by Half Life, and mind f-ing absurdity in the stylings of Antichamber, then this game is for you.

												I have a video review of this game here.  


YouTube™ Video: NaissanceE Review (GIVEAWAY CLOSED) 

			Views: 314		

			I'm back with a review of NaissanceE. I truly enjoyed this unique experience. Leave a comment to be entered to win a copy.		

Or you can read my review belowDescription: NaissanceE is a game that truly grew on me over time and there are two adjectives that describeit best, intriguing and unique. NaissanceE throws you into a world with no hand holding and absolutely no direction. The first two levels are gentle exploration and minor platforming where you mainly need to avoid large falls. You are introduced to a breathing mechanic that truly isn’t used until much later in the game. This time is used to let you truly take in the aesthetic design. The game then throw some interesting puzzles at you, continues with a descent into madness, which was someof my most unique gameplay I've ever experienced and finally the game becomes a rather difficult platformer. Graphics: Graphically NaissanceE is one of a kind. The world is almost entirely gray, with high levels of contrast. At times you are engulfed in total darkness or blinded by excessive amounts of light. NaissanceE finds unique ways to play with lighting. This can be the necessity to case a glowing orb in order to see where cliffs may be, or an entirely dark room where you can only see when the lights flicker for a moment. The lighting is used at time to invoke desperations or the sensation of solitude. At other times its used to help extenuation the scale of the environment. This is also re-enforced by the blocky/simulation esc world design. Fun Factor: NaissanceE is more of an experience than a game. It is undeniably interesting to wander the massive environments. You also never know what exactly you should expect next. It has some truly clever puzzles and some intense and fairly difficult platforming moments. It’s also unforgetably different than anything else I have ever played. I did at times find myself frustrated by random falls or by being unable to figure out which way to go. Limase Five has listened to used feedback and added addition checkpoints but it is still occasionally frustrating. Verdict: 7.5/10So let’s go through the pro and cons list and do I recommend that you buy this game. Pros Beautiful environment and atmosphere Truly Unique Unforgettable experience Cons Not for everyone (too unique) Short (approximately 4-5 hours) Occasionally frustrating (checkpoint save system) There are also a few minor features missing, features that are now common place. There was no controller support, steam cards or achievements. I’m also curious to see if a Occulus Rift version of this game could be made. If you are looking for something different, GET THIS GAME. If you are a platformer fan this can be a good option but its more of an exploration game. And finally if you are easily frustrated, steer clear!			"

												NaissanceE is a bleak architectural nightmare. It's surreal noir, a descent into alien machinery or the cold corridors of a decaying mind.It is a walking sim, a platformer, and a horror game all rolled into one. I'm a sucker for artful use of minimalism and geometry in games, and this, couple with the most ambient lighting I've seen in a game, and its chilling sound design turn this game into a brooding adventure like no other.The story, or lack thereof, is best experienced firsthand and left to interpretation, and that's the beauty of it.If you like running around in big, empty spaces, in a narrative of zero words instead told through the level design, then this game was made for you, as it was for me.

												Absolutely amazing game. For me, an easy 9.9/10 (minus 0.1  for the extremely annoying white or black rooms with flickering lights at the end of the game where I almost lost my sight). What sold it to me at first was the bit about exploring super massive structures...And waow I was not disappointed. I had never played a game like this ever before. In fact it was quite an experience at times. The really bizarre feeling of wandering among huge abandoned structures was really something. It's like living in a Kafka's novel. Plus the soundtrack (unfortunately not available) is very very good. Fits perfectly the game. A great bunch of alternative/indie artists !I'd highly recommend this game to whoever wants to experience something different. Hats off to the developers (Limasse Five) for offering such a great bit of indie game. I hope they're working on a sequel.			"

												I loved this game. It's hard to describe all the visual excitement that was able to give me, i can't even compare it to other games in the genre because it made me an experience that I had never experienced before. I can say that the gameplay basically in its platforming stages reminds Mirror's Edge but then the comparison ends there. The peculiarity of NaissanceE is to transform the environment winking at big movies like Dark City and Inception, succeeds thanks to a masterful structural realization which is alive in the true sense of the word and offers a pleasant challenge, much like the trial games and error to some extent with the addition of puzzle stages. Another important aspect of the game is the total identification that manages to offer by exploring, giving a feeling of loneliness and captivity in an unknown environment that is an understatement to say disarming. Closing, i recommend strongly also NaissanceE to all lovers of art in its infinite expressions, really, don't let him escape.10/10 if you remember to breathe ;)			"

												I echo the views of those who say this is a game of two halves - one consists of pure exploration, and the other consists of time-sensitive first-person platforming.The first game is magnificent. The sense of scale NaissanceE provides, the sheer immensity of its environments with seemingly endless verticality is unrivalled by any other game I've ever experienced. The world is utterly alien, and so completely sterile and lifeless, I actually began to hope I'd make human contact. The unique mechanic of manually forcing the player character to breathe during periods of strenuous activity, and the yelps and periods of recuperation required after a long fall, act to remind the player that they are controlling a human body, and that there is nothing else in the world which bears this sense of organic fragility. I began to make up my own story as to what I was doing in this world - I, who had been born, traversing a world without birth or death. Who made this world? How did I get so out of place as to arrive here? The game provides no story, no explanation, no end and no beginning, beyond that which you want to assign it. I thought it was superb.Unfortunately, the second game comprises tedium and frustration as you jump from moving platform to moving platform, punctuated by regular trips, falls and checkpoint-reincarnation. Additionally you will regulaly fumble about in pitch black, only knowing when you've hit a wall because the game has stopped the head-bob animation, and watch in dismay as the aforementioned sense of scale is transformed into stifling claustrophobia.Fortunately the first game is much, much longer than the second, which makes NaissanceE easy to recommend, but I never actually finished the second game - I had to watch the last minute of gameplay via YouTube as I simply could not pull off the ridiculous jumps required. Quite why they thought it would be a good idea to send off this otherwise pensive, almost zen-like game of exploration with a swift series of firecracker bangs is beyond me. It leaves a sour taste in the mouth after an otherwise sumptuous meal.			"

												NaissanceE is reminiscent of a dream, always seeming slightly intangible or abstract and never content with exploring one idea for too long. It feels as though you're journeying through some kind of limbo, with levels, designs, and ideas pulled out of the ether rather than being something consciously created. Environmental puzzles punctuate the experience, involving primarily working out how to get from point A to point B and some light platforming. If you're inclined towards more unique, thoughtful and solitary experiences I highly recommended it.			"

												This is one of the most unique and fun platformers I have ever played. NaissanceE brings the mind-bending logic of Antichamber and then blows it up to a megalithic size. You find yourself in a monochromatic structure of the sorts, that seems to stretch endlessly in every direction. Using an interesting (yet seemingly tedious) breathing mechanic you control your character and jump your way through fast paced obstacle courses, with some puzzle solving on the side. Granted, depending on how stuck you get on those puzzles they could make up a lot of your play time. Everything in NaissanceE feels like it's right at home in this almost alien world. The puzzle mechanics, the architecture, the music, the lighting, and everything else piece together incredibly well and immerse you completely. Even the breathing while sprinting mechanic becomes second nature (and proves a challenge when trying to time perfect jumps).Feelings of claustraphobia, vertigo and isolation will wash over you as you experience the tight winding corridors and staggeringly huge structures. Here's a few screenshots I took during my playthrough.TL;DR this game is a bit difficult for me to describe, but is a challenging and unique take on first person platformers. I recommend to any fans of the genre looking for something new!			"

												NaissancE might be a beautiful, thoughtful game. I wouldn't know, though, because between every beautiful setpiece are sectons of incredibly infuriating first-person platforming. Combine that with the fact that every bit of off-the-path exploration you do is rewarded with either a locked door or an empty room, and the experience simply ends up being frustrating, instead of thoughtful or, god forbid, fun.Go buy Kairo instead. It's a much better version of the same idea.			"

												The Good: - Fantastic atmosphere, both from the visuals and the audio.- Some levels are mind-bogglingly huge. The level of detail, even in out-of-the-way or inaccessible areas, is very impressive.- Actual gameplay, including both platform and logic puzzles. Contrary to what you might think from the game description, this isn't just a walking simulator.- Neat breathing mechanic. It would be cool to see this used in an Amnesia-type game.- No story, no dialogue, and no explanations keep pretentiousness to a minimum.The Bad:- Doesn't stick with any gameplay mechanic for very long. The moving lights, sliding puzzles, rotating fans, etc. only make appearances in their own individual chapters and are never mixed together.-  A few areas are almost too dark or disorienting to navigate.- Directional cues vary from subtle to non-existent. Sometimes this adds to the game's atmosphere, but it can also become incredibly frustrating.- Only 3-5 hours long. Not much replay value either, unless you really want to explore.If you think this sounds like your type of thing, go ahead and buy it. It's definitely not for everyone, though, so if you're on the fence, wait for a sale. It's also worth mentioning that the game takes a lot of inspiration from Tsutomu Nihei's manga “BLAME!” If you're a fan, this game is definitely worth a look.			"

												One of the closest dreamlike experiences I've had in games comes from this title. It's a weird, atmosphere and often downright unnerving journey through realms of forgotten history, strange technology and expansive realms of unidentifiable peculiarity. It's abstract and strange, and there are layers of meaning when you look for them, but for the most part it's simply a fun puzzle platformer with one hell of a mood. It does a great job of creating a bizarre and changing world, but keeps connections to reality and understandable mechanics with just a hint of reality and logic so we can create a bridge between our character and the strangeness of the world.There are some minor technical issues like screen tearing with lack of V-Sync, and some outright annoying and frustrating puzzle sections, but otherwise it's well made and doesn't feel cheap and the only other gameplay complaint is lack of mechanics, but it never feels samey or repetitive. NaissanceE is short, but probably fairly priced, though the majority of us should probably wait for a sale since it's a very love or hate kind of game.			"

												If you like the works of Tsutomu Nihei (BLAME!, Biomega, Knights of Sidonia), this is a must play. The base is an exploring game with some puzzle elements based on light, and some platform jumping etc. Beautiful, unsettling environments very much like the ones in BLAME!. It's untextured, black & white and built with simple geometry, but the span of the environments and the chaotic architechture makes it a memorable trip. The ambient music is beautiful and atmospheric as well.I experience quite a lot of screen tearing, though, which is a bit annoying, and the slight noise filter makes jpg screenshots look a bit messier than the game really is.

												NaissanceE!In a nutshell: a great minimalistic experience, set in a mysterious greyish-white monumental dream-like maze, some features of which resemble the real world, some rather like strange monolithic constructs.Making most of the limited color scheme and basic geometric shapes, the game pulls of a pleasantly mysterious atmosphere, epecially in the many open parts which are free for the player to be explored. It is intriguing, sometimes scary, sometimes awe-inspring. Even though there is literally no story, the vague, allegoric mood present makes its own sort of narrative, with blocky ghosts flying around your head while a giant musical instrument submerged in sand plays some music for you or platform chases by giant floating worms.Gameplay here is certainly secondary to the atmosphere, but nevertheless it was pleasant enough UDK-platformer-faire, with some puzzles and a sprint-breathing mechanic built in. However, I didn't like some middle parts where you are disoriented by pitch-black darkness constantly and have to randomly find some glowing cubes for reference. Pretty frustrating. Still, it was decent enough.Music was as expected, minimalistic, but very well used for atmospheric effect, be it during exploration or during chase scenes. No complaints here.In short, if you like experimental minimalist games with great atmosphere get it. Just don't expect any clearly explained story or AAA-class gameplay and you will be greatly pleased.Have fun! "

												""NaissanceE is a game, a philosophical trip and an artistic experience.""It's a simple game where you delve deeper and deeper into this beautiful grandious primitive structure and solve various puzzles to proceed.The main idea behind the game is to make the player appreciate the loneliness, the feeling to be lost in a gigantic unknown universe and to be marvelled by the beauty of this world. A world which seems to be alive, leading the player, manipulating him and playing with him for any reason.  Walking in an undiscovered abstract structure brings questions about the nature of this world, about the meaning of this trip. Evocating and symbolic, the architecture and events will lead player’s imagination to find an answer, if it only matters.A testament to games as an artistic medium. Definitely worth playing.			"

I do think the 'breathing' mechanic in this game should have been left out. I think it just adds frustration to the controls seeing as there is no way to LOCK sprint to on, you have to hold down the shift key the entire time to run.			"

												Amazing scenery, the vast, open spaces you have to run across are breath taking. Nice soundtrack which you get to hear most of the time. The game is simple in a good way.However....endless running, having to manually breath while you run, needing to sprint jump frenquintly but you have to let the sprint button go to jump. This wouldn't seem like an issue but at points if you fail the jump it can send you back a LONG way, especially since you can't choose save points. I also hope you like the constant sound of foot steps and a woman panting in your ear cause you can't turn those off. With the lack of options to better adjust this game to your style of game play I can't say it's for everyone.Other than that the game is beautiful, a real piece of art.			"

												This game is one of the most amazing and horrifying experiences I've ever been through. The views on most chapters are stunning and without any dialog or text you feel like you have to continue, it made me feel like on a dream or nightmare where you know you have to go, but don't know why, it just makes sense when you're dreaming.The only bad thing I could say about the game is the gamma options are not quite as the game tells you but you can just adjust it at will. Also that one f*cking sh*t level that makes you choose to go through either a dark room with some flashes that reveal part/none of the platforms and a white room that has ""black lights"" showing you the platforms, it really feels like being on a really bad fever dream. Otherwise 10/10			"

												Chiaroscuro: The Game.Oh boy, this game... as I tried to compose this review in my head while playing through this game, every opinion I had caught in my throat. Every feeling of awe at the game's stunning landscapes turned sour as they were constructed around frustrating puzzles, every complaint at the periodically frustrating darkness cut off by the game's fantastic score. It took me to the very end to decide if I would even come out with a recommendation or not.I did.NaissanceE is a exploration/puzzle game with an emphasis on the interplay of light and dark. Well, that's not quite true. Because as a game, it's not particularly good. As a portfolio, on the other hand? It's FANTASTIC. This game's developer should be given their pick of set design jobs for the rest of their career. ""Breathtaking"" is a word not used in much hyperbole here. There were several moments throughout the game where I had to simply stop and admire the amazing views I was offered. I've played amidst many amazing worlds in games, and I think this might be among some of the most impressive.NaissanceE doesn't have much - if any - story, and while a bit of context might have given a deeper appreciation for what I was looking at, ultimately it didn't need it. The vastness and the detail of the seemingly endless (in every direction possible) cityscape spoke for itself. It felt timeless and haunting, the inevitable disquiet of any location simultaneously vast and empty. The soundtrack helped, with beautifully atmospheric tracks that perfectly suited the mood. I'm genuinely disappointed that the soundtrack isn't an available purchase in the store, because this is probably the first time I've actually wanted to buy it separately.As I said at the beginning though, the game isn't perfect. Many of the puzzles are franky awful - I must've toggled noclip on a dozen times after getting sick of the latest segment - and there are a few sudden, jarring tonal shifts that completely lose track of what the game is good at, including one chapter that is essentially one long chiaroscuro acid trip where everything becomes abstract and the music takes on a manic, wacky tone that doesn't at all fit with anything else.What ultimately landed a positive review on it after the annoyances balanaced out the game's beauty was the unexpected appearance of a final boss. Without spoiling too much, after spending the entire game essentially alone, the final sequence is a terrifying chase that brings to mind the shoggoth encounter from H.P. Lovecraft's original ""At The Mountains of Madness"" short story. A sudden heart-pounding finale left me in a good mood on the way out, predisposing me to a recommendation.Check it out, but don't be afraid to cheat to advance. The scenery is what you're here for. NaissanceE might've worked better as an actual walking simulator or a puzzle-free VR experience, but it's still an absolute treat for the eyes and ears.			"

												Uniquely artistic, polished and stupedously epic in all proportions. A real treat and donation to the genre you would place it in. If you are especially fond of puzzle fps games and side scrollers, from Portal to limbo. Then this is an alternative title which is a real piece of work, breath taking, bold and curious. Many games are becoming a possibility and this for such a small team is a really good example of the power of both the unreal engine and indie development talent. This for a limited and planned experience was all you could hope for, memorable and inspiring with some very new ideas I personally haven't seen before, which were both suprising and thrilling.Hopefully like ""The fall"" ""Dear Esther"" & ""Portal"" we'll continue to see more and more alternative and beautiful game ideas like ""NaissanceE"".

												Initially this game can be assumed to be an exploratory game in a darkly futuristic world, with a stark black and white aesthetic. However, do not be swayed by the developers claim of ""philosophical trip and an artistic experience"" - it is much more of the ""old school die an retry games"" category  they also claim the game to be.This is first and foremost an unforgiving first-person platformer, with some incredibly difficult and frustrating jumping bits, horrendous checkpointing, and very little direction and help for the player (I could live with the latter though).I am sad to not be able to recommend this game, as I was actually really looking forward to it, but I should have done a bit of research beforehand, so I blame myself mostly.

												Don't let the intro vid throw you - this isn't a hide-and-seek game.  There's a chase scene, but that's it.Instead, it's a puzzle/platformer, where your goal is... well, often times the game makes your goal ""figure out what your goal is"". ;)  (not in a bad way, usually)Pros:* Good, solid platform-based puzzles & small mazes.* The stark beauty of the levels.* There's at least a few easter eggs.Cons:* The intro area definitely needs some TLC - if you get halfway up the shaft, and miss a jump, you may as well restart the game because you can't see.* The ""breathe so you run good"" mechanic is annoying at first, and then becomes irrelevant as you learn to reflexively click-to-breathe.* Some of the jumping puzzles can be a bit annoying, but the checkpoint-on-death system is fairly well-tuned, overall (I hear that this was a complaint in earlier versions of the game).* I had to crank the Gamma (brightness) all the way to the top, just to navigate the darker areas - YMMV.Overall, a decent game - not much replayability, but worth picking up, especially if it's on sale.

												TRUELY AN AWESOME ""GAME"", but not for the unimaginative,...apperently.          Generally it can be said that the people casting negative reviews here, seem to lack the creative mental facilties to appreciate the absolute existential genius ideas that this ""game"" emcompass. Simply put, NaissanceE is one of the most moving experiences I've ever had in a virtual space and the reason being is the games hauntingly chilling embodiment of the human experience and its mezmerizingly beautiful and awe inspiring visual representation. The staircase scene in particular gave me chills, its dark, Sisyphus-like personification of our own humanly grind, the questioning of one's choices, ""am i going the right way?"" or ""did i make the right choice?"" feeling of being trapped in your own thought patterns, I think it draws a unique and interesting parallel between some of the real life choices we make; our doubts, our fears, our second guesses, that voice thats tells us: ""you ♥♥♥♥ed up, turn around and start over."" but you learn, you perserve, and you stumble through the dark, not knowing if the path your taking is the right one, but you stay the course and realize that with patience and willpower you can sumount any obsacle. However if you dont understand this basic but very powerful symbolism at work here, then I feel you, as a reviewer, you are sorely lacking the intellectual knowledge to put forth any meaningful critque of this ""game."" Its like saying ""I don't get it, so its dumb."" which yes, IS a hilarious paradox, i know. And generally speaking, most people dont read anymore, (outside maybe comercialized fiction) cannot understand simple rudimentary philosophy, and cant deconstruct simple abstract concepts, so its of little surpise to me that the sheer depth of the ideas were not ABLE to be fully appeciated by some, who, mistook it for what it is not....a puzzle ""game.""        The entire nature of my apprecaition for NaissanceE is its embodiment (at least to me) of philosophy, specifically existentalism. Its colors (the white and black has a Cartesian Dualism thing going on), its themes, the relation of spaces to one another, the themes of light and dark, the feelings of ""deja vu"" or of feeling like your doing the same thing over and over (Again as I was saying, this is done on purpose to illustrate some of the pointless things we do in our own lives, our routines, our rituals, our habits.), the vast universal emptiness, the feeling that your creation was pointless, that your are all alone and all that matters is the choices you make.       NaissanceE's art style is a conglomerate of Platonic solids, Surrealist dreamscapes, Escher-like reflections and continuems, and vistas taken seemingly from a dream of H.R. Giger, its sets a chilling, foriegn and otherwordly atmoshpere. You can almost sense that it wants to reveal its purpose to you and NaissanceE does that, as you wonder the creeking echoe-y corridors, running through monochromatic tunnels that bend and twist, you begin to discover the silent ""story"" deep inside this quiet structure. NaissanceE is able to conjure an extraordinary amount of reason and feeling using basic shades of grey and simple blocks, stirring deep, complex human emotions seemingly out of the benign. Which is what makes NaissanceE a truely unique and different experience.  NaissanceE is test, an allogory to the testament of human will, and finding internal truth. "

												This is not a very good Game, which is a shame because I was very much looking forward to playing it. The actual gaming part of the game is not worth anything, it's actuallly downright bad in a lot of places. (The riding cubes down the wall part, the wind tunnels part, the final ""bossfight"". All awful stuff from a gamedesign perspective.) The breath mechanic ultimately doesn't add anything except annoyance. There is for the most part no direction or hints of where you're supposed to go, but for a game of this type that's perfectly fine, though it does leave you wondering if surviving a long fall means you broke the game and you're not supposed to be where you are, or if you actually found the right path.It has some very nice visuals in places when it doesn't lose itself in abstract gobbeldygook and goes to the more realistic BLAME!-like environments. Unfortunately the amazing infinite city vibe only reveals itself in about half of the gametime, leaving the other half clambering around in tubes or cubespew corridors. The desert was really cool, but I'm not sure if I got to see all of it really.In most games light is there to help the player, but in this game is there to actively annoy you and make things irritating. My advice: Play until you see the text ""Breath Compression"" appear on the screen, then exit and uninstall the game. You'll miss out on ""Interlude"" (which really is just 5 minutes of holding forward, but the leadup to the next chapter is great) and ""Endless Dive"", but you won't have to slog through the insipid bullcrap of the chapters surrounding them.Unfortunately the first part of the game is also awful, but it's worth slogging through if you've already got the game.I can't really recommend this game, even if this is exactly the kind of game I enjoy. :-( This makes me sad!

SPOILER ALERTI don't know if the spoilers will be major, but read on at your own risk.Now, this game is really not for everybody, despite the largely positive reaction from the playerbase. I'll outline some for and against points with this game to start with:Pros:The world is breathtakingly large, a marvel in its own creation. Again, the world is incredibly beautiful and mysterious, in its werid monochromatic way.Interesting mechanic with managing your breathing as you run, and creating a sense of freedom in your movement.Puzzles are largely based around your ability to move and position yourself and other objects.Incredible ambience, makes you feel like you are isolated, but almost as if this massive structure is watching you, or some primal emptiness is observing your every move.Cons:Puzzles are generally simple and can be boring at times.The monochrome palette of the game sometimes leads to great difficulty in finding your way forward, especially when lighting is either very low or very high, which is more common than one might think.With the breathing mechanic, it occasionally becomes tedious to continually click, especially in large open areas which you want to traverse as fast as you can. Don't get me wrong, it's an impressively original mechanic, and I love its execution, but there are some parts which could become boring when incorporating it, if you don't want to take it slow and admire the scenery.I know that it seems like I don't have a lot to say about this game, but that's because so much of it is just so evocative and so enigmatic, that it's impossible to put into words. The nature of the environment is uncannily familiar, yet weirdly alien and distant, and just creates that feeling of uncanniness that stirs such emotion in the player. The emotional response to this beautiful world is almost like that feeling deep in your chest when you watch a TV show that focuses on something a little too close to home to be comfortable watching; like it's almost invasive and weird to see an outsider's view into your world? That's that same feeling in NaissanceE; you see this world which bears these uncanny resemblences to our own, but the sheer scale of the loneliness just greys out all your thoughts and fears about what could be around the corner, like a normal atmospheric semi-horror game could do. You feel a certain pale lamentation for the emptiness of this world. It's so hard to find the proper way to speak of the emotional response I have had to this game so far. It's like trying to grab a moray eel with chopsticks and push it through a pasta strainer. It's like... what!??THIS GAME REQUIRES IMAGINATION AND INVESTMENT IF YOU WANT TO FEEL WHAT I FELTI don't think that the developers have concrete lore for this story. I don't think they will ever implement it or ever should. I think that the true value in NaissanceE is what the player does with what they feel from this game. How YOU rationalise (or don't!) this crazy world that you find yourself exploring. I love to create lore for this, but I don't think any of it is more correct than any other. This is not a game about a backstory creating a storyline. This game is about a storyline creating a backstory, or artistic impression.			"

												This game sets out to make you feel alone and it keeps it promise.On an emotional level this game really delivers.At first you explore simple yet confined level structures that very soon give way to absolutely monumental feeling set pieces that will have you in awe.The art style is in itself consistent and works very well, especially when paired with the rather excellent audio design. This visual and acoustic experience seems to always matche perfectly.The game really manages to deliver a wide range of experiences and emotions, from feeling lost in a huge and fascinating world to adrenaline pumping action sequences and solving the occasional puzzle, it does it all very well.The one thing I especially enjoyed is the at times very clever level design. While being a linear game with areas for you to explore it never feels like it is linear. In fact, I could swear I was making my way through at random or at being driven by interesting set pieces.Don't however expect much of a story. Not in the traditional sense anyways. Whatever happened or happens is up to your imagination. That is a good thing though.All in all, if you're looking for a game that will take you on a bit of an emotional rollercoaster ride while making you feel small, forgotten and alone, then play it.The thing that stayed most with me is the level design. Simply brilliant.			"

												NaissanceE opens with many questions. Who am I? What was chasing me? But it always comes back to one pressing question - where am I? It's something like Journey by alien brutalism. The game is at it's best when you are just simply trying to navigate its strange landscape, less so when you are faced with traditional puzzles, even if they do elevate it from the dreaded ""walking sim"" tag. Sadly, it's a fairly lackluster ending but the four previous hours proved enjoyable despite the sudden difficulty spikes 7.5 outta den would reccomend			"

That being said like other comments the checkpoints are pretty bad expecially for the harder sections, where you have to redo the entire lead-up to it. But yes! It's everything I wanted Kairo to be and without the motion sickness too!			"

NaissanceE is an exploration adventure game where you find yourself lost in a mysterious sprawl of dystopian superstrcutres trying to seek a way out, whereever ""out"" might be.With an incredibly strong focus on atmosphere and ambience, NaissanceE is visual showcase of delights for anyone who appreciates carefully thought out and well executed use of artistic and architectural technique. From careful use of light and shadow, to volume and negative space, the foreboding scale and perspective doesn't cease to impress.There is a saying that the journey is the destination, and NaissanceE takes this to heart. Rather than the setting being a medium to deliver conflict or puzzles to the player, the interiors, buildings, cityscapes and landscapes are the true star of the show. There are no NPCs to talk to, no notes left around to read to explain anything. There is no plot in the same sense that a nice Sunday drive ambling through the countryside is aimless. If the idea of doing nothing more than walking around and admiring the view doesn't interest you, you'll be bored to tears.While I thoroughly enjoyed the game, it comes across as the kind of game that you'll either love or hate. It's brilliant for what it is, but what it is is something that only appeals to a small niche. If you enjoyed Thatgamecompany's Journey, or are a fan of Tsutomu Nihei's BLAME!, with its endless swathes of misanthropic edifices reaching to and past infinity, then NaissanceE just might be the game for you.

												NaissanceE is visually awesome. It drops you without explanation in an environment that is strange yet coherent enough to convey the feeling of being stranded inside the megastructure of an alien civilization - or at least that is what happens during the first half of the game. There are wide gaps in the narrative, which players may (unintentionally) fill however they can. In my head, I made two associations: (a) First, with the movie 'The Signal' (2014), and I'll not develop the point as to avoid spoilers; and (b) I thought this setting would work well to represent the Combine Homeworld in a Half Life 3 game, if it were ever to be developed (a man can dream, can't he?). So the sheer scope and size of the structures you navigate through is intimidating, oppressive, and eerie in a 'Lovecraftian' way - as you're left to wonder: What race of ancient god-beings built this? And are they still around? (distant alien noises indicate they might well be).The second half of the game gets much more abstract and feels sort of disconnected from everything you've experienced previously: it's like the developers created a series of visual experiments in order to test the limits of 'Unreal Engine 3', and then stitched all of them together because - why the hell not? Still visually amazing, but less compelling as an experience because you just get teleported from one 'room' to another, so that 'coherence' which made the first part of the game so interesting is lost.If I had to complain about ONE aspect of the gameplay, I'd aim straight for what can only be described as 'Half-Life-1-worthy first-person platform-jumping puzzles'. They were annoying back in the late 90s, and they are annoying today. Valve certainly learned that lesson early and refrained from using plaftorm jumping puzzles in Half-Life 2 and its expansions. In NaissanceE, thankfully, they don't occur all that often - but when they do, the location of checkpoints could definitely be improved: You cannot quick save (which I guess is in keeping with the game's minimalist style), so it only adds to the annoyance when you have to retrace your steps through the same corridors for the 10th time before you can have another go at the bloody platforms. All in all, despite all the platform jumping and the game's loss of structure in its second half, I found NaissanceE to be more than worth the time it took me to complete it, which was about 4 hours. It's just aesthetically impressive, deeply atmospheric and bewilderingly bizarre. Me likes.			"

NaissanceE is a flawed game, but very much worth trying for the things it gets right.Let's get the main problem out of the way first: the game consists almost exclusively of first-person platforming and the checkpoint placement could be better. Getting lost in its labyrinthine structures is not uncommon and some levels, particularly towards the end, can be only described as trolling the player, which is sometimes amusing, but sometimes not. It can get rather infuriating at times, and I leave it up to you whether you are willing to excuse that.But you should. Because the game's levels, or rather the spaces that you get to explore, are phenomenal. Ranging from minimalist claustrophobic structures to vast city-sized complexes, at the same time alien and familiar, they are surprising, majestic and beautiful in their own stark monochromatic way. The stellar sound design also deserves a special mention, and so does the exquisite soundtrack, complementing the game's spaces in a harmony that's often unexpected, but always inspired. (The levels were built to accompany the already existing music rather than vice versa, and it really shows.) If you ever wanted to feel like a lone explorer of an abandoned titanic complex, built by unknown architects for a mysterious purpose, then look no further: this is a game for you.Or let me put it this way: NaissanceE is the closest thing I've ever seen to the Rendezvous with Rama game that I've been dreaming about for years.

It has a scent of Star Trek's first movie like from inside V'ger.It also reminded me of many more unkown games like Product Number 03 for the gamecube or Journey which is a little bit more known.Ah yes and also it reminds me of a whole load of animes like Silent Möbius or Bubblegum Crisis or Dirty Pair and Dominion Tank police and not to forget Ghost in the shell.

												Naissancee was truly a unique experience. The game main focus is exploration, platforming and puzzles. The world of naissancee is one that you don't see everywhere, simple geometrical shapes with no definite texture and some clever lighting creates a breathtaking view.The world, is huge, probably bigger in concept that what's already shown. And although it is so big, it's also barren. Empty, it makes you think for what would a world this big exists and not be used? What am i doing here, and who is he?He... The host.... Was probably my only complaint about the game, his existence is supposed to bring thrill to the players that had been taken away by the relaxed and calming atmosphere that the world inspires and yet, he was merely annoying. I did really like the game, especially the exploration part and the amazing mood it had.			"

												The textures are simple, but the architecture is insane. To be in a giant room, see something way way way way way far away and eventually make it to that place was just wonderful. I've never felt quite an unease like I did when playing this game. The music always makes you feel like you're about to be chased by something, which makes it all the more unnerving as you look around and are completely alone. It is basically a walking simulator with a few really difficult platformer sections, so you have to be really into exploring and try not to rage at a few of the sections, but overall it's an incredibly immersive experience to the point of madness on occasion.

												NaissanceE is a nice attempt at a surreal landscape, from vast cavernous spaces, to looping tunnels.The main gameplay is focused on exploration, with challenges taking the form of jumping, sprinting and a variety of visual imparements.The combination of platforming puzzles and the first-person camera leads to the game's main point of frustration (constantly overshooting, undershooting, miss-timing, etc). Occasionally this is also combined with not being able to see where you're trying to reach. Any death adds to the frustration, often you're left to fall some distance before the game declares you dead, and the poorly placed checkpoints mean you will often have to redo some minor puzzles just to reach the main one that killed you.The atmosphere, mostly constructed through the impossible architecture and audio do redeem the game somewhat.

												Still a game heavily under construction.NaissanceE is very atmospheric, yes, but I cannot really call the rampant cubism beautiful as some have done.Most of the music is okay, but some parts are particularly annoying, the ""Chase"" sequence in particular got on my nerves.My only other real complaint is that some of the platforming, particularly the segments involving wind are ridiculously luck based, this especially goes for ""Chase"" which, in its current incarnation of patches and fixes, is completely unbeatable.  Between the losing breaths just by falling the distance from one segment to the next, the poorly designed boosted jumps (the older style I see in videos of it was much better) and the fact that many platforms are designed to fly away literally before you can possibly get to the far edge of them (I'm looking at you particularly, last jump before the enclosed arches) it's literally either completely impossible to beat or reliant on such massive amounts of luck as to be completely irrational.  Either way, I haven't been able to get to the end, through literally a few hundred tries, and.... well... from what I've seen, there really isn't an end anyways.			"

												This is a very stylish, beautiful and athmospheric piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that nobody should play.It's fine as long as it just lets you walk around and explore the moody environments but whenever any kind of gameplay shows up you immediately wish it wasn't there. Unless you're really aching for hours of super floaty first person jumping puzzles with buggy collision while staring into a strobe light. Imagine if Journey suddenly had Battletoad speeder segments with bad controls, terrible checkpoints and long load times - it's a frustratingly awful idea and the creator must have either gotten no feedback at all or ignored it.Also there's a couple of godawful areas that look like completely out of context UE tutorial examples that should've been cut. The game is only ~3 hours long, but really i wish he had removed half of it to allow the actual unique and impressive rest to be much more memorable.I've taken a few screenshots, just look at those or a youtube recording instead of buying this.

												Welcome to HELL!!!... The game is anything but mundane and is quite insane.  You start off doing minor navigation through a pleseant labyrinth of multiple choices of doors, stairways, and paths with a zen-like music feel.  Yes, this appears to be a relaxing game of adventure, right up until half way through and down the rabbit hole.   Hurry, Hurry, rush we go.  Time is a ticking or you get your licking.  Where little Alice, NO REALLY IT'S LUCY, goes nobody knows.  And the descent is simply maddening like a cross eyed Hatter.  Mind the gap, it's quite a trip.  Not even a quick pause for a simple sip of tea... That's right, this game will have you thinking that you took a hit of acid or something.  ""WHAT'S HAPPENING?!?!""... Seriously though, it took me about 10 hours to complete.  The first half of the game was relaxing, slow paced, with moments of stillness for trying to figure out where to go, and the last half is quite simply out of this world and like nothing I have seen in all my 20 years of gaming.  I believe it won somekind of Indie Choice Award.  And even though the last half was frustrating at times and had me helling at my computer screen (like it could hear me and could change the game because I said so) THIS GAME WAS WORTH THE EXPERIENCE!... And very glad I never tried a hit of acid.  LOL ;) ^5			"

It's creative, beautiful, and the sound design is a contender for the best I have ever experienced in a piece of media, and that's very important to me.It's more adventure, less game if that influences any decisions, but there's jumping and thinking to be had.

												NaissanceE is an experience quite unlike any other I've had in gaming. It feels like you're journeying directly into the minds of the creators - it's an interactive artwork, and it is hauntingly beautiful at every turn. Literally every corner of the strange, surreal worlds you'll travel to is captivating and aesthetically incredible, to the point that my finger was practically glued to the screenshot button throughout my playthrough. Don't go into this game expecting there to be story, or even for puzzles to be a major part of the game. This isn't like the similar-looking Kairo, which IS a puzzle game at its heart. NaissanceE is all about the atmosphere, and has a spectacular soundtrack to back it up. From Blade Runner-esque synthesisers to strange organic grumbles, the soundtrack matches the visuals perfectly.The gameplay, I must say, doesn't quite live up to the game's visuals. Sometimes it's really not clear at all where you need to go, and more in-game hints would be appreciated. Also, the platforming can be unintuitive and frustrating at times, and while the mechanic of controlling the character's breathing while running is innovative, it's more of an annoyance than adding to the experience. I've heard some criticism about the game's checkpoints being harsh and complaints about frequent deaths. I personally think the hazards the game throws at you justify the number of times you'll fall to your doom, and the anxiety you'll feel works well to complement your isolation in this bleak, hostile world. I do, however, think the ending was underdeveloped, and could have possibly done with a cutscene of some kind to wrap things up.All in all, though, NaissanceE was an experience I won't soon forget. It's possibly not a game for everyone, due to the lack of story, but if you know what you're getting into and enjoy atmospheric games like I do, you're in for a mind-expanding treat.			"

												This game is exactly what the synopsis says. The artwork, the environment, the soundtrack, the atmosphere, the sense of loneliness and exploration. It's all really well done and makes this one of the most immersive games I've played. One thing alone however, stops me from giving this an amazing recommendation and a 10/10.That is, as probably most other people have said...Checkpoints! It really, really needs more of them. Because you will die a lot, from mistimed/misclicked jumps, to falling off a ledge, to taking the wrong route (as it's really not obvious sometimes where you need to go). In one area I had to complete the same puzzle 6 times in a row, to then keep dying afterwards because of a confusing gameplay mechanic  The light/block puzzle followed by the fan that glides you up...That Fan!!! . I came close to turning the game off out of sheer frustration, and that is something I never thought I'd do with a game this beautiful, as the world is so compelling and drives you onward to discover more.So I will recommend this game, because while some parts of the game you will have to redo several times, in the end it usually pays off and is worth the hassle of retrying to see more of the world. But be prepared to test your patience to the limit on certain areas.So at the moment, as this game stands, I'm giving it a 7/10. But with better spaced out checkpoints I could easily give this a 10/10			"

												An absolutely fantastic game. The vistas are breathtaking at times and downright frightening and confusing at others. I had particular impressions of the style of BLAME! at times. At others, another great game, Kairo came to mind. The overall tone is not a happy one, so beware. Loneliness and confusion bordering on madness are the overarching theme.The choices the game sometimes throws at you are also very satisfying despite their ambiguity and certainly warrant at least a second playthrough. There are puzzles, there is platforming and there even are eastereggs and traps.The sound design is also brilliant, with a constant ambient soundtrack that perfectly compliments the scenery.The only negative points I have to mention are the sometimes questionably spaced checkpoints during hectic platforming parts. This is manageable though, if a bit frustrating.Also, I felt the game could overall have done with a bit more puzzling and a bit less platforming.But those are minor gripes and do not take away from an, in my opinion, resounding success.

More of an interactive experience than a game, but once you reach the first big room, you will be hooked.There are a lot of complaints about the platforming elements, which are admittedly unnecessary but not particularly challenging.  Only the 'epilepsy' segment stands out as terrible in design but even then, taking a minute or two to get your bearings before mindlessly jumping around goes a long way.

												When I first learned to drive, I would sometimes drive around my hometown until I got lost, then try to find my way back to somewhere familiar.  Playing NaissanceE is a little like that.  The familiar made unfamiliar.If you have an affection for vast spaces, inhuman scale, and the feeling of being lost, you might love this game.  I do.  It's one of those games that stuck with me.  Usually, I prefer rich stories, but there's none of that here, except for what your imagination brings to it.I played the game imagining myself in those spaces, with no idea how I'd come to be there, no option but to keep moving.  The mixed sense of unease and wonder was really rewarding.I've played the game through twice in the few years I've owned it, and I expect I will again.  I tried Kairo, which other reviewers recommend, and enjoyed it for a while, but found it too colorful, too busy, less focused.  I missed the stark, strange loneliness of NaissanceE.This one isn't for everyone, but I think if you do like it, you'll love it.			"

												This is a brilliant ""game"". Absolutely worth it, if you like exploring strange and overwhelming (really!) worlds at the detriment of the mechanics. Its focus is definitely not on the mechanics (mostly first-person platforming, when it is), but it's certainly solid at those parts. There were a couple of sections where the game failed to guide the player, but nothing major -- especially when taking into consideration everything else.The atmosphere is fantastic, with great hand-picked soundtracks! It reminded me of 2001: Space Odyssey and even Akira, at times. Ranges from awe-inspiring to what-the-♥♥♥♥ am I experiencing in a very nice way!Basically Tsutomu Nihei meets Kairo meets Antichamber. The world built is really great and definitely makes you feel small and alone.I loved it, looking forward to Limasse Five's future games!			"

												NaissanceE is one of the few videogames that can be defined as a piece of art,a testament from his creator. For those reasons, this is not a game for everyone, cannot be appreciate by the mass market. You'll find platform section close to the limit of frustration and you don't have any indication to go on. It's up to you to find the way out and push Lucy away from this alien dungeon. And this is only the beginning. The rest, here http://www.myplay.it/1150/recensione/steam/naissancee.html "

												Did you ever feel like walking/running through dimly lit hallways, with walls and floors that phase in and out of solid states?  And if you screw up, you fall off end up back a previous point, or dead?  Over and over.  In a place that is often so poorly lit you can't even see where you're supposed to go?  Welcome, you've found it!I like puzzle games.  I like exploration games.  Sometimes I like them combined.  This is not one of those times.  If the puzzles are abstract and/or difficult, then navigation should not be.  If navigation is difficult, then the puzzles shouldn't be overly difficult, or at least not require excessive movements.  The movements and the ramifications for poor steps are obnoxious.  I want to enjoy my games, not be unnecessarily frustrated by them.   While the atmosphere of the game is good, the overall experience is hampered by the mechanics.  I just can't recommend this game.			"

												Like ""The Swapper"", NaissanceE is a sci-fi game touching on themes of isolation and the definition of life. While scaling down towering apartment complexes, feeling your way through pitch black corridors, and clutching against the wall from a burst of wind as you cross paths miles above the ground you encounter you'll discover remnants of a human life now either erased or abandoned. From strip clubs to a child's room with the television still running, you'll get a feel for life in this steel monolith.Though advertising itself as a puzzle game, NaissanceE fits more in the realms of a first person platformer. You'll spend more time falling from missed jumps than stuck on puzzles. Many of these moments are built to hammer in the player's mind the sense of vulnerability and insignificance to the towering structures around them.During one segment, the player must traverse over a thin walkway overlooking huge steel structures hundreds of feet below. The wind at this height is lethal, and the player must sprint to sections cut off from the wind or be thrown into certain death. These segments evoke a real sense of panic and fear that the game's breathing mechanic is built around.Breathing serves both as a way to contrast the main character as something familiarly organic against the metallic world around them. Player's must manage their breath as they run, keeping it under control. Should the player panic and lose its rhythm, they will find themselves partially blinded and slowed considerably. Though I am currently unfinished and only two hours in, NaissanceE is a strong contender for my game of the year, without a doubt. If you're someone who enjoys games like the brooding sci-fi atmosphere of games like The Swapper or enjoy the rarely seen FP Platformer, I strongly suggest you pick up NaissanceE.			"

												This game is a work of art. It only lasted for about 4 hours, but it feels so, so much longer. Except for one part somewhere half through the game where gameplay gets a bit boring and unnecessarily too technical, I can't find a single part I didn't enjoy. A lot of the locations are true works of art, and a few times I just had to stop playing upon entering a new area because I was just awestruck and had to just look around for a while. While it's definitely not one of the best ""games"" I've ever played, it's definitely one of the best digital experiences I've ever had. Highly recommended.			"

												What attracted me to this game initially is probably what brought it to everyone else's attention: it's visual style. The striking architectural designs and high contrast lighting make this a game that stands out from the crowd. This simplistic form extends into the gameplay, taking on the role as a basic first person platformer. The style is so consistent and immersive that it manages to make even basic geometric shapes send chills down your spine and it by doing so it accomplished what no other game I've played has managed...It genuinely feels like a nightmare.I know NaissanceE doesn't necessarily advertise itself as a horror game, but it unnerved me to such a degree that most other self-proclaimed horror games have failed to reach that I feel compelled to refer to it as such. Here is why, in greater detail.The AtmosphereMuch has been said about the game's atmosphere, from the limited color palette to the imposing structures and the stark lighting. What really made the game feel like a nightmare was the subtle nods to real world architecture and interior design. The whole game feels like an abstraction of reality, Doesn't that sound pretentious? like what you would get if you asked someone to draw something, but never allow them to look at what they were drawing. Many other games try to achieve the ""nightmare"" by having warped, celestial looking entities or having porcelain doll faces everywhere or lovecraftian horror creatures startle you. NaissanceE acheives the same feel using a minimalist appearance that resembles what you remember from a nightmare after waking up, rather than what the nightmare actually contained. Ironically, this grounds the visual style more into reality than other horror visuals that try a little too hard.Sound is also used to great effect to compliment the imposing visuals. From echoing thunder to harsh stings to the loneliness of your own footsteps, all of it reminds you that this dreamlike world is vast and reaches farther than you can possibly comprehend. There is also a particularly noteworthy moment in the game (that I won't spoil) where the music and sound effects start to speed up as you progress and it does a brilliant job of creating tension and making you feel rushed even though you are in no actual danger.GameplayIt's a good thing that the atmosphere is phenomenal because without it the gameplay wouldn't be much to write home about. I have a few specific nit-picks that I will go over in more detail in a bit, but overall my impression of the gameplay was that it was very basic, but it served the atmosphere well.What it boils down to is that NaissanceE isn't a game. It's an experience. The first person controls are simple enough that it allows you to indulge in the scenery without taking away from your focus on said scenery. They are fully generic though. The only really unique control the game offers is that you have to click every couple of seconds while you're running to avoid running out of breath. Thankfully, this doesn't distract from the game too much. Once you've figured out the timing, it's just as regular as everything else. The game does occasionally try to throw in a some platforming sections or puzzles involving lights and shadows. These do help to break up some of the scenery but in a lot of ways I wish they weren't present. Some of the platforming adds to the dream-like feel I explained earlier, but mostly it is just frustrating, which I will elaborate on further. For some puzzles, it means navigating the same section of the environment several times to check if you got the solution to the puzzle correct and it really doesn't add to what makes the game stand out so much, which is the atmosphere, so now we're getting to what I mentioned earlier:The Nit-PicksMost of the game's platforming sections are very frustrating because the simple geometric art style, the lack of textures, and the randomness with which some blocks are placed make it challenging to judge the distance that you have to jump. A cube might be small and close by or it might be big and far away. Often, you won't know until you are in mid jump.Towards the end of the game, there is a desert like environment you have to navigate which is HUGE. It's pretty simple but there are no checkpoints. You could be wondering for awhile and then accidentally fall far enough to die and you have to start all over again. This is especially frustrating when the game doesn't make it entirely clear where you are supposed to go.The level design, while appropriately maze-like and reminiscent of an M.C. Escher drawing, does tend to leave you asking ""Was I supposed to go that way?"". There are a few points in the game where the path forward is hidden around a corner or in the dark. The level design also features a lot of dead ends and varying paths so confusion is likely to hit you at some point, even if it does aid the nightmarish atmosphere.There are quite a few points where the game is so dark that it is almost impossible to see where you are going. A few times, this is used for atmospheric reasons where you are meant to be walking down a dark, seemingly endless tunnel or staircase, but sometimes, it's just poor lighting.In ConclusionAll of the nit-picks I've mentioned are miniscule at most and the atmosphere is so fascinating that it more than compensates for the other flaws in the game. NaissanceE is a truly unique and unnerving experience and if you're a fan of artistic games, horror, or you just want something a little different, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not playing it.

												Probably the greatest atmosphere i've seen in a game ever. Great graphics, Great sound assets. Great Soundtrack. Ewokes haunting feelings of awe, loneliness, madness, anxiety, absolution, existensialism, confusion, disorientation, mystery and joy. It's a beautiful abstract piece that says so much and so little at the same time. It really shows how to merge art with gaming.Now some of you might worry that this is just another linear walking simulator, in my opinion it is not. There's a lot of walking and exploring, granted. But there are puzzles, platforming and failure states too. Which makes NaissanceE qualify as a game. These puzzle-platforming segments are seamlessly blended into the narrative, so seamless in fact it is sort of hard to notice when the game transitions from puzzle to exploration. Although the game never tells you where to go or what to do, i never found myself lost, As i imagined what i would do if i was in the protagonists shoes, and acted accordingly. I ""role-played"" if you will. Over all NaissanceE is probably the most immersive game i've played in a good while. And i especially recommend it if you like the atmosphere of Cube, Eden log, Brazil, Enter the Void, Pi or The Matrix. Those are movies, i know, but that is not to imply NaissanceE is more of a movie than a game, it's very much the opposite as it doesn't even have any cutscenes at all. It just has a similar atmosphere to said movies.I will totally replay this game once oculus rift is released.			"

												I have to say this is quite possibly one of the more confusing games I have ever had the displeasure of playing.  Tried the game for 45 or so minutes and ended up confused and frustrated.  Lighting in the game only adds to to the player's disorientation.  There is also no readily apparent goal.  I thought I'd enjoy as I had the Myst series but not with this game.  I will not be recommending this game to others.			"

												If you just try to play this straight through, this is basically a series of irritating jumping puzzles with clunky controls in environments that are often claustrophobic and disorienting. It's a total ""where the hell am I supposed to go now?"" kind of experience that appears to have no real narrative payoff. As a campaign, this is absolutely frustrating dreck that reminds me of the worst parts of Xen in Half Life, with worse controls and no combat.HOWEVER - the world itself is absolutely gorgeous and the ambient soundtrack is mesmerizing and great. The console commands are also enabled right out the gate. If you abandon the irritating campaign the moment you get to the open world and just throw on Fly, Ghost, Noclip, and the like, and just start treating the beautiful world as an explorable art project, the game actually has a ton of entertainment value. You can sequence break the game in interesting ways and discover a ton of unused areas around the map that I felt actually rewarded my sense of discovery. I have no idea why the developer decided to structure the game around one irritating jumping puzzle after another and didn't just treat it as a massive open world exploration game. I got this game for less than a dollar in a bundle and just having this awesome virtual environment to fly around in while I burn one is totally worth it. Definitely don't buy at full price, but as a bundle game the entertainment value in breaking this beautiful environment with the console makes it legitimately worth the money. Thumbs up as an art project/sandbox, thumbs down as a video game played for enjoyment.			"

												NaissanceE is a very good game that could have been amazing, if not for a few unfortunate design choices.In terms of the visual and audio design, and the ""cinematography"" of the level design, the game is near perfect.   Pauline Oliveros was the perfect choice for a soundtrack composer - in fact the cavernous environments in the game echo some of the settings in which she made some of her most well known recordings (""Suiren"", for example, which was made in one of the world's largest subterranean cisterns).   The art design choice to make textures minimal if not nonexistent and instead create visual interest via lighting also works extremely well, giving the game a tone both otherwordly and abstract.   This is accentuated by the diverse level architecture, which deliberately and dramatically alternates between representational and abstract modes, and plays very effectively with scale.In some was the most impressive, and for me most enjoyable aspect of NaissanceE is the way the designers managed to explore the various possible permutations of their chosen art style.   Despite the fact that in some ways this style is minimalist, the sensation of playing the game is almost one of sensory overload.   No one visual element overstays its welcome, no one theme or motif is overused.   Uniqueness is the rule in this game, not the exception.   If anything, I often felt a twinge of disappointment when moving to a new area, knowing that my time exploring my more immediate surroundings had come to an end.Game-design wise, there are some wonderful moments.   This is a rare game that succeeds in drawing out poignancy on the most intimate personal level as well as real awe and awareness of personal insignificance.   Of particular note are the times when the concept of infinite landscapes or areas is played with, but other instances in which the rules of the game world otherwise shift or are temporarily broken over the game's course are extremely effective.   There are few other games as capable of eliciting a feeling of wonder and a joy in exploration.However, there are also some unfortunate choices.   While the visual design is extremely varied, the rather puzzling choice was made to have certain reoccurring types of sections that are fundamentally unpleasant to play.   I am thinking here particularly of a series of platforming ""puzzles"" in which the player must make their way along a rod (often rotating) with various obstacles impeding progress.   This idea is re-used several times and not one iteration fails to be annoying.The controls are generally competent, but for a game that relies heavily on platforming, jumping is remarkably ""floaty"" and imprecise, and it can be difficult to judge whether a given drop will be dangerous to the player character.   This is made worse by several points in the game that feature strong winds capable of blowing the player character around.   This is a fine idea in theory but is here frustrating in practice since the controls already make it difficult to know the exact relationship between player input and player character behavior.One final annoyance is that even in the ""less pain, more pleasure"" version of the game, checkpoints are placed at some very inconvenient spots.   As mentioned before, the mechanics of the game alter at various points over the game's course and the game architecture can be very abstract.   This results in somewhat frequent situations where the player is forced to guess what the designers intend her to do.   There are also several junctures at which the player must make more-or-less split-second choices, the wrong choice resulting in the player character's death.   None of these game-design choices by themselves are bad, but when they come together and the player is forced to make a split-second decision based entirely on guesswork and ""game-design intuition"" it is extremely aggravating to guess wrong and be forced to either play through a large previous portion of the level or sit through long cutscenes that, though wonderful and fascinating the first time around, feel like adding insult to injury the second.   This also applies to some degree to the platforming sections of the game, which can be quite lengthy and are all-too-easy to fail.Given all this, I can only assume the game did not undergo proper playtesting, because these faults, particularly the last, would have easily been spotted and fixed during a well-run QA process.   This makes it doubly saddening that the game was published with said faults glaringly un-remedied.Nonetheless, despite all this I enjoyed NaissanceE greatly.   I admire its ambition and salute the designers' courage in allowing their game to have such minimal explanation, little narrative structure, and in encouraging the player to experience extremes: vast emptiness as well as intimate and claustrophobic detail, dark and light, deafening noise and deaf silence.   In the end, NaissanceE is polarizing as well as polarized.   For those who find the conceptual depth of the game's art and its deft manipulation of space and light compelling, it is a flawed masterpiece.   For those for whom these things are only distractions from its rather clunky mechanics and sometimes unexamined design, it is merely a waste of time.			"

It's like playing through an Escher piece writ large, only way, way creepier.This game makes me *feel* things I don't in other games at all - isolated, agoraphobic, claustrophobic, disoriented. It's way more horrifying in a lot of ways than any survival horror piece, yet it's also beautiful and awe-striking.  There's a whole bunch of dichotomies going on in this game actually - Its aesthetic is both austere and clinical, yet also baroque and dramatic; and the music is often simultaneously beautiful and immensely creepy.The only real downsides to the game were a very surreal middle-section that feels as though it clashes too much with the tone of the rest of the game, and an ending that was terribly abrupt. The main setpieces, however, were absolutely stunning and worth the price of admission alone.

												For the first time in many years, has a game made me truly feel as if I was in an alien environment. The lack of color or photorealistic textures or elements familiar to us makes MaissanceE an amazing experience. The gameplay involving shadows and light feels fresh and intuitive. the sprinting mechanics are another welcome breath of fresh air. (Pun intended, for those who already played it.)There are no downsides to having NaissanceE in the library. It's a remarkable experience worth every penny.However, It shouldn't be bought by those looking for an action packed puzzle first person platform game. That's not what it is and that's not what it tries to be. It is a well paced exploration game, that should be played in short bursts. But I have to leave a warning. Those starting up NaissanceE thinking about playing a short bit before something else, will find that time is indeed relative, and time will fly while playing it.			"

												""Follow the light.""Aside from the stunning visuals, the breath-taking scale of the secretive megastructure, the suspenseful pacing and kafkaesque atmosphere of the play between light and darkness ... I feel the need to point to the beautiful and enriching sound-design of the experience.Otherworldly soundscapes scratch, brood and stretch behind the walls. Creepily chattering mechanisms click, whirr and hum in their spaces. Strange ambient noises fluctuating just on the brink of perception eventually become something else (I swear I heard pigeons at one point)... awe-inspiring.And then there's the music. An assortment of deep drones, sci-fi winds and strings, and distorted synthesizers serve to capture the scenic moments of tranquil exploration and promote a pounding involvement when the pace picks up and the breathing of player and character sync up. As a fan of Blame!, by Tsutomu Nihei, I've been waiting for this game.It is surreal, intimidating, engaging, awe-inspiring and all-throughout an atmospheric exploration game worthy of the sub-genre name. If this game doesn't sell you on the idea that video games can be art, I wouldn't know what could.Addendum: Not for the seekers of casual trial-and-error puzzles. Brain involvement is required. Might also, at times, be very frustrating.I'll use a quote from wsgf.org to explain why: ""No weapon, no flashlight, no idea where you are. NaissanceE is a first-person exploration game set inside a soulless architectural complex. Puzzles involve simple platforming mechanics and a clever use of light sources [a.o.]. Trough eerily lit corridors, across bright gigantic halls, up and down stairs and on the edge of endless chasms, Lucy must find her way to freedom... and safety.""			"

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/naissancee-first-impressions/NaissanceE, a game where I had no idea what I was doing the entire time. It’s more a work of art than a game, a popular concept these days.The game has you exploring a black and white world, with very little light (for the most part). I found it very difficult to make any progress in the game, as there was no clear indication as to where you should be going or what you should be doing. In terms of being nonlinear, NaissanceE nails it. That being said, I would have liked some sort of indication as to where I should be going at any given time. During one segment of the game, I found myself jumping down a shaft in a way that probably was not supposed to be possible.Checkpoints in the game are not saved often. I wish quick saves were implemented. That’d make the experience much more enjoyable and a lot less frustrating. I often found myself finishing an area, only to die and have to redo that area. It was quite annoying, as you can probably tell.They are asking $20 for the game, but I don’t know if that price can be justified. The game is beautiful, but I still have no idea what I’m supposed to learn from the experience, much less where it will lead me.			"

												""This is a world that has ended. [...] Even time does not exist.[...] There is person in a world such as this.[...] The girl who lives alone in a world that ended. The girl who lives in a vacant, unmoving world. For a reason I cannot explain, she interests me.""-Clannad AfterstoryFor me this quote fits the game very good. To avoid spoiling I'll go through several criteria. First:The soundMusic is a very important part in every game. Esspecially at games like Naissance or Slender. It supports the gameplay and creates an atmosphere I have never felt in a game. The music makes the game unique. It is interesting how music affect your own reaction in the game. Therer were parts where I thought I got stalked. To create music that is perfectly fitting with design is pretty hard. So that I have to give Naissance in this case 9,5 out of 10 empty rooms. Nobody is able to create the perfect soundtrack, but Naissance comes pretty close to it. Time to the next part:The designThe design is, well how should I describe it? It is needed to create the atmosphere and the impressions you get. The design looks simliar to portal, with a lot less brightness, but still looking sterilized. If you know the movie ""The Cube"" you will see similiarities to it as well. It is amazing what you can do with a simple design. I have never seen such awesome environment in a game. Yes, everything looks sterilized and grey. But does this lead to make a bad game? No. Naissance surprises in a lot of ways. The location you get to are wonderful places. So here the game gets a 10/10 empty rooms from me.The gameplayThe gameplay is the thing that keeps you playing.  And Naissance master this trait without loosing one second uninterested. I kept playing  and playing. I wanted to discover every single part of this game. This stance is in my opinion attached to a very small number of games only. The normal games are just the normal stuff. Killing, killing, killing. Building, building, building. Gathering, gathering, gathering. If yoz want something that falls out of every categorie mentioned you should buy and play the game. The gameplay is pretty unique. You won't find smth. like Naissance in a long time. Use this chance and buy it. The gameplay overall gets a score of  7,5/10 empty rooms.The conclusionThe game knows how to convince the player in nearly every part. The mechanics and gameplay in combination with design and sound makes this game unique. Allthough I pretty recommend this game, I rate watching the three trailers first for getting a first impression of the game. If you are sure you want to play this game then buy it. You won't regret it.

												NaissanceE is such an intense, eerie game. It takes place in an abandoned, lonely, gigantic underground industrial setting, full of huge architecture. The lighting will play tricks with your senses, the sometimes non-eucledian geometry will play tricks with your brain. This game has no story, but it features an incredible atmosphere and  equally intense and eerie soundtrack. There are also some (fairly easy) puzzles and brutally difficult platforming.This was one of the most intense games I've ever played. And the first game to make me experience in-game vertigo. Play it for the atmosphere.			"

												Lost in an huge Merzbau by Schwtters, in a perfect Escher world, in a Dostoevskis nightmare. With wonderful Vangelis-alike music, as you've got stuck in Blade Runner's world. This is more than a game. This is an experience. You won't be the same again. You've seen the hugeness, you experienced the transcedental awe.A huge world, at the beginning still conventional like all those movement tutorials in your next Tomb Raider. But just some chapters later you are in a massive urban environment - with huge air shafts, with hotel rooms, bars, you even find a children room. But everything is empty. Everybody are gone. I'm still in, I don't know whether I will met somebody here. But I know - if this is what I will get after my death, I will find orientation now. Even if it's tricky and seemingly impossible. We need more such games, haunted not by monsters, but by your own loneliness. Sartre said once, we are monsters. Indeed we are.			"

												NaissanceE and Kairo share many stylistic and gameplay similarities.  Both prominently feature first-person exploration of vast, compelling brutalist architecture, monochromatic visuals (frequently, but not always greyscale), a profound sense of isolation, a deliberately ambiguous plot and practically-undefined protagonist, as well as an overarching dreamlike quality to the entire experience.Where Kairo is primarily exploration and puzzle-solving with some occasional light platforming, NaissanceE is primarily exploration and platforming with some occasional light puzzle-solving.Some of the setpieces in NaissanceE are truly impressive and encourage stopping to just look around and take in the sights.  While you're occasionally dropped into somewhat vast and seemingly open-ended locations, it's a fairly linear experience with defined periodic auto-saves.  (One minor annoyance - you'll re-trigger the auto-save right after you re-load a checkpoint which caused a second or two of hitching on my system.)Steam says I've gout about 4 hours in, and I've played through to the ending and gone back to explore a couple of alternate paths and areas that I missed, so it's not a long game.  Frankly, it feels like I spent a lot more than 4 hours, and at $8 on sale I have no regrets about spending $2 per hour considering the crafstmanship on display.			"

												A beautiful peice of art. Simple shapes and monochrome colors have never been so unsettling. This is one of the trippiest games I have ever played and I mean that in the best way. There's some really annoying platforming segments that involve waiting for dynamic lights to reveal where you can walk, but it is worth suffering through.When you get to the level ""Going Down"", I would recommend not playing it until its about 2 or 3 AM and you're exhausted. You should probably go through the whole game in that state of mind, but Going Down is when it gets intimidating. I didn't think I had a fear of heights until that level.Of all the short and simple puzzle/exploration games I've played this year, NaissanceE is easily the most memorable. I can't recommend it enough.			"

												An hour in. Was enthralled from the first little bit. Just came across the first truly surreal area. Was going to wait 'til I had a little more play-time 'fore writing the inevitable glowing review; I can wait no longer.Very impressed; buy it. If those abstract first-person puzzlers seem a little too archaic or otherwise just ""too much"" (Kairo, FRACT OSC, Ilamentia, etc.), NaissanceE is the perfect game for you (if you do wish to play such games but are, er, intimidated). Thus far, the puzzles have consisted solely of manipulating light and shadow, in a much more simplistic way than in Closure, even. The walls are predominantly made of cubes, but the graphical style is far from ""voxel."" Most of those first-person exploration (sans crafting) games have collectibles; NaissanceE needs no such thing - you are going to want to explore every nook and cranny, JUST to see more of the architecture. Sprinting is sometimes necessary. Alice gets out of breath in seconds; map the ""Breathe"" function to RMB, wait for the circle to appear in the middle of the screen/for her to gasp, hit it and run endlessly... As far as I know, we had to wait until 2014 for sprinting to be done right. As for what prompted me to write this: I seem to have stumbled upon the Red Light District, as it were. Convoluted passageways and abundant staircases yielded discovery of several shops (most of which had the gates drawn), a strip club, an apartment complex... and what seemed to be an elevator lobby. Reaching this final room through a long and cramped corridor; there were three open doors: one took me back the way I came, one circled around on itself, one... One incredibly vast room (I lack the words)('s'minimalistic, though, so). The light from on high only reaches so far. I ran into the darkness... [Redacted for your benefit]I recommend this game and regret that I got it so cheap.			"

												For the vast majority of the experience that is NaissanceE, I felt like a little kid in a closed mall with the power out. A vaguely threatening ambiance cloaks the situation, but there doesn't seem to be any direct or immediate danger present. And still, I count my steps.NaissanceE is not a horror game, but why the hell not? I believe it might have to do with the game's emphasis on the exploration in place of the peril. The tension accentuates the experience, instead of directing it. A good portion of the unease stems from the horrifically inadequate lighting provided in many parts of the game, shrouding corridors, stairwells, alleys, catwalks, bridges, entire landscapes in a suffocating darkness. In these portions, players would have to tentatively traverse ahead by the seat of their own senses, or wait for stray lights to draw near (enough) to cast looming shadows of pillars and banisters onto surfaces to indicate where the ground ends and the void, or more appropriately, ""Everything Else"" starts. I refuse to call it ""nothing"" because although the spaces in the game have the capacity to be quite vast, every square inch accommodates the game's expert sense of mood. In some parts, they underlie curiosity; in others, perhaps wonder, or that persistent unease we were talking about. One wrong step, you won't just take a tumble into inky nothingness– you'll whoosh past stories and stories of additional architecture you wouldn't even have been aware of.In NaissanceE, you are alone. And there will not be a moment that goes by without that reality trailing your awareness. This is easily the main factor that contributes to the unnerving tone of the game. Rolling cityscapes with intermittently lit windows, dark underground cubist caverns, miles of interior deserts– walk on, walk on. With such detailed environments, it's a bit diminishing to realize that you are following a linear path. Not to say there aren't manymanymany Many detours one would have to take to find the right one. These pathways seem so organic and natural to the world they're based in that it isn't just beneficial to the game's open-world illusion– often times, it's preferred. I wanted to wander and meander and occupy every space I could discover.NaissanceE nails the exploration part of the game so well, the other parts of the game simply seem duller in comparison. There are several puzzle aspects throughout, which only ever halted the process of immersion and got me wishing I was someplace else doing something else. It's also heavy on platforming, which seemed to work its way into the ""gameplay"" without much fuss. Naturally, the platforming segments were the ones that posed the greatest challenge to get through, especially whenever the game started taking inspiration from the fever dreams of Brutalist architects and schizophrenic minimalists. It also doesn't quite find the right way to end. For all of its sound and fury, the final sequence of the game doesn't provide any form of endgame closure to the experience. While it would have been blasphemous to the game's values, or even outright impossible to give a concrete ending to all that had come before it, the game doesn't seem to end so much as stop. Perhaps just as well, as the game isn't about its ending but about its experience; an ending might've ironically allocated more attention into what the game is ultimately building towards, instead of letting the journey justify itself. All the while, backed by an understated but essential soundtrack. Just listen. The music almost seems to inhabit the space you explore. That's good company.8/10((Side Note: Though the game's themes and tone hearken back to 2001: A Space Odyssey on a number of occasions, there is only one direct reference found in the game. Can you find it?))			"

												NaissanceE is a very good game that could have been amazing, if not for a few unfortunate design choices.In terms of the visual and audio design, and the ""cinematography"" of the level design, the game is near perfect.   Pauline Oliveros was the perfect choice for a soundtrack composer - in fact the cavernous environments in the game echo some of the settings in which she made some of her most well known recordings (""Suiren"", for example, which was made in one of the world's largest subterranean cisterns).   The art design choice to make textures minimal if not nonexistent and instead create visual interest via lighting also works extremely well, giving the game a tone both otherwordly and abstract.   This is accentuated by the diverse level architecture, which deliberately and dramatically alternates between representational and abstract modes, and plays very effectively with scale.In some was the most impressive, and for me most enjoyable aspect of NaissanceE is the way the designers managed to explore the various possible permutations of their chosen art style.   Despite the fact that in some ways this style is minimalist, the sensation of playing the game is almost one of sensory overload.   No one visual element overstays its welcome, no one theme or motif is overused.   Uniqueness is the rule in this game, not the exception.   If anything, I often felt a twinge of disappointment when moving to a new area, knowing that my time exploring my more immediate surroundings had come to an end.Game-design wise, there are some wonderful moments.   This is a rare game that succeeds in drawing out poignancy on the most intimate personal level as well as real awe and awareness of personal insignificance.   Of particular note are the times when the concept of infinite landscapes or areas is played with, but other instances in which the rules of the game world otherwise shift or are temporarily broken over the game's course are extremely effective.   There are few other games as capable of eliciting a feeling of wonder and a joy in exploration.However, there are also some unfortunate choices.   While the visual design is extremely varied, the rather puzzling choice was made to have certain reoccurring types of sections that are fundamentally unpleasant to play.   I am thinking here particularly of a series of platforming ""puzzles"" in which the player must make their way along a rod (often rotating) with various obstacles impeding progress.   This idea is re-used several times and not one iteration fails to be annoying.The controls are generally competent, but for a game that relies heavily on platforming, jumping is remarkably ""floaty"" and imprecise, and it can be difficult to judge whether a given drop will be dangerous to the player character.   This is made worse by several points in the game that feature strong winds capable of blowing the player character around.   This is a fine idea in theory but is here frustrating in practice since the controls already make it difficult to know the exact relationship between player input and player character behavior.One final annoyance is that even in the ""less pain, more pleasure"" version of the game, checkpoints are placed at some very inconvenient spots.   As mentioned before, the mechanics of the game alter at various points over the game's course and the game architecture can be very abstract.   This results in somewhat frequent situations where the player is forced to guess what the designers intend her to do.   There are also several junctures at which the player must make more-or-less split-second choices, the wrong choice resulting in the player character's death.   None of these game-design choices by themselves are bad, but when they come together and the player is forced to make a split-second decision based entirely on guesswork and ""game-design intuition"" it is extremely aggravating to guess wrong and be forced to either play through a large previous portion of the level or sit through long cutscenes that, though wonderful and fascinating the first time around, feel like adding insult to injury the second.   This also applies to some degree to the platforming sections of the game, which can be quite lengthy and are all-too-easy to fail.Given all this, I can only assume the game did not undergo proper playtesting, because these faults, particularly the last, would have easily been spotted and fixed during a well-run QA process.   This makes it doubly saddening that the game was published with said faults glaringly un-remedied.Nonetheless, despite all this I enjoyed NaissanceE greatly.   I admire its ambition and salute the designers' courage in allowing their game to have such minimal explanation, little narrative structure, and in encouraging the player to experience extremes: vast emptiness as well as intimate and claustrophobic detail, dark and light, deafening noise and deaf silence.   In the end, NaissanceE is polarizing as well as polarized.   For those who find the conceptual depth of the game's art and its deft manipulation of space and light compelling, it is a flawed masterpiece.   For those for whom these things are only distractions from its rather clunky mechanics and sometimes unexamined design, it is merely a waste of time.			"

												It really is an exploration game - because its environment is so unusual. Mostly monochrome, with subtle shades and mostly abstract, cubic architecture, the game surely stands out. The shapes are ranging from entirely abstract to vaguely familiar, the spaces are ranging from uncomfortably tight to uncomfortably vast - and the result is a unique environment that's not tailored to you rather than outright hostile. The impression is enhanced by the eerily atmospheric soundscape.Gameplay-wise, it's a mix of exploration, puzzles and first-person platforming. Who doesn't like first-person platforming? :) But it's well-done, properly checkpointed, and frequently intermitted with exploration and puzzles. There's an interesting gameplay mechanic: you need to regularly press the button to breathe when you're running - otherwise you run out of breath.The puzzles never become a routine. You might get stuck on some of them - but I never had to watch a walkthrough. As usual, you just go back to the game the next day.All in all, it's a very good exploration game. I can easily recommend it, especially if you liked Kairo. Can be played with a controller - only the menu doesn't support it.			"

												Who the heck thought first person jumping puzzles in the dark was a good idea?Okay, I'm glad a lot of folks here seem to like this game but I felt like it had some serious problems.  There is some stunning architectural and level design in this game, and the limited palette is well-used.  The game bills itself as a first person exploration game, but as someone who loves walking simulators and hates jumping puzzles, there are way too many jumping puzzles in this game to be considered an exploration game.  There are some great views and a lot of detail in the scenery, but halfway through I would come upon another gorgeous scene and rather than appreciate it, I immediately wonder what kind of tedious hopping I would be doing.  The palette and style actually starts to work against the game here; you aren't sure what you're supposed to step on, what's a deadly fall, what might kill you and what might just push you toward the end of the puzzle.Speaking of which, there are mostly jumping puzzles, but there are also several logic puzzles.  None of it is very difficult, but I have to wonder, why were they even necessary?  The game would be far, far better without so many chances to kill you off and have you faff about yet again in the scenery it seems to want you to enjoy.(PS - If you're playing it for the ending, don't.  It's not worth it.)			"

												A mix between a game and art. This was most comparable to Antichamber and Fract OSC, although it did have some moments that reminded me of Portal and Mind: Path to Thalamus. Minor Spoilers Below:One thing that set Naissancee apart from these is that it appears to be massive. I can't judge how large it actually is, but visually, it appeared to never end. The world looks like it should be populated, as there are what look to be houses everywhere, but after checking everywhere, I couldn't find anything that resembled life in the game aside from the guiding light that would occasionally appear. Eventually you realize that you are the only one there in the massive world, and it actually became incredibly creepy for me. This game may have been one of the creepiest games I've played due to the lack of interaction with anything, the darkness, the abandoned world, and the feeling of falling deeper and deeper into a world that you might not have a way out of. Creepiness aside, the game design was beautiful, and the scale and architecture were my favorite thing about the game. It's hard to believe that somebody actually envisioned the scale of this world and took the time to create it. I thought the gameplay was good, but it is the kind of thing that could turn people away from the game. Most of the gameplay was 'get from point A to point B', and the puzzles available were too easy and too infrequent. This did help to immerse yourself in the world, but it makes me more inclined to describe this as art than as a game. The story is largely up to your interpretation. I actually forgot about the main character about halfway through because the story was so minimal (if you can argue that it exists at all). I would say that it's more of a journey than a story. It's hard to recommend this for the full price, given the time I got out of it, but the time I had was very good. I would recommend grabbing this on sale though, if you're the type to appreciate art and don't mind light puzzles, light platforming, occasional interaction, and minimal story development. The reason I'd get this is for the beautiful world.  If you don't think you're the type to appreciate the world's design and architecture, this may be lost on you.			"

												This is a Gorgeous Monochrome (for the most part) game that will polarize players.  It's basically a First-Person Exploration game - very little interaction is needed (beyond a breathing component while running, which is a great way to keep players invested when moving long distances, which you will do a lot). If you're not up for enjoying intricate and massive vistas, you'll probably get bored with this.  But if you can enjoy a game just for the spaces and environments, this is a great example of the form.  It gets a bit trippy in the middle, and you can definitely die (from falling mostly, or occasionally getting crushed), and you can get lost or stuck in loops.  But if you just want to go to new worlds, this game has you covered.  And I would love to see this in VR form.			"

												This is such a hidden gem of a game that doesn't explain anything to you while still pulling me in with it's atmosphere. The visuals are something of an artistic sort while it's gameplay reminds me of something along the lines of one of those Counter Strike Source climb maps. The vast areas give you an idea of how insignificant and small you are compared to it while still wanting to explore it.The game does come with a few bothersome bits.-Run mechanic.-A certain block shifting puzzle.Other than that, while it may not appeal to a lot of people, I personally enjoyed the experience and didn't experience any crashes or glitches that would halt my journey.

												Since the beginning, the graphics and the way the objects are represented show that's not only a game. For me, I can't see this as a normal game, it's a true art masterpiece. When you enter each new big room, you sense that you can relax, that it's not a game which pushes you around to kill something or be the fastest to do that, ... I think this game hasn't been made for that. The way I play it, it's feel and enjoy.The scenery and the calm showed truly made me enjoy playing it, because it isn't something usual. As far as I played, and the thing I loved the most, is that you feel that nothing has been put without a reason ; another way to continue, purely aesthetics, ... I don't regret to have bought that game because nothing gives you a reason for it.Forget zombie or alien invasion, when you click on ""play"", you enter an artbook.			"

												This game truly is a work of art. The level design was absolutely amazing, the soundtrack was enthralling and the visuals were outstanding. Whilst there are a lot of complaints about the ending, once again in the circumstances of 'walking simulators' that it is the journey that is the main part of the game and not the ending. Whilst the ending was abrupt and caught me off guard, it did leave me with questions and allowed me to interpret the game as my own. Just like movies with open endings leaving questions people get upset and confused as everything hasn't been spelled out for them. If you don't like these types of movies I don't recommend playing this game, or at least keep that in mind as you near the end. Some of the levels in this game are beautiful and left to be discovered on your own. Whilst they felt quite open sometimes, the path is linear but doesn't make it seem so. For those who are into exploration, I do recommend this title as you feel you are constantly discovering the path or something new.The game is a walking artwork, much like Proteus. However it happens to have puzzles and platforming sequences. The checkpoint system was pretty good but I did find the save point was sometimes a lil too far away for my liking. The journey was great and I'm going to get other people to buy it and play it for themselves.			"

												It feels like this game is a metaphor for something... not sure what though... anyway, it has cool awe inspiring environments, which vary regularly enough to keep it fresh, took alot of screenshots for my desktop. Some platforming and some puzzles, not any specific enemies, so don't worry if it looks kinda dark and scary, it's not, it is a pretty nice experience with a nice soundtrack too.Took me about 3 and a half hours to play through, would play more from same developer. A good choice for anyone who enjoys first person explorative adventures, or even 'walking simulators', like I do :)			"

												I am really enjoying this game. It's eerie and mesmerizing. Reminded me of the movie Cube somehow.There is platforming involved. Can be challenging and sometimes heart thumping because of the huge environments.Controls very good and there is a tutorial at the beginning.Sounds effects and music do a good job of immersing you in the game.As for replayability, trying to speed run it could be quite entertaining.

												The trailer and game description feel rather misleading. I was expecting a 3d Yume Nikki-style game, but it's just not an ""exploration"" game, the level paths are essentially linear and there's really nothing to do besides run from point A to point B in any given level. The level design is pretty frustrating, too. There's a ton of split paths or hard to reach places you can jump to that may appear to be a secret path or area, but they always lead to either a dead end, or trap you on a ledge with the only escape being to kill yourself and respawn. It feels as though they set out to make an open-ended game but left all the extra areas as dead ends.Some of the puzzles are pretty fun, but a lot of them are either too easy or too frustrating due to the clunky controls.The art style/aesthetic design is all over the place. I really loved the large, open areas, which felt beautifully constructed and were a lot of fun to walk through. There's tons of areas, however, where you're just running through what feels like endless tight corridors, with nothing really interesting to see or even try to explore. Then, there's areas where it's intentionally all dark or all light, which is cool for maybe half a minute until it starts to strain your eyes. Many of the ""puzzles"" in these areas just involve waiting for the light to pass over you for a half second so you can see where you're going, then forcing you to wait in that spot until it passes you again.Overall it's a fun platformer/puzzle game and a lot of the scenery really impressive to look at, but the level design is awful and heavily detracts from the experience.

												I would never have imagined that a game made almost entirely out of grey blocks could be so beautiful or terrifying. I found myself wanting to be lost. I found a side of me that I don't think I had before.I felt I was trapped in some sort of dreamlike dystopia, and despite it's sometimes nightmarish darkness or silence, I couldn't help but explore it. With amazing level designs that vary from claustrophobic to massive. Lights will show you the way, sometimes only letting you 'glimpse' the world; so you'll often have to rely on memory, sense of direction, reflexes, and instinct to make it through the game. Make sure to experiment, but watch your step!The atmospheric music is brilliant too, almost like something drempt up for a ""Blade Runner"" sequel. Delicate yet often Powerful. And while the ambient sounds can often get to you, silence may become more frightening to you, in a world where you'll find yourself clambering for any light you can find.The only things I would consider for improvement are minor, but as follows:- Controller support within menus. I'm glad I can pause with the 360's start button at least.- Mouse movement smoothing. It still seems like it's using the raw data from the mouse.- Analogue walking speeds. A variable walking speed would be nice, or even a zone with half speed. In areas like ""Going Down"" I found I had to tap the stick/keys to walk slow enough on the stairs.			"

												Good idea for the game as well as looking good, but... There is one issue. The game itself is working slow due to low optimalization. I can run GTA V  smoothly (low details tho) but this game is still in slow motion whenever there is many things going on, like changing lights and massive number of objects etc. Good practice would be to create HD textures and use UV mapping, instead of thousands of vertices for cubes. Sadly i do not reccoment this game but i would gladly change my opinion if it will work smoothly.PS. let me know if there will be update.			"

The game gets boring and the levels are very linear. I was expecting a randomly generated game like the ones made by Strange Think. Exploration makes you think that you can go anywhere you want and find multiple exits to different, unique areas. The three trailers don't even show much gameplay. I tried to enjoy it. In my opinion, this game is bad.			"

												- Let's make this game unique and modern and arty!- Great idea! Let's do something that nobody does!- We will use no textures!- Yes, without textures, player will see true nature of naked polygons!- Modern!- Arty!This game has three components with varying quality.Music is beautiful.Visuals are arty.Puzzles and game design are meh.Goal of the game is to find a way out. It requires coordination when you have to run and jump, no brain power needed.Some locations are poorly designed. If you miss correct turn first time you pass it - second time this place might be in complete darkness, making navigation  difficult. And when I say ""complete darkness"" - I mean only black pixels on your screen.Buy it at sale, or if you are big fan of exploration genre.I would give it thumbs up only for the music, but there are better way to listen music.Search for Thierry Zaboïtzeff on the net. His work is fantastic.			"

												So, I don't write reviews often but after depending on user reviews so frequently, I've decided I should contribute.I bought this game based on user reviews so I had a good idea of what to expect going in. I've been into walking simulators as of late and heard that would be a way someone could describe this game.I only played for about ten minutes and can see the draw some people had to this game as I was drawn to it almost immediately. But then a very strange nausea set in playing this game. It reminds me of playing old Doom-esque FPSs at really high frame rates. When I played Bungie's Marathon remake, within minutes I was having the strangest nausea and had to put it down.I feel bad giving this game a thumbs down because of my physical reaction, but I could not recommend a game that made me feel ill.

												What is more frustrating that first person platforming?Why: first person platforming in black and white, in the dark, when you don't know where you need to go!Welcome to NaissanceE.I played the game for 30 minutes and I'm done.Right from the start, I fell down the chaft in the intro, so I had to reload... It's impossible to climb back out if you fall down because you can't do it without the light to guide the way. Bad game design.Maybe it gets better after a while... But after 30 minutes of this torture, I noticed that I wasn't having any fun.The environments are boring. No texture. No dialog, No story (narrated, written, experienced or environmental). The interactions with the lights come out clumsy without player input. The designer clearly had an artistic vision with this light and dark esthetic, and it can see how it could be pretty. But the whole experience come out frustrating and tedious. Avoid!			"

												I tried, I really tried, but I just can't get into this game. The annoying black and white visuals with the disorienting, abstract platformy levels with the moving lights and shadows made it too frustrating to play. I kept missing jumps because I was half in the dark most of the time. I would stand there, high up on some platform, waiting for the lights to shift enough to see the next platform I needed to hit and it just got boring and frustrated when I kept falling. I have a nice new GTX 1070 so I had no trouble making the game ""look nice"" but admittedly I have a crappy old monitor. Maybe I just couldn't get the gamma set up right to be able to see enough of the confusing world around me. I just found the game unplayable and uninistalled it.			"

												It's hard to judge NaissanceE. Really hard!I think the main problem of this game is inconsistecyOn one side the game clearly pushes in creating evocative moments surrounded by mega-structures that make the player feel insignificant, and they work really really well. The only reason i kept playing was to see what i was gonna discover next.On the other hand though, everything kinda leaves you with a lot of question marks, not only about what you see in the game, but also about what the hell the developers were thinking.Examples (Mild spoilers): In one level you'll find an infinite staircase that takes you nowhere, and only one way to get out to where you were before...pointless...later you'll find another staircase that seems inifinite, although this one you actually have to climb for more than 2 minutes to get somewhere....2 MINUTES of straight running without any hint...why?Another example in one area you'll find some platforming puzzles to get at the top of 2 towers...once you make it to the top...the world will change color....and that's it...why?Some area of the game are breath taking and beautiful, evocative and alien to the right point...something that could be out Blade Runner,  or some other amazing Sci-Fi movie. Other levels are a complete mess of geometries, and flickering lights to the point that i almost got sick, and totally annoyed.Finding the right path is at times complicated, with small black staircases that are almost invisible in the dark.The feeling is that this game wants to be ""edgy"" for the sake of it, but often failing at some basic concepts of game design and consistency. I shouldnt have to go and change the gamma in the options to be able to see where i'm going.There shouldnt be a corridor that leads to the game closing itself on purpose, it's not ""edgy"", it's cheap crap that has nothing to do with game design in my opinion.I found myself really struggling to finish this game, and the later levels felt more like a chore then a real game.So, if you're in for an interesting journey, with a few very akward/annoying moments, and some really debatable game design choices, go ahead and try it yourself, i cant feel to recommend it though.

												Okay so this is a game I knew nothing about until its release 3 days ago. I bought it because it looked abstract and artsy, and the art style was really striking and interesting. Overall I enjoyed it. It had a few shortcomings, but first the positives:As I said, the aesthetic style of this game is the big draw. It has huge sweeping vistas, brutally minimalist architecture, and is just generally beautiful to look at. The soundtrack too, is excellent. In a game like this the music is very important, and here it does a very good job of carrying the mood, which is lonely, eerie, tense, and occasionally a touch of insane. The gameplay itself is entirely exploration, with a handful of puzzles thrown in. As an exploration game, it keeps you engaged through curiosity and novelty, showing you new and interesting structures and areas to explore. Despite being entirely linear, it does manage to keep an ""open"" feel to exploration for most of the game. As for the negatives: the main flaw in this game is the lack of a manual save feature, and by extension, the less than generous placement of auto-save points. For the vast majority of the game this is not a significant problem, however there are two fairly difficult segments that you will probably die a lot on and be frustrated at how far back the game starts you. This is especially frustrating seeing as how dramatic these sequences would have been without the repeated death and starting over. Beyond that, the only other complaint I have is that the ending was very unfulfilling. But I suppose I shouldn't have expected anything in the way of resolution from a game with literally no story. Overall: very good game if you like exploration and architectural eye-candy. Zero story, and a few flaws, but I enjoyed it. 8/10			"

												Pros:Great art design for the worldGreat sound trackHuge levels with lots of exploration and hidden secretsDecent game lengthThe only cons I have stem heavily from my opinions, and most of them are spoilers In Naissancee all living beings aside from the player are made up of particle-effect cubes that look out of place in the setting. They look like minecraft cows that have wandered onto a starwars space ship. The world, or 'megastructure' as it might be called, is so sharp and detailed, whereas the beasts that populate it are made up of marshmellows and fuzzy black and white colors. A detailed humanoid creature hunting the player would have greatly added to the game's atmosphere - perhaps a beast that was rarely seen or maybe even showed up at random times.Also later in the game things stray from the megastructure setting to an artsy dream sequence that I thought killed the creepy vibe I was getting from the rest of the game. The platforming in these dream seqences was downright intellectually insulting. When I heard that the art design of this game was heavily inspired by the BLAME! manga I had to play it. I loved BLAME! and wanted nothing more than to venture into that world. This game succeeds in capturing a lot of the atmosphere that BLAME! demonstrated. HOWEVER a lot of key concepts from BLAME! are missing - such as wandering refugees scattered about the city and creepy cyborg people assigned to kill you as fast as possible. Without these elements I felt the game missed out on a golden opportunity. I'm definitely not one to say 'guns make a game better!' but in this case... I think they would've vastly improved this one.I highly reccomend this game to somebody who loves adventure and creepy atmosphere.			"

												     Definitely should have some sort of seizure warning and the fact that I have to breath when I sprint is more of an annoyance than anything. The small amount of puzzles there are are more of an annoyance than hard, requiring stupid jumping with sloppy movement and things you can fall through and get stuck on. I understand the point of being artistic in your simplicity, but I think it would've done the creator a lot more to maybe simplify how enormous the areas are(albeit you can only explore a small amount without dying) and focus on more features in the game, there was a use button but I don't think I had to use anything once. There is just sprint, jump, and breath...in a world that is all white. If you want to spend 10 hours on a 4 hour game dying over and over to eerie and some just downright obnoxious music, while watching strobes disorientate you the entire time, then by all means buy this game. I do wish I didn't make the purchase, though. I think it would be worth 9.99 tops, there is zero replay value to the game.Pro's :* Massive architecture that is fun to look atCon's :* Disorientating lighting and sound* Not enough check points meaning you have to often restart from far back when you die* Small user interaction/overly simplified* Puzzles are mediocre at best and easily solved, also far and few between* Zero replay value* Extremely short game			"

												This ""game"" is not a game. It's an environment that could have been used to build an amazing story. Now it's empty. Truly a shame. Even that beautiful environment doesn't really justify NaissancE to be called a complete game since it consist of cubes. It's just one shape copied and pasted all over the place. There is literally nothing at all to happen apart from walking and breathing. You literally have to push buttons to manually breathe in the game. You can imagine how annoying and pointless that feels. There is nothing to do, nothing to see and nothing to happen. You can breathe, walk or die from falling and that's it. Not a game. 0/5			"

												Despite only having played this game for 2 hours, writing a review of it that is less than 10 pages will be difficult. I usually dont like to do this, but there are so many thing going right and wrong for this game, Ive got to break it all up. Graphics/Art Direction: The game looks fine, its graphics options are solid, and its use of light is phenominal. I understand and appreciate why it lacks color, and Ive got no problems with the game in terms of how it looks.Level Design: This is where the problems begin. While the game does a great job of letting you scamper around HUGE structures, there are plenty of places in the game where what you have to do to advance is either unclear, poorly placed, or nonsensical. Also, while I appreciate the desolate look they're going for, the entire game could use a little more to make the environment look just the tiniest bit lived in. For people who say that would ♥♥♥♥ with the designer's vision; there are several rooms that are fully furnished and clearly designed to be lived in. Why cant we get a tiny bit more of that? Worse yet, the envionrment alternates between structures CLEARLY designed for human usage and traversal, and structures that are clearly not, with paths leading though both, with no real common sense defining the layout of the ""city"" (which appears to be what we're looking at). It goes several steps beyond abstract architecture. Also, for any who were wondering, there is no ""story"" or ""plot"" or background. Nothing is ever explained as far as I can tell, which is fine, but its just another thing to note. There are also multiple instances where they pull the old ""all these rooms look alike and are chained together"" gag, which gets old really fast, as well as some really poorly implemented non-euclidean elements that honestly come out of nowhere. This extends to easter eggs, many of which will force you to restart from your last save. I once got caught in a looping staircase that I couldnt get out of by going either direction, it took me a solid 10 minutes to realize that this was both not the way I was supposed to be going (there ARE several repetitive staircases in this game) and that I couldnt escape. WHY WOULD YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN A GAME LIKE THIS?Long story short; the level design is nausiating at times, but pretty to look at, and you will need to look up a walkthrough at least once. Sound: This is probably the biggest failure of the game. Its sound design is like bad prog-rock; it almost seems designed to offend the sensibilities of those playing it. While sometimes it harmonizes with the game's atmosphere with long synth-horn sounds, a'la Bladerunner, most of the time its composed of random little background trills, clicks, whines, and other mechanical noise, which is a bit unnerving, but for the most part its just distracting.Gameplay: NaissanceE is a first person platformer, so it has all the problems that come with that, especially since you cant see your feet. If you've played this kind of game before you know what Im talking about. On top of that, the distance you can fall and how much damage you take seems to change with the weather, with some 5ft drops putting you near death, and some 10ft drops getting landed with no problems at all. There is a sprint and sprint-jump mechanic which requires you to breathe with the bumpers (I played with a controller, sue me), but it doesnt really add anything to the game. For the most part you just look for new places to jump to, then move on. There are some fairly solid puzzles (I think I found 3 over the course of 2 hours), but they're not really anything to write home about. The game's biggest problem is that there appear to be rules that its not telling the player. For instance, there are a series of wind-tunnel areas in the game where you have to walk along the shaft of what seems to be some kind of windpower generator or something. Fine. At random, the game will just decide ""♥♥♥♥ you"" and push you back and kill you with a gust of wind. There is no text explaining WHY this happens, and no way of knowing WHEN it will happen, but it happens none the less. I suspect it has something to do with taking too long, but I cant be sure. Overall, unremarkable in the gameplay department. Ive got so much more Id love to say about this game, because I sorta enjoy it, but I still feel the price is a ripoff. To boil everything down; its got nice environments that are sometimes intentionally annoying to navigate, the occasional puzzle, and horrible sound design, but for the most part its an unremarkable walking/jumping simulator. Just go play Mirror's Edge with your monitor's color settings turned down or something. I wouldnt recommend this game in a million years, or unless its price drops below $10.			"

			This is another part of my blind NaissanceE let's play. A first person exploration platformer. The game is available on the PC via Steam or the official NaissanceE website. Developed by Limasse Five.		

There's no way to explain NaissanceE. It's a game like I never played before, it has the power to make me both angry/frustrated but also surprised/pleased with many different occasions. You will either love it or hate it.			"

												NaissanceE is at it's best a unique game but not necessarily a good game, not at all. It starts as a combination of running and puzzle solving which looks promising until you finish the first chapter because you then get to the ''Nonsense"" parts of the game.Starting from chapter two the game becomes boring, your only goal is to find the exit room after room and space after space & it goes worse and worse every time you advance through the game. It reaches a point where it become almost unplayable; dark places that you can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥ very large spaces where you don't know which way you should go & repetitive uninteresting challenges that you have to play again and again in order to pass them. And for what?! for reaching an ending that fails to explain anything or even satisfy the player's curiosity. This game is a must pass for me and I really don't understand why many people recommend it.			"

The world of NaissanceE is a vast and complex one, with some absolutely breath-taking views and spectacular lighting effects, but the game offers very little that is new in terms of mechanics and those it does bring to the table, it's over-all execution feels like it simply missed the mark.For a more detailed explaination, check the video review above.

												After reading the comments I thought this game was similar to Antichamber (which I love!) but it turns out the game is closer to Dear Ester gameplay wise (which I do not like). The game is more like an exploration platformer hybrid.Pro:- nice visuals- nice intro- has potentialCon:- disorienting, too dark, sometimes complete darkness.- no audio settings, personally I think the music is annoying but I cannot disable it- only checkpoint, this could be OK if there were more of it- overall feels like an alpha			"

												This game was just awful.  Sure I only played for twenty minutes, but I guarantee you it was twice as long as I wanted to play.  I absolutely wanted to give this game a chance because of its good reviews and cool aesthetic.  It reminded me a little of AntiChamber and Portal, but I kept getting vertigo from the awkward lighting and shading.  I get the intention was to be simplistic, but this game complicated the level designs too much and obscured many angles to require both light, patience, and a lot of guesswork.Level design: I want to say that what I saw in my short time was fantastic, and I suppose to some degree, that would be correct.  But as a player, you're not eased into this world as you are in the aforementioned AntiChamber and Portal.  You start the game in an empty solid room.  Looks pretty good - I'm intrigued.  But the second you leave this room, you're met with the strangest blocky tower that you have to scale straight up following some ball of light.  And me being the adventurer, I tried exploring through these gross grey corridors, and guess what?  There are no secret areas or fun adventuring.  Instead, you must trudge through a terribly linear area that is rife with pitch black darkness and itss only challenge is to keep yourself from vomitting from the confusing landscape and constant lighting changes.Gameplay: I love being taught how to play the game as I fumble through greyscale graphics and blinding light, only to be rewarded with a dead end, a place I've already been, or falling to my death because of how precise and narrow a lot of the ledges are while waiting for light to happen for a split second at a time.  The controls are just like any other keyboard and mouse game, but there's also this breathing mechanic for running, which is actually pretty cool and new and different and I'm into that.  And giving you about a mile's worth of empty runway to practice it on was a nice touch, but probably the only saving grace from a design aspect.  Oh, and everytime you die (most likely from a fall you can't see), the checkpoints are very unforgiving.  And not on a difficult scale (which something like 1001 Spikes does beautifully), it's more about how ANNOYING it is to drag yourself through all that damn WAITING for the light and constantly adjusting to the darkness.Overall, it feels like there a ton of these kinds of games, the ""walking simulator"" variety.  But here they tried to shoehorn a bleak story, what feels like a last minute choice to make an otherwise boring protagonist a female, and jarring gameplay paired with vertigo-inducing graphics.  I get the impression that the developers were too busy jerking themselves off with how pretty the game looks and how mysterious it all is instead of focusing on something that could have been amazing.  Like I said, I wanted to like this game.  If they had a better tutorial level or 1st level, something to ease you into this new world and its rules, or even have more frequent checkpoints (given the nature that it's not neccessarily hard - just awful to experience repeatedly), or wasn't too dark and barfy, I would have given it another shot.

												There were parts of this game that I genuinely enjoyed. The visuals and the atmosphere are amazing, the environments vast and breathtaking and the lighting made it look great even without textures on anything. However, too much of this game has you stumbling around in the pitch dark or falling to your death because it's impossible to tell what the intended path is supposed to be. I realize that exploration is part of the game, but when part of that exploration involves walking across a vast desert for several minutes and then figuring out that I'm /supposed/ to fling myself off of a deadly-looking cliff no different than countless others in the game, that's poor design. Or when you're running up a staircase into blackness for literally 3 minutes and you can't tell if the game is progressing or is pulling some Mario 64 Bowser stairs shenanigans (no shenanigans, btw, the staircase is literally 3 minutes of running long).There were some decent puzzles along the way, but the vast majority of the game is running across huge expanses of grey nothing or wandering down samey-looking corridors and trying to find which pitch dark little alclove has a staircase hidden in it. Several times I found myself stuck and unable to proceed, only to find out that the solution was to stand around for 30 seconds or so until blocks appeared as platforms or a door opened to let me proceed.I finished the game just because I wanted to know if there was more to the story, only to find that the game pretty much just ends. This game wants to be Antichamber, but lacks anything to keep me invested.The good:Nice visuals, great lighting engineControls are good.The bad:Dull, grey, featureless environments copy-pasted onto each other. There are huge environments, but they are completely empty and you will find yourself walking down the same identical staircase 8 times for no reason.Aside from a handful of puzzles, most of the game is very boring and uneventful.One chapter is literally running across a vast bridge for 2 minutes followed by running up a staircase for 3 minutes.The level design is like an Escher painting sometimes, but the path forward is hidden in pitch blackness or drowned out in white bloom.The breathing mechanic when running, while interesting, is completely unneeded in a game like this.Summary:I would not recommend this even on sale. There is nothing to drive you forward. The exploration is boring and unrewarding. The levels are huge but contain nothing and if you reach the end hoping to find some idea of what the whole game has been about, you will be immensly let down.			"

												Probably one of the most dog♥♥♥♥♥♥games I've ever played. Dont let other reviews fool you, legitimately all you do is jump from random box to random box with no objective and you can barely see in such terribly colored and lit rooms. There's also almost no sense of direction. You could be hopping one way for 10 minutes and it ends with nowhere to go and you cant remember which way you came because once again the lighting, coloring and environment all lead to confusion.

												This game seams to get a lot of good reviews, why is beyond me.The Good:The game starts out with brilliant and interesting design as well as good allthought somewhat abstract level design.The one puzzle in this game is actually quiet fun.Athmosphere is quiet gripping at the start.The Bad:The controll is bad, not just is the controll of the player itself rather jaggy. But i crinched at how often I pressed the jump or crouch button jsut for it to do nothing.The game has zero exploration, allthough it dose seam like it at the start there is nothign to find anywhere. With exception of the two paths there is nothing to see or hear.A simple straight path is all you will get with this. If you ever dare leave this path you will find yourself in either an endless loop or a small hallway that will shut down the game.The level design despite beeing some of the more interessting I have seen recently was horrible. I fell through so many platforms and tried to jump down what seamed to be small paths only to be tricked by the games perspective.The Engin room as i call it was the most infuriating level ever, you have to be literally perfect to get through this, the worst is that the safezones from instant dead give you the idea you might be able to wait for it to pass, but this is wrong. Overall:I did get this game for pretty cheap and it was an interesting experience for the first half. But everythign after this was just a pain to sit through. I would never tell anyone to buy this at full price.			"

												NaissanceE is a first person perspective exploration/puzzle game.  The environments seem oddly made for human beings to navigate through them (stairs, doorways, tables, platforms) but yet are forebodingly pristine and devoid of any sign of human or animal activity.  It feels like being in the equivalent of a hamster trail made for human beings by an unseen superintelligent entity.  In that vein, it strikes me as eerily similar to the alternate universe at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  This game is a work of art.  But it may not be everyone's cup of tea.

												TL:DR = play with headphones, game lasts about 5 hours without rushing. didn't regret the 5~ euros I spent.The game has an extraordinary level design with a really thick atmosphere. The beginning may be a bit slow, but the scenery will become wonderful once you progress.There is not much to do. The core of the game is exploration and run / walk. There are very few puzzles (challenging enough) and some fast paced running section. In this sense, this game maybe would have had a benefit by implementing some kind of obstacle course runing style. Not really parkour, but at least a vault over object kind of jump and a slide (more or less like mirror's edge). Nevertheless, the fast paced sections are fun enough but sometimes the movements feel kind of funny and you will have to repeat the section.It is not an action game, it is much more towards an inner thinking / interpretation kind of gameplay. There isn't even any lore, no text to read, no voiceover, you only get the name of the current level when you go on to the next level.The only real problem I can think of and that was kind of gamebreaking for me, was that somehow the level would not load completely so you would go through a dark door and find yourself out of the map. I doubt that was a wanted thing, because if I reloaded the last checkpoint and played the same section, the same door would lead to a new room. Same thing with some 'interactable' (can't say more for spoiler reasons) objects: I would arrive at point X, and see that those objects were useless. I would be then stuck. By reloading the checkpoint (sometimes much much earlier....) I would notice how the same objects were actually supposed to be moving.....so well, yes, instead of having the surprise effect of seeing weird things moving in front of you, you have the hassle of repeating a whole section again to make the 'moving thing' script trigger properly.

It is without a doubt one of the worst beginnings to a game I have ever seen.As for the rest of the game, I have no idea as after that I just couldn't be bothered. Some of the pictures look nice though, shame.			"

												Running and jumping simulator. Haven't finished yet, decided to write a review since I am in 3rd chapter. For someone who doesn't like puzzle games very much it is quite frustrating game, also unreal engine sucks but it fits for these types of games. Not too hard, though there are few instances where you do not know which path to take, so just trial and error, trial and error. Worth 5-6 Euros, not more, so if you spot it on a sale, grab it into your collection of puzzle games.Ambient music is pretty good too.			"

												NaissanceE is a first person perspective exploration/puzzle game.  The environments seem oddly made for human beings to navigate through them (stairs, doorways, tables, platforms) but yet are forebodingly pristine and devoid of any sign of human or animal activity.  It feels like being in the equivalent of a hamster trail made for human beings by an unseen superintelligent entity.  In that vein, it strikes me as eerily similar to the alternate universe at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  This game is a work of art.  But it may not be everyone's cup of tea.  If you liked Portal, Antichamber, or Proteus, you will probably appreciate this game.			"

												I'm not far into the game, so my opinion of it might change from now. While I like the fact that it's different from other platforming games since it's basically black and white, the fact that there isn't any other colors can make it a bit frustrating. I've gotten turned around quite a few times and found myself backtracking. Also, at least in the beginning, there's lights that you have to follow. If you hit them and they move to the next platform that area is then lit up. The frustrating thing is if you fall off your platform it can be hard to get up it because that area you need to jump from to get onto that platform is basically black since it's not lit up. (I'm really hoping that makes sense.) Anyway, I found that frustrating in the beginning. Despite all the things I don't like about it, I still like playing it, but I can't play it for hours on end or I'd get sick of it.			"

												Somoene sold me on this game when they said it was like exploring the house in House of Leaves.  And he was right.  Feelings of disorientation and helplessness really set the mood for this game when I first began.  There were times where I was in the darkness and felt completely lost, unable to move, loooking and spinning around trying to locate where I came from.  Some truly breathtaking massive areas; this game is gorgeous and the soundtrack fits perfectly.A really great, unique experience.

												I have to say that initially I was a little frustrated with the jumping puzzles and platforming in the start of the game, because it wouldn't always respond snappy to input. But that was soon overcome by first off enabling VSync to stabilize the frame rate and get rid of the horrible screen tearing this game suffers from otherwise (all these people reviewing negatively with complaints of distortion or nausea should really try this!) and switching to full screen with proper gamma correction -- not entirely sure why it starts as a windowed application by default.Also, if you've only played this an hour or less, you haven't even begun to see what this title has to offer; it gets a lot more interesting if you get further in! I'm in the third area as I write this review, and it's only getting more interesting. Some parts are a challenge, but isn't that exactly why you want a game like this? If you do die, the frequent checkpoints won't set you back far at all, and the game is also forgiving: if you fail a particular platforming sequence too often it will actually assist by making it easier for you (adding lights, adding platforms, etc.)! No reason at all to get ""stuck"" on any one part because of this and I think it's a very smart way of approaching the player by giving them a real challenge but not making it game breaking for them if it turns out to be too tough. Adaptive difficulty, people! I love it :)Overall (so far): 8/10, for providing a rich, mysterious and atmospheric game with interesting vistas and a good balance of exploration, scenery, action, skill and mind puzzles. The only negative is the sometimes iffy responsiveness to controls considering there are some real precision jumps you need to make sometimes. Certainly worth picking up if it's on special! the game is larger and deeper than the trailer might have you think.			"

												NaissanceE is a game where you enjoy the sights along your journey more than anything else. It's certainly an immersive exploration game first and foremost, and it does not force its own explanations on you - it's open to interpretation.Its distinct aesthetics of a seemingly sterile, ""underdeveloped"" world are very well realized. When you find pockets of high detain in the world they look bizzare and unnerving, even though they are closer to ""reality"" than low detail shapes of most of the world.What the developers absolutely nailed is a sheer sense of scale of the environments. Without resorting to VR, you feel small and lost in its fractal-like vast environments. It's probably the only non-VR game that triggered my fear of heights - so tangible the scale is. It's a world where you are just a speck, passing through.Oh, I wish I could take a look at this in VR. Sadly, and not developers' fault, the framework they build the game on is something Oculus only supported with DK1.Pacing in the game differs wildly. One moment you are slowly traversing its terrain, taking it all in; the next moment you're running for your life from an environment threat with the soundtrack pounding the rhythm in your ears. By the way, soundtrack deserves a mention - it's eerie and fitting.If I were to criticize the game, I would say that the difficulty spike in its last segment is unwarranted and was a source of immersion-breaking frustration. Also, don't expect the game to be very long - one can finish it in one long sitting.It's linear, but I expect to return to it now and then. Only to see the sights again. They're worth it.			"

												First of all I admit - I've played it on work because I had nothing else to do and sometimes I need to feed my inner hipster. I love Dear Ester and Verde Station, though I hate Gone Home because it's full of modern politics crap. That's why I bought this game searching for some artsy solitude that isn't ruined by some human story no one cares. Or maybe even some Lynch-like stuff, you know.And I found that NaissanceE is very atmospheric and beautiful in it's simplicity game. Very symbolic and artistic, and makes your imagination go wild. Also NaissanceE is idiotic platformer full of bad design choices, annoying and boring.The game is absolutely empty meaningless canvas that tries hard to give you impression that you need to fill the gaps, but there is no gaps - the game is all empty space. NaissanceE might be a great place to think and imagine if it wasn't ruined by platforming sections and dumb puzzles.So after NaissanceE my inner hipster is still starving. In the end it's very shallow and dull experience that you probably won't enjoy too. It is just a pretentious and bad designed platformer that tries hard to seem smart and fails even at that.			"

												I want to like this ""game"", I really do.  Unfortunately, at least in my opinion, it's over before it begins, and you're left with no sense of accomplishment or greater understanding from when you started.As many have stated, the artistic style and atmosphere in NaissanceE are absolutely incredible, and give a sense of something infinitely larger and more complex than what you're actually presented with.  Disappointingly, no clues or hints as to the functions of the constructs you'll encounter are ever provided, and you're similarly left in the dark about the mysterious dwellings and habitats you'll come across.  It's kind've like the initial excitement of the Myst games, without the eventual satisfaction of seeing all the pieces come together.If pure aesthetics are enough to get your giggles, go ahead and pick this one up.  If you're looking for any kind of story at all, don't waste your time.			"

												This is a strange game, a unique game.I felt like it was leading somewhere, but felt that the further it went with being abstract, the less I enjoyed it. It became disconnected from my curiosity and became a chore. There is a puzzle that I'm sure other players of this game will find infamous, if not already. A flickering puzzle that reminded me of another game that relied on echo-location, or the earliest parts of the game where you are chasing the lantern and must rely on it for sight, in order to navigate without falling. That would be fine if the puzzle weren't so cruelly difficult. You're introduced with a relatively clear experience, an oppressive tone (yes, that's a plus, it opens with such captivating mystery), and challenging platforming. The game could've used more direct writing to make its meaning more clear beyond a general feeling of fear and stress.In the end, was difficult to recommend this game to others. I felt that its consistency fell apart too much despite its beauty.			"

												NaissanceE is an intensely atmospheric walking puzzle sim. It's a good experience albeit one that is still very incoherent in overall vision.The walking simulator genre, or whatever you want to call it, has a lot of games under its belt. Not too many are like this one. The problem for me with its closest rival, Kairo, is that game just reeks of amateur game design whereas this one is slightly more polished and playable. That doesn't excuse some of the horrid checkpoints and mediocre mechanics for breathing. This one gets a recommendation only based on some of its superior art and music design.Yea, Kairo has more colors and different puzzles, but none of it comes together to be even slightly believable, and nor did that game immerse me in its world. I mean I don't even know what the hell is going on in that game to the point it undermines the experience. While that happens here, I'd say the game does really well up until the ending parts, which kind of become too abstract and weird for their own good, undermining the art deco flourishes and other strangely alien stylings up until that point that promoted a more cohesive and grounded mood.The major cons are the checkpoints for sure. I mean, just stop wasting our time please? I'm not gonna cast hell on this one like some others do, but it is noted that certain gameplay elements are confusing or cheap to play through. The breathing is a bit off to me, and in reality it's annoying to hear the character breathing all the time in such an unrealistic way. I'd rather tough platforming and better controls any day of the week.Altogether that didn't ruin the fun for me, butI still felt that parts of the fan episodes and later areas were completely ridiculous and cumbersome for no reason. It doesn't harm the mysterious nature of the game, but nothing really approaches the coolness of the middle part for me. The ending is pure disappointment. I have no idea why you build up such an experience and then basically end it with a text. Something simple but much more creative could have been done after the boss fight. It kind of feels not worth the time in the end. But for nearly 3/4 of the game it does promote a really nice atmosphere that is worth experiencing.Not much more needs to be said really. If you dig the artstyle plus light puzzle and platforming elements then fire this thing up in 4K with some SMAA and enjoy the ride. It's not going to blow your brains out or max every sensory nerve you have, but it's a solid addition to the walking puzzler genre, and most of the elements come off as fairly well presented throughout your journey.

												The 1.1 patch addresses every single complaint I had with the game, except for a few things.Seizure potential, due to flashing lights, but otherwise it's definitely worth the experience.----Original Review----MOST IMPORTANTLY:  Seizure warning.  Maybe not for the entire game, but there is at least one sequence that is a serious danger.Very atmospheric, but seems to be poorly optimized (<30fps and/or vsync doesn't work, lots of tearing), and feels very untested.The game is a linear puzzle/exploration game that has very clear lose states but commonly has obfuscated win states, causing you to take leaps of faith, which, if you fail, results in having to redo things that you've already done, as the checkpoints are placed rather far apart.I want to recommend the game, but there is far too much player punishment, and it will invariably, and needlessly, frustrate the player.EDIT:I was contemplating recommending the game until I got to ""Meet the Host"", now I can't not recommend it enough.  I'd be thrilled for a refund.			"

												I feel like I haven't played enough of this game to review it, and that's just the problem, I can't pull myself any more. The game felt like a chore even after only 30 minutes. There were a lot of missing elements from it. To begin, the game almost sets up a horror vibe, which is never accomplished, and that is the biggest issue I have here. Second, the puzzles are really strange, and not in a good way, and tend to be either based in speed or platforming. Other than that, there aren't any obvious flaws other than how utterly boring it is.			"

Naissancee is a first person view platformer game with puzzle elements, set within an abstract, dystopian futuristic, dark industrial, three dimentional environment. It involves interesting, innovative mechanics - first time, as far as my memory goes, as a digital player have I been actively responsible for the protagonists breathing control. The damage tolerance system is thought out well, being mostly forgiving, while still is it possible to perish due to unwise or unlucky move. Fortunately, the game does auto-save, but unfortunately, the savegames are available only at given checkpoints.The platforming aspect is swift and featuring proper challenges. The exploration aspect - as plenty of pathways and vistas are provided to be discovered - is very good as well. The quality of puzzles involved is noteworthy even when compared to Antichamber, nevertheless the ones present are oftentimes too focused on platforming to call Naissancee a proper puzzle game in the vein given.I have yet one complain about Naissancee. Namely, it visually becomes deliberately overtuned at times, making it hard to distinguish which way to go certain places. Albeit, since I have written a recommending review, it must be bearable.7/10 wHATs grade. Expect between ten and fifteen hours of honest singleplayer experience. By the way, check The Matrix once more before beginning Niassancee.			"

												This game is bad.That's how I'd describe it to friends wanting to know what playing it is like. it's a twitch puzzle platformer horror story... thing. It is very hard but not in a way that's very fair to play. the main theme is ""light"" as you are introduced  to it very quickly. you soon learn about the breathing mechanic which requires you to rhythmically click while doing things that require running. you're often put up against puzzles of average to simple design that require a bit of platforming and other times you'll be going through a purely platforming segment, and these are often timed so you need to be managing breath, jump distance, and getting to the next platform all within a specific time frame. The map layouts are clunky and unintuitive as to where you're supposed to go next and it's all made harder by the fact you CAN'T SEE♥♥♥♥♥♥♥through 90% of the game.oh yeah that's a thing. that's what took this game from an average disjointed pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥and turned it into a beautiful, festering, mountain of♥♥♥♥♥♥jumping segments. In the dark. puzzling. In the dark. trying to find out where the hell to go next in this rats nest of a map. In. The. Dark. A lot of this is trial and error, and error, and error, which wouldn't be the worst thing about it except you can't see some rooms but for a split second to figure out exactly what the pattern is and why you just failed. and often when you fail, you fall into utter blackness that further traps you in some pit that has no way out of it except to kill yourself, or sometimes does, you won't know until after spending some time wandering around hoping for something to happen.There's a game that did the limited visibility puzzle platformer theme much better than this. It's called Devil's Tuning Fork. It allows you to choose the time you can see things and how, and gives you a whole bloody lot longer to get your bearings and the layout of the room.Imagine trying to preform surgery, in the middle of the woods, on the run from the law, with your only light from the searchlights that pass by you every so often and your only tools whatever you can snag from the tree branches as you barrel desperately through with the gurney rattling along in front of you.It's not as bad as that imaginary situation but it bloody feels like it at points.

												NaissanceE isn't a game that explores a ""primitive mysterious structure"" or allows you to ""explore and feel the deep and strong ambiance of [an] atemporal world"". At its best, it's a game that allows you to simulate exploring a world made of cubes whilst being partially blind. The game consists of vague puzzles and dreadful lighting to provide you with a ""challenge"". Any sort of ""atmosphere"" or ""ambiance"" this game has to offer is shattered as soon as you find yourself smashing your gentials into your keyboard repeatedly after falling off THE SAME CUBE OVER AND OVER AND OVER.""You Didn't Pay the Power Bill Simulator 2014"" is perfect for the visually handicapped or any sort of aspie neckbeard who thinks playing these ""interactive experiences"" is going to make him more artistically inclined or cool.1/10			"

												I do recommend this game but only to those who like surreal & abstract environments and don't care that much about gameplay itself as this game doesn't have it (for most of the time). It's just a journey through an empty but atmospheric world. Interaction is minimal but I'm cool with it. If you liked Kairo than think: Kairo without puzzles and here you go - NaissanceE. If you prefer to solve puzzles than skip this one, you will only find few and they don't even require too much thinking.If I was to compare this game to something outside game world I would say ""Blame!"" (comic book) without all the creatures.Was it worth my time? Definitely, it met my expectations although the game has potential to be something more.Pros:- vast abstract world- general vibe- music- graphicsCons:- not enough interaction (if you care about it)- few puzzles which are way too simple			"

												NaissanceE does one thing very right, put you in the middle of your own spectacular waking dream. The grandeur of the architecture, the unsettling foreigness of the scenery, and the subtle underlying tension all contribute to a wonderful cubic journey in shades of white and grey.  Many moments found me motionless gawking at the impressive vista.  Yet all the while there is a feeling that one should not tarry for fear of some unseen watcher.The game is a 3D linear exploration game with the focus firmly on the level design.  The developers even forgo textures relying solely on their masterful use of light and shadow.  Your odyssey is enhanced by some mild platform jumping and puzzle solving challenges.  The only drawbacks in this otherwise satisfying experience were a couple of long ""runs"" that required more than the expected amount of restarts which in my opinion broke the sensory flow.  All in all a gratifying affair.			"

												Don't be fooled by the look. Looks absolutely amazing as long as there is light ... and there are lots of parts where there is not a lot of it. But the worst part are those annoying platfoming sections ... and there will be a lot of them ... was expecting some decent puzzles but in over 3 hours of playtime I encountered a single one where I had to use more than half a braincell. And OMFG the breathing and dying sounds ... completely destroy every little bit of immersion that is building up.Terrible waste of a very cool artstyle. Don't waste your time and money. "

												One of the strangest games I've ever played. It's like a darker version of Antichamber, but with less puzzles and MUCH more walking.Graphics: At first I loved the style, but it got old pretty quickly. It honestly felt unfinished in some parts, but that might have a bit to do with the level design as well. Everywhere you go, it's some form of gray, black, or white. Occasionally you'll get the odd dull orange or dark red, but it's monochromatic for the most part. Other than the boring textures, it ran very well and I always found myself impressed with the scale of the environments I was placed in. Which leads me to...Level Design: This is both the best and worst aspect of the game. First of all, I was blown away by how large everything was, and how there were very few loading screens. If you could see a bright point really far off on the horizon, or on a wall somewhere across the huge room, you can probably get there eventually. I remember this sequence where I was decending down this huge city-like area for almost thirty minutes, and it just kept going. On the other side of things, the levels were so erratic and confusing that I often found myself lost among the various gray rooms and corridors. Some areas had lights to designate points of interest, but others left the goal in the dark and I would pass over it numerous times. This is where the game feels unfinished to me. I feel like it needs a bit more polish, a bit of editing, and more specific playtesting in order to iron out those spots that confuse the player. Story: There really isn't one. You walk until you can't walk anymore, and it lasts about 4 hours.Gameplay: Again, nothing too interesting other than just walking and using light to your advantage. There are a couple mechanics involving certain blocks that disappear/reappear depending on where you orient the light, but those are introduced early on and rarely utilized in the rest of the game. There are plenty of puzzles that play with your perception of reality, which can be interesting. One other gameplay mechanic which I'm not too happy with is the need to ""breathe"" while you sprint. This means pressing a button as you sprint when a circle appears on your screen. It can make the more intense platforming sections a bit harder, but generally it's just annoying to have to push the button when you're running around aimlessly, which is the majority of the time.Overall, this game seems like a way to showcase the crazy things you can do with the Unreal Engine, rather than a game you can sit down and enjoy in terms of gameplay. It's fun to watch the environments and explore, but sometimes it can be frustrating with the clunky controls and confusing level design. I enjoyed it, for the most part, and I'm glad it was as short as it was. If it were any longer, I would've gotten sick of it. 7/10			"

												In general, the atmosphere and art of this game is astoundingly good.It's a shame the gameplay ranges from pretty decent at best to mediocre and, at a few points, outright terrible.The breathing mechanic, I like. It adds a layer to the gameplay that's just a simple thing to manage while you do other platforming stuff. It never really gets in the way.Each chapter is kind of its own thing, chapter 1 does a lot of vision-based puzzles, chapter 2 is descending a massive area and might be almost half the game's length by itself, chapter 3 has some really tightrope-y platforming going on, chapter 4 is... special, though one of its segments is easily the worst moment of the game. Chapters 5 and 6... basically don't exist, and chapter 7 is a kind of annoying ""final boss"" sort of thing-y. The general vibe of the game is a 3D platforming and kind of walking-simulator-but-not-really and there's some puzzles along the way.There's a bit too much of nothing happening and a fair number of weird/awkward platforming segments, especially the really awful one in chapter 4. But the game's gorgeous to look at, the atmosphere is great, and there's a constant sense of unease and tension. If you don't mind a bit of annoying gameplay, this is probably worth your time for the experience....just, maybe not at full price, as it's not a particularly long game and there's very little replayability to it.

My screenshot button has never had such a workout.If you are a fan of the Portal Series, Qube or Antichamber I can defnitely reccommend this game. While quite light on the puzzle aspects, this game will still get your brain working.My favourite thing about this game though, are the environments. I was constantly amazed at the developer's ability to convey massive scale and distance while still making the space intricately detailed. And all without any textures (that I could see).I definitely reccommend this game.			"

												I've really debated whether to give this one a thumbs up or a thumbs down. The architecture is breathtaking; i've never seen anything like it. Unfortunately, the ""puzzles"" are so insanely frustrating that every moment of awe and wonder is immediately destroyed when you spend the next 20 minutes falling off disappearing platforms, missing jumps or running round in circles trying to find an unmarked spot that triggers an elevator. Be aware, this is not a game like Mirror's Edge or Lemma where you can see your body and grab onto ledges and enjoy the flow of parkour. This is an oldskool trial-and-error precision platformer where you jump around like a demented Quake Guy without any feet. And it's a crying shame because it has the potential to be one of the best damn walking simulators ever made. The scenery is just awesome. The music is atmospheric. The lighting is bold and fabulously alien. The second level is truly epic and brings the wildest megastructures from classic science fiction to life. Alas, i can only imagine how much more it has to offer, because after falling off a rotating crankshaft festooned with blades for the ten billionth time at the beginning of the third level i gave up.

Upon some input and continued play of NaissanceE, I found it necessary to write a new review.First of all, NaissanceE is a brilliant game. The term 'game' is a little shaky due to the fact that there isn't much gaming to be experienced. There's no combat, there's no enemies. There's no guns, XP, or Russians taking over the world. There's movement. There's levels. You explore them.'Explore' is also a bit of an understatement. More-so you 'experience' them. The aesthetics are simple yet immensely complex. Areas seem to sprawl on indefinitely. The architecture is believable yet foreign or alien-like. You feel uncomfortable, like you don't fit in. All while everything is in simple shades of grey. No game has ever impressed me visually as much as NaissanceE. If you're like me, you'll be reaching for the F12 key after turning each corner. This game is utterly beautiful. Combined with the music, the ambience, it's incredibly immersive. My first time playing was at night, in the dark, with some good headphones. From the very start I was completely sucked into this game. I felt alone, lost, and confused. The game often made me question what I was actually doing. It wasn't until late-game that I finally embraced this game's concept of a 'leap of faith' and had a bit of a breakthrough with this game. Throughout the game I stumbled upon an amazing number of easter eggs. Some amusing, some degrading. There have been quite a number of times where I find an easter egg, only to walk away from it questioning the game, the developers, my own sanity.The game claims to supposedly have 5 hours of gameplay to it. In my experience, I took 3.5 hours to beat it the first time. Keep in mind I took probably 30 screenshots the first time through. Upon completing it, I felt the need to do a second run-through. I'd call it a speedrun, though, once again, I stopped quite often to breathe in the atmosphere and smash F12. This playthrough took roughly an hour. This does not mean I'm done with this game after only a handful of hours; I still find myself wanting to play it again. The game leaves you feeling like you missed something somewhere at some point. Just prior to writing this review I played an early section only to find a whole area I never saw before. In the future I plan to play a literal 'walk through' of NaissanceE where I use the sprint key as little as possible. I feel the undying need to explore every nook and cranny of this game.As much as I love this game, the platforming was a little wonky at times. The basic jump puzzles are do-able, maybe a hiccup here and there. The ""Less Frustration"" patch they put out does help a little, though a few more checkpoints will only go so far. I don't know about you, reader, but solving jump-based logic puzzles in quick succession isn't my claim to fame. Bare in mind that the puzzles in HalfLife2 left me stumped at times. Of course, once you get it right once, you'll probably never screw it up again. The chase scene was, I'll admit, tedious and a bit unforgiving. Fudging a jump or taking too long will result in death rather quickly. And once again the leap of faith aspect kicks in. Much like the previous puzzles, beat it once, you should be fine.Overall, I love this game and highly recommend it. However, I'm well aware that not everyone will enjoy this game. It's not meant for everybody. If you're a fan of games like Dear Esther, Journey, Gone Home, and other various indie-like, ""experimental-type"" games, chances are you'll like this one. The price ($20 at the date of writing this) might not be for everyone but I feel content in my purchase. I am a bit of a sucker for games like this though. If you find it interesting, grab it on sale if you want. Also consider looking at some Let'sPlay's, though they won't even compare to what the game itself can provide you with.			"

												Wow, what an intense experience!! Naisancee is definitely one of the most unique experiences/games I've EVER played! You are basically exploring this mysterious world filled with corridors, pathways, bridges, platforms, tubes, stairs (millions of them)...you are not fighting anybody unless you don't count the final level where you have to excape this rotating light - pulsing entity and here you go for a crazy ride, mark my words! Some puzzles are very easy, some are very difficult, whole game is designed mostly in black & white with some exceptions where you find yourself in the desert like enviroment. Music and sounds are extremely moody/dark/distant making you feel very isolated and that's one of the main purpose of this game. I'm just hoping they make a sequel or prequel! :)			"

												a very interesting and unique game. it partly reminded me of the movie CUBE. for a linear game, the most common path is not the right one. exploring the levels is interesting and very mysterious that you want to keep looking around. even when its gray and dark, it still creats an interesting atmosphere that keeps you questioning where you are and some weird, yet not to hard to solve puzzles. you will be amazed by its architecture that you will stand to look around. especially when you are in an huge hall.what i think was missing is an explanation where you are. all you know is that you play a female named lucy and thats all you get. no hints what so ever about where you are or why she is there in the first place. there are some frustrating platform moments (which obviously has been fixed with an patch that was released a day later after i passed it) that was leading me to countless deaths. the ending on the other hand is rather frustrating. i dont want to spoil it, but the reaction you will have would be a big questional ""WHAT???""never the less, it was a fun game and i cna recommend it to anyone who likes to play a game that doesnt require you to kill anything and be lost in an unique environment.

												I do recommend this game but only to those who like surreal & abstract environments and don't care that much about gameplay itself as this game doesn't have it (for most of the time). It's just a journey through an empty but atmospheric world. Interaction is minimal but I'm cool with it. If you liked Kairo than think: Kairo without puzzles and here you go - NaissanceE. If you prefer to solve puzzles than skip this one, you will only find few and they don't even require too much thinking.If I was to compare this game to something outside game world I would say ""Blame!"" (comic book) without all the creatures.Was it worth my time? Definitely, it met my expectations although the game has potential to be something more.Pros:- vast abstract world- general vibe- music- graphicsCons:- not enough interaction (if you care about it)- few puzzles which are way too simple			"

												I really liked this game, feel it has been forgotten about right after release, why I felt I needed to write something about it… it has epic art direction, felt like a massive structure like black mesa or aperture just without humans living in it. Wish this game had a screen savor that would just fly around the levels. To be fair I’m a bit biased working in lighting. I really wish I could set up a lawn chair in this world and just hang out.

												Having a hard time rating this game, but in the end I have a harder time recommending it than not. Also, I have a hard time figuring how its pricetag is considered justifiable at $15. Seems like games of its ilk go for about $9.99. Value proposition is real I'm sad to say and, TO ME, this game is maybe worth $5-$8 to take a gamble on.NaissanceE has a very interesting visual style - its landscape is striking and has enough unique pieces to keep locations feeling fresh. I also have to give the nod to sound design, where it largely feels amorphous and evokes a sense of unease & foreboding. Sounds feel like they belong and have a purpose, without sounding like a recognizable variation of things more based in our world (i.e. boring reality :-p). The visual and aural experience is a pretty a cool and well rounded one. However, there are issues with the lighting sometimes proving to be too finicky. This basically happens during the more difficult platforming bits - almost always a bad idea in a 3D game - where you only have a couple of chances to succeed. After a handful of failures they dumb it down and pull out the equivalent to bowling-lane bumpers by decreasing gap sizes and such so that you can continue. I like that they have a way for you to move on, but this seems an inelegant way to do so. I have no problems if things like this occur when it feels like a failing of me or my abilities, but this feels like they recognize certain sections didn't work well and this was their concession - their patchwork solution. Other times you'll just be stuck trying to get past a section. I prefer this over the lessening of difficulty, though certain sections are just overly difficult when you are worrying about finicky 3D platforming while wrestling with darkness. Perhaps a better crutch would be for light to slowly increase as players continue to fail, giving them a chance to use pure skill to continue. Seems like there are more than a few platforms (or whole areas even) somewhat unfairly hidden in shadow. Or times when a light source decides it's going to run away after you've activated it, which might as well be a fail state rather than letting you bump along in perpetual darkness. Perhaps it is just me, perhaps I do just suck, but this is just how it seems in my (admittedly) short time with the game. The senses are certainly entertained with the games visual and aural flair, but the patience is tested a bit too much and feels like successes are further out of your control than they are within. I'll have a hard time coming back to this game.			"

												Superb atmosphere build by scale, lighting and music. There are some annoying platforming sequences i can look over because i had to actually use my brain to solve some puzzles. By that i don't mean the usual 3d puzzling like in portal where you learn mechanics and rules and how to apply those. There is some out of the box thinking involved. Played it at a friends, had to buy it aswell. Like a weird french movie but a game!			"

It's a very particular and specific experience that isn't for everybody, again. It worked for me, and I have to say it's one of the most interesting games I've ever played. I will note as well, though, that the world in this game is VERY massive (and it's not particularly open either, the game operates on a linear path for the most part with certain areas offering some little hidden areas to check out), and that means, that to experience the world in a way that makes sense, the game requires you to be VERY patient at times. If you've ever played the game Journey there are a lot of sections in this game that feel like the last few minutes of the snowstorm in that game. "

												Long version: Some parts took me a couple of tries to figure out, but eventually even I completed the game. I don't consider myself an amazing gamer or anything like that, but i felt this game was challenging enough for the average gamer to complete.I don't think the game was ment to be a purely exploration based game (probably why the game is getting any negativity at all since it was labled as one). Otherwise why would they even include death as a response to going the wrong way or making a huge mistake? The trial and error, the easter eggs and hidden dead ends... The fact that the only way to get a story, or rather an idea as to what is going on, is through extrapulating what the environment shows you, makes the game that much more compelling. yes you could add things to make it easier, but that doesn't always make a game better. The satisfaction of completion well outweighed the learning curve the game presented.Short version: I don't believe this game is for everyone, but i do believe anyone who can understand it's basic mechanics can complete it. Kind of like an easier platformer version of the dark souls series, the challenge and reward of figuring it all out yourself is just apart of it.			"

												This game isn't for everyone. If you're the kind of person who enjoys being psychologically tested and don't mind being disoriented then you may enjoy the short trip this game provides. It never holds your hand. It just drops you in media res and leaves the rest up to you to figure out. I believe there's a lot of meaning in this game but its up to each person to figure out for themselves. This game stimulated my aesthtic significantly and there were two moments that I had goosebumps.

												NaissanceE is perhaps not that much of a good game. However if you understand it as a standard game, you'll probably never enjoy it as a breathtaking experience which it really has to offer. No need describing the reality of NaissancE like other reviews do, simply watch the trailer and if you find the atmosphere captivating, then you can probably expect even more - the feelings range from lonesome awe to sudden pressure, gently curving into architecture of insanity. I always wanted to run in dehumanized megalomaniac structures and NaissanceE has provided me with such an experience.			"

												One of the strangest games I've ever played. It's like a darker version of Antichamber, but with less puzzles and MUCH more walking.Graphics: At first I loved the style, but it got old pretty quickly. It honestly felt unfinished in some parts, but that might have a bit to do with the level design as well. Everywhere you go, it's some form of gray, black, or white. Occasionally you'll get the odd dull orange or dark red, but it's monochromatic for the most part. Other than the boring textures, it ran very well and I always found myself impressed with the scale of the environments I was placed in. Which leads me to...Level Design: This is both the best and worst aspect of the game. First of all, I was blown away by how large everything was, and how there were very few loading screens. If you could see a bright point really far off on the horizon, or on a wall somewhere across the huge room, you can probably get there eventually. I remember this sequence where I was decending down this huge city-like area for almost thirty minutes, and it just kept going. On the other side of things, the levels were so erratic and confusing that I often found myself lost among the various gray rooms and corridors. Some areas had lights to designate points of interest, but others left the goal in the dark and I would pass over it numerous times. This is where the game feels unfinished to me. I feel like it needs a bit more polish, a bit of editing, and more specific playtesting in order to iron out those spots that confuse the player. Story: There really isn't one. You walk until you can't walk anymore, and it lasts about 4 hours.Gameplay: Again, nothing too interesting other than just walking and using light to your advantage. There are a couple mechanics involving certain blocks that disappear/reappear depending on where you orient the light, but those are introduced early on and rarely utilized in the rest of the game. There are plenty of puzzles that play with your perception of reality, which can be interesting. One other gameplay mechanic which I'm not too happy with is the need to ""breathe"" while you sprint. This means pressing a button as you sprint when a circle appears on your screen. It can make the more intense platforming sections a bit harder, but generally it's just annoying to have to push the button when you're running around aimlessly, which is the majority of the time.Overall, this game seems like a way to showcase the crazy things you can do with the Unreal Engine, rather than a game you can sit down and enjoy in terms of gameplay. It's fun to watch the environments and explore, but sometimes it can be frustrating with the clunky controls and confusing level design. I enjoyed it, for the most part, and I'm glad it was as short as it was. If it were any longer, I would've gotten sick of it. 7/10			"

												In general, the atmosphere and art of this game is astoundingly good.It's a shame the gameplay ranges from pretty decent at best to mediocre and, at a few points, outright terrible.The breathing mechanic, I like. It adds a layer to the gameplay that's just a simple thing to manage while you do other platforming stuff. It never really gets in the way.Each chapter is kind of its own thing, chapter 1 does a lot of vision-based puzzles, chapter 2 is descending a massive area and might be almost half the game's length by itself, chapter 3 has some really tightrope-y platforming going on, chapter 4 is... special, though one of its segments is easily the worst moment of the game. Chapters 5 and 6... basically don't exist, and chapter 7 is a kind of annoying ""final boss"" sort of thing-y. The general vibe of the game is a 3D platforming and kind of walking-simulator-but-not-really and there's some puzzles along the way.There's a bit too much of nothing happening and a fair number of weird/awkward platforming segments, especially the really awful one in chapter 4. But the game's gorgeous to look at, the atmosphere is great, and there's a constant sense of unease and tension. If you don't mind a bit of annoying gameplay, this is probably worth your time for the experience....just, maybe not at full price, as it's not a particularly long game and there's very little replayability to it.

												Certainly one of the most unsettling games I've played in recent memory. You start the game thrust into what can best be described as a very weird and strangely vacant city with awesome architecture. The devs, Limasse Five, bang on nail a feeling between alien and familiar that kept me simmering at a creeped out foreboding. You can tell from the screens how visually strong the game is, but it's more than worth noting the fantastic sound design. Environmental sound effects carry realistically in huge open spaces and tight air vents alike and the music tracks are licensed from several professional artists that basically make the city feel even more alien, even more threatening and even more awesome at just the right moments. In terms of gameplay, make your way through the city! The story as such is very nondescript and you're basically relying on your own interpretation of your surroundings to create whatever you like in your head. Limasse have said the game is meant to evoke a strong feeling of loneliness and that's very much a realised theme. For the most part, NaissanceE is a fairly challengeless game but certain infrequent sections will test your first person platforming skills. Though in my experience checkpoints during these bits were reasonably well spaced and aren't too much of a barrier.			"

My screenshot button has never had such a workout.If you are a fan of the Portal Series, Qube or Antichamber I can defnitely reccommend this game. While quite light on the puzzle aspects, this game will still get your brain working.My favourite thing about this game though, are the environments. I was constantly amazed at the developer's ability to convey massive scale and distance while still making the space intricately detailed. And all without any textures (that I could see).I definitely reccommend this game.			"

												In short, if you like Blame! - the manga by Tsutomu Nihei - you will find a world filled with similar visuals. It is definately a beautiful game, enhanced by some very awesome ambient music. All of these are taken from existing compositions by three different composers and are used to enhance certain scenes and images. Although they don't form a coherent listening experience, they do enhance the overall mood in a wonderful way.Sadly, the one thing that is lacking is narrative. Not a story in the normal sense, but a form of narrative. Why is Lucy lost? Where is Lucy? And who is she? Who is she running from? The game starts - innocently enough - with three words - Lucy is lost, but sadly it doesn't go anywhere from there. This short sentence is the starting point for aesthetically awesome adventure, that sadly left me a bit cold at the end.The puzzles itself were totally fine with me, even the platforming bits were fine, except for the tunnel level - that one got a bit too annoying in parts.Would I recommed this game? Hell yes! It looks beautiful and has some of the coolest architecture and designs I have seen in a long while!			"

												NaissanceE is not an easy game to review. It is one of these exploration games that a cynic might call walking simulators, but NaissanceE actually has enough gameplay to call it a game. Still, a term that might be even more fitting is tech demo for the UE3.So NaissanceE is sort of a one-man-project from Limasse Five a.k.a. Mavros Sedeño. It seems like Limasse Five wanted to make a 3D game and was able to do the environment and level design, some animation and a bit of programming. But he had absolutely no clue about 3D modeling, texturing and creative writing, so he nearly completely avoided these jobs.Take a look at the screenshots to see what the game looks like. It does have its style and surely it is nice to look at. But while the lighting job was probably quite difficult, the modeling and texturing (or nearly complete lack thereof) still make it seem like not a lot of effort was put into it. However, this may be forgiven if you consider that the game was a one-man-project. The graphics completely rely on the advanced lighting technologies of the UE3, that's why I suggested to call NaisssanceE a tech demo earlier.In terms of gameplay, NaissanceE is a bit like a 3D platformer. Actual puzzles are rare, you just have to keep going. The challenge lies in the fact that you have no objectives and no idea where you are supposed to be going, so you have to explore the area a bit and figure it out.Regarding the context and the storyline, the short answer is that there is none. You may interpret the game however you like it, but NaissanceE does not try to push you in any particular direction.The game lacks some attention to the technical details. When I opened the UE console with the TAB key, it covered two thirds of the screen and would not close. When I called up the Steam overlay, the game crashed. It also does not install silently like most games on Steam do. And a lot of default strings were not replaced, which is just lazy.Also, the distribution of checkpoints is often quite weird. Sometimes it felt like I was systematically not reset to the last checkpoint, but the one before that. This also adds a lot of unnecessary commute to the game if you die often.NaissanceE is not a long game. Even if you take the time to explore, the first runthrough should take about 4-6 hours. A replay could be accomplished in an hour or two, speedruns take about 45 minutes.For a one-man-project, NaissanceE is indeed quite impressive and a nice experience. But if you consider the lack of features most games have and the corresponding lack of effort, 15€ does seem quite a bit pricey. Definitely wait for a sale or reconsider that this a one-man-project.

WOW! One of the best games I have ever played NaissanceE is not just an exploring game. It is so much more.If you want to save time, just read the following...A lot of mystery, awesome level design, perfect atmosphere, not too scary (not classified as horror).HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!If you want more, read the rest...Environment/GraphicsThe environments are absolutely stunning and the word beautiful doesn't even begin to describe the level design. With around 15-20 textures in the entire game, it still has the top of the line graphics. The lighting is what makes each scene particularly breath taking (that is a pun, just wait..). The levels contain platforms and other structures made of very simple geometry like cubes and rectangular prisms. The awesome part is how complex each structure is with its detail to make your mind create assumptions to what is is or could be.AtmosphereLet me define a term..Atmosphere in a game1. The level of engagement the game has on the player.2. The level of immersion the game has to make the player believe the game is real while playing the game.3. NaissanceEThe atmosphere is so important in games, and NaissanceE got it right. Music fits into every moment and may be deceiving at times. Without the music there would be almost no point in the game because it gives you the urge to go forward or stop and take in the scene. It is very well performed and implemented while also being really stylistic and creative.     NaissanceE also features one of the best and most realistic running/breathing systems. It is infinite if you so choose. The breathing is a great feature that throws realism in your face. You may be able to breathe in the game just fine, but remember to breathe in reality (and the pun) because every situation and moment is absolutely breath taking. (it is seriously a problem though, remember to breathe)CharacterThere is not a lot of information given, meaning then that you must be the character. You find out your character is a girl and is named Lucy...              and she is lost. This is told at the very beginning of the game so I wouldn't call it a spoiler. The voice acting is amazing for Lucy, even though it is only grunts and gasps and crying in pain, it is still well done.Level DesignI already ranted about the amazingness of the levels and their detail (just look at the trailer to get my point), but as far as progression goes, it is a bit different. The game has a puzzles brilliantly planned out and difficult but passable. The utilities used in the puzzles aren't explained but I wouldn't count that as a negative because when you figure it out, you get the amazing feeling of ""did I just do that? YEAH I DID!"" {happy dance}.     The puzzles and levels are typically utilizing light, which is really fascinating. There are moments that are normal and others that are super bright or super dark each having ways so you can still continue.     NaissanceE also stays consistent with the overall confusion. You have no idea where you are or where you are going (the exploration piece) and sometimes you get stuff thrown at your face (figuratively and literally) that you just don't know how to handle. As the game progresses you will gain more of an idea of what you should do and how to solve each puzzle.Final ThoughtsI am truly glad I bought this game. It may be $15, but with so much effort put into each aspect of the game, it is well worth it and the developers deserve every penny. As far as length goes, you'll be looking at about a minimum of 3 hours, short but packed. I would love to spoil the whole game for everyone to share my experience, but that ruins the point. Don't hesitate to buy NaissanceE (unless you want a discount) and watch the trailers, they give a great look inside what it has to offer.     As a final rant, let me take you through my thoughts while playing.          You get in the game, with a little expectation. You hesitate to progress because of what other games have thrown your way. But you march on, because it is so interesting and each thing is so delicately placed that you expect everything and nothing. Every doorway has another secret that is calling your name			"

												If you are looking for something truly different from the usual - whether that's 'kill 'em all' fps or manic 2d platform - this game is worth your attention. I love my immersive fps games like Alien Isolation, Stalker, BioShock, Metro etc., but was getting a bit bored of the all to similar linear game path which eventually reveals itself (Alien Isolation being the exception there as the alien AI is fiercely adaptable and challenging). A search on the web for new and innovative games led me to this wonderfully dark, dystopian and beautifully imagined and rendered brutalist world. Nothing to shoot. But death is always just a misstep or miscalculation way. Explore the foreboding majesty that is NaissainceE. P.S. IMO, SO much better than Kairo,  a very distant runner up in similar style; No competition where music and graphics are concerned.			"

												The game is very minimal. No textures. No plot. No world interaction. Just some simple gemeotry and lights. I got nuasiated after an hour of playing. That feeling comes from playing a game that's going nowhere. I started the game, I followed a light. Then I followed some more lights. Then some more lights. Then some platforming and some more lights. It just isn't what I'm in to, but I can see how others would find it enjoyable (which is why I didn't give this a thumbs down). If you're in to 3D puzzle platformer type game, you'll likely enjoy this game. One minor (but irritating) issue I did notice: The game pauses while it loads some sections as you're walking. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, expect that this game has literally 0 resources other than simple geometry and lights. There are no textures (everything is ♥♥♥♥ing white), no npcs, no dialog, and no world interaction.			"

												This is one of my favorite games. The atmosphere is tense and foreboding, and the exploration, while linear, is truly epic and surreal. It's full of haunting mystery, and its got one of the best sound tracks for a game that i can think of. there isn't a ""story"", but there are some clues as to what kind of world you are in. you are stuck in some ancient futuristic structure, and everything you encounter seems to defy reality. definitely would recommend.Pros+ Amazing orchestral soundtrack+Jaw-dropping and abstract vistas+Haunting and tense atmosphere+Is oculus compatible (tho i haven't tried it, but i can safely say that it would be perfect for oculus)Cons-some platforming/running sequences that you'll have to repeat at least a few times towards the later parts of the game-some seriously flashy parts that could give some problems for people with epilepsy			"

You will never hear a fairy yell ""hey, listen!"", you will most certainly not be given a map, the game certainly can't be bothered to warn you when you are about to die.  NaissanceE is immense beyond imagination, and I get the impression that I can only clambor around its cracks because it hasn't noticed yet.  NaissanceE is a punishing environment and you will die.

												Ok, this game has three or maybe even four platforming stretches that are most definitely (don't even attempt to argue) too hard. It should not take an experienced first person gamer 15 or even more tries before getting past something (five is usually enough ;). I can't imagine somebody who just picked up their first FP game finishing this. On the other hand, it's almost as if the developers did this because they were ashamed of how superior to all other surreal makeupyourownstory games (or even films) their creation is. Other than those misunderstandings with difficulty, it is beyond description and beyond good. Words can't do it justice. It's hard to believe there are people who can make something like this and remain completely unknown to pretty much everybody. All in all, there are great games like Portal 2 or Talos Principle, and there are masterpieces like this one. You may love it or you may hate it, - in any case, it's timeless.EDIT: watching Youtube videos for the ending I realised that developers did try to reduce difficulty by adding considerable amount of new checkpoints. It DID NOT help. For the second day straight I can not get past last (or second to last) checkpoint although I think I nail a much better run at it than those on youtube (with an older version of the game). I simply have no idea why while having such a groundbreaking product devs decided to commit a near suicide by introducing those few extremely difficult stretches. Gamers are not you, people! This is a maxim no 1 of software development - ""DON'T EVER JUDGE THE PRODUCT BASED ONLY ON YOUR PERSONAL IMPRESSIONS (unless you are developing a tool for yourself)"". Sorry for shouting.			"

I'm impressed by the author's ability to produce an intriguing first person game with extremely simple control mechanics. Run, jump, fall, and DIE...And you will die many times in this game, which can break the rhythm in immersion at times.This game is about the journey and not the destination.

												This is one of those games where a ""maybe"" option is warranted. Pay in mind that I have only played the first chapter, where I decided that the game wasn't really worth my time. I just didn't have fun. Why? Here's why.Firstly, I wouldn't recommend playing this on a laptop. I don't know if it's a part of the game or not, but I had some input lag that drove me absolutely insane. This is a first person game and there are some jumping parts, which made me fall over and over again at places I shouldn't have. Since there is also a part where there is a timing aspect... well, it wasn't enjoyable. Looking around with the mouse also felt floaty and therefore frustrating. As previously mentioned, this might be because I played on a laptop, but it might be worth considering nontheless.Secondly, the theme of the game is about light and shadows. The problem, in my opinion, is that the dark sections are pitch black. If you're not looking where you're supposed to, this is really disorientating, and finding the right paths can feel a bit random. However, this does add a challenging aspect to the game, which some might love. It is very stylistic and has a very distinct ambience. The music, the dark and the tight spaces does make it feel very uncomfortable and quite creepy at times, which is more of a plus than a minus. There are some intriguing things happening as well, if you can get to them.This game was very frustrating to me and I felt that it was a bit too random. Based on this I wouldn't recommend it. But if you like being challenged by hidden paths and if you don't mind being lost and fighting through some less satisfying mechanics, do give it a try. For me, it's a no.			"

												This game is so very aesthetically pleasing. I loved every moment I spent in this game. Just running around and looking at all the design, detail, shapes and planning that went into creating this world was so pleasing. I was immersed into this world. I loved the breathing aspect as I was running. It made it feel more real. The gameplay was simple and minimalistic, which was wonderful. The puzzles were different enough that I had to stay on my toes to progress, but I never felt like bashing my head into a wall out of frustration with this game. Sure, at times, it was finicky, but I never lost enjoyment from dying too often and not getting anywhere in the game, which I think is hard to do in a game.I really wish the main character you play as spoke during the game. I believe the game is supposed to make you feel isolated in a world where you're the only thing human and living. It would have made a world of difference if my character talked at the beginning of levels, commenting on how it felt to be so alone, how strange and empty this vast, beautiful world was. I wanted someone to empathize with. I think that was the biggest drawback to this game. I still loved playing it, though, and will recommend it to all my gaming friends.			"

												This game, despite having no explicit plot besides ""Lucy is lost"", could well be my favourite. I have never played another game with an setting as great as this - a sci-fi minimalist, somewhat brutalist (underground?) complex. The architecural style is right out of the best sci-fi films, and is lovely. And the music is outstanding as well. The game actually brings the player on a journey and you experience so many emotions... It's transcendes plot. I got it on sale, and honestly, I believe that it is underpriced at 22 $. But watch out, there are no hints, and, partly because of the open nature of the environment, it is really easy to get lost and spend half an hour doing the wrong thing... It remindes me a bit of 2001, but with less explicitness...The good: -Probably the best setting of any gameThe bad: -Can be very challenging 95/100.			"

												If there's one thing this game does well it's to provoke your imagination to create an awe inspiring and ""epic"" game experience. You'll find yourself alone in an impressive futuristic structure of some sort, uncertain if it is of human or alien origin, or consists of something more abstract than matter entirely. I think the most illustrative example of what you're getting into with this game is this: I'm still not sure whether or not I managed to make it outside of the game's normally playable bounds. I took every opportunity I saw to attempt reaching areas that I didn't think I should be able to reach. And, every time I did make it to a new area, I found myself questioning whether or not I had succeeded. Was I skipping part of the level? Was the part of the structure I was currently exploring meant to be for visuals only, or had the game developers intended to allow the player to wander freely in this area?The difficulty of puzzles and the frequency of checkpoints felt perfect, and the few challenging action-y/platformer-y parts of the game didn't frustrate me in the slightest.

												The aesthetic of the game looked cool to me, but unfortunately there's not much ""game"" here. It's basically a giant set piece. There's a few token puzzles, but it mostly plays like a giant walk-through without very clear direction. I found myself wishing there were checkpoints, collectibles, some sort of progression, narrative, anything. It just feels aimless. And moving from place to place can take a long time; there was one point I think i went down about 5 stories of stairs that seemed like carbon copies copy-pasted on top of each other.The controls are very basic and not very precise, which is fine if the rest of the at-your-own-pace exploration game is excellent, but it ends up being a front-of-mind inconvenience when mechanics are what I naturally focus on without objectives or story.I ended up motion-sick playing the game, which I've played through for other games I really enjoy, but this was not really worth it. I thought this game might be Antichamber-like, but I've found the interesting art direction has nothing nearly so worthwhile to back it up.			"

												A surreal game that only teaches you how to move in the beginning and that's it. No hand holding and no obvious markers on where to go. The protagonist is female but beyond her breathing when running or fall damage, they don't say anything, you make up your mind on what's going on. There are plenty of puzzles and false traps/rooms/paths to get into. It makes you think, all while being in a very pleasing aestheitic.On the arbitrary rating system I give a 9/10This is solely on the fact that there is a small sequence where it is very intense with the lighting and would be a very serious problem to anyone who is epilleptic, I got a little light headed myself.

												A walking/exploring game with absolutely zero plot or story, just you navigating your way through a massively huge area trying to figure out where to go next.The game world is rather impressive if drab in color. I don't think there's a single texture used anywhere in the game which probably allowed the developer to create massive areas and have it be viewable to the player without causing a video card meltdown.The game is mostly exploring with a few light based puzzles scattered throughout. The light/dark dynamic is interesting but definitely do not play the game if you're prone to issues due to flashing lights.It's designed to be played via keyboard and mouse but does support the xbox 360 PC controller though it's a bit clunky in it's implementation (walked off a ledge more than once after I tried to stop moving) and the game interface is clunky too.If you like this sort of game, it's a good buy, but maybe when it's on sale.

												CON: No story. That is the only gripe which can be had for this under hyper-critical pretenses. You wander from one puzzle dungeon to the next and then the end appears. I absolutely love the artistic, aesthetic quality of this game. An interactive form of art, really. From the music, to the visual displays, to the level designs, everything about this game has placed me in a position to give this a positive review. On more than one occasion I've started up this game with absolutely no purpose in mind than to just chill out in some niche area that I find wonderfull. Wether I'm getting ready for bed and just want to sit around in a calm desert scene, or if I just want to feel an eerie dread and wander dark hallways, this game allows me to do that. I remember one time, I got lost on one of the levels. I was looking for a way around some long, windy corridors, and I found a set of stairs which seemed to be heading in a promising direction in relation to a mental map I had projected for myself based on reasonable conjectures from studying the architecture so far. After about fifty flight of stairs, and without seeing a single exit thus so far, I decided that that wasn't the way to my destination-to any destination, it seemed-and so I booked it back up the fifty flight of stairs. But after seventy flights up, I realized that I was trapped in some kind of schrodinger stairwell... forever. After frantically scouring the near walls for a crack or crevice that would reveal an escape, I soon conceded to my fate and crawled up into a ball in the corner of one of the levels to this infinite stairwell and gave up. I turned off the game and went to bed, somewhat satisfied with the entire, surreal experience of it all.There are many experiences like this in this game, however most aren't as disheartening as that previous recount, but they are, all of them, enjoyable and refreshing experiences, nonetheless.

												At its heart, NaissanceE is intended not for those who want to experience a ""game"", but rather the ambient darkness a la Tsutomo Nihei's BLAME!, perhaps coupled with Piranesi's ""Carceri"". The experience you have is manifold, and compares well to Kairo (another game in a similar vein available on Steam). Where NaissanceE is pseudo-linear exploration and the accidental occlusion of puzzles - they sort of show up, rather than being presented to you as in Kairo - the atmosphere is much more pronounced here. NaissanceE reveals a measure of spectral light, causing movement to be rare and the interplay of light and shadow quite spectacular. If you can deal with and enjoy a game that can be quite difficult in its platforming aspects (moreso than Kairo) but rewards you with the visual splendor that Pauline Oliveros' ""Deep Listening"" album evoked aurally - monolithic devices and structures rising from the gloom of nothingness, with a rather haunting ambient feel - definitely pick this up.This is Danielewski's ""House of Leaves"" in visual form. Where does form define itself if not within the darkness of our own eyes?			"

												The game is very minimal. No textures. No plot. No world interaction. Just some simple gemeotry and lights. I got nuasiated after an hour of playing. That feeling comes from playing a game that's going nowhere. I started the game, I followed a light. Then I followed some more lights. Then some more lights. Then some platforming and some more lights. It just isn't what I'm in to, but I can see how others would find it enjoyable (which is why I didn't give this a thumbs down). If you're in to 3D puzzle platformer type game, you'll likely enjoy this game. One minor (but irritating) issue I did notice: The game pauses while it loads some sections as you're walking. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, expect that this game has literally 0 resources other than simple geometry and lights. There are no textures (everything is ♥♥♥♥ing white), no npcs, no dialog, and no world interaction.			"

												Don't be fooled by the look. Looks absolutely amazing as long as there is light ... and there are lots of parts where there is not a lot of it. But the worst part are those annoying platfoming sections ... and there will be a lot of them ... was expecting some decent puzzles but in over 3 hours of playtime I encountered a single one where I had to use more than half a braincell. And OMFG the breathing and dying sounds ... completely destroy every little bit of immersion that is building up.Terrible waste of a very cool artstyle. Don't waste your time and money. "

												In general, the atmosphere and art of this game is astoundingly good.It's a shame the gameplay ranges from pretty decent at best to mediocre and, at a few points, outright terrible.The breathing mechanic, I like. It adds a layer to the gameplay that's just a simple thing to manage while you do other platforming stuff. It never really gets in the way.Each chapter is kind of its own thing, chapter 1 does a lot of vision-based puzzles, chapter 2 is descending a massive area and might be almost half the game's length by itself, chapter 3 has some really tightrope-y platforming going on, chapter 4 is... special, though one of its segments is easily the worst moment of the game. Chapters 5 and 6... basically don't exist, and chapter 7 is a kind of annoying ""final boss"" sort of thing-y. The general vibe of the game is a 3D platforming and kind of walking-simulator-but-not-really and there's some puzzles along the way.There's a bit too much of nothing happening and a fair number of weird/awkward platforming segments, especially the really awful one in chapter 4. But the game's gorgeous to look at, the atmosphere is great, and there's a constant sense of unease and tension. If you don't mind a bit of annoying gameplay, this is probably worth your time for the experience....just, maybe not at full price, as it's not a particularly long game and there's very little replayability to it.

												One of the strangest games I've ever played. It's like a darker version of Antichamber, but with less puzzles and MUCH more walking.Graphics: At first I loved the style, but it got old pretty quickly. It honestly felt unfinished in some parts, but that might have a bit to do with the level design as well. Everywhere you go, it's some form of gray, black, or white. Occasionally you'll get the odd dull orange or dark red, but it's monochromatic for the most part. Other than the boring textures, it ran very well and I always found myself impressed with the scale of the environments I was placed in. Which leads me to...Level Design: This is both the best and worst aspect of the game. First of all, I was blown away by how large everything was, and how there were very few loading screens. If you could see a bright point really far off on the horizon, or on a wall somewhere across the huge room, you can probably get there eventually. I remember this sequence where I was decending down this huge city-like area for almost thirty minutes, and it just kept going. On the other side of things, the levels were so erratic and confusing that I often found myself lost among the various gray rooms and corridors. Some areas had lights to designate points of interest, but others left the goal in the dark and I would pass over it numerous times. This is where the game feels unfinished to me. I feel like it needs a bit more polish, a bit of editing, and more specific playtesting in order to iron out those spots that confuse the player. Story: There really isn't one. You walk until you can't walk anymore, and it lasts about 4 hours.Gameplay: Again, nothing too interesting other than just walking and using light to your advantage. There are a couple mechanics involving certain blocks that disappear/reappear depending on where you orient the light, but those are introduced early on and rarely utilized in the rest of the game. There are plenty of puzzles that play with your perception of reality, which can be interesting. One other gameplay mechanic which I'm not too happy with is the need to ""breathe"" while you sprint. This means pressing a button as you sprint when a circle appears on your screen. It can make the more intense platforming sections a bit harder, but generally it's just annoying to have to push the button when you're running around aimlessly, which is the majority of the time.Overall, this game seems like a way to showcase the crazy things you can do with the Unreal Engine, rather than a game you can sit down and enjoy in terms of gameplay. It's fun to watch the environments and explore, but sometimes it can be frustrating with the clunky controls and confusing level design. I enjoyed it, for the most part, and I'm glad it was as short as it was. If it were any longer, I would've gotten sick of it. 7/10			"

While quite light on the puzzle aspects, this game will still get your brain working.My favourite thing about this game though, are the environments. I was constantly amazed at the developer's ability to convey massive scale and distance while still making the space intricately detailed.

												I've really debated whether to give this one a thumbs up or a thumbs down. The architecture is breathtaking; i've never seen anything like it. Unfortunately, the ""puzzles"" are so insanely frustrating that every moment of awe and wonder is immediately destroyed when you spend the next 20 minutes falling off disappearing platforms, missing jumps or running round in circles trying to find an unmarked spot that triggers an elevator. Be aware, this is not a game like Mirror's Edge or Lemma where you can see your body and grab onto ledges and enjoy the flow of parkour. This is an oldskool trial-and-error precision platformer where you jump around like a demented Quake Guy without any feet. And it's a crying shame because it has the potential to be one of the best damn walking simulators ever made. The scenery is just awesome. The music is atmospheric. The lighting is bold and fabulously alien. The second level is truly epic and brings the wildest megastructures from classic science fiction to life. Alas, i can only imagine how much more it has to offer, because after falling off a rotating crankshaft festooned with blades for the ten billionth time at the beginning of the third level i gave up.

												This game isn't for everybody. All I can really say is, if the description on the store page sounds ""right"" to you, like it makes sense, then buy this game. You won't be disappointed. It's a very particular and specific experience that isn't for everybody, again. It worked for me, and I have to say it's one of the most interesting games I've ever played. I will note as well, though, that the world in this game is VERY massive (and it's not particularly open either, the game operates on a linear path for the most part with certain areas offering some little hidden areas to check out), and that means, that to experience the world in a way that makes sense, the game requires you to be VERY patient at times. If you've ever played the game Journey there are a lot of sections in this game that feel like the last few minutes of the snowstorm in that game. "

												Certainly one of the most unsettling games I've played in recent memory. You start the game thrust into what can best be described as a very weird and strangely vacant city with awesome architecture. The devs, Limasse Five, bang on nail a feeling between alien and familiar that kept me simmering at a creeped out foreboding. You can tell from the screens how visually strong the game is, but it's more than worth noting the fantastic sound design. Environmental sound effects carry realistically in huge open spaces and tight air vents alike and the music tracks are licensed from several professional artists that basically make the city feel even more alien, even more threatening and even more awesome at just the right moments. In terms of gameplay, make your way through the city! The story as such is very nondescript and you're basically relying on your own interpretation of your surroundings to create whatever you like in your head. Limasse have said the game is meant to evoke a strong feeling of loneliness and that's very much a realised theme. For the most part, NaissanceE is a fairly challengeless game but certain infrequent sections will test your first person platforming skills. Though in my experience checkpoints during these bits were reasonably well spaced and aren't too much of a barrier.			"

												NaissancE is very, very good at providing a large open world to explore, with nice little puzzles and trials involving trying to find the proper way forward, but the problem is that it hooks you in, makes you start to interpret its minimalist geometric bits into cities and spaceships and machines, and even goes so far as to make you'll escape - wherever you are - and then leaves you with absolutely jack effin' squat as a result. You climb these huge stairs, and I mean huge, music swells, the light is bright and beautiful, and then you look up and the sky is the same as ever. You will never find meaning or answers here, though you'll look for them throughout the entire game.			"

												This is one of the coolest 3D platform/puzzle games I've ever played. The atmosphere is absolutely stunning despite its minimal use of colors and textures - in fact, this contributes to the unique, bleak yet stunning and haunting style. I so badly want to talk about the genius of the environments but to do so would give away the element of discovery of the game. It is impossible to talk about any one part of the game without giving away some of the mystery. I do have to say that if you have any serious fear of heights or the dark/claustrophobia- this game is probably not a game you should play. Otherwise, this is absolutely worth the $15.			"

												The aesthetic of the game looked cool to me, but unfortunately there's not much ""game"" here. It's basically a giant set piece. There's a few token puzzles, but it mostly plays like a giant walk-through without very clear direction. I found myself wishing there were checkpoints, collectibles, some sort of progression, narrative, anything. It just feels aimless. And moving from place to place can take a long time; there was one point I think i went down about 5 stories of stairs that seemed like carbon copies copy-pasted on top of each other.The controls are very basic and not very precise, which is fine if the rest of the at-your-own-pace exploration game is excellent, but it ends up being a front-of-mind inconvenience when mechanics are what I naturally focus on without objectives or story.I ended up motion-sick playing the game, which I've played through for other games I really enjoy, but this was not really worth it. I thought this game might be Antichamber-like, but I've found the interesting art direction has nothing nearly so worthwhile to back it up.			"

												I've played many of these abstract exploration games, but this one was by far my favorite. The way the game manages to present game mechanics and a narrative, all purely using visual cues, is quite impressive. The game also never got frustrating or overly confusing. Maybe I just got lucky, but the longest I ever got stuck for was a couple minutes, which is impressive for a game like this that does absolutely no hand holding. I felt like I was getting lost at times, but the game is well designed and your intuition is almost always right.The main thing you notice at first is the gorgeous and mind bending level design. It managed to impress over and over as the game progresses, by bringing new elements and always evolving.What truly brought this game to the next level though was the soundtrack and audio work. For an indie game, this had an almost blockbuster movie level sound design. It accompanied and augmented the mood of the level, bringing a whole new depth to it.As for the gameplay, each chapter managed to completely spin things around and keep things interesting. Sure, there wasn't much story, but this is definitely a beautiful piece worth experiencing.			"

												Ended too soon/10It's not really a puzzle game, there's only maybe 3 puzzles.  Most of the difficulty is from platforming sections that took me hours but would take a mildly competent chimpanzee only one or two tries, or walking around sections that are too surreal to tell where to go.  And it's a bit too linear to be called exploration.   But the vistas are magnificent and the music fits them perfectly, so I definitely recommend this for that alone.  Just make sure you buy it on sale, the game is really, really short. "

												While some might criticize this game as a ""walking simulator"" (and perhaps there is some merit to that), the atmosphere and execution of this game are, in my mind, simply unparalleled. Eerie, lonely, and mysterious, but consistently beautiful, I can safely say I've never played anything else quite like this, and I'm not sure I ever will. Definitely worth the price.			"

												Whether you like this game or not will be extremely subjective. Some people will love it, some will hate it. While the style, music and overall atmosphere of the game are amazing, and it has significantly more gameplay than would be expected from a walking sim, the game can get frustrating at times, and what is there may just not be what floats your boat.First off, the style is amazing. The world looks incredible and eerie, rarely straying from a monochrome colour palate, which gives the world a strong surreal, alien quality. Add to that a soundtrack that alternates between beautiful and tense and you have a game with an atmosphere few games hope to achieve. This atmosphere IS the game, it's the star attraction and if it's not you're thing you aren't going to like the game.Another important thing to note is that, while this isn't a horror game, it feels like one at times. It can make you feel very, very uncomfortable, and while you are rarely in danger, the game makes you feel as if you're being stalked by... something.The story is threadbare in the traditional sense of the word. You are a girl lost in a world that clearly isn't your own. You're running away from something. This is all that is obvious, although the world itself does a decent job of telling a story of its own.Finally, I feel that, unlike other Walking Sims like Gone Home or Mirror Moon EP, it is completely justified to call this a game. The gameplay is a combination of first person platforming, that rarely becomes irritating, and a few atandars puzzles. However, despite the added gameplay over other similar titles, I can't stress enough that it is the atmosphere that makes NaissanceE. The eerie feeling of being alone in a world that may or may not be hostile is incredible. The best example I can think of is, if you have played and enjoyed a game like Riven, and it was the atmosphere that really got to you, you will probably enjoy NaissanceE. If not, look elsewhere.

												Having a hard time rating this game, but in the end I have a harder time recommending it than not. Also, I have a hard time figuring how its pricetag is considered justifiable at $15. Seems like games of its ilk go for about $9.99. Value proposition is real I'm sad to say and, TO ME, this game is maybe worth $5-$8 to take a gamble on.NaissanceE has a very interesting visual style - its landscape is striking and has enough unique pieces to keep locations feeling fresh. I also have to give the nod to sound design, where it largely feels amorphous and evokes a sense of unease & foreboding. Sounds feel like they belong and have a purpose, without sounding like a recognizable variation of things more based in our world (i.e. boring reality :-p). The visual and aural experience is a pretty a cool and well rounded one. However, there are issues with the lighting sometimes proving to be too finicky. This basically happens during the more difficult platforming bits - almost always a bad idea in a 3D game - where you only have a couple of chances to succeed. After a handful of failures they dumb it down and pull out the equivalent to bowling-lane bumpers by decreasing gap sizes and such so that you can continue. I like that they have a way for you to move on, but this seems an inelegant way to do so. I have no problems if things like this occur when it feels like a failing of me or my abilities, but this feels like they recognize certain sections didn't work well and this was their concession - their patchwork solution. Other times you'll just be stuck trying to get past a section. I prefer this over the lessening of difficulty, though certain sections are just overly difficult when you are worrying about finicky 3D platforming while wrestling with darkness. Perhaps a better crutch would be for light to slowly increase as players continue to fail, giving them a chance to use pure skill to continue. Seems like there are more than a few platforms (or whole areas even) somewhat unfairly hidden in shadow. Or times when a light source decides it's going to run away after you've activated it, which might as well be a fail state rather than letting you bump along in perpetual darkness. Perhaps it is just me, perhaps I do just suck, but this is just how it seems in my (admittedly) short time with the game. The senses are certainly entertained with the games visual and aural flair, but the patience is tested a bit too much and feels like successes are further out of your control than they are within. I'll have a hard time coming back to this game.			"

When playing, it gives you the feel that you could go in many diffrent ways even though it is very linear. Some may think of this game as boring because it is described as a ""walking simulator"", but this is my favorite out of all of them. If you have any intrest in the game, I would highly recommend picking up this game.			"

												A surreal game that only teaches you how to move in the beginning and that's it. No hand holding and no obvious markers on where to go. The protagonist is female but beyond her breathing when running or fall damage, they don't say anything, you make up your mind on what's going on. There are plenty of puzzles and false traps/rooms/paths to get into. It makes you think, all while being in a very pleasing aestheitic.On the arbitrary rating system I give a 9/10This is solely on the fact that there is a small sequence where it is very intense with the lighting and would be a very serious problem to anyone who is epilleptic, I got a little light headed myself.

												A walking/exploring game with absolutely zero plot or story, just you navigating your way through a massively huge area trying to figure out where to go next.The game world is rather impressive if drab in color. I don't think there's a single texture used anywhere in the game which probably allowed the developer to create massive areas and have it be viewable to the player without causing a video card meltdown.The game is mostly exploring with a few light based puzzles scattered throughout. The light/dark dynamic is interesting but definitely do not play the game if you're prone to issues due to flashing lights.It's designed to be played via keyboard and mouse but does support the xbox 360 PC controller though it's a bit clunky in it's implementation (walked off a ledge more than once after I tried to stop moving) and the game interface is clunky too.If you like this sort of game, it's a good buy, but maybe when it's on sale.

												CON: No story. That is the only gripe which can be had for this under hyper-critical pretenses. You wander from one puzzle dungeon to the next and then the end appears. I absolutely love the artistic, aesthetic quality of this game. An interactive form of art, really. From the music, to the visual displays, to the level designs, everything about this game has placed me in a position to give this a positive review. On more than one occasion I've started up this game with absolutely no purpose in mind than to just chill out in some niche area that I find wonderfull. Wether I'm getting ready for bed and just want to sit around in a calm desert scene, or if I just want to feel an eerie dread and wander dark hallways, this game allows me to do that. I remember one time, I got lost on one of the levels. I was looking for a way around some long, windy corridors, and I found a set of stairs which seemed to be heading in a promising direction in relation to a mental map I had projected for myself based on reasonable conjectures from studying the architecture so far. After about fifty flight of stairs, and without seeing a single exit thus so far, I decided that that wasn't the way to my destination-to any destination, it seemed-and so I booked it back up the fifty flight of stairs. But after seventy flights up, I realized that I was trapped in some kind of schrodinger stairwell... forever. After frantically scouring the near walls for a crack or crevice that would reveal an escape, I soon conceded to my fate and crawled up into a ball in the corner of one of the levels to this infinite stairwell and gave up. I turned off the game and went to bed, somewhat satisfied with the entire, surreal experience of it all.There are many experiences like this in this game, however most aren't as disheartening as that previous recount, but they are, all of them, enjoyable and refreshing experiences, nonetheless. I full-heartedly endorse this product. This medium of surreal escapism from our reality. And this game. 9.8/10			"

However if you understand it as a standard game, you'll probably never enjoy it as a breathtaking experience which it really has to offer. No need describing the reality of NaissancE like other reviews do, simply watch the trailer and if you find the atmosphere captivating, then you can probably expect even more - the feelings range from lonesome awe to sudden pressure, gently curving into architecture of insanity.

												Long version: Some parts took me a couple of tries to figure out, but eventually even I completed the game. I don't consider myself an amazing gamer or anything like that, but i felt this game was challenging enough for the average gamer to complete.I don't think the game was ment to be a purely exploration based game (probably why the game is getting any negativity at all since it was labled as one). Otherwise why would they even include death as a response to going the wrong way or making a huge mistake? The trial and error, the easter eggs and hidden dead ends... The fact that the only way to get a story, or rather an idea as to what is going on, is through extrapulating what the environment shows you, makes the game that much more compelling. yes you could add things to make it easier, but that doesn't always make a game better. The satisfaction of completion well outweighed the learning curve the game presented.Short version: I don't believe this game is for everyone, but i do believe anyone who can understand it's basic mechanics can complete it. Kind of like an easier platformer version of the dark souls series, the challenge and reward of figuring it all out yourself is just apart of it.			"

												This isn't a game. This is an interactive art. In NaissanceE, you will explore haunting but beautiful world which lacks a sign of life. Sanity even. At first time I played this, I was chilled and amazed its beauty. If you love surreal paintings such as Giorgio de Chirico, this one is for you.			"

												Ended too soon/10It's not really a puzzle game, there's only maybe 3 puzzles.  Most of the difficulty is from platforming sections that took me hours but would take a mildly competent chimpanzee only one or two tries, or walking around sections that are too surreal to tell where to go.  And it's a bit too linear to be called exploration.   But the vistas are magnificent and the music fits them perfectly, so I definitely recommend this for that alone.  Just make sure you buy it on sale, the game is really, really short. "

												While some might criticize this game as a ""walking simulator"" (and perhaps there is some merit to that), the atmosphere and execution of this game are, in my mind, simply unparalleled. Eerie, lonely, and mysterious, but consistently beautiful, I can safely say I've never played anything else quite like this, and I'm not sure I ever will. Definitely worth the price.			"

												What i imagine it would be like being stuck in an asthmatics stress dream.Cool level design and atmosphere,   the click to breath mechanic is a bit random and the game lets itself down when it turns into a speed platformer from time to time.    Still worth picking up if you liked antichamber,  mind path to thalamus  etc			"

												A game with deep atmosphere and nice feeling of isolation, which will try to make you empathize with the protagonist without real story-telling.There are some puzzles sprinkled in as well, but you will probably only care for the environment and exploration. ;p			"

												I think this game succeeded in what it was trying to do. I absolutely loved the level design, the atmosphere, the music, the gameplay, the environments... This entire game creates a wonderfully unique mood, even among and above games that have a simlar look or feel. I believe that NaissanceE is the best example of this kind of aesthetic and is the most fully realized game with this style of art. I only found one or two of the platforming sections to be a tad clunky, but in my opinion they mostly work. Only thing that didn't work for me in the long run is the breathing mechanic, but I can see why they wanted it in there considering the game is about birth.			"

												NaissanceE sparkles your curiosity at every corner of this dark, mysterious world. It's moody, unique, weird, intriguing, the soundtrack is awesome, fits very well with the atmosphere. The game never lets you down, there is no clichés here, every new place you go, you are always surprised, there is always a new kind of cool experience to be had, the game rewards your exploration in many ways. The is no backstory really, this is focused on gameplay, exploration, mystery, mood. If you ever read any work of Tsutomu Nihei like BLAME! or BIOMEGA, this is a MUST play. NaissanceE is an astonishing experience that I will never forget.			"

												I played this a while ago, but just remembered the experience and want to review. I personally love this 'game', but I honestly put it into my cart on BundleStars just to qualify for a discount since it was the only first person game left to choose from at the time.However, I've played it, and it's been a great experience.NaissanceE is another of these artistic exploration type games, with a focus on environment design over raw features. However..! NaissanceE has sprinting, fall damage and slight character momentum which make you feel less like a rolling camera and more like a human being. That is a fantastic choice, because after a while of immersive play you get the feeling of being an explorer in the landscape.The area types vary through the game, with both low points and high points. Some of the weaker areas were just little platformer rooms, but at least they had puzzles instead of relying on pure jump timing.For me, the game had a clear high point: You come across this city like area, a spacious indoor location with spires and skycrapers. Little rooms resembling bars or apartment stairwells bring your mind into modern Earth to hint that the area is residential.It's probably just done for art, but after a while exploring that section of the game the effect was great, you begin to feel like you're intruding on ruins of someone before you. It felt beautiful but extremely unnerving, a few games have a lost civilisation theme (Elder Scrolls Dwarves, Mass Effect Protheans, Halo Forerunners) so you know how it felt to be there.NaissanceE does have a few downsides however.The price might not be perfect, since even as someone who takes my time I doubt there's enough game time for the cost.There is a UI noise I remember as having extreme bass on it, so loud it made audio clipping in my headphones. Weird.Also the checkpointing is unusual... In some places there are checkpoints every few feet, but in a later area I got caught under some machinery, died and went back literally to the start of the chapter.All in all I enjoyed it. I'd recommend the experience, but just be warned that your experience will vary on your tastes.. If you like art games, surrealism, ghostly environments or first person exploration you'll love this.If you're itching for a shooter or purely puzzle-based game then give it some thought before purchase.

												It is more a walking/running simulator, than a puzzle/platformer. There are some jumping, some puzzling, but for me, it was more about the experience of moving around, enjoying each new scenery. I would have loved for this game to have been  longer and/or more open for exploration. Some of the areas gives a impression of a vast world and the soundtrack only adds to the feeling. I had to lookup the solution to the spiral stairs trap >_<	 "

												While on the surface it can be said that it's no more than an exploration game mixed with some light puzzles, the developer actually managed to create a game that is much more than the sum of all its parts. The scarce story hints, the ever changing environment, the carefully integrated puzzles, as well as the haunting soundtrack, all contribute in creating an unique atmosphere that elevates the game to an experience.  Nihei would be proud.			"

												On sale it's pretty alright. There's very few games that allow you to explore structures of such scale. It's got some easy platforming and simple puzzles, though I'd qualify it as more of a walking simulator. It is quite the spectacle, but I hesitate to recommend something so short and only debatably a game for full price.			"

												This is a beautiful platformer study of space and lighting that would hopefully one day be built upon to become a foundation for a more fully-realized game.NaissanceE juggles a number of curious gameplay mechanics (breathing to run; the treacherousness of light creating challenges in otherwise straightforward locations). What it seems to lack, however, is a sense of purpose. It feels a bit too game-y and poor on detail for an immersive artistic game that would invite us to simply soak up its atmophere—and a bit too loose, directionless and not challenging enough to be gameplay-based. That is not to say that it's bad; but neither is it good. More than anything, it's just lacking in production quality, presentation, and that elusive component that would make it breathtaking rather than just interesting.Like I said before, here's to hoping that discoveries made in NaissanceE will be put to better use someplace else.

												It's hard to say whether I'd recommend this or not. If you're looking for an epic game with story and action and so on, then this isn't for you; but if you're looking to just live an experience that's quite unique then yeah, try it out.The game never gives you any clear indication as to what's happening, why it's happening and what you're supposed to do. You rely purely on your instinct and just get through the game. Most of the challenges are overcomable with some practice, but there are a couple of instances, one in particular, that you will NOT solve without a sneak peak on the internet. Well, you might, but (hint hint) I was playing with really low volume so I had no indication at all that anything I was doing was of any use; it takes no advantage of any mechanic the game has tought you, nor is it something that 'exhausting all possibilities' will lead you to success. But other than that, the game can be tought but fair.There are plenty of sites in this game that are truly unique, you'd have never seen things like them before, nor would you see them in any other game. And the way that the visuals try to tie in with the music is also quite lovely at times.This game is for the curious, and it's nothing I can sell any more without spoiling anything.			"

Pros:+ No hand-holding+ Nice ambient soundtrack+ Often visually striking+ A few good puzzles (not many)Cons:- Annoying first person platforming- Breathing mechanic is irritating and unnecessary- Not much interesting gameplayOveral:NaissancE is mechanically very weak but visually interesting. I think the game would have been better as a pure puzzle game or even as a walking simulator. The poorly implemented action elements just hamper the core experience imo.			"

												Architectural nightmares, flashing lights, excellent musical bits, come together in a thought-provoking art game. If you've ever been in a room-sized modern art installation, imagine that sort of surreal space extended to impossible scale. At times claustrophobic and at other times the opposite, whatever that's called. Some of the skill sections feel a bit out of place, but the full experience was worth the few hangups. Also stairs.

												Amazing game! You will experience every feeling human can have playing this game. Happiness, sadness, feeling weird, confused, lost, like wft is this, omg this have no sense at all... Best to describe maybe to compare a movie or tv series, ""lost"" meets ""the cube"", some areas are simply breathtaking, long walks, or runs, others need intense focus to pass, some are brainteasers, puzzles, alot of them dont make sense. Tell me if you ever seen a way to find exit out of a locked room is following: do nothing, remove hands from your keyboard and mouse and just wait. Door will only then open. Last thing you would think of to do. Well this game does that. Totaly messes with your mind. Its a platformer, puzzle, exploration game, with almost no knowlege of that is happening. For me it was like im in a movie. Takes alot of patience to complete. Dont give up.			"

												Played this years ago and it's still the most interesting game I've ever played. Best played in one go and at night as the longer you play the more you get sucked into its dark and abstract universe.I'm just really sad it's not as known as it should be. More people need to at least try it, it's too beutiful to be ingnored by so many. As an ignorant interloper with no idea what's going on, you feel so spectacularly inferior the whole way through, an aspect I've never felt so strongly before in any other game, which still holds true to this day. And that's coming form someone with more than 300 games in their library alone. And not a single texture was used to achieve this, being minimalistic, which is beyond impressive in my opinion.You shouldn't jump into the game expecting to have fun. It's way more of an experience than it is a game in that sense.			"

												At its heart, NaissanceE is intended not for those who want to experience a ""game"", but rather the ambient darkness a la Tsutomo Nihei's BLAME!, perhaps coupled with Piranesi's ""Carceri"". The experience you have is manifold, and compares well to Kairo (another game in a similar vein available on Steam). Where NaissanceE is pseudo-linear exploration and the accidental occlusion of puzzles - they sort of show up, rather than being presented to you as in Kairo - the atmosphere is much more pronounced here. NaissanceE reveals a measure of spectral light, causing movement to be rare and the interplay of light and shadow quite spectacular. If you can deal with and enjoy a game that can be quite difficult in its platforming aspects (moreso than Kairo) but rewards you with the visual splendor that Pauline Oliveros' ""Deep Listening"" album evoked aurally - monolithic devices and structures rising from the gloom of nothingness, with a rather haunting ambient feel - definitely pick this up.This is Danielewski's ""House of Leaves"" in visual form. Where does form define itself if not within the darkness of our own eyes?			"

												A bizarre journey with no dialogue, no color, and no plot, yet it will keep you interested in its twisting mysterious labrynith.  Calming at times, creepy at other times.  The game nudges you in the direction you are supposed to go without feeling as linear as it is through clever level design.  It's a difficult platformer at times but mostly isn't too hard.I would strongly recommend!  My only real complaint is the enviornment is so dark it is hard to see where you are going.  Gamma settings don't help much.			"

												I expected a dark exploration type game filled with solitude and lonliness. Instead I get a mix of puzzles with platforming and running and jumping and the worst part is you have to remember to breathe every now and then. Some areas are way too dark and if you're too slow to keep up with the light, there's repitition, fall damage, or death waiting for you and that sealed it for me.			"
