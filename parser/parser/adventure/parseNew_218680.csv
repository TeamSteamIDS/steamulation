												What I love about scribblenauts is its creative problem solving and peaceful attitude.Problem: Did the children of the neighborhood land their ball on the old geezer's lawn that won't give it back? Solution: Spawn a gun and kill him! It works!Problem: Nurse being chased by an angry heart?Solution: Spawn a gun and kill it!Problem: Want to contact a manager at the other side of a wall?Solution: Spawn a grenade launcher!Problem: Frozen people encased in ice?Solution: Spawn a flamethrower! Bonus: Watch their life points diminish as you melt/burn away!The thing that bugged me the most and made me sad is the cruelty towards animals. For example, as I visited a restaurant I made friends with a brown recluse spider and a cockroach, petting them and watching their happy little faces light up. Then some evil quest-giving person wanted me to kill them for a pest-control inspection, the nerve! And for a starlite fragment I had to kill my newly made bug friends?! What cruel madness is this!Also while going through the object shards achievements I had to prod a cow?! Shame on you scribblenauts. I hope they will fix those issues in future installments. In the meanwhile I will continue riding my black&red huge supersonic fire-breathing dragon that is immune to damage, while going around helping people and making their lives better (sometimes with the use of supreme firepower).

												It may look like a childish game at first glance, and it indeed may be considered as such. However, I'm 23 years old and I found it quite entertaining. Between two violent games, I just wanted to use my imagination and create my own universe and items; which the game does very well!All in all, the game is repetitive if you don't use your imagination. I'd give it a 8 out of 10.A must-try !			"

												A charming game that expresses the innocent sense of curiosity and imagination of a young child in a way I have rarely seen.If you're not familiar with the Scribblenauts series, they are platformer sandbox puzzle games where you can summon just about any object from the dictionary (with some reasonable exceptions such as copyrighted things, alcohol, and proper nouns) and expect them to interact in a believable way. If you can think of any food, animal, household item, weapon, mythological creature, or vehicle, chances are you can make it appear. We're talking tens of thousands of possibilities. A few surprises can also be summoned, such as a variety of internet memes and special objects, if you can think of them.You can summon objects, or add adjectives to existing objects, to solve puzzles and make all the townspeople happy. Or, you could just screw around for hours summoning gods and beasts and riding them across the world as your epic mounts, or watching them run loose and terrorize the villagers. The puzzles are all ridiculously easy, but difficulty is obviously not the point. Personally, my favorite way to play this game is to think of the most obnoxiously ridiculous solutions to every puzzle. Most puzzles will have a bluntly obvious solution, but you can make hilarity ensue if you can think of something creative. For instance, a guy wanted something to help carve his ice sculpture. I gave him a toenail clipper. Hansel and Gretel needed something to make a trail with through the forest. I gave them thumbtacks. A buzzard wanted something to eat. I gave it a dead baby. A tracking dog needed something that smelled like Santa so he could search for Santa. I summoned Santa.It's an excellent game packed with great humor and content, and it's miles ahead of the Nintendo DS games it was based on. My only complaint is that it got a bit boring after the first few hours, but I fixed that just by taking some breaks and not playing it all on one sitting. But I never once stopped appreciating how wonderful the game is. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to rediscover their inner child, complete with borderline politically incorrect humor, in a way that very few games can provide. (Achievement hunters: getting 100% is very tedious, as you will need to solve over a hundred riddles to acquire the remaining bonus pieces. Usually you will solve some of them on accident throughout normal gameplay if you try to use creative solutions. However, if you ever get bored, you can just look at a FAQ to fully complete the game effortlessly.)			"

												""Write anything, solve everything."" This has been the mantra for Scribblenauts since its creation in 2009, and each new installment comes closer and closer to realising this goal. Scribblenauts Unlimited on Steam has taken the ""write anything"" part to heart, but falters a bit of the ""solve everything"" side of the equation.The Steam Workshop support for this game is quite huge. If you can think of an object that the game doesn't recognise (mostly copyrighted content), then it's possible that someone has either created it for you, or some toying around with the game's impressive object editor will make your dreams a reality. Even better, you can upload your creations for all Steam users to enjoy.As awesome as this is, the gameplay is a tad disappointing. At least, we finally have an explanation for Maxwell's endless search for Starites (the game's MacGuffin). The story acts as a prequel to the series, as Maxwell struggles to retrieve the errant Starites to rescue his sister, Lilly (one of literally dozens of his relatives, all of whom are playable characters), from being turned into stone. This story is quickly forgotten once you start summoning vuvuzuela-playing pink jaguars to fight a winged preposterous black knight riding atop a cowardly telekinetic cybernetic T-rex, with only the occasional interlude reminding you of your main objective.To retrieve the Starites, Maxwell must help people around the game's expansive world with various problems, from helping an up-and-coming rock band gain a fanbase, to helping patients in a hospital with their various ailments. While its nice to have a large amount of different areas to explore, many of which feel alive with various characters mulling about, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was just playing nicer-looking versions of the DS games' title screens. Worse yet, many of the main challenges don't encourage your imagination as often as you think they would.Despite these problems, I would still highly recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played the series before. The visuals are crisp, the sheer amount of objects that can be generated is mind boggling (not counting the extensive Workshop creations), and it's still fun to see how each object and adjective interacts with each object in the world.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros:+ Graphics look amazing, even on low-powered laptops+ Amazing object editor+ ""Write anything"": only limited to your imagination+ Always fun to see object/adjective interactions+ Nice origin story for Maxwell...Cons:- ...but is quickly forgotten while goofing off- Worlds feel like glorified title screens from the DS games- Many challenges limit/stifle creativity			"

												I highly recommend this fun for all ages kinda game. It is like mad libs come to life. You wander around what is basically a 2D open world mad libbing people's issues. Issues like I need something to scare away crows.... well just spawn a zombie or a scarecrow, or an angry hunter, or a gun to do it yourself! There's a lot of unintentional yet intentional fun here. Spawning a zombie to solve one puzzle might chase away other NPCs. Unless you add the adjective, friendly zombie. Its really the interactivity with the world that makes the game such silly fun. Did your zombie make a fire? Well have a firefighter put out that fire. Its a silly fun game that I can imagine would be great for kids. Simple controls that really thrive with a keyboard when you're typing things like 'pretty pink princess.'  There are good area settings too, everywhere from standard city areas like hospitals and a fire station, to more creative areas like Jurassic Park, a haunted house and a castle. Overall, the game is pretty easy. Easy enough that anyone can see it through to the end.			"

												A game with lots of creativity. You control a boy who can turn anything to life by writing it on his notebook. Lots of crazy things to do in this game like shooting down a building with ""Destroyer"", turning a lizard into a Ice Dragon and make him fight a ""Flamethrower Soldier"", building a school underwater, make a health potion and drink it if you are hurt and low on health, add dead as an adjective... Instant death! and more fun and crazy stuff to do. The art design is nice. And lots of variety in characters and customization. Its more like a sandbox game where you can do anything you want. Also has cool story. Its not a game for Everyone though. You might get bored of it quickly if you don't like these kind of games. And...! You can get past most of the game without killing people! Type ""Sleepy"" or ""Sleeping"" as adjective insteed! Had a great time in this game. Will play more.+ Creativity at Its Finest+ Great Art Design+ Lots of Characters and Customization+ Improve Your Spelling Skills! :P+ Good Story+ Makes You Think+ Truely Open World+ Lasts Long- Not for Everyone.

												I am writing this review on behalf of my daughter, who recently completed the game. This is a wonderful game, for children and adults alike. For children, however, there is the added benefit of improving spelling and vocabulary as the child plays through the game. I know this, because my own child's vocabulary and spelling improved during the 140+ hours it took her to complete the game. It is relatively non-violent, that encourages the player to solve problems in creative and imaginative ways. There are often more ways than one to complete a challenge. Message to the developer: please make more follow-ups to this game! I'm aware of Scribblenauts Unmasked, although that game has much more fighting content in it than this one, so less violent solutions are not as viable. If the original dev won't make any more, I encourage anyone with the proper skill set to make more games like this; it's a winning formula that should not be abandoned.			"

Scribblenauts Unlimited is one of my favorite games in the Scribblenauts series. However... this is entirely because of the object creator and character creator.While I AM recommending this game, I feel the need to list a couple major issues I had with it:-The puzzles are much easier and less interesting/creative than the ones in Super Scribblenauts-They got rid of destructable terrain entirely (you can no longer dig/destroy the land like you could in Super Scribblenauts)-The maps are very crowded and there's no sandbox mode like there was in Super ScribblenautsAs you may have noticed, these are all downgrades from the previous Scribblenauts game (Super Scribblenauts), and while these issues do make the game a lot less fun, the new features mostly make up for it.I rate this game a 7.5/10 and recommend getting Super Scribblenauts if you have any of the devices it's available for.

												This game just makes me happy when I play it. It's fun and I laugh a lot while I play it. Do you really need anything else from anything? It's not a difficult game by any stretch as a simple story game of collecting stars to help save somethign from something with a lot of cool/cute art and object making. It lets you use your imagination to create an enormous amount of objects to just drop into the world and play with. Want a monkey? How about a GIANT monkey? You can make one and then ride it. Hilarious notebook? Sure. It will make every NPC that it passes by laugh. Create a Living Garden Gnome riding on a Tiny Goat. You can even create NPCs that will fight with one another, or even jsut play nice. Using adjectives in front of objects makes them even more interesting than they already are.You can save objects you create in your backpack for easy access, you can get objects created by other Steam users in the Workshop with simple in-game menus and a couple clicks. Tons of user created stuff is amazing and hilarious so make sure to spend a good amount of time in the Steam Workshop for this game. This is a Family Friendly game that anyone with a soul should play and enjoy. If you are a ginger, well we know you have no soul, but even YOU would probably be able to find some joy here. It's an easy 100% Achievements game and they just take the time of finishing all the stars mostly and making objects they tell you to. Trading cards as well of course. Fun and hilarious casual game for all ages!NOTE: If you look at the credits and use the Developer's names to create in-game characters they will all appear in the game with some sort of special attribute. One dev NPC has the ability to turn every hat you put on them to spawn wings that you can take and fly with for example. There are a ton of these and it is fun to mess around with. You can view the credits at any time so write down some developer names and experiment in the game. :)			"

Scribblenauts unlimited attempts to build on this formula by addding the feature of editing items already in the game world through adding modifiers. Unlimited also adds the ability to store items in your backpack for later use. All nice features, but altogether clunky as the game loses its charm without the use of a stylus. Having to mouse entirely across the screen to spawn in an item seems like a hassle when the first time around it took hardly any effort to access the notebook. It's still good ol' Scribblenauts, and while I'd take the old level select systems over this ""open world"" approach, Sribblenauts Unlimited is fun play and a creative pastime. 8/10			"

												I think that this game has a great conscept and is fun to play.It's like the original scribblenauts game but you can get unlimited creations. Maxwell and his sister were spoiled kids, their mom and dad were rich. They bought a magic notebook and a globe of the world. The notebook enabled them to create anything they wanted, and the world globe allowed them go to any place they wanted. One day they were out and saw an old man, so went up to him. They gave him a rotten apple, but the old man was a wizard and bespelled Maxwells sister with a curse,  gradually turning her into stone, every day it gets worse. Maxwell  is sent on a quest to save his sister. They learned that Maxwell has to collect various starites, but the only way to obtain a starite is to make people happy.			"

												This is truly a joy and not only because of the game. 5th Cell Media have developed a game that encourages thinking and learning and actually manages to pull something very fun and enjoyable in the process; something I haven't seen since the age of the Spectrum. Undoubtedly a child will find hours of fun trying to come up with wild and crazy adjectives to supplement their boring nouns. Equally they will perhaps try to find a not-so-obvious route to solve a problem, which again is a credit to the developers. Not enough games encourage this kind of learning and thinking while you play a game.			"

												The idea of Scribblenauts Unlimited really appealed to me. Using your own creativity to solve the hundreds and hundreds of puzzles without any limits. Unfortunately once i played a bit i started noticing more and more Scribblenauts isn't as unlimited as it claims to be. Now don't get me wrong Scribblenauts Unlimited is a very fun game and has some nice and creative locations you travel to! It runs really smooth and has almost no loading times at all. But the game is just really limited, often i tried solving puzzles in fun and creative ways and ended up on google asking myself why nothing works, with the dissapointing news you could only choose from a set of solutions the developers already choose. This way the game starts to feel like a chore after a while, just solving the puzzles with the most basic solutions because those are the only ones that work most of the time. Now this wouldn't be that bad if the puzzles would actually be challenging, but since this game is aimed more towards kids the puzzles are often so easy they're just boring. However Scribblenauts has some really nice and fun points aswell, you can costumize your own character and all of the different NPC's. And although the puzzles aren't as free as the game claims them to be, there are still quite a few items in the game to mess around with and you can create literally everything you can think of. The artstyle is unique and fits the game perfectly and the music is really catchy.Yes this game can be fun, especially for kids. And even i enjoyed this game, just not till the end cause it got way to repetitive after a while. Don't buy this and expect to get creative by solving the puzzles, buy this if you like solving basic and easy puzzles, don't mind a bit of repetitivty and enjoy messing around to create fun and original stuff.

												This is a really fun and original game that is easy to lose track of time on. I can't think of many games with gameplay that allows for so much variety, freedom, and creativity. Scribblenauts Unlimited is a good game. On the downside it does not have a whole lot of replay value. you can go back and enjoy it again, but eventually you feel like you have done it all. Ultimately it's a fun game that you will play, beat, and then probably leave alone. It's not a huge downside, not all games can have a whole lot of replay value, sometimes the way the games work does not make it very replayable.			"

												The concept of Scribblenauts is fantastic, and the graphics are awesome, but this game is really let down by how unbelievably easy the ""puzzles"" are. And yes, being creative is half the fun, but if puzzles are as easy as ""oh no a pipe is leaking we need something to catch the water"", or ""my dog is hungry"" then the novelty of something as strange as a pipe leaking into a swimming pool, or dogs eating enormous waffles wears off really quickly. What's more, an alarming number of the problems can literally be solved just by typing the word ""gone"", which takes another level of fun out of it.Everything else about this game is great, and I think it'd be fantastic for teaching kids about spelling and problem solving, but how unbelievably easy it is just ruins it completely for me. A few harder puzzles here and there, even if they were optional, would make this game infinitely more fun.			"

												When I got this game, I thought it was going to be similar to the first game I played on the DS, which I got bored with rather quickly. However, I was surprised at how far this franchise has come and how many hours I lost playing this quaint game. It inspires creativity, gets you thinking outside the box, if you choose, and can be very funny at points. The only downside, in my opinion, is that some of the solutions to some puzzles have a “guess what the dev’s thinking” mentality which, although makes the puzzles more challenging, can get a little annoying. Overall, a great game for people of any age and I recommend it highly.  "

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is not a bad game. It's just not as good as I was hoping it would be. It's put together well, the artstyle is good, the soundtrack is good (I can still hear some of the game's music playing in my head,) and the voice acting (what little of it there is) is good. So where does it fall short, then? A few places actually. Let's start with the big one: the gameplay.The idea is to solve puzzles by conjuring up an object, or by adding an adjective to an existing one. Sounds intriguing, but really you just wind up solving puzzles with the most basic of objects. The whole idea of being able to add adjectives to objects is neat, but it's not really put into play all that much. There are a few instances where you must scare Person X away from Object/Person Y. So you just apply the adjective ""Scary"" to Object/Person Y. Or perhaps something needs wings, so you give it the adjective ""Flying."" Makes sense. But there's only a few puzzles that really make use of adjectives. The large majority of the puzzles can be solved with basic objects, and it just kinda starts to feel as though you're grinding through the game rather than really ""solving"" anything. It just gets rather tedious after a while.Then there's the Steam Workshop. Probably the main reason that the game is called Scribblenauts Unlimited, the way the Workshop works is you can use and in-game Object Editor to create your own objects and submit them to the workshop for the rest of the world to use. Likewise, you can download other people's creations. Now, I personally took one look at the Object Editor and said ""No thanks."" But I'm sure those of you out there who have the blood of Michelangelo or Vincent van Gogh coursing through your veins can imagine and create masterpieces with it. I just didn't feel like taking the time to get used to it.Now as for the Workshop itself. It's kind of...meh. There are some really well made and detailed things in there with their own creative and useful functions...surrounded by Five Nights at Freddy's characters. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike Five Nights at Freddy's. I just dislike seeing it in every. Single. Workshop. However, you can play and enjoy the game without even looking at the Workshop, so I won't base my judgement of the whole game on it too much.Finally,considering the game's content and how many hours you'll likely get out of the game even if you go to the trouble of 100%ing it, that $20 price tag is WAY too much. To put it in perspective, you can purchase Terraria on Steam right now for $10. That's a game that you can potentially get hundreds of  hours out of. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a similar story: $15 for potentially hundreds of hours. Scribblenauts Unlimited meanwhile is $20 for around 12 hours if you feel so inclined to get all of the achivements. But to be fair, Terraria and The Binding of Isaac are COMPLETELY different than Scribblenauts. Scribblenauts isn't the type of game that you dedicate hundreds of your hours into. It's the kind of game that you finish, and then move on to something else. But even still...$20? In my opinion, if you truly feel so compelled to purchase the title, you're gonna want to wait until the next big sale.I hope this helps.			"

Lots of crazy things to do in this game like shooting down a building with ""Destroyer"", turning a lizard into a Ice Dragon and make him fight a ""Flamethrower Soldier"", building a school underwater, make a health potion and drink it if you are hurt and low on health, add dead as an adjective... Instant death! and more fun and crazy stuff to do. The art design is nice. And lots of variety in characters and customization. Its more like a sandbox game where you can do anything you want. Also has cool story. Its not a game for Everyone though. You might get bored of it quickly if you don't like these kind of games. And...! You can get past most of the game without killing people! Type ""Sleepy"" or ""Sleeping"" as adjective insteed! Had a great time in this game. Will play more.+ Creativity at Its Finest+ Great Art Design+ Lots of Characters and Customization+ Improve Your Spelling Skills! :P+ Good Story+ Makes You Think+ Truely Open World+ Lasts Long- Not for Everyone.

												I have looked at this game for several time before I decide to buy this game on discount. Videogame is fun on itself, and importantly gameplay system is more creative than another games I have played before. Scribblenauts Unlimited expands my sense of curiosity about English language, and of course it helps me learn some words I don't even know before such as, defibrilator. On the other hand, level design of Scribblenauts Ultimate sometimes makes me feel it's harder to find what word I need to take in the gap. However this game has a 2D graphic, I guarantee if you like intellectant videogame, this game can offer you a ton of English language's knowledge and general knowledge that we should know as well.

June 22, 2015Scribblenauts Unlimited is a strange game, functioning best as a sandbox to play with creativity and absurdity. Focusing on completing the game tasks can become boring, and a fair amount of objectives feel like padding. Completionists will be annoyed by the amount of chores needed to 100% the game.This may sound like the game is bad, and that could be argued. Approached as a series of tasks to save Lily, the game can feel a bit slow. However, sometimes you need to forget the quests and just mess around. Arm shotguns with shotguns, then hand them to a musical afro. Build a tower of dirty jesters, riding a hated jester on the bottom. Give a dog-fearing man a dog whistle and watch him panic. Play around, and you can really see the pure fun of this game. I've spent at least an hour catching my breath after hilarious events, most of which I didn't expect or plan. That alone is worth the time and money, in this era of pretentious art games and multiplayer communities that make you hate humanity.Do you want to laugh, preferably without vulgarity? Can you come up with some silly ideas to see what happens? I'd recommend Scribblenauts Unlimited.  I don't have much idea about the Unmasked version, doesn't seem to change much beyond the missions, and I figure the Unlimited Workshop community is stronger. I got the game from a Humble Bundle key  <3 Fred but I would recommend the game easily at 25% off for $15 USD.			"

												The best scribblenauts game out there in my opinon, you should really get this game if you love the scribblenauts series. The game might be a bit short, but it's worth every second. If you complete the game there is always alot of fun things to do such as creating a flying helpful rocket launcher or a big red triple headed dog to ride on.			"

												This game is clever, innocent and fun. My seven-year-old neighbor begs me to let him play some Scribblenauts all of the time, and I definitely love this game as much as him. It takes the already entertaining concept of the original mobile game and takes it way farther, with a sizable campaign which took awhile to beat, and was fun all the way through. Just like the original, the puzzles involve solving problems by creating helpful items, and it doesn't get old!I was skeptical about this game at first, since I got it for $4.99 in the recent Warner Bros. Interactive sale, but I was pleasantly surprized by how much fun it is! Give it a try...and when you do, make sure you try typing in Cthulhu.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is a game where you create stuff, earn Starites by completing objectives, and play as any character you want. You can create anything. Anything! Like Shoggoth, a squirrel, a T-Rex, Deadpool, a lighthouse, and even a leprechaun. The object of the game is to get 60 Starites. Once you hit 60, you've completed the game and you get to play as Maxwell's sister, Lily. Hooray! You can create stuff using the object editor. Like a cat launcher, a cat gun, an army camouflage rifle, Ellen DeGeneres, etc. You can also create your own avatar if you want, and you can download other people's creations on your Steam Workshop. They can create other stuff and upload them on their Steam Workshop too.I recommended this game. I like it.			"

												Likes:It it freaking hilarious!!! I can sit and play this thing for hours on end!The ability to manipulate anything and everything in the game just makes for a very special gaming experience, and even though this game is targeted at a (much) younger audience than myself, I find it to be plenty stimulating and intriguing.I can imagine this would be a great game for your kid learning colors and words, and grammars and stuff (yes, I see what I did there).Now, with English not being my primary language, I learn a lot of new things through this game, and I like how I am sort of forced to learn words I rarely or never use in daily life.The absolute major +++3000 for me about this game is the manipulation of everything, and the possibility to download mods to make it (less) childproof and more to my liking.Dislikes:... Well... it does get a little monotone after a while. You do the same thing on every map, and after a while that just becomes a little boring.All in all:YES. I LOVE THIS GAME!!! It's brilliant!!!			"

												For me, playing Scribblenauts Unlimited is a very entertaining way to touch and play a little with my inner child! For those who play it, everything seems like a simple logic problem that must be solved with a bunch of creativity. The fact the game has a simple and at the same time full of imaginative possibilities mechanic, which matches with the clean artwork and graphics, drives the player to this very wished psychological place of not worrying or not having to follow any kinds of protocols, by fullfiling complex and hard-to-understand objectives; but yet being driven and carried on by such direct and fundamental moral themes: making other people a little happier with the powers we have and struggling to undo an ""evil"" caused by our own acts. With the nowadays tendence of creating very human like heroes and villains, with a spectrum of mixed moral values and affections, Scribblenauts makes us all remeber a little what is like to have possibilities of believing and making things look and feel better without the need of titanic actions and moves. I have a 10 here, but that's likely because I really like to hang around with the kiddo side of myself!			"

												This is one of my favorite games. However, it has its flaws. If you dont want to read this entire review, scroll all the way to the bottom, There's a tl;dr version.So first off, the title lies.The object creator is limited. The fact that it says ""Unlimited"" in the title makes it feel like the creator just wants money. It really takes alot of the fun away from the game, but don't get me wrong. I know it was made in 2012 and making everything ""Unlimited"" would kill your computer's memory, but this still is pretty dissapointing.Basically, my point is; Don't buy the game unless you know what to expect, or you've played the game before on something like the Wii U.Second, the small space in all of the levels.I haven't played through the entire game yet, but im getting there. What really bothers me more than the limited object creator is that the levels are just so small.If you've only played things like Big RPGs, Shooters, and Garry's Mod, then this game is going to be weird for you.Although each level has enough space for you to create several things, the free space could be bigger.Finally, the price is too high.I don't think this game's worth 20$. Like i mentioned earlier, the game's very limited and not what you'd expect. Please, take a moment to think about it before you buy it. Now, lets go to the positives.First off, the artstyle's unique.Yes, it's a little blocky and chibi-ish, but it just works. That's all i need to say for this.Second, you can create almost anything you want.You can write something bad like ""Invincible Strong Huge Bee"" and it'll appear as an invincible strong huge bee. If its not in the game, you can make it.Third, the gameplay.The missions, the fact that you can create almost anything, and the high resolution is just what you'd expect from a Scribblenauts game.Finally, that feeling you get when playing Scribblenauts.The feeling of wondering ""When will there be another game?""10/10. Tl;dr: The game's limited, the levels are too small, and the price is too high. But the artstyle's unique, you can create almost anything you want, and the feeling of wondering ""When will there be another game?"" While playing this. 10/10			"

												Imagine being able to create whatever you wanted just by writing it in a book. Now, instead of using this book to give yourself a flying rainbow llama, you use it to help people in need. This is Scribblenauts Unlimited, the third game in the Scribblenauts series.You play as Maxwell, a young boy who has been given the gift of a magic notebook from his parents. Maxwell then uses the notebook to give a rotten apple to a hungry man, and angers him. The man puts a curse on Lily, his sister, who now slowly turns to stone. To stop this, Maxwell has to make up for his trickery by collecting Starites from people, to free his sister from the curse.The gameplay in Scribblenauts Unlimited is basic, but it is obtained and used well. I was never confused by the controls or wandered around pressing buttons. The notebook feature is easy to use, and writing something with multiple meanings (say, 'bat') will bring up a menu to select which type of object you would like. There is also a backpack feature that allows you to save your favourite creations for easier access later, but I rarely used this feature as I created new and different things all of the time.While Scribblenauts Unlimited is simple, its charming art style is colourful, playful and different to a lot of other games that I am used to. Playing the first two games on the Nintendo DS, Scribblenauts Unlimited combines the series-defining mechanics of the first game with the creativity and art style of Super Scribblenauts, building a game that is definitely one of the best puzzle games available on PC. While this game is definitely directed towards a younger audience, I couldn't help but pick up the third instalment of this amazing franchise.There are no borders in Scribblenauts Unlimited. Unlike the first two games, Scribblenauts Unlimited is set it over 20 different locations, which when unlocked are accessible all the time, creating an open world to explore and invent wonderful contraptions and experiments. Never in any other game have I seen so much creative freedom.To conclude, Scribblenauts Unlimited is a flawless addition to the series, and definitely a game that will consume a fair amount of play time.9.8/10			"

												If you want a game that has explosions, impossible amounts of creativity, ridable miniature giraffes, a large cast of characters, and Workshop support, then Scribblenauts 2: Scribblenauts Harder is the game for you! During my many visits to this sandbox gem, I found that you could solve many of the puzzles with multiple solutions. You were free to use your noggin' when it was needed, giving you an edge over the admittedly simple puzzles this game had to offer. The addition of adjectives really boosted this into my favorite sandbox games, along with Garry's Mod and Minecraft.			"

Scribblenauts Unlimited is an adventure puzzle game. As Maxwell, save your sister Lily from a curse by creating happiness around the world with the use of your magical notepad that can create anything you can write.Pros: The game has an astonishing amount of potential content. Almost any word and adjective you can think of, you can create by typing it. There is a lot of different method to resolve any situation, and the fun comes in finding new and unexpected ways to do so. You will find yourself attempting different solutions again and again even after you already succeeded just to see if you can find an easter egg or game secret. Usable created objects also add game elements to work with, and combining people or objects with one or more adjectives increases the possibilities tenfold.Cons: The game is short, you can breeze through it, getting the Starites you need to win the game within a few hours. Many of the puzzles are easy, half of which can usually be resolved with the same few objects. There are multiple passageways to move around a level, but they are often useless as it won't take time for you to always make sure you have a jet-pack or pair of wings to move around. Unless you want to explore the possibilities, you won't find much replayability as resolving a puzzle in different ways still ends up with the exact same result.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!If you're looking for an exciting story, grand adventure or mind-bending puzzles, turn away. But if you're looking for an entertaining time trying to push the limit of the game, and exploring just how far you can go, it's a great one. The Steam Workshop makes it easier than ever to add dozens, if not hundreds of new objects and options, assuming you don't use the object creator to add your own. Furthermore, the game is great for all ages, maybe even more so for younger gamers. Of course, if you didn't like previous Scribblenauts games, you're unlikely to enjoy this one. But if you did, Scribblenauts Unlimited will go where previous ones never went before!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												This game is surprisingly entertaining! I have seen my daughter play it a lot on her DS so assumed it was a kids game but some of the stuff requires much thought to figure out what these characters need you to create for them. Some things can be funny, some mundane and some dangerous. Yes you can put something out that will kill your people and then you must start the level again. Some are inevitable and restarting does not cause you to lose progress.The workshop also has lots of additional content you can download. To do so you must do it from in game. If you go and just subscribe through steam about 95 percent will NOT show up. To do so go to the object editor (the glue and scissors) and then subscribe from there.Its great when you need a break from the FPS, RPG or Dinos! I had so many hours in ARK that when my husband asked me a question while I was groggy I responded I will just bring my T-Rex! Yes I was serious and he thought I lost it LOL So this game has given me a much needed dino break, cartoon dinos don't count!			"

												The game allows for an impressive amount of objects to be created, however it is designed for kids and is ludicrously easy. In 4 hours of playing, I had gotten through the majority of the puzzles, with only 2-3 of the over 100 I had done taking more than a few seconds to figure out. In saying that, the levels are creative and funny, and allow for your to set up your own situations using different combinations of objects - which can be edited with the use of a large amount of adjectives.

												An experience not far detached from genuine creative writing, except you get your vocabulary hacked off at the knees, turning it (and - subsequently - you) into a linguistically-challenged, clean-mouthed, experimental dwarf. The upside is that instead of crawling under your desk to cry about your lack of progress and insistence on unhealthy quantities of procrastination, your efforts are rewarded with charming caricatures rendered in glorious patches of primary colour.  In all fairness, it's a tempting trade-off.			"

												5th Cell have made a few very good games that I have played, and this is one of them. This game company has made a few games that can really inspire creativity, such as Drawn To Life and Scribblenauts, though of course inspire creativity  in different ways.Scribblenauts is a game that encourages you to come up with ways to solve moderatly easy puzzles, where there is no one solution. Because there is no one solution, it has high replay value, with you figuring out what else works, and different ways to do the same thing. At first you might start out summoning a sponge to clean a wall, later you will be using aardvarks for everything. This game has changed a lot since it's start on the Nintendo DS, and you can even MAKE new things with parts of things from the game, and even script their behaviour! Or if you are no good at making things, you can download some from the Steam Workshop!There are very few flaws in this game, as no game is perfect. One flaw I find is not really a flaw, but can be seen as one, you have way too much freedom in this game. Limits really work well in certain games, and with games with too much freedom you can get bored, or you see no challenge. If you get bored, there are heaps of achievements to get and there are little challenges in-game for you to solve. But if you have done everything, you can always clear the game data and start anew, and maybe even have a challenge of your own, like, for example, only using aardvarks, which is something I find myself doing a lot.This game doesn't just stop at the limitless freedom, it also has a very heartwarming story, that premotes kindness. Which is a very nice touch on top of the rest of the game. These types of games are very hard to come across, they are very different from most games, and because they are different and very special, they are games that you must have, even if you are a gamer who plays zombie games, or plays a lot of indie games (a lot of the time they overlap) you must have this, as it is not just another generic game, it is Scribblenauts Unlimited.

												I reccomend it! I got it when it was $55 and I still don't regret it. I didn't like the DS ones but this one takes the DELICOUS MASSIVE CAKE! But let's talk detail.This game is literally a dictionary stuffed inside cartoon graphics and zapped with story, and I'm okay with that. The story isn't half bad, the level design is fabulous and the graphics is eye candy. There are afew flaws, some times words entered aren't adapted and it won't help you spell your workshop creations (I happen to have made afew) so it can be a little tedious when trying to make somthing specific. Don't make somthing specific! Go nuts! I come back to it even with the story complete just to make some crazy stuff. (P.S That backpack is very useful if you like making special items every time you play!)			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time.  I often play it whenever I need cheering up.It has lackluster reviews, and I've noticed almost everyone that rates it mediocre or bad plays it differently than I do.  You could consider this both a review and a guide to having fun with the game.  Don't worry, there won't be spoilers.If you're out of elementary school, and play the game in the most straightforward way, it will be too easy.  It amounts to a graphical adventure where you can access almost every item in the game by typing the name, letting you bypass anything resembling a puzzle.  While this might be viewed as a problem by teenagers and adults playing the game, it's actually a good thing for children, who can use it as a fun way to exercise their vocabulary skills.Teenagers and adults playing the game should use their creativity.  The game is usually surprisingly flexible in how you can achieve a goal.  The only restrictions it normally has are: you can't use real people's names, or anything involving drugs, prejudice, or sex, and you often can't kill anybody.Suggestions to get you started: Be indirect.  Creating things people ask for and sticking adjectives on the problem is boring.  Create other beings and complex Rube Goldberg contraptions made of multiple objects to solve problems.  Watch the chaos as unexpected interactions ensue!  When your solutions cause more problems, add more elements to try to fix those, rather than changing or removing anything. Be lazy.  See how little you can create while still solving a problem indirectly.  This usually involves heavy use of side effects.  You may be able to solve multiple problems on the same level with one action. Be impractical.  Pick a role and stubbornly stick to it.  The best roles are those least suited to a hero (e.g. cook, janitor, tailor…).  Dress the part and give yourself appropriate adjectives.  Try to solve all problems using only things that are in theme.  MacGyver would be proud. Do no harm.  When dealing with a problematic creature or object, try to create and use some other creatures or objects that harmlessly neutralize it, rather than fighting or destroying it. Provide unhelpful help.  Be an evil genie.  Do what someone asked you to do, but make sure it has side effects they won't like, or doesn't achieve their goal. Consider what would happen if…  For example, what would happen if a prince, turned into a frog, was given a werewolf princess to kiss?Played this way it should have you laughing your head off.  You may lose the level (usually due to an accidental death), but have so much fun you won't care.The game does have some flaws.It doesn't recognize every correctly spelled word.  That would have been impossible to program and create art for.Some goals are too restrictive to allow creativity.  Sometimes there is only one solution.  There should be at least three significantly different solutions.  Better playtesting could have caught this.There are “fetch quests”.  They involve going to some part of the map, which is usually unobstructed, picking up a item, and carrying it back to the person that asked for it.  You can't use your magical notebook to do this, and it's unhumorous, uncreative, and unchallenging.  Hopefully the authors will stop including these in the future.While I love what the object editor can do, I hate how it does it.  The primary pain-point is how difficult it is to “draw” a new object.  You have to do it by lumping together existing art assets.  The second worst pain-point is how difficult it is to get the behavior you want.  You can only create new behaviors by tuning settings on existing ones.  While you can argue this is “creative problem solving”, it fits poorly with the design of the rest of the game.  Making a item in game is as easy as typing the name.  Making items in the object editor should be similarly painless.  We'd be better off with a design that imports SVG and allows scripting in some common, efficient, sandboxable, programming language, like JavaScript or Lua.There is no way to create new levels at all.  This could have greatly extended interest in the game.Overall, I think this is one of the finest games ever made, and look forward to more in the series.			"

												Great little game, it's got a ridiculous amount of adjectives. You can spawn an evil version of yourself that randomly creates things to see how advanced it is, you'll see things like ""noctophilic haystack"" or ""serendipitous pho."" They use lots of playtesters to see what solutions people would come up with so that combined with lots of items fitting into similar categories means that most puzzles have an incredible amount of solutions. Spawn a pregnant man and a midwife and you'll get a thin man and a baby man, for example. I don't know how that helps solve puzzles, but there's a lot of dynamic events that pop up. It's worth a look and you can buy it, get a feel for it and return it within 2 hours if you don't like it. That's more than enough time to see what the game is like and whether you want to keep playing, after the opening cutscene and tutorial, you're essentially thrown into the game and have all your abilities. The only downside is the Steam Workshop, which is really cool. Lots of... interesting things there but the only way I've found it to work is that you have to subscribe to things from the game itself, that's the only way it would load what you want. I would've also liked to be able to use downloaded models for the character selector but I suppose the detailed character creator is a more configurable tool. Still, it's nigh impossible to pick Jango Fett or Samus as your character unless you know what you're doing.			"

												When I was about 7 I saw my friend playing this and I started backseat gaming SO HARD. It was amazing to watch an electric god fight death. So I got the game my self (super scribble nauts) and started playing! UNTIL I got to this DEVIL mission where you have to help this directior shoot this movie. Looking back, I didn't know what a clapper was and I didn't want to loo up a walk thru. So like 5 years later, I got this game started playing and what I like about this game is that yoou can just plug in your random real world trivia to solve theise puzzles. The game's all like ""What makes hair blond?"" And im all like HYDROGEN PEROXIDE and poof I completed the level! The ending really got to me tho. I'm not going to spoil anything but the ending was all about don't prank people unless your SoFloAntonio and do nice things to people to start that chain reaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.9/10 FNAF ruined the workshop.

												This is a game that I found myself addicted to during the first few hours of playing.  The creative aspect of the game is really fun and it really encourages you to come up with creative ways to complete each task.  As with a lot of the other reviews, you can come up with the most ridiculous solutions to the tasks and still pass them.  Spawning random objects just to mess around with the NPCs is probably one of the most entertaining things about this game as well.  Despite all of this, the story could get boring after a while, but it is a fun game to play nonetheless.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is interested in creative type games like this.			"

You are like some kind of genie, running around fullfilling wishes for others so that they may give you a star. However, you can fullfill the wishes in a ""technicaly"" correct way. I once made the sea more safe by giving an orca a revolver, turning him into POLICE ORCA. A giant was in love with a normal sized woman. They want to live a normal life: Make a woman huge. NOW NOONE IS HAPPY BUT YOU CAN BE TOGETHER ANYWAY HAHAHAHA NOW GIMME YOUR STAR.Not but really. Its a cool game with a really cute graphic style and a good message.			"

Despite seeming like a childish game as it may to some people, there is a plethora of references to movies, songs, shows, mythology, historical events, Shakespeare, etc. which must be understood in order to complete certain quests. Its endless creativeness and possibilities combined with its cutesy art and character design make this game a must-have.			"

												It is unlikely you will find a single scenario in this game that will challenge you to think outside the box.  Most of the problems the game presents you with can be solved in painfully obvious ways.  Do you need to put out a fire? Type fireman.  Is someone  hungry?  Give them food.  Because of this most of the fun in the game will be through either self imposed challenges such as not allowing yourself to solve things in a obvious way or by trying to solve everything in a silly or ironic way.  I myself tried to complete as much of the game as possible using the noun ""baby"" with different adverbs attached to it (this worked surprisingly well). Despite its flaws I would still recommend the game if you enjoy sandbox experiences as with the addition of steam workshop it has enormous potential in that area. Just don't buy it expecting a challenging puzzle game.			"

												Scribblenauts is great. Its even better if you play by your own rules and have an audience. If you don't know the basic idea is there are people who need the help of your godlike notebook that can create anything you can imagine and write down into it. So this knight needs a weapon to fight off a giant dragon, why not give him a diamond chainsaw? This girl wants to win a race, why not make her a super hero with super speed? Want to ride around on a golden dinosaur or a flying magical cat? Well in Scribblenauts you can. Its a little easy to get tired of the game though. Its fun and all but the overall difficulty can basically be summed up in ""this mouse wants cheese, click notebook write cheese, give cheese to mouse. This football team can't play football without a football.. click on notebook write football, give football to team."" ..its absurd how easy the game is. Every once in a while I got totally stuck on something because its a childrens rhyme or a kids logic thing that I am obviously no longer in the loop for but that can be solved with a good audience.The real fun though comes from messing with the game. So the mouse wants cheese right? Why not give him a cat made out of cheese then watch the hilarity of a mouse eating a live cheese cat. That poor guy needs a doctor, why not give him a zombie doctor? Make it fun and it becomes fun.. let it be boring and it can really tire you out. Overall its a great game and its easy to 100% (though you'll probably want a walkthrough for the random object challenges). I think it would be great to play with others more than alone and children maybe more than adults.. but its a great game for all ages.			"

												after playing Super Scribblenauts on the nintendo ds i didn't think there was any more room for improvement i was dead wrong unlimited is truly unlimited there are so many objects you can create and so many solutions for solving problems its just amazing the amount of objects that are spawnable are crazy you can also add adjectives on words to make them behave in a different manner scribblenauts unlimited is a great game that tests your ability to spell and also test how many diffrent ways you can solve a puzzle the music the graphics the gameplay are all amazing i'd recommend this game to anyone who is very imginenative			"

												I've tackled games in this series before on nds and iphone but this one seems to be the one with the most content...which is both good and bad really. I've waited for this to come out for a while and while it's actually really fun that wears off after a while. While every new are you go to is interesting and uniwue in it's own right they all follow the same rules - you have different characters with problems and you have to come up with an item or a person that will solve that. This is really fun at first but it can get repetitive after a while and getting all the starites in the game (you get starites or shards for every problem you solve) is very tedious.Bottom line play it in small doses and it will stay fun...try to complete it all at once and it will get pretty boring. Also it's fun to screw the goals of the game and just do whatever - make a pink cthulhu with a rainbow colored afro fight a robot elephant with gatling guns. If you can think it you can pretty much make it in this game..and then set it on fire and launch it in space.			"

												Scribblenaughts Unlimited - A Fun and Creative Game.If you’ve skipped the series until now, start here. You’ll be amazed at how much there is to show off. And if you’re the creative type, the Object Editor opens up endless possibilities. Scribblenauts Unlimited is an excellent game!			"

												For a child     I can see why a child needs this game. It has hard puzzles for a growing mind and allow you to solve them with your creativity. Also something that allows you to make your own objects! That is awesome, but the community got a little carried away with that. I will go in more detail later. Back on subject, this game might not have a sandbox mode where you can't die. Scibblenauts Unlimited replaces that with a massive world to explore. Makes you feel like you are helping real people instead of just doing levels. Fun new graphics, expertly done, endless hours, and most of all real characters that you feel for. This game is better then the old one indeed.     Now to complain.   This game has a awful community. Be warned! See the workshop items section below. All items are just stupid and you know why. Here they are...10% normal fun items25% stupid items like cat hydras, baby guns, or worse.35% Fnaf items, how did scibblenauts get fnaf disease? Also pokemon too.30% Adult jokes, There is balls items and nudity everywhere!     As you see 90% is just bad. That is only complaint.My final score is a 97%, but the community brings it to a 80%.The rating is 10+, but because of that I bring it to a 13+ game.			"

												When the original Scribblenauts came out for the DS, it was one of my favorite games. While it did not have the option to customize objects or use adjectives, most levels were both fun and challenging, forcing you to push your creativity's limits in order to reach the starite. Scribblenauts Unlimited allows much more depth with creating items, but the levels/puzzles do not reach beyond simply creating a category of object when prompted. There are no action levels in Scribblenauts Unlimited and as a result none of the levels are really challenging and there is no satisfaction in completing them. The object editor also allows you to create overpowered objects as well, decreasing what little challenge there is. It is fun to fool around with the object editor, but Scribblenauts Unlimited does not offer much depth beyond customizing your own objects.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited was a gift to me.  I had heard about the game winning awards, but never considered it ""my kind of game.""  The basic premise is that you are a child with a magical notebook that allows anything you draw to come to life.  n You use the notebook to help people in town in order to save your sister who was randomly cursed.  You can type thousands of things into this notebook, and they will pop up on the screen.  The beauty of the game is in the sense of humor and in all the unexpected interactions that the people in the game have with the items you create. (I may have created a citywide epidemic by modifying a cockroach with the adjective ""diseased,"" but that's not important...)  It took me a little bit to get the hang of what the game expected of me and a couple of hilarious discussions with my roomie (""What would you draw in order to make a lamb come to dinner?""  Him: ""What?"") to fully grasp it all, but I really enjoyed the creativity and imagination that the game offered.			"

Figuring out the most creative ways to accomplish something, in a way that shouldn't be possible outside of a pencil and paper, is just so very, very satisfying. Keyboard required, thesaurus suggested, and you'll want to play with someone younger than yourself. This is how your childhood imagination looked in your head.			"

Despite being extremely repetitive, the satisfaction that encompasses the success in passing certain objectives is not to be ignored as some combinations are just hilarious, or even confusing. For the fans of the series, this game should satisfy the needs of them, whilst for people who are new to the series, may be a tedious and difficult experience to complete. 6/10			"

												     Scribblenauts Unlimited is a VERY fun installation in the Scribblenauts series.  New to the game is the object editor, a very easy to use and creative way of making your own interactive objects.  You can change sizes, colors, and shapes, but the one thing that made me upset was that you can't DRAW your own objects.  This limits you to using only pre-made things in the game, forcing you to combine them if you want something unique.      Also new to Scribblenauts is its vast world.  From the city, to a desert, and even to space, you can take Maxwell (or one of his many brothers) on missions around the virtual globe.  Each level has challenges awaiting you that can be very simple or complex.  On the other hand, many missions have simple solutions.  For example, if a boy is unhappy, you can make a clown, video game, etc.  The possibilities are endless, but the entertainment level with some obstacles is limited.     All in all, I still like playing the game.  Even after you finish all the side-missions and campaign, you can still make your own objects and re-create your favorite characters and scenes from movies, video games, and books.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to share their ideas with others and explore Maxwell's world.			"

												Actually I just got this game super cheap through Humble Bundle just because it came with the Batman Arkham games, so I didn't expect to like it. But I read that it was a sort of puzzle game, a genre I love, I gave it a try. First session playing it and I couldn't stop playing. There is a story but it's not obtrusive, so you get to start playing very quick, and the story although simple is not bad. I obviously haven't played a Scribblenauts before, so I don't really know what's new and what's not, but I found the game to be super creative, original and very funny. The gameplay is weird but it's very clever and fun and let's you be creative, although sometimes I couldn't create what I wanted. The music is also cool but can get repetitive. So overall, while I can't say I highly recommend this game, because I got it super cheap, it is a very fun game and if you find it at a low price then I do think you should go for it.			"

												The initial humor and creativity lies in finding strange ways to solve problems.  Why just build an airplane when you can give yourself wings?  And how many imaginary creatures can you make?  But as the game goes on, you'll find yourself using the same objects for the many identical challenges.  The greatest challenge lies in finding the right 2-word phrase the developers intended.  Fun at first, but boring in the long run.  Good for earning achievements and amusing in smal doses.			"

Turns out that this game is extreme fun to play and it really can make you laugh, smile or rage at how dumb you are. Since some reviews are lacking structure, I will try to get some sort of scheme into mine:Pros:-It is suitable for every age (although some parts are tough to get)-It is super neat (graphics, sounds, story and characters)-It is ridiculous how much stuff you can create (you can spawn a Cthulu, ride it and go ape♥♥♥♥♥♥-It is captivating since some riddles are quite challenging and you kind of want to proof to yourself that you are not    completely dumbCons:-It is somehow repetetive-Some riddles and their way to solve them are illogical-It should cost less I think (but I bought with the WB Bundle on Humble Bundle so I was okay with the price) "

												Worth $5 at most. Nice quick and short game(about 10 hours game-play at most.) and basically, you type an object, it appears. Thing that frustrates me about this game most is that some objects don't work that should, and other objects that shouldn't work, do. It's also toned more towards little kids(not surprised on that one.) it's fun to play around with the different random things you can create. Would be interesting to see an adaptation that allows you to do like a multiplayer mayhem with random objects, animals, etc, that you can spawn to fight against others or just random mini-games. As it stands, it's not.. a bad game, but the story-line is kinda weak and it's basically you go around helping people. I want to be the villain more often. This.. doesn't give you that chance, unless you spawn a bunch of random chaotic things. Which.. in turn, can be fun. hahah. But yeah, get it at $5 or below. I wouldn't recommend it at full-price but no worries, it goes on sale quite often.			"

It gives you some good moral lessons and helps expand your vocabulary, sometimes i had to look into a dictionary to find a really good word to solve some puzzles. Anyways let's get down to gameplay, you play a character named Maxwell and you have to help your sister from turning into stone that was casted by a mysterious stranger and in order to turn her back to normal you have to collect these stars called starrites. In order to get starrites you have to solve peoples problems the more problems you solve the more starrites you get. You write in a notebook to solve problems so anything you write in there becomes a reality, what i mean by this is that anything you write in the book rather it be person,place,or thing appears right in front of you. You can pretty much write anything in there except vulgarity,copyright material, or if you can help it not write the same words over and over again.After playing this game for 9 hours i would recommend this to anyone who is creative with words.

												     Scribblenauts Unlimited is a VERY fun installation in the Scribblenauts series.  New to the game is the object editor, a very easy to use and creative way of making your own interactive objects.  You can change sizes, colors, and shapes, but the one thing that made me upset was that you can't DRAW your own objects.  This limits you to using only pre-made things in the game, forcing you to combine them if you want something unique.      Also new to Scribblenauts is its vast world.  From the city, to a desert, and even to space, you can take Maxwell (or one of his many brothers) on missions around the virtual globe.  Each level has challenges awaiting you that can be very simple or complex.  On the other hand, many missions have simple solutions.  For example, if a boy is unhappy, you can make a clown, video game, etc.  The possibilities are endless, but the entertainment level with some obstacles is limited.     All in all, I still like playing the game.  Even after you finish all the side-missions and campaign, you can still make your own objects and re-create your favorite characters and scenes from movies, video games, and books.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to share their ideas with others and explore Maxwell's world.			"

												It almost seems like attaching the adjectives 'charming', 'gentle' or 'lovely' to a description of this game might be damning with faint praise. After all, wholesomeness only goes so far, right? Well, luckily that's not really the case. Scribblenauts IS charming, gentle and lovely and it manages to be all of those things without tipping towards the sickly, saccharine and ultimately bland and nauseating end of the spectrum. Part of this comes down the player throwing themselves into the spirit of the game. For someone who has no problem negotiating play time with their inner child, the game is a treat: relaxing, witty, occasionally quite puzzling, and offering up possibilities for creative solutions at every turn. And, y'know, when a game is that completely pleasant it also makes it all a lot more fun. Good game.			"

												Scribblenauts unlimited is a fun little game (mostly a game for kids though) about traveling the world and collecting stars by doing lots of ""chores"" and getting payed with shards and stars which in the end help with freeing your sibling from a petrifying curse. you have a notebook which makes everything you write on it become a real object. you can costumize and create almost anythingCons:- since a ""chore"" has at least 10 ways to clear it, doing them is a bit tooooooo easy, nothing challenging in my opinion;- its graphisc might not appeal to some;- little to no replayability;- if played alot in a short time (a day) can get boring pretty fast;Pros:- fun and short game;- easy to 100%;- while not challenging it still helps improve imagination, writting speed ( did to me:)) );- despite doing stuff at a really fast speed there are quite a large number of ""chores""to do and explore the fun world;- fun to play around with random objects and properties; "

You can literally think of anything, and I mean anything; A rocket powered lemon riding Goat? Sure! A flying Hippo with blue toenails, HELL YEAH! Also, for the stuff you can't create can easily be downloaded as the game has Steam Workshop Support. Irresponsible Dad from Happy Wheels? Yup. Dubstep Guns from Saint's Row, YES! :D I'll admit, the storyline is a bit childish but the amount of things you can do is crazy and damn hilarious!

												This is a great puzzler where, to use a cliché, the only limit is your imagination - within the boundaries of PG. I would recommend it to you if you've never played a Scribblenauts game before or if you just want a good puzzle game. There's a few hours of story in it, plus the added bonus of the sandbox mode, which is essentially integrated into the story. It's jam-packed full of recognizable references includingNyan Cat, Lord of the Rings, Super Mario, Indiana Jones and Half Life. It also has something called the Object Editor which allows you to create your own items to use in the game and even upload to the Steam Workshop. You can also download some great content put out by other users too. It's definitely targeted to a younger demographic but that doesn't mean older gamers won't get something out of it too.			"

												Worth $5 at most. Nice quick and short game(about 10 hours game-play at most.) and basically, you type an object, it appears. Thing that frustrates me about this game most is that some objects don't work that should, and other objects that shouldn't work, do. It's also toned more towards little kids(not surprised on that one.) it's fun to play around with the different random things you can create. Would be interesting to see an adaptation that allows you to do like a multiplayer mayhem with random objects, animals, etc, that you can spawn to fight against others or just random mini-games. As it stands, it's not.. a bad game, but the story-line is kinda weak and it's basically you go around helping people. I want to be the villain more often. This.. doesn't give you that chance, unless you spawn a bunch of random chaotic things. Which.. in turn, can be fun. hahah. But yeah, get it at $5 or below. I wouldn't recommend it at full-price but no worries, it goes on sale quite often.			"

												Firstly, let me say that I really enjoy, the game, but that I am also deeply disapointed at how much they seemed to have back tracked from their previous versions in a few ways. Although you can now edit your object and creations more than ever before, as well as get new and incredible creations from the steam commuity workshop and upload your own fairly easily, the most glaring flaw is that the game is also easier than ever before because the ""challenges"" are not as intricate and put together as they used to be. In fact most of the shard ""challenges"" are one-word-one-step solutions. So, although I fully recomend this game with its incredible library of possible creations, adjectives, and small challenges, this is also to say that it is not as great as it could be. If you can, i would fully recomend first buying SUPER scribblenauts on a different system (it's not on steam sadly) where you can experience the more developed gameplay. This said, it seems that by making the game easier and more user friendly, they are aiming at a younger audience, so if you wish, buy it for a child to enjoy, they likely won't notice the flaws or problems mentioned above. I hope you like the game as much as i do, even with these problems, i am happy i bought the game. Also, on a side note, for those of you whom wish to try and get all those achievements on your game, this game is pretty nice. While it may take a bit of work past the end of the storyline to get all the achievements, they are all pretty straightforward and accessable, meaning you can very likely 100% the game if you put in the time. I would say it takes about 6-12 hours to do this depending on how familiar and witty you are at quickly and correctly  guessing	 creating the wanted items. You'll need 60 starites to ""finish"" the storyline and 107 to get all the achievements. Enjoy!			"

												This is a very unique puzzle game. The art is bright and colorful and the environments are fun and well drawn up. The puzzles are creative and interactive although they can be quite simple at times, especially once you find out what I like to call (Cheat items) these are items that allow you to do many of the puzzles with ease, one of these such items is Wings. Speaking of items, the amount of things you can type and create is insanely impressive and makes it so you have so you have a variety of objects that can help in each puzzle meaning that you may even solve the puzzle differently or with a different item then someone else did. Its very kid friendly but is also very fun as an adult and could even be something cool to play with you kid if thats what your looking for. Highly recommended as it is just a unique charming puzzle game that is very addictive, has loads to do in it and the art work is just gorgeous.Game Showcase/ Gameplay-

												The thing I love about this game is that the possibilities are endless. You can make almost anything and what's not programmed into the game you can make yourself or download from other users though Steam. Unlimited is definitely a most fitting title.Another brilliant thing about Scribblenauts is that it can be enjoyed by any age group. Some might think this game is childish but it is so enjoyable.The style is colourful and friendly and you don't have to worry about hoards of monsters coming at you. I think there should be more relaxed, casual games like this.I'd say the main are Scribblenauts Unlimted falls down is language. The only language option in this game is English. That said, I imagine a game based on writing would be rather difficult to translate.All in all, I highly reccommend this game.			"

												If you like Scribblenauts, you will love this game. If you haven't played Scribblenauts, then you should get this game because you have been missing out! It is unbelievable fun to be able to type in your own creations and adjectives, and you are limited just about only by your imagination. Some of the puzzles do seem to limit you more in what they are looking for, but there are many that you can complete however you wish, and of course aside from the puzzles you can just play around and cause mayhem or see how many things you can think of. You can make everything from an Enormous Scary Bunny to a Robotic Shoe. Few games are as versatile as Scribblenauts, and you are bound to end up with some unintended hilarity.			"

												TL;DR If you are torn between Unlimited or Unmasked get this one  first	 8/10Scribblenauts Unlimited is... Scribblenauts. You can create almost anything you can think of Cthulu, a big Cthulu, a Scary Cthulu, a Purple Cthulu, oh right, I almost forgot! You can also create Cthulu. Jokes aside there is a large variety of things to make, Obviously the game is E10+ so that means nothing inappropriate (Sadly) However you can create weapons, or guns. The game has a pretty forgettable plot line, your sister is turning into stone and you have to get like 70 Starites, or something like that... Not too great but its acceptable.If you are looking for an easy 100% this game is perfect for you, this game took me only 8 hours to 100% (acheivements and all) The game itself is a piece of cake to get through, not very hard, Scribblenauts is a very casual game, which isn't bad. This game is actually very enjoyable, and will leave you wanting more even after a 100% completion!But then something more came... Scribblenauts Unmasked... I was unimpressed by this one as it limited you a lot more than Unlimited, the joy of Unlimited came in the fact that you could do anything however much you wanted, not in Unmasked, if you keep using the same thing you'll start getting punished.Pros: Easy 100%, Pretty chill game you can't really get stressed playing it, Creative, entertaining, Steam Workshop (I like the Wii U take on mods a little better, they have a whole new world added for mods which you could experiment with.), Achievements (Unlike the Wii U Version), Very fun, A WHOLE LOT better than Unmasked (If you don't get it yet, I really don't like Unmasked.), Fun for all ages!Cons: Short, Some worlds just suck in my opinion (I hated the storybook one, and many of the desert ones) you'll forget about many of them, The object shards are fun sometimes but can be boring spawning stuff in for like 2 hours which is required for a 100%, Nothing to do after you beat the main story and 100% in Unmasked you can do little events that continue.Geet Unlimited first, I liked it better than Unmasked, if they make another Scribblenauts game, I should have the mechanics of Unlimited with ideas from Unmasked. Unlimited gets a 8/10 very fun, yet very short.			"

												I really liked Scribblenauts Unlimited. I had a lot of fun coming up with creative solutions to the problems thorought the game, and I liked seeing all the little characters you could interact with, and even ones you could create. Only one or two had really reaching logic or unclear direction that had me stumped and annoyed. I actually found the backpack mechanic kind of useless, since I got so used to just pulling out the notebook and writing what I wanted. Overall, however, I'd recommend the game to anyone.			"

												This is just one of those games that get forces you to use your imagination and to really get involved in the game. It's a funny, cute, and positive game that can make even the grumpiest smile. As an artist I can appreciate the creativity that went into this game, I plan to create, design and even draw some art and share with the community. Love this game <3			"

												Ever wanted to have the power supreme, being able to materialize anything you could think of at a moment's notice? Annoyed with adventure games that reject your awesome solutions to the puzzles simply by not giving you the desired items? If you answered Yes to both, then Scribblenauts is for you. It encourages many ways to go about the challenges, or just wreak havoc on your fellow man, while still promoting creativity, and even if you are not that savvy about correct spelling, you might even learn something with this. Even if you try to be witty at first, it may be a while until you find something that is not in the game's vocabulary, apart from obscenities and copyrighted materials of course. And best of all, the visuals and characters as well as the music score are adorably cute!			"

I would definitely recommend this to anyone, I got it in the Warner Brothers Humble Bundle and played it on the off chance and it turned out to be a really well developed game with fast loading times and very few bugs.I would rate this game 8/10> Few Bugs> Fast load times> Not the best descriptions> Fun			"

												All I can say is wow.  When I purchased the original Scribblenauts for Nintendo DS, I had no idea this would be the result.  Using the adjectives for the first time (the original had no adjectives) was awesome.  The amount of fun is only limited to how big of an imagination you have.  Overall, it's an enjoyable, fun game if you're looking for a casual puzzle game that isn't as intense or hard as the Portal series.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is a title in its own genre: to the general public there is no game quite like it (and to this day I have not found any alternatives myself either). While the gameplay should be known to most of my readers, for the sake of completion I will elaborate on the game's objectives and means to succeed in them. The protagonist is Maxwell, a kid that gets his hands on a notebook with a magical power, being that everything written down in the notebook will magically appear. As ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and malicious little children are, he seized the opportunity to make the lives of others miserable, that is until a magician curses his sister and she is slowly consumed and converted into rock. The only way to stop this from happening is for him to make people, as well as animals and sometimes even inanimate objects, happy again. The player is presented with a sidescrolling 2D level including Maxwell, the aforementioned entities, and loads of hints that should indicate the player what to spawn for those in need. Some of these entities initiate a small storyline, while others are as simple as spawning a glass of water for someone that claims to be thirsty. There has obviously been a lot of work put into the levels as to not make them linear, and while this succeeded, the overall premise of the game makes it that it will still appear linear to the player. After all, your mission is to spawn the things you're asked for. The sandbox aspect of the game has some potential as far as humor is concerned (have you ever worn a pants that's armed with a sword and is fighting your t-shirt?), but to some this will be entertaining for a shorter period of time than it is to others. The music and sound complements the visuals and while these aspects aren't exactly extraordinary, they are good enough. In general I'd spend €10,- to €15,- if I was less cynical of a person. The reason I wouldn't scoop out that small amount from my budget is that I easily got bored with the sandbox aspect, but you'll have to keep in mind that I'm one of few uncommon gamers that is unable to enjoy the sandbox aspect of many other games like GTA1/4, Saints Row III and Just Cause 2, so I'm sure this will still appeal to a lot of folks out there.

												This game is like a 2D Garry's Mod, with a story mode replacing multiplayer. Maxwell's notepad features have improved since the last iterations of the game. The notepad itself spawns in almost anything. Want something that's not in the notepad? Browse on the workshop. Couldn't find it there either? Make it yourself with the object editor. Customizable avatars, too? Yes, please!  This alone makes the game a 8/10 in my book, but then it has an entire massive story mode. Full of awesomeness, brain-scrambling, and challenging at times. With games like these I'd rather mess with features like the object editor and etc., but the story mode is so welcoming that I find myself going back to it often. All in all, the game is just about perfect. 10/10, the only game that seems to go against it in my opinion is Starbound.			"

[*Type* small purple katar] can you do THAT?*weapon similar to Voldo's from soulcalibur appears, the size of my fist and purple*THAT ACTUALLY WORKED?!?!Everytime I typed something the game had something to give me, which blew me away. The possibilities are endless; it would take me weeks to figure out all the graphics the designers shoved into the dicionary. Obscure things like decahexane tetrachloride would actually yield results. If you wanna type Laser Rifle, that would work, or if you type a pew pew pew, you'll still get an alien gun. The level of vocabulary is so diverse. The only things it doesn't have are propernouns/copywrited material, obviously, or they might have to type Lawyer, and there's no profanity/adult content, which actually is pretty funny when you type♥♥♥♥♥and a donkey appears. The flaw to this game is that the main story only has a very limited number of hours to the gameplay, even if you go on to do notebook challenges. Unless you find it enjoyable to simply make your own stuff and play around in a sandbox (A massive one), which I do, you probably won't get more than 10-20 hours out of it, unless you're a child.

												Honestly, i was sceptical about playing Scribblenauts Unlimited.It looks simple enough, but does not look like my 'type' of game. Keeping an open mind I gave it a go!I was impressed!The game has you completing hundred of tasks ranging in difficulty and hilarity.You are equipped with a notepad which enables you to create just about anything, and add adjectives to objects and people!One task asks you to dispose of toxic waste in a better manner than being dumped on the sea floor.So i pulled out my note book, equipped myself with a rifle and shot the barrels up. They disappeared and task was accomplished.It's even just fun to mess with different adjectives and objects. I took a lion, a basic lion, added some wings, added adjectives 'massive, scary' and it immediately changed into a massive scary flying lion.As the game progresses, you find some tasks which are similar, but its fun to just do these in a more ridiculous way than you did it the last time!

												Fed people in the diner. You can literally feed a cannibal ""corpse"" or ""baby"". 12/10.Seriously though. This game gives you a lot of options for how to solve problems, and lets you apply a certain degree of customization to it. My only complaint is that (so far?) you only unlock brothers to play as. Is Lily really the only sister of the family? I think little girls would like female characters to play as too. Still, you can give the guys dresses and wigs to wear, so if you really wish to express your feminine side, get creative!You can also spawn gigantic beasts that attack people. Or ride around everywhere on a pegasus.			"

Youngsters addiction!Be careful what you do, this game actually is fun to play. You can mess around in your environment and ... well, just by adding adjectives or nouns you can change the game.Ohh, don't get too cocky though, you can get killed in this game too. And using the same words over and over again won't get you a high-score in the game. You can also create your own stuff. Well if you wish that is.It is a game in which the player can get creative, in a most verbose way, giving live to your own ideas to solve quests and riddles. And with each starite you get closer to the ultimate goal of the game.The game is captivating, because it has a lot of quite comedic capabilities. If you ever has a chance to lay your hands on this game for a low price, don't think twice, just get it - if you love creative games you should get it anyway, regardless of price!A clear vote for recommendation!

Then burn them too, Mission complete.The only gripe is after 50% of the game, it starts to get repetitive.There's only so many innocent creatures you can burn before it gets boring.On sale? GET IT.Not on sale? Still worth it if it is your kind of game, or you have children / psychotic teenage tendencies.			"

												When you first look at this game, your thinking ""This is a kids game, why would I play it?"" Well, that is also what I thought first. But my thoughts totally changed later when I dived into this game. The game may be designed for kids but in my opinion its for all ages. I was particularly impressed by the crap loads of words that the game had to offer. You have a notebook where you type in words that turn into objects. Or you can add a adjective to the object. There are missions where you help people or you can just mess around spawning stuff. I also like how they added the object editor which let's you add your custom objects.So if you can I definitely recommend you get the game. It is tons of fun and you will never be disappointed that you bought the game.			"

												This is a game I played the whole way through with my daughters. I manned the keyboard and mouse, but they solved all the puzzles. Simple childlike solutions are a valid approach to just about all the game's problems, and really the fun for an adult comes from doing things creatively in silly roundabout ways, and seeing if the game likes your style, as the challenge is just about nil.The premise is, the game presents you with loads of challenges in a globe full of different climates etc. Generally, people have a problem that needs to be solved. You are armed with a magic notepad that will create anything you write into it, and you can also use this to add adjectives to most objects or even in-game characters. So, you write in: ""Polka-dotted yellow cryptozoologist,"" and suddenly a spotted marigold gentleman in a jacket and hat will appear that has a keen interest in monsters. Then you can create ""Bigfoot"" and he will appear, and the former will walk over to investigate the latter.The game's problems occasionally require a bit more knowledge than a six year old can muster, including awareness of mythology, pop-culture or some complex relationships. However this can turn into a really great teachable moment as you can guide the kids through deciphering the answer, or take them through the process of learning the answer by quickly opening up a browser window and doing some research. In the cuddly context of the game, the knowledge feels useful and they seem to absorb it really well, and it's usually at least referential of practical info.Additionally, Scribblenauts Unlimited is the first game in the franchise that allows the player to make their own objects that they can later create with the notebook. While the amount of nouns the game recognizes is staggering, it's still quite amazing, considering there's loads of copyrighted or rated-E objects the game won't let you make, or just wacky stuff that isn't real or too specific for the game creators to have included. These objects are built on templates of objects that already exist, but they can be modified in every way visually with a simple layering / coloring system, and you can then further modify them by defining their relationships with other items, audio, etc. etc. I've used this to make stuff like Mike & Sully from Monsters Inc. (Cryptozoologists find them fascinating, by the way, check out my Workshop items if you want'em!)The only part of the game we haven't finished is an extra portion where there are loads of various interactions the designers want you to uncover. These are like achievements and are called things like ""Liar Liar Pants on Fire,"" so if you create a Criminal and a Lawyer in the same location (or otherwise anybody that pop-culture deems to be known liars), the influx of localized liars will automatically create a pair of pants that happens to be ablaze. There are literally hundreds of these things, ranging from the amusing to the obscure to the complicated, but at the very least they illustrate all the fun special cases that the designers went through the trouble to make happen. In a game that's all about making whatever you want, I appreciate that the designers took the time to make stuff interact as you'd expect, and this is a great way for them to pat themselves on the back by showing you how to get them all to happen.I recommend Scribblenauts to game designers and anyone with kids, or anybody that likes a super easy activity that lets you be creative.

												Played scribblenauts on the DS and it was amazing.Played the sequel and it got better.Played this, it could've been better.Scribblenauts unlimited is not a bad game, far from it. It's a good game but the only thing that made me sad is that they dumbed it down a bit. I like the free exploring through the world, create an object is fun and the starites do have humor in it.What i really miss is the diffeculty that the DS games had(wings and jetpacks were less OP as well).The starite missions are fun for its objectives and the humor it shows, the starite shards are also nicely done.Both starite and starite shard objectives have references to other things to make it even more complete.Overall Scribblenauts is a nice game to buy, it's well worth the price. If you don't like the price, just wait for a sale to come up.			"

												Scribblenauts is, to put it bluntly, a puzzle sandbox.  If you can think of whatever could be used to solve a puzzle (or not), you can type it's name and summon it.  This game also includes adjectives, so you can write ""explosive rainbow bacon"" and get just that.  If the game cannot summon it, just hop on over to the workshop and see what others have made, or make it yourself with the painlessly easy object creator/editor.  Suddenly you've got yourself a nuclear bacon launcher and catgirl with the face of an elder god in the game.  It's extremely easy and wholly entertaining to ignore the main game and wreak utter havoc with what you summon.  The game makes you the closest thing to a physical god as possible, so go completely nuts.			"

Then burn them too, Mission complete.The only gripe is after 50% of the game, it starts to get repetitive.There's only so many innocent creatures you can burn before it gets boring.On sale?

												Honestly, i was sceptical about playing Scribblenauts Unlimited.It looks simple enough, but does not look like my 'type' of game. Keeping an open mind I gave it a go!I was impressed!The game has you completing hundred of tasks ranging in difficulty and hilarity.You are equipped with a notepad which enables you to create just about anything, and add adjectives to objects and people!One task asks you to dispose of toxic waste in a better manner than being dumped on the sea floor.So i pulled out my note book, equipped myself with a rifle and shot the barrels up. They disappeared and task was accomplished.It's even just fun to mess with different adjectives and objects. I took a lion, a basic lion, added some wings, added adjectives 'massive, scary' and it immediately changed into a massive scary flying lion.As the game progresses, you find some tasks which are similar, but its fun to just do these in a more ridiculous way than you did it the last time!

												Fed people in the diner. You can literally feed a cannibal ""corpse"" or ""baby"". 12/10.Seriously though. This game gives you a lot of options for how to solve problems, and lets you apply a certain degree of customization to it. My only complaint is that (so far?) you only unlock brothers to play as. Is Lily really the only sister of the family? I think little girls would like female characters to play as too. Still, you can give the guys dresses and wigs to wear, so if you really wish to express your feminine side, get creative!You can also spawn gigantic beasts that attack people.

Youngsters addiction!Be careful what you do, this game actually is fun to play. You can mess around in your environment and ... well, just by adding adjectives or nouns you can change the game.Ohh, don't get too cocky though, you can get killed in this game too. And using the same words over and over again won't get you a high-score in the game. You can also create your own stuff. Well if you wish that is.It is a game in which the player can get creative, in a most verbose way, giving live to your own ideas to solve quests and riddles. And with each starite you get closer to the ultimate goal of the game.The game is captivating, because it has a lot of quite comedic capabilities. If you ever has a chance to lay your hands on this game for a low price, don't think twice, just get it - if you love creative games you should get it anyway, regardless of price!A clear vote for recommendation!

												Scribblenauts Unlimted is the game you go to when you want to let your imagination run wild. You want a ridable fire-breathing huge Cthulu? You can have it. You want a diamond coat? You can have it.Anything you want, in this game, there's a 90% chance you can have it. And if the thing you want isn't in the game? Make it yourself or download something like it from the Steam Workshop! :DYou are Maxwell, and your sister, Lily, has been cursed by an evil old man and is turning into stone, and the only way to stop her from fully turning into stone is by going out around the world and doing good deeds for people to collect ""Starites"" to make everything better, and for her to stop turning into stone.With your magical notebook, you can create anything you want, your imagination can run wild in this game.The game also comes with Steam Achievements and Trading Cards, as well as Workshop support for the game, so getting new content is so easy, just by the click of a button!The replay value in the game is pretty large, considering you can do anything you want, and collecting all of the stariets will be quite a challenge, but rewarding in the end.The game can get pretty repetitive at times though, which is unfortunate, considering it shouldn't be repetitive at all, there's a lot of ""I want this"" quests, and it can get quite annoying after a while, doing the same quest for a person with a different name.I give this game an 8.9/10, it's a great game, but a few shortcomings stop it from being a perfect game.I still would recommend you to buy it, it's worth the asking price of £14.99.

												It's casual.  And open world.  And it invokes creativity.  And it is even intelligent in certain aspects.  However, perhaps the main feature that makes this game really neat is because although it gives an ample selection of pre-created objects & NPCs in any given part of the game's world, you can create practically anything imaginable using your Notepad, and then add in-game ""Adjectives"" that describe the object and will alter its behavior.  To top it off, this amazing game comes complete with Steam Workshop support, so you can share your fun creations with others and utilize their content in your own gameplay.  Definately recommend you try it!			"

												Scribblenauts unlimited is a great game!This game has a nice gameplay and has an interesting story. Reasons why this game is AWESOME: *Can be addicting*As I said, a nice gameplay*Workshop*Great expierence*Variety of things you can spawnAnd much moreThis is a great gameI rate 7/10. Why? It's only singleplayer, Isn't as unlimited as it says and can be glitchy, and is fairly expensive... But hey! This game is still good and I still rated 7/10. If you are about to buy the game, I recommend you do so!			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is a brilliant concept. You're faced with a myriad of problems throughout the game and have to solve them by conjuring items from a magic notebook. The number of items you can conjure is impressive. Everything from the Kraken, to God, to microbes and dark matter can be summoned to solve challenges. You can spend ages figuring out the most ingenious way to solve a puzzle, and seeing your solution finally work is satisfying. Unfortunately, there's little incentive to solve puzzles this way when more obvious methods are just as effective. Some items cannot be summoned at all, even if they seem obvious (blood comes to mind). Nevertheless, Scribblenauts is a charming puzzler which can be fun for adults as well as the kids.			"

												Scribblenauts is a lot of fun without going very deep. You can enjoy the entire world map and the main story without getting any object shards... little word-play puzzles based on how seperate objects interact. And this is what I did. I finished the whole game, unaware that I hadn't done everything I could.Then, when I noticed all those achievements I hadn't gotten, I opened the menu, looked at the ""shards"" and immediately became twice as entertained. That's right: I became twice as entertained once I'd _finished_ the game.A beauty queen is tired of being pretty. Make her a ""lycanthropic beauty queen"" and spawn a full moon, and you get a shard. That's what an object shard is. And it's amazing.I'm plowing through all those now, but suffice to say, this game is creative and fun and it makes me happy. Avoid the temptation to look any of the answers up; The puzzles are fairly simple and you'll get it on one or two tries, and there's nothing more gratifying than figuring out a solution like lycanthropic beauty queen.Buy.

												I know this may sound really silly, but this is one of the best games i have ever played... everything about it is fun, from the characters to the level design, and the music to the story... In terms of difficulty, the game is as difficult as you make it to basically a situation arises, and you type in a word and whatever you type in appears in front of you... situations can be overcome simply, or by taking a more extravagant approach, for example in one mission you have to defend a base from attack, it says to spawn an army, so i spawned an army of alien robots, wearing jetpacks and firing laser rifles... this is just a little of what the game has to offer.. rewarding you for creating things at random too, and there are many guides out there that can help :)			"

												- If you've played the previous Scribblenauts, would not recommend.- If you've never heard of Scribblenauts in your life and you like coming up with creative answers to things, go for it. My view's quite biased as I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the original and ESPECIALLY Super Scribblenauts, big fan of the series, but was severely disappointed with Unlimited.A lot easier and boring than the previous Scribblenauts. 3/4s of the way through, still not having any fun, except for the odd randomness here and there.The answers are either really stupidly obvious or really stupidly not-obvious - and that's not in a funny way.I liked the old 'advanced' system, where you'd have to replay the levels with different answers every time. That encouraged more creative thinking.The hints are also a lot more blatant in Unlimited - ""Try using a hat"" or ""He wants a place to sleep"".But, the new object editor feature is pretty damn awesome. Made a cat-spawning afro, spawned hundreds of cats, didn't crash, 10/10. Though I kind of wish the old level maker was still in the game, that would've kept me more interested in the game if we could try other people's levels.			"

												A GREAT successor to Super Scribblenauts(DS). The story(while simple) works well, and we even get an explanation for why the starites appear. The Object Editor is a great way to incorporate the Steam workshop, and allow others to distribute their creations to others. While I do feel like 5th Cell dumbed down the notepad gimmick by making some puzzles too easy, I still really enjoyed the game. The art style is great, the creativity is still there, the music is outstanding, and the graphics are amzing.  Just like it's predessessors, you're pretty much required to have a good imagination to play this game, and I don't believe that it will be a problem for this game at all.			"

												I spent a little over 10 hours in this game doing every level and every side quest. I did not do the mini-puzzles in the book but I did every level.I enjoyed the game quite a bit, but almost the entire game was too easy and the puzzles were funny but not hard.The basic idea is that you can use a book to spell out any item or change a description of an item to solve puzzles. You can be very creative and specific or you can be simple and generic.... both will generally solve the puzzles.There was no combat missions, or create a situation level... so after I played every level, I decided to goof around and make ""massive epic mega ultra portal"" and have giant monsters do battle, but quickly found that playing outside of puzzles isn't as fun as i wanted.Cool game, worth it but only for the casual who is creative.

												Personal Rating: 8 of 10Great fun for the young and adult. Scribblenauts is a puzzle adventure games where you travel from one map to another and help the characters residing in the area by creating and manipulating objects! You can create from animals to robots to even becoming Zeus yourself. The game offers unlimited space for your imagination and creativity. Play with your family and kids as this seems to be a great platform for learning as well. However, you can only create objects that are not copyrighted and the objects comes in limited visuals; but this can be overcome by downloading objects designed by other players or create your own in the editor.

Also there's limits, nothing is unlimited. EXCEPT FOR MY ABILITY TO REVIEW GAMES!!!! I AM AN UNSTOPPABLE DESTROYER OF ALL EXPECTATIONS AND REALITY.

												Sbcribblenauts is a very unique type of game. You are given the power to create anything, and i mean anything. Even if it isn't programmed into the game, chances aer someone on steam has made it and uploaded it. If not, you can create it yourself. The visuals are cartoony, like a drawing, and the sound is nice and cheerful. The story consists of you helping multiple people to make them happy. It dose get boring after a while, but it's always fun to mess around and see what kind of crazy situation you can get yourself into. 8/10			"

												Perhaps the best game to play when you feel too tired to play much else. It is also perhaps the only game where tophats make anything and anyone instantly handsome, you can get attacked by an overgrown cyborg cat boy riding a magic flying carpet armed with a giant a machine gun you accidentally conjured using a magic notebook and travel around on a flying skateboard summoning demonic winged moustaches and giant neon octopus minions to take over the world while building robots that shoot waffles out of glue and toasters!

												Were you ever bored after playing your Team Fortress or your Left 4 Dead and wondered to yourself ""Hm which game I can send my imagnation free... Make anything I want without any trouble"" Well then Scribblenauts Unlimited is perfect for you (Well.. Besides GMOD) in Scribblenauts Unlimited the story is simple two parents created a crap load of children and deciced to give their favorite ones apparently Lilly and Maxwell a Globe to go anywhere you want and a Book to create anything you want. Later Maxwell and Lilly meet a weird old man who was hungry for an apple so Maxwell deciced to create an apple. But not any apple he thought it was a clever idea to give him a Poison Apple cause he thought it was funny but jokes on him the Old man did not like the apple Maxwell gave him so he turned his sister into stone and the only way to get her back to normal is too collect all the starites scattered across the world.. SO HAVE FUN!			"

Aside for another great story across many boards that challenge your ability to think of fun, creative or creepy solutions to problems big and small, this installment also includes the Object Editor, where you can take anything and make anything. A giant grandma with cars for arms that shoots out cats at clowns? Done. A hydra that has a dog head, a dragon head and an ant head that is colored like a sweater? Check. A purple angel that explodes when it comes in contact with cheese in a nuclear fireball? Bingo.I've had hours and hours of fun with this game and it never gets old. It's worth every penny			"

												Surprisingly complex and addictive. Had a bash on this because of the Humble Bundle. Heard it was great, and was not dissapointed.Some of the puzzels make little sence (like a board dude not being excited by cthulu/Giants/Explosions animated around him) but it still has a great theme. The music is pretty nice as well. And the plot seems to be a thrownback to the old NES days. Simple structure, but good moral and nice charecters.If you can find this on the cheap, pick it.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is a very impressive game. The whole point of the game is to simply conjure any item you want (within reason) at any time. The Scribblenauts series consists of a range of small puzzles that require you to use whatever items you want to complete your objective, earning a star in the process. Scribblenauts Unlimited differs from the previous game in the series by having a small free-roam element that steps away from simply clicking on the unlocked level you want to do, but rather you find puzzles through exploration. Another new feature is the object creation, where players may create their own items that they can share online. I recommend this game for puzzle fans with imagination, people who think outside 'the box' and idiots who want to see Deadpool fight an army of vampires while riding Alduin.			"

 Positive + Simplistic and cute art style+ Big variety in the amount of objects and creations you can generate, sometimes leading to comedic outcomes+ Good enough length for what the gameplay has to offer (around 4 ½ hours for the main game, add another 2-3 hours if you want to do everything the game offers). Negative - Gameplay is overall too simple (though the game is targeted at a younger audience, so this is intentional). Verdict “A very fun and creative package, Scribblenauts Unlimited gives the user an environment with (almost) complete free reign to design solutions to many various problems. Think word association with added charm.” 7.5/10 TJBs   "

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is your average scribblenauts game. Scribblenauts, as you may already know, started out as a series of Nintendo DS games, Like Scribblenauts and Super Scribblenauts.Now, Don't look away from this game. This game, is, in MY opinion, is the best game in the entire series. Now, lets start with the plot. One time, long ago, there were two young adventurers, Grandma Julie, and Grandpa Edgar. Now, these two often challenged eachother as they explored all over the world. But, it always seemed Julie beat Edgar to the treasure. One day, Julie, Who once again, Beats Edgar to a lost pyramid, Found an engagement ring! Awww... The two retired to start a family. And wanna guess how many kids they had? FORTY FREAKING TWO. Anyways. They had two special  children, named Maxwell and Lily. They gave them Two amazing gifts. One of them was a magic globe, that allowed them to go anywhere they pleased. The second, was the greatest notebook ever found-- It was able to create anything you wrote into it. ""Like a flying rainbow laser-eyed dolphin?"" ... Yes .... Anyways, They're parents, (Yeah, Remeber them?) Thought that giving them these gifts will turn them into spoiled brats. So they sent them off, to face the challenges of the outside world. On they way to the city, they ran into an old man, who said he was famished. So Maxwell, ignoring common sense and not using the notebook for good, Gave the old man something to eat, Which was an apple. No. Not any regular apple, A rotten one! The old man spat out the part of the apple he ate, and somehow places a curse on Lily that is turning her to stone! Maxwell creates a red wagon, and hurrys off to Edwin's Farm. Edwin, who is one of maxwell's brothers, is a farmer. Edwin seemed pretty upset with Maxwell and what he did to the peasant. So, in order to remove the curse, Maxwell needs to collect Starites, by making people happy and using the notebook for good. DANG! That was a pretty dang long plot summary. Anyways, onto the next segment of this review. GRAPHICS! This game. Oh my gosh, THIS GAME. Has some of the best graphics I have ever seen! Not only to we get to learn Maxwell's Backstory, But we learn in in HD Graphics! Next up, MUSIC!My gosh, they went all out with the soundtrack on this one. It sounds aboslutely wonderful! Its just a joy to listen to. GAMEPLAY! Now, heres the thing that is just so cool about scribblenauts. You can CREATE anything you write down! And you use this to your advantage to solve puzzles! DOWNSIDE! Well, the real downside is, that it seems that the puzzles have been... A bit.. Simplifed... And thats what kind of drags about this game. The puzzles are either really easy, which is about 45% of them, Medium, about the same, 45%, and Hard? About 10%. So, The games difficulty is so out of place, like, sometimes, theres an easy level with ONE single hard puzzle in it. That is the downside to this game. But, Sence it IS a scribblenauts game, You know, YOU KNOW It has to be good. My rating? 9.3 out of 10. Scribblenauts Unlimited, Is alot better than the ones on DS, but sometimes the difficulty gets in the way. But I still recommend you give it a go.			"

Most of the enjoyment is probably derived from the player's creativity and not inherent in the puzzle design, but that's an advantage if anything.The only real downside is the vast amounts of glaring sexism everywhere in the game (the single female main character, of 50 something others, starts out as a damsel in distress, spending most of the game dying? really?)

												Told me to put something in a dungeon to fight a dragon - I put a knight in... Answer - an angel?????? All kinds of messed up.  This is one of the strangest, most morbid games I have ever played.  And is supposed to be educational and for families...I have had people eat other people, tons of violence, and so on... so what is my verdict? HIGHLY RECOMMENDED OF COURSE!  Obviously this is the best game for your three year old!			"

												This is one that kinda surprised me. I suspected that I would enjoy it, as I'm a fan of puzzle games and word problems. But what really caught me off guard was how charming it is. It's obviously a game for kids, however there's a very basic pleasure in seeing the choices you make come to life. Even though simple, it is fun. Kinda like solving a crossword, mixed with a mild-mannered saturday morning cartoon.There's not a lot to say other than that. The story is very simple, and it's really just a fun word puzzle game. But if you want a bit of fun which tickles the brain, it's certainly a good source of that.			"

												Great puzzle game with a different twist. You solve the puzzles on your own way by writing down and making objects or changing the status of certain things. It also has an object editor which you can use to make up pretty much anything. The story isn't really the selling point of the game but the ability to solve each puzzle on your own way is. The soundtrack is kinda nice and relaxing at the same time. I definitely recommend Scribblenauts Unlimited to anyone who loves puzzle games or is just looking for a casual and fun tittle to play.

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is your average scribblenauts game. Scribblenauts, as you may already know, started out as a series of Nintendo DS games, Like Scribblenauts and Super Scribblenauts.Now, Don't look away from this game. This game, is, in MY opinion, is the best game in the entire series. Now, lets start with the plot. One time, long ago, there were two young adventurers, Grandma Julie, and Grandpa Edgar. Now, these two often challenged eachother as they explored all over the world. But, it always seemed Julie beat Edgar to the treasure. One day, Julie, Who once again, Beats Edgar to a lost pyramid, Found an engagement ring! Awww... The two retired to start a family. And wanna guess how many kids they had? FORTY FREAKING TWO. Anyways. They had two special  children, named Maxwell and Lily. They gave them Two amazing gifts. One of them was a magic globe, that allowed them to go anywhere they pleased. The second, was the greatest notebook ever found-- It was able to create anything you wrote into it. ""Like a flying rainbow laser-eyed dolphin?"" ... Yes .... Anyways, They're parents, (Yeah, Remeber them?) Thought that giving them these gifts will turn them into spoiled brats. So they sent them off, to face the challenges of the outside world. On they way to the city, they ran into an old man, who said he was famished. So Maxwell, ignoring common sense and not using the notebook for good, Gave the old man something to eat, Which was an apple. No. Not any regular apple, A rotten one! The old man spat out the part of the apple he ate, and somehow places a curse on Lily that is turning her to stone! Maxwell creates a red wagon, and hurrys off to Edwin's Farm. Edwin, who is one of maxwell's brothers, is a farmer. Edwin seemed pretty upset with Maxwell and what he did to the peasant. So, in order to remove the curse, Maxwell needs to collect Starites, by making people happy and using the notebook for good. DANG! That was a pretty dang long plot summary. Anyways, onto the next segment of this review. GRAPHICS! This game. Oh my gosh, THIS GAME. Has some of the best graphics I have ever seen! Not only to we get to learn Maxwell's Backstory, But we learn in in HD Graphics! Next up, MUSIC!My gosh, they went all out with the soundtrack on this one. It sounds aboslutely wonderful! Its just a joy to listen to. GAMEPLAY! Now, heres the thing that is just so cool about scribblenauts. You can CREATE anything you write down! And you use this to your advantage to solve puzzles! DOWNSIDE! Well, the real downside is, that it seems that the puzzles have been... A bit.. Simplifed... And thats what kind of drags about this game. The puzzles are either really easy, which is about 45% of them, Medium, about the same, 45%, and Hard? About 10%. So, The games difficulty is so out of place, like, sometimes, theres an easy level with ONE single hard puzzle in it. That is the downside to this game. But, Sence it IS a scribblenauts game, You know, YOU KNOW It has to be good. My rating? 9.3 out of 10. Scribblenauts Unlimited, Is alot better than the ones on DS, but sometimes the difficulty gets in the way. But I still recommend you give it a go.			"

												I have completed this game and have gone through all the missions and done all the achievements, and I can tell you it's not as fun as I expected. It's good for the first <10 hours and then it starts to get awfully repetitive and quite boring. It really needed something more to stop it from getting boring. I think that if you have played any Scribblenauts game before,  it's really not worth your money as they are all practically the same. However on the bright side it is rather fun to play around with different props and items and to make traps and experiment with weapons and monsters (try 'cthulu').Overall I'd give it a 6.5/10 because of its repetitive gameplay.

 Positive + Simplistic and cute art style+ Big variety in the amount of objects and creations you can generate, sometimes leading to comedic outcomes+ Good enough length for what the gameplay has to offer (around 4 ½ hours for the main game, add another 2-3 hours if you want to do everything the game offers). Negative - Gameplay is overall too simple (though the game is targeted at a younger audience, so this is intentional). Verdict “A very fun and creative package, Scribblenauts Unlimited gives the user an environment with (almost) complete free reign to design solutions to many various problems.

												If you're looking for a game review than you came to the wrong place, now if you wanted a delicious pancake recipe...Ingredients + EquipmentYou’ll need a mixing bowl, a wire whisk, a spatula and a non-stick griddle or skillet. An electric griddle works wonders too, if you make a lot of pancakes at your house. The ingredients you’ll need are:1 ¼ cup milk  2 eggs 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons sugar 3 teaspoons baking powder ¼ teaspoon saltThe BatterPancakes aren’t complicated, so the batter is everything! For best results, mix that bowl of batter up right before it’s going to hit the griddle.The wet ingredients come together first. Beat the milk, eggs and vegetable oil in a mixing bowl with a wire whisk.The dry ingredients—flour, baking powder, sugar and salt—are then stirred into the wet mixture. Baking powder is what makes the pancakes fluffy, while the sugar helps the exterior caramelize just enough. And a dash of our friend salt enhances the flavor.Gently mix everything together until it’s combined, but still lumpy. It’ll only take about 10-15 seconds to get to that liquidy-lumpy state. If you over-mix the batter, you’re going to be chowing down on a very tough, rubbery pancake because the gluten molecules start having a party. If you under-mix, you might end up with a mouthful of flour.The CookingBrush a non-stick griddle or skillet with vegetable oil, clarified butter or cooking spray before heating. You don’t need too much with a nonstick pan. (You may be tempted to use regular butter, but it tends to burn easily. Save the butter for the breakfast table.)Heat the griddle over medium-high heat. To determine when the griddle is ready for pancake action, run your hand under the faucet and carefully flick just a tiny bit of water onto the surface of the pan. The water droplets will bead up and sizzle when it’s ready.Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the hot griddle and cook 1-2 minutes or until the bubbles on the surface have finished popping and the pancake is dry around the edges.Now it’s time to flip. Using a spatula, gently turn the pancake over and cook on the other side until golden brown.Serve warmFluffy PancakesPrint Recipe  (0)    0 View Full RecipeIngredientsStepsHow to Keep Pancakes HotIf you’re cooking for a crowd, turn the oven to 325°F and put your finished pancakes on a baking sheet as they come off the griddle. That way they all stay hot until you are ready to eat.How to Store Leftover Pancakes in the FreezerStack cooled pancakes between a sheet of waxed paper or parchment. Wrap the stack in foil and freeze. To reheat, preheat the oven to 400°F. Unwrap frozen pancakes and remove from waxed paper. Heat pancakes in a single layer on an ungreased cookie sheet for 5 to 7 minutes or until heated through.How to Store Leftover BatterStoring leftover batter is one of those things one could technically do, but should one? Nah, one really shouldn’t.The baking powder loses its oomph very quickly and the gluten molecules have a field day of chewiness when they are allowed to sit around. Rather than storing leftover batter, we recommend making just the right amount of batter for your breakfast or cooking up the whole batch and storing leftover pancakes in the freezer as directed above.Back To TopTwists on PancakesPancakes are meant to be twisted! There are so many ways you can upgrade your pancakes, from batter mix-ins to mid-griddle additions to final toppings.Batter mix-ins might include pureed pumpkin with pumpkin pie spice, lemon zest and ricotta cheese or even mashed bananas. Our Gingerbread Pancakes are perfect for the holidays. Buttermilk is a common substitute for milk in pancakes too, as the acidity provides extra volume, browning and flavor. Adding additional (or different) wet ingredients may mean you need to adjust your dry ingredients accordingly, so unless you’re simply shaking a bit of cinnamon into your batter, you’ll want to follow a recipe to make sure your flavored pancakes turn out perfectly.Mid-griddle additions would include those tasty bits that you’ll want to place on your hot cakes before you flip them—things like whole berries, chocolate chips, crunchy granola or little pieces of bacon. Adding these types of things to the individual pancakes rather than the batter helps them stay evenly distributed and keeps them from burning. You can use the same Fluffy Pancake recipe outlined above and easily personalize it with whatever you like without changing the batter.Topping options are pretty much unlimited when it comes to pancakes, and also don’t require any new recipe. Obviously butter and maple syrup are classic pancake pairings for a reason—there is no substitute for a hefty drizzle of real maple syrup. But it’s also wonderful to think outside the syrup container and try topping your pancakes with jam, caramel, nuts, fruit, whipped cream, sprinkles and more!8 Easy Twists on Pancakes Gingerbread PancakesGingerbread Pancakes Blueberry Sour Cream PancakesBl			"

												I never really did like Scribblenauts on the Nintendo DS, but it was a great concept nevertheless. Imagine that you can write down anything - ANYTHING - in your notepad and it appears as an (animated) object. That's... that's just awesome, don't you agree ? All you need is a bit of imagination and you create the wildest things.Still, I was a bit sceptic when I purchased and played Scribblenauts Unlimited because: 1) I thought it would be a simple port, and 2) it wouldn't be any fun for me now (if it wasn't already back then, right ?). I'm so glad I was wrong - once again.Scribblenauts is an amazing port, with beautiful art that looks extremely detailed in 2560x1440. The overview map is the one thing that looks kinda low res. Other than that; great stuff. And there are so many (parts of) stars to collect that you'll never run out of things to do (ok, maybe not, but still...). This game has character !Another thing that took some time to get used to, though, was the fact that you have to switch between mouse and keyboard frequently. It's nothing major, but it's a bit clumsy.Scribblenauts should be in anyone's collection, especially considering the price.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												When this game first came out it was original and different and I remember enjoying the original Scribblenauts on my Nintendo DS, but playing it now the puzzles feel dull and takes an excruciatingly low amount of effort to solve a problem. Aside from the main quest there are ""Starite shards"" which take up most of the game and often has the f*cking answer in the question itself. I feel like this is how this game should of been all along and they shouldn't of made multiple entries in this series. This game is fun at the start but gets extremely boring and repetitive quite quickly. I can't help but feel this game is very childish and is marketed towards younger audiences with everything being resolved by common sense. ""Hey I need to get smarter do something"" *Adds smart adjective to the character* ""Hey I'm smart now you did it"" HOORAY -_- I really can't help but feel dissapointed by this game.			"

												A polished and full-featured offering to the Scribblenauts series. Being on PC and having access to things like the keyboard and the Steam Workshop greatly improve the game. It is somewhat annoying to have to figure out what the game wants you to say, as its understanding of words can be limited at time. For instance, one puzzle needs you to evaluate a piece of art and typing ""art expert"" doesn't work, but ""expert"" by itself does. A mechanic can't repair a robot because a mechanic repairs cars, but a scientist can because science. Little things like that. Luckily those issues aren't usually a huge barrier to progress.			"

I love sandbox games, and this brought a whole new meaning to that genre to meI may be a little late to discover this game, but all these things still apply today. OverviewVenture into a wide-open world where the most powerful tool is your imagination. Help Maxwell solve robust puzzles in seamless, free-roaming levels by summoning any object you can think of. Create your own original objects, assign unique properties, and share them with friends online using Steam Workshop – to be used in game or further modified as you like! Points of interestThe amount of things you can create and do in this game is staggering, plus it's got steam workshop!If it exists, you can probably type it!Animate your creations with adjectives, provides for even more possibilities.The puzzles are fun and can be completed in many different ways, not just one.Around 13 or 14 hours of gameplay to complete the storyEasy to 100% achievments-Some puzzles may be difficult for kids, but there is always guides to help with that.-Controls can be a little frustrating if you use your mouse to move, and clicking on things can be challenging, but WASD is a welcome alternativeSummaryA charming game full of possibilities. Recommended for all ages: great for the kids or for you to play in your spare time! 9/10			"

												When the astoundingly ambitious Scribblenauts was originally released for the Nintendo DS I completely loved it.  You were tasked with solving a simple puzzle – get a starite (the game’s star-shaped macguffin), and to do so you could conjure up just about any item you could think of, from the commonplace like cars and ladders, to more outside-the-box things like arsonists and marimbas.  I was always surprised such an excellent game was made by 5th Cell, a game company that was, up to that point, a veritable mediocrity factory.  Was 5th Cell secretly a team of amazing game designers?Scribblenauts Unlimited answers this question with a resounding “No.”Unlimited introduces some new features that should make this game a hit – like an item editor that allows you to create your own stuff.  And, as much as I appreciate a game that allows me to make a bazooka that shoots newborn infants, the new mission-style of the game itself is what ruins it.  Doing a simple task like “get a starite” was rewarding because the solution was open to your imagination.  There was any number of solutions you could use and solving a level made you feel smart and accomplished.  When someone gives you a mission in Unlimited by saying “Boy, I’m hungry.” I don’t care if you say pizza, artichokes, or quinoa, thinking of a kind of food will never feel like an accomplishment.  Also, people who give their missions out to you exist in such a cramped space, sometimes you accidentally solve other peoples’ missions without intending to.			"

												 you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients- To Make the Dough375 grams (3 cups) plain flour1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) waterExtra flour for dusting - To Make Cheese Filling15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.1/2 cup cheddar cheese2 eggs, lightly beaten1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper- ExtrasYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)Parmesan cheeseBasilFried vegetablesShrimpFish slicesChicken pieces Make the Ravioli filling.- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												The fun of this game comes from thinking up and creating absurd items. The problem is that none of the puzzles require absurd items like flaming helicopters, dancing hippos, or angry claymores to solve, so you end up using the same five items over and over because you know they work, thus turning the game into tedious chore.

More Bells and Whistles with Less Challenging PuzzlesLike Lego, I am more impressed by its predecessors(the originals) than the later editionsWAY back when I remember my friend showed me Scribblenauts, I was determined to achieve all stars/most creative methods on all levels. I borrowed her game and played it religiously.Less is more?This edition has a coreherent world, an editor to create your own customized items among other functions. Yet, I feel that because all the puzzles are scenario-specific to fit into the world, the possibilities become limited. Trust me, I have summoned a Gentlemanly Cthuhlu to scare a pegasus drawing a piece of rope to move a car...or an oil rig to crush a bad guy...so I have tried my best to solve problems impractically. In the end, something is still kind of lacking...Some of my overall positve experienceEasy to learn and navigate, but the menu can be a bit cumbersomeCharacters and art is still bright and quirky as everCreate and use your own character instead of eg.MaxwellCute but confined scenariosStill a unique puzzle gameConsAs i have mentioned, more restrictive than is predecessorThe user base creation becomes mostly flooded with fanart of games and memes Personally I was hoping to see a game that encourages creative problem solving and ridiculous thinking rather than being  limited by a series of very situational scenariosConclusion:Take a wee bit of my money or none at all: I am reluctantly giving this a not recommended rating because I have seen better release from the Scribblenauts series. It is still a fun game but it has definitely fallen short. As a result, it's not a must have. Feel free to purchase this though, as it can still be entertaining.			"

												This series used to be good, and it still is in a way.  But after the adjective system was added, the challenge, and the value of most of the game, was lost.  What used to be a game that tested your ability in word association has now turned into a game about making up nonsensical items.  The ways you can solve puzzles now are so easy; you could complete a majority of the game using nothing but sticks.  Here are a few examples:""Make an item that will put out this fire."" CRYING STICK""Prepare a steak for this customer"" COOKING STICK""Make something for this art museum"" BEAUTIFUL MODERN STICK""Give Santa something he likes, but doesn't already have"" MERRY STICK""Scare away the Vampire"" HOLY STICK""Make this date more romantic"" ROMANTIC STI- actually, don't use that one.Point is, the game has been simplified by this mechanic, and it doesn't reward you in any way for being logical or creative.  Kinda sad, because if they did, you would have a clear, straight upgrade of a game from the first Scribblenauts.  The workshop is flooded with poor remakes of copyrighted characters; something that was purposely left out in the original games.  Its a shame I can't recommend this, because the amount of work put into the engine and content would definitely be worth the $20 price tag if the single player wasn't so absurdly easy.  The most enjoyable part of this game is derping around like its a sandbox game.  If that sounds like something you would get a kick out of, by all means buy this.  Just know that the single player ain't worth♥♥♥♥♥♥PS: This game has a sequel with DC Comic characters in it.  Same kind of game play, and the addition of DC characters doesn't do much for the game itself.  About the only thing that it does is add visual assets to the workshop mods.  So... you're not really missing much in that one either :v  I guess go for it if you are a fan of derping and comic book hero's?			"

												I recommend this game for children that already know or are learning how to read and write. Do I recommend this game to adults? No.This game is simply not challenging enough for an adult to play. The starite sequences are easy to complete, and the shard hints are easy to figure out. When it comes down to it, the most gameplay you'll be engaging in is pressing ""Enter"" and typing. True, you can do some goofy things like making people blind and making animals fly, turn colors, or force school children to eat cats, but when that is said and done, the game doesn't get much more entertaining.The achievements are rather easy to unlock aswell. All of the shards are available to unlock without any prerequisites, and the starites are achieved through normal gameplay. The most backtrackingI had to do was resetting a level maybe three times. It's nearly impossible to fail at this game unless you accidentally get Maxwell killed. There are no timed levels and the game eventually tells you what to spawn if you take too long to complete a task during a starite mission. My five year old loved this game. He enjoyed the themed levels, the ability to spawn almost anything, and how he could interact with almost all of the objects. We would often play together and the game motivated him to learn how to spell.  He would ask me how to spell certain words and I believe the game made learning a little bit more enjoyable for him. He played this game for a long time before moving on to Scribblenauts: Unmasked.			"

												EN Super fun, original and interactive, you are sure to have good times when playing this. This is a game I don't see getting bothered too soon.      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PT Super divertido, original e interactivo, é garantido passar uns bons momentos enquantos jogas. Este é um gajo que não vejo a aborrecer-me tão rapidamente.Devo avisar, para quem não está familiarizado com o inglês pense duas vezes, porque será bastante difícil jogar, visto que se tratar de um jogo à base de escrever inúmeras palavras em inglês, aquelas que nos vierem ao imaginário.

												Scribblenauts is finally available on PC (and now finally available in Europe as well!)  It's a fun little game that has you solve word puzzles by typing in words to create just about anything you could want.  Objects can be modified with a wide variety of adjectives and you can ever create your own objects with custom scripting.  If something isn't in the game already you can easily go find it on the Steam Workshop or create it yourself.To the game itself, it is very fun.  Puzzles can be solved in a wide variety of different ways, giving you room to be creative.  A few of the puzzles are very obtuse which is an annoyance when you run into them, but it's not game breaking.I'm not sure what else there is to say.  Go buy this game!			"

												Scribblenouts Unlimited is one of the most fun casual puzzle games I have ever played. Pretty much all puzzles are very easy (if you know the language well enough) which usually makes for a horrible and boring game, but that's not the case with this one. It's because difficulty is not the mane goal of this theme, it's creativity. In this game puzzles are completed by writing nouns to create new objects or adding adjectives to existing objects. Once you get the gang of the mechanics of the game it becomes ridiculously fun. My personal highlight of the game was the moment when I had to retrieve a ball from an old dudes yard without him noticing aaaaaaaand I just added the adjective ""blind"" to him. I felt so evil once it worked.Get it you dummy!			"

												Have you seen a Flying Rideable Hipster Manical Supersonic Supercharged Sparkling Golden Toaster Oven!? Well I have. You can too if you get this game of PURE FUN.Don't let the cartoony style fool you into thinking this is a game for kids, this is easily one of the most f*cked up games I've ever played to date. In just 20 minutes of play I've helped a chef at his restaurant cook up random things that his customers wanted, one guy wanted pizza so I gave the chef human body parts for his pizza ingredients that made a lovely human pizza afterwards, the dude totally ate the whole thing without a clue, ha ha dummy. The next person wanted a motorcycle... okay, wrong place n' all but whatever I'll just throw some part together and make a bike for you no problem, EXCEPT! once the kickin' rad bike was done the chef decided to take it for himself and drove off with it leaving a crying customer for me to deal. Wasn't my restaurant though so not my problem, I then bailed to some school.First thing I noticed here was this bully forcing some nerd into a locker, I helped this nerd by summoning Mutha Fu**in' NITO, yes NITO from Dark Souls, who then bullied the crap out of this bully, after soaking in all this glorious irony I then moved onto the cafeteria to help with school lunch, this was a no brainer for me, I fed them a ♥♥♥♥♥ (not that kind :/), unfortunately the kids all died from eating it, not sure why when China eats cats n' stuff, but whatever it didn't matter at that point because I already got my star. I then just flew off on a flying pregnant baby going at supersonic speeds with Solaire from Dark Souls where we praised the Sun for the rest of that play session. This all in just 20 minutes.Seriously get this game, you should play this now. Never mind the fact that little Maxwell is an idiot that almost got his sister killed, all that matters is with this Notebook YOU ARE AN ALL POWERFUL GOD AND SHOULD GIVE ZERO F*CKS.			"

												This game was recommeded to me as a fun way to use language and my imagination in order to defeat levels; it looked childish enough but the person insisted I would like it nonetheless. Although I enjoyed the cute animation and the quirky possibilities of Scribblenauts, I found the game to be dull and repetitive real fast. I still opted to beat the game to see if things changed. The answer is a resounding no. The game is too easy to be a puzzle game for adults. Purchase Scribblenauts for a child learning to read, write, and think; it feels much more like a pop-up storybook than anything else. When you beat the game it also addresses gamers as ""children."" So much for testing out a kids' game, but hey... someone has to do it.  "

												This game is great. The idea of having a notebook that can make anything appear (also, it's green.) is brilliant and the object editor works almost flawlessly. There's only one thing missing from the PC version that exists in the iOS/Android version; the playground. The playground is pretty much an empty space with no missions just to play (hence the name (?)) with the notebook.			"

												If you have played Scribblenauts on NDS or IOS and are hoping this game is exactally the same you are sadly wrong. This game is fun but when it comes to creating things out of words it cant be compared to the NDS or IOS port. Simply because it doesnt recognize half the words you put together. For example in the first city there is gaffiti drawn on the wall and you have to get rid of it, So you may be thinking lets get creative with the words so you type Paint Eraser, or Paint Thinner and the game asks you did you mean this, and it gives you 5 pages of words you possibly dont know to replace the words you typed. Its like they took the worst part of gooogle search from the year 2005 by saying did you mean this, and made it into a game.The game is really fun once you get past the flaw of being creative with words and you can even make your own creations and replace other creations with your own in a level such as a ant with your own design by clicking on it and recreating it. But with the 1 flaw thats holding it back it feels like its not the same scribblenauts from the NDS or IOS and was simply made poorly as if the game was made by a different company.The game is a defininate buy but if your a fan of the Original games on NDS or IOS then prepare for extreme ammounts of being angry because the game wont let you make paint thinner for paint but somehow an eraser can get rid of the paint which has no creativity at all when you are trying to get crazy creative with word creations.

												Some puzzles are very specific with their solutions, which makes the ability to ""create anything"" a little daunting. These puzzles are far and few between but frustrating when trying to get 100%. Most of the puzzles were a breeze, so the difficulty spikes were never really in a middle ground, either super easy (most of them) or very specific (difficult).Good for kids and adults alike... but more for kids I'm sure.

												If you have played Scribblenauts on NDS or IOS and are hoping this game is exactally the same you are sadly wrong. This game is fun but when it comes to creating things out of words it cant be compared to the NDS or IOS port. Simply because it doesnt recognize half the words you put together. For example in the first city there is gaffiti drawn on the wall and you have to get rid of it, So you may be thinking lets get creative with the words so you type Paint Eraser, or Paint Thinner and the game asks you did you mean this, and it gives you 5 pages of words you possibly dont know to replace the words you typed. Its like they took the worst part of gooogle search from the year 2005 by saying did you mean this, and made it into a game.The game is really fun once you get past the flaw of being creative with words and you can even make your own creations and replace other creations with your own in a level such as a ant with your own design by clicking on it and recreating it. But with the 1 flaw thats holding it back it feels like its not the same scribblenauts from the NDS or IOS and was simply made poorly as if the game was made by a different company.The game is a defininate buy but if your a fan of the Original games on NDS or IOS then prepare for extreme ammounts of being angry because the game wont let you make paint thinner for paint but somehow an eraser can get rid of the paint which has no creativity at all when you are trying to get crazy creative with word creations.

												An adult version of this would be SOOO much more fun. I cannot even begin to tell you the amount of things you can do if this was an adult version. But it is a PG version and limited words to choose. A lot of puzzles of certain limited answers when clearly there are more than those few. So it becomes a frustrating exp of choosing and typing and trying until you get stuck and go online and look for it. After a few hours, it becomes repetitive. Suitable for young children but I doubt anyone older than 15 is going to find it fun.			"

												Decent little time killer with some unique gameplay and puzzles, but most of them can be solved with just a few different items.  For example, need to get somewhere high?  Build a ladder.  Need to help someone else get somewhere high?  Build a ladder.  That guy wants to fly?  Give him some wings or an airplane.  The game isn't challenging enough to make you think.  I believe, (and this is just me) that the puzzles should give you specific hints about specific items that you need to think of in order to achieve your goal.  There are thousands of different items in this game that could be put to use, but I bet only about 1% of any of the people who have ever played any of the Scribblenauts games have used more than 10%.  It's a great idea for a game, but the lack of choices you have make it boring and repetitive.  Save your money.			"

												Long ago when I didn't work everyday I was a pretty creative person, I wore a beret, had an evil Mcgee mustache and a paintbrush in hand. So it's only natural I grab a 1 part puzzle game 1 Part LittleBigPlanet story , 2 parts Mr. Rogers at the crayon factory.It's a good concept, along the lines of a creative mind game. You get enjoyment out of it as long as you can imagine stuff to do.

												It's really fun once you play it. You can make anything appear, except for: real life copyrighted items, vulgar items, and other inappropriate items. If you REALLY want to make those objects, you'll have to create them yourself, using the Item Editor. There is a main story to it and if you actually try to complete it, you can unlock more places to go to. You have the notebook to use for every part in the story. Creating items is the key to this game with adjectives and nouns. I would DEFINITELY reccommend this game for anyone with a creative mind. The possibilities are endless. Also, you can edit yourself however you want to, except that you can't change the torso on Maxwell's body in the Avatar Editor. Sorry, but that star on his chest will stay there.			"

												Kind of fun at first. But way too simple for an adult. The thing that makes this game fun is trying to find silly ways to solve problems. Like trying to build a house with a screwdriver or fight zombies with toys. But once you figure out the underlying systems to solve all the puzzles it starts to get to be a chore trying to figure out how to be silly. Kids might like it though.			"

												Maxwell is the true representation of an all encumbering indivdual, reaching out and trying to touch the entity that is god. Each time he traverses the levels, he is jumping through space and time with his almighty totem of infinite possibilities. Anti-death note some may say, but in truth, Maxwell is his own entity. Disguised as a child's play thing, as he is innocent as the birth of the world is young. I enjoyed this game as it was cheap enough to aid in my art degree.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is truly Unlimited.Want to throw an exploding potato at a defensive man to have the man get angry and explode when he eats it? You can do that.Want to make a tiny purple kazoo that will sing whenever you use it? You can do that.Want to throw strong evil babies at old men? Yes, you can even do that.I'd never think any of this would be possible in a video game, but it is.Sure, there are certain words you can't make such as drugs and copyrighted stuff like Harry Potter, but now that we have the object editor, we can have those things come true... if you're good at making stuff in the object editor, that is.I really wish there were multiple save files for this game, since I don't want to lose all my data just to replay the game. I also wish there was a level editor, like in the previous games. But it's still an enjoyable game.Truly, a great experience.I will never know how I have managed to play this game for more than 100 hours...			"

At first I had to guide my little girl in playing this game because she didn't know how to read yet. But when she learned how to read and write, she was able to play the game alone and it became more enjoyable to her. She only needed a little help on how to spell things.			"

The visuals, however, look great, and the backpack feature was an overdue and welcome addition to the series.Is it worth the current price? No.Is it worth it when it's cheaper than a bag of chips?

												Don't expect the same gameplay as the first two games on DS. While Unlimited is just as charming as the originals, the gameplay is relegated to simply helping other characters perform actions. You're basically ""Helper Scribblenaut."" The solution to most puzzles is pretty linear and you wind up not feeling nearly as creative as in the previous titles. But if you don't have a DS, and this is your only way to experience Scribblenauts, check it out!			"

												I cannot recommend this game. The game consists of various locations populated by people (or animals, or other objects) that have a problem to be solved. These ""problems"" or ""puzzles"" are usually incredible simple, like ""This guy is hungry. Give him something to solve his hunger"" or ""this girl wants something to wear to a party"", or ""this ghost wants to see his reflection"", or ""this elephant wants to be a painter. Give him something a painter would have"", or ""this jockey needs something to ride for the race"". You ""solve"" the puzzles by using your notebook to create an item for the person in question: ""dinner"", ""dress"", ""mirror"", ""palette"", ""horse"". You can be creative in your solutions (""pink polka dot flying horse""), but other than self-amusement, there's no incentive not to go with the first obvious answer the pops in your head. Young children may get a kick out of this game, but personally I thought the game was pretty boring.			"

												This is a really charming game, and the idea behind it is fantastic. The amount of words in the dictionary is really impressive, and you can solve puzzles pretty much any ridiculous way you want. But if you're looking for a good brain workout, look elsewhere. This is by no means a brain-teaser. I'm really confused as to what audience this game was intended for. It's so simplistic that a 6 year old could easily figure out all the puzzles, but there are words and references that only an adult would get. If it was meant to be played by parents and children together (which would make sense), it's certainly not marketed that way. The unfortunate truth is that this game gets boring incredibly fast. You can solve puzzles in very creative ways, but there is no incentive to try because the game rewards you exactly the same way no matter what you do. You could create a giant burning zombie made of bacon to melt an iceberg in your way, but using a flamethrower will net you exactly the same result, so eventually the appeal of using your imagination wears off and you'll settle for the easy solution just to push through faster. Even playing with friends or being inebriated (which usually make anything awesome) only extends the fun for so long. If you're still curious and want to try it, at least wait for a sale, because $19.99 is just way too much of an asking price.			"

												The game is cute and the dictionary is a novelty you won't find in any other series, unfortunately the game's selling point is also kind of its downfall since it makes all the puzzles incredibly easy. There's no penalty for using the same words over and over and the game doesn't really reward cleverness, you can solve pretty much everything with adjectives or the same obvious solutions. A game with limitless potential for creativity isn't worth much when it offers no incentive to actually be creative beyond self-amusement. The controls are also pretty bad, you'll find yourself repeatedly accidentally opening menus and pausing the game when you try to attack things, although this game is very light on reflexive action as it is.. It's an alright sandbox if you get it in a sale, though if you've played any of the other Scribblemans games then you've already seen everything it has to offer.			"

												It's ok.  The puzzles are extremely easy to solve - usually you just give a simple item to someone who wants it.  If someone wants a picture, you give them a camera; if someone is hungry, you give them food.  However, you could be creative.  If someone is hungry, you could always give them something amusing that might satisfy them.  The thing is, this gets old very quickly.  If you have a friend to play it with, you could laugh at it, but it loses its appeal if you're playing alone.  It just wasn't enjoyable enough for me to recommend.			"

												Yes, it's cute, and the potential to solve the puzzles in any way -at all- that you want is nice. But it is, for all that, rather a short game. I completed all the achievements the game had, as well as the game itself in far, far less than a day. It also falls over when you consider that many of the puzzles in the game can be solved in the same few ways. Work out one or two of the solutions that just repeatedly work and you can blast through the game extremely quickly. This leaves mopping up the collections to become a rather tedious task. The novelty wears off on Scribblenauts pretty quickly. It's fun at first, but that soon wears off, leaving you with an adorable game that's far too easy. I think this might be challenging for a small child. If you have a small child, give it to them to play, perhaps play it with them. Or just play it while you're too drunk to think clearly. This would be an amazing game to play while drunk.			"

												A game that allows you to create your own objects to solve puzzles! Unfortunately the concept of a game with a magic create anything notebook turns all the puzzles into rote data entry. There's an editor, but judging from all the recreations of video game characters on the Steam Workshop, I'm assuming there isn't much of a reason to use it. Unless you want to create a Human Centidog, but then again I like my ideas when they're in my head and safe within their Platonic form and not in the hideous physical world that somehow ruins everything.

												If you're looking for a creative/sandbox-ey type game to get into (think: Garry's Mod, Minecraft), look elsewhere. The puzzles in this game are all pretty much mind-numbingly obvious, and being creative is actually *discouraged* because the game engine won't accept or recognize most really creative solutions - so this often leaves you solving the puzzle with the first, most blatantly obvious thing that came to your mind.With this, I believe Scribblenauts Unlimited is a great game for the kiddies, considering its easy puzzles and the insane amount of objects you can spawn (they really did think of everything). I could see this being a great for the fam-fam if everyone sat down in front of the tele and played the Wii U port together.However, I'll have to give this a negative review because while the game and its description would like you to believe the limit is your imagination, it's really not.

												PROS:*Impressive dictionary with unique images for many terms*Good variety of environments*Pleasing art*Unlockable avatars*Object editor and Steam Workshop integrationCONS:*Minimal, yet tedious gameplay*Dictionary gaps and re-used images stand out, though the object editor can alleviate this if the player is willing to do the work*Story is unnecessary, boring, and not spread throughout the gameGAME LENGTH:For achievement hunters, this game should take around 10 hours at most.  Those who just want to finish the game can expect to be done in around 7 hours, perhaps even less.SCORE:4.5 out of 10Even though I got this game for only $1, I regret the purchase.The greatest disappointment for me was that there really isn't much game here:  the player moves from one environment to the next, solving very simple problems by typing an appropriate noun or adjective.  The challenge does not increase, creativity is not demanded, and 95% of the problems to solve feel identical in concept.  In short:  the game was tedious and I never felt challenged.The game certainly boasts an impressive dictionary with unique images for many terms, including a decent variety of dog breeds.  However, without anything interesting to do with the objects that the player can create, it becomes substantially less impressive.  Moreover, since the dictionary is the star of the game instead of actual gameplay, terms that aren't recognized or given unique images (for example:  two kinds of trees might look identical) stand out.  I understand that it would be impossible to include an exhaustive dictionary with a unique image for each term, but that is why the gameplay needs to pick up the inevitable slack of this category.  Fortunately, the player does have the option of using the object editor to add new terms to the dictionary with custom images or download others' work from the Steam Workshop.  The option wasn't stressed in the game and it seemed like more work than it was worth to me, but other players might enjoy it.Finally, though this is a very minor point, the story is lackluster.  (Spoilers ahead.)  The player character and his sister play a mostly harmless prank on an old man, who responds quite unfairly by cursing the sister to turn to stone.  The only way to save her is to collect magical ""Starites"" by helping people around the world, which also unlocks new areas to visit.  In the end, the curse is lifted and the old man who cast it is revealed to be the father.  (What a great guy.)  This is the entirety of the story and it is told entirely at the beginning and the end, rather than weaved throughout the game.  The only reason to even visit the sister is because the game requires it to unlock new areas, but the only aspect of the story that is advanced is how much of her is stone.  As I said, however, this is a minor point; clearly the game is not about the story.I could perhaps recommend this game for children, but it's just not enough for teenagers or adults.  If I graded games solely according to what developers intended to accomplish, I would give this a 9.5 out of 10, subtracting half a point only for the dictionary's incompleteness and re-used art.  But I grade games in large part according to my enjoyment of them, so, despite the game's art, dictionary, and polish, the tedious nature of what little gameplay there is compels me to give it a 4.5 out of 10.

												Although fun at first, it hardly earn the term ""unlimited"". Sexually and racialy biased, it basically teaches kids that women are powerless, and that other ethnical groups act wierd and dress funny. The subtext is clearly ""Be a Douchbag! No consequances!"". Also, i feel it's absolutly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to allow the option of creating a gun and shooting a small child, but prevent you from creating alcoholic bavareges. It's like trying to be politically correct by adressing a black guy as ""underpriveliged minority"". It's still condencending and hurtfull.The guys who made this took a great idea, made a sub-par game mechanics, and added a twist of old fashioned bigotry and chauvinism.Just...bad...			"

												In Scribblenauts you have to find solutions for problems by creating or altering objects/persons with your magic notebook. The amount of objects and adjectives available is enormous, but unfortunately the puzzles are lacking. In fact they are not even worth being called puzzles. Someone wants to chop down a tree? Give him an axe. Someone wants to fly? Give him wings. Someone wants a gift for his girlfriend? Give him flowers. And that's it. Of course you can use weird solutions, like giving the guy with the tree problem a 'huge pink funny demonic chainsaw', but the fun in doing things like these wears of pretty quickly. Especially since it doesn't change the outcome, the guy still chops down the tree just like he would with an axe. Often your weird creations aren't even used and standard objects are created instead. If you give a girl who wants to dress up nicely a pink miniskirt for example she'll just put on some default clothes instead of the object you created.The game can be fun for a few hours if you just mess around, but it gets boring pretty quickly. It is certainly a nice game for little children (age 5-10) though. So no recommendation for adults from me, but recommended for children.			"

												I've been meaning to play Scribblenauts for a long while, I wanted to see how good it was at realising what I had it mind.I've got to say the object creation and interaction definitely worked.However, in my opinion, Scribblenauts fails to be an actual game, it's just a tool to play with. I thought I would have to figure out puzzles by combining elements and unlocking stuff progressively. Sadly, that's not the case, almost all ""challenges"" simply ask you to create one single object, most of the time obvious. When you're asked to ""write someone to help spy on the bandits"", well the answer is obvious, a spy will do. Yes of course you can try more wild choices, and most of the time they will work. However, since everything has to be solved by inputting one single item, even the sandbox aspect is limited. Your word works or doesn't. It's in the game's list of possible answers or it's not. That's it. And there is only so many times I can get amused by giving overpowered or stupid items (especially since, if you go too wild, you risk destroying an important item and having to redo some stuff again).Dashed hopes... :/			"

												I'm really surprised by how much I've come to hate this game. It is such a load of closed minded, sexist, anti-scientific, moralising rubbish. Many of the restrictions are merely reflections of the rating system in place for games so the devs aren't really to blame but when you put it in this context they become so incredibly infuriating. So for example, it is perfectly fine to spawn a flame-thrower and burning everyone alive. One the other hand woe betide you if you try to spawn anything relating to sex, drugs or alcohol because none of those words are in Scribbenauts' vocabulary. I get that this is a children's game but then why can we spawn flame throwers? Why is violence so often featured in the puzzles, often unavoidably? Why does one level feature torture? Why can we spawn iron-maidens if we feel like it? It is garbage. Moralising garbage that shoves a twisted morality down the player's throat where torture and violence are a-okay and sex and alcohol are the works of the devil.Other things are clearly in place just to reduce controversy so you can spawn old religious figures that not many people take seriously any more like Thor and Zeus but not Jesus, and Mohammed is right out. Mind you so are most of the historical figures I've wanted to spawn so far. Someone was clearly in the grip of internalised capitalist oppression so I tried to spawn Marx to talk some sense into them, I didn't seriously expect this to work but I did expect to be able to spawn Marx but no. I gave up and spawned a Lemon when that was the suggestion when I tried Lenin.On another occasion a scientist wanted someone to talk to so I tried to spawn Aristotle, this worked but it seems the game doesn't consider Aristotle to be a scientist so the scientist refused to talk to him. Einstein of course worked but it felt like such a hollow victory to resort to the bloody obvious. And the game forces you to resort to the bloody obvious so often. Thinking outside the box is so often met with no reaction at all from the game. Sometimes the box you're meant to be thinking inside is bloody stupidly defined as well. One of the hints was to solve the problem of needing to melt a block of ice to thaw out a prehistoric man ""with science"". I tried heating the ice in various ways. The ice melted but level was failed. I tried ordering the ice to melt with adjectives. The ice melted but level was failed. I tried spawning salt and using that on the ice. The ice melted but level was failed. Eventually I resorted to Google. It seems ""with science"" in the Scribblenauts world means ""don't try to solve this yourself, spawn a scientist to do it for you"". Good god, such a stupid anti-scientific attitude to science.Finally there is Lilly, poor, poor Lilly. First off she is a Ms. Male by which I mean she is a female version of Maxwell with no other distinguishing personality or features except for being pink. Then she gets damseled in the opening cut-scene. Then you find that each level you can unlock one more of her siblings as a new playable character if you don't want to play as Maxwell, how many of these are sisters? None. Seemingly the other god knows how many playable characters are brothers. *sigh* Maybe Lilly becomes playable after the end of the story missions and she is released from her predicament but if so it is too little and far too late.No. Enough. There is joy in the heart of this game but after you're over the initial rush of apparent power the limitations and all the rubbish that come with it suck all the joy of it. I dare say some might say that as a grown man I shouldn't be surprised that I can't enjoy this since I'm hardly the target audience but honestly given the amount of twisted crap that is wrapped up with this game there is no way I'd let a child play it.

There is no incentive to be creative because the canned puzzle solution animations are always going to be the same no matter what you do. Any creative energy you put into this game will be quickly drained by doing so many simplistic puzzles. This game is probably fine for younger kids but does not have the all-ages appeal that the DS game supposedly had.			"

												[Warning: There may be spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk.]This game really disappointed me. I had seen adds for it before and it seemed very cool, but it was not all it was cracked up to be. First off, the avatar creator REALLY disappointed me. It was too difficult to work with and never really ended in my favor. I got a few avatars to work good, but they didn't express my full creativity because the current avatar creator was very difficult to work with, especially when working with several entities. Second, I feel the game really starts off too easy. It was just a create one of MANY things to solve very simple tasks. The difficulty should really pick up earlier since Scribblenauts was a puzzle game (and even a free-play game). The game seems as if it was designed for a mere child to play. Third, the side-quests. Though they added more spice and variety to the game, it just seems to be a lot of annoying running around or too vague to even finish. This problem was fixed in Unmasked, but they should've done something about it in Unlimited. The game also doesn't seem to have as many levels as it did in the DS games. Though, I will finish this game and play it more (since I bought it) I do not recommend it to others.I rate 3.4/10 for the game.And 4/10 for the avatar creator.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is a fun, interesting, and innovative game for about 15 minutes. The game concept is engrossing enough; type any word or phrase and it will appear in-game. Y'all already know I was rolling with my posse of George Washington and Napoleon on the reg, sporting a tuxedo and wielding a flamethrower atop my giant flying jaguar. The open nature also makes the options to resolve ""quests"" interesting (we'll get to that later). I was a vengeful God, and if a person needed, say a bag of money, I would make them blind in return. If they wanted a child, it would be a gargantuan, dying, amphibious baby. And for a while the gimmick was entertaining. However, the gimmick gets old fast. Because that's all the game is; an interesting game concept and gimmick that is stretched into a full-length video game.The game quests are extremely shallow and repetitive. An NPC says ""I need something that can do this/is like this/is this, and you oblige them. This process takes an average of 7 seconds to complete, and is the core of game progression. Like I said, this provides plenty of opportunity for humorous moments. But the game counts on you to make those moments happen. And there's really no incentive to do so; because the game is so repetitive, you want to just blow through it and be done with the quests. As the game progresses I became more and more utilitarian with my answers. I just didn't have the heart to try and make humor out of what felt like work. ""I need a friend"" - give them a dog. ""I want to write"" - give them a pencil. THe process became so monotonous and boring it was unbearable.This is a game that brings the player an interesting but temporarily engaging concept and absolutely drab quests and asks the player to bring the fun. Whereas ""make your own fun games"" like Just Cause and GTA create diversity in how you can create that fun, Scribblenauts is dull and taxing throughout. Just knowing that this game exists is about as much fun as playing it. Don't buy it, not even on sale.			"

												Ok i got this game as a gift and i started playing it and i noticed that there was no free play mode or anything so i did some boring missions and i got stuck in the game because i have no sense of direction and the 2 maps are boring you cant do anything at least super scribblenauts had it where theres a free play mode so i could spawn in 500 barrels of tnt and shoot it like in gmod but gmod is way better than the scriblenauts series so buy gmod instead  and gmod is cheaper			"

												The game falls flat on several instances. It´s not easy to learn even tho the game seam to aim the younger generation. The possibility to try different word is a good idea in theory. In reality it gets far to limited where many liable alternatives are ignored and you are left hoping for a hint. It has a really nice design but it cannot not compensate. Maybe it is because i dont have English as a first language. But should this stop me for playing this kinds of games? I Hope not.			"

She played this game on her 3DS XL before and she could just play that without the character creator! All her creations failed and she didn't want to play as a boy. Object creator forced her to use a kidnapper without editing her. I bought this yesterday and she ALREADY doesn't like it! WASTE OF 20$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												I played a couple of Scribblenauts games on DS and absolutely loved them.  It may have been the novelty of it that really got me hooked, or maybe the fact that I had to learn the ""tricks"" of the game as I went along.  This game was terribly disappointing by comparison.Most of the ""puzzles"" or ""quests"" are insanely simple.  I was stumped maybe 3 times at most.  Otherwise it was a bunch of, ""I'm hungry, make me something to eat,"" or, ""My cat's stuck in the tree, please get him down,"" or, ""I'm bored, find something to entertain me.""  Sandwich, ladder, clown, EASY!!!  Given the name ""Scribblenauts Unlimited"" and the fact the game is Steam Workshop enabled, I was under the impression other people would be making levels and challenges.  Wow!  Was I ever wrong!  The fact that you can create your own objects is a poor consolation, especially considering most of the changes are simply visual and the item editor comes with NO GUIDANCE WHATSOEVER!  I tried to make an object starting with a cannonball as the template and it was never any more useful than an actual cannonball.I don't recall how many areas/quest there are, but there are way too many given the overall difficulty of the game.  The developers definitely went for quantity over quality and I think that's where the game really suffers.  Too many challenges that aren't challenging and too many objects that aren't all that unique.  Even at a dirt cheap price this game feels more like a chore than an actual game.			"

												Scribblenauts unlimited is great if you have an amazing imagination. However, more often than not, the game is treated more of a sandbox as there really isn't much appeal to complete the quests, although they are relatively simple to solve with a mundane solution. The challenge is to find alternative ways to complete such quests, although once again, the game fails to motivate you to push yourself to do so.Storyline is also made to appeal to younger kids-teens and is mediocre at best.6/10, fun for the first 5 hours of playing or so.

												Pretty great for kids that don't require much of a challenge, but for an adult it's a 'make-your-own-fun' kind of game. You play a young boy venturing out into the world with a notebook that makes him an itty-bitty god, letting you create anything your imagination can conjure up, as long as it's not copywritten or mildly controversial (you can create God, but no Hitler). Challenges are usually a slight riddle or a character telling  you what they want, leaving you to generate it with your notebook. Unfortunately, most of these challenges are without real challenge, leaving it up to the player to try and eake out some of the more creative solutions the studio programmed in. Still, the game is attractive, has a pleasant cheeky sense of humor, and has some really nice music, but as a game it usually as demanding as that children's game where you put the round peg in the round hole. Charming, but more ingenuity need to be applied to how to engage the player's imagination.			"

												This is a real fun game, to get you started on the story, you are a boy names Maxwell and you have a notebook and if you write anything in the notebook like ""car"" you get a car. Maxwell and his sister were walking along and pranked a witch of some sort, the witch uttered the words ""SPOILED LITTLE KIDS"". Nothing happened but moments realizing his sisters feet were made of stone. Maxwell was later told he needed starlights or what ever they are called.. to get the curse out of his sister. He told Maxwell starlights are earned from helping people, and making them happy. Anyways, I had alot of fun with this game and I rate it 7/10.			"

												Personally, I don't like this game. I think drawing or adding characters to the screen to complete easy puzzles / quests quickly gets boring and repetitive and it feels like the game has no real goal.. it's more of a ""play around with objects"" game for children than a game you could enjoy or feel achieved in as an adult. On top of that the quest start over even if you mess around a little bit.Good thing I got it from the WB humble.			"

												Ahh Scribblenauts Unlimited. A childish but still entertaining game.It really is surprising how this game has so much content, it amazed me the first time I started playing it and keeps amazing me every time I play it. I think that the concept is quite interesting and original. But it's still not perfect, the game is clearly made for children so it gets repetitive quite fast and is extremely easy. Well that is really not true, if you are not from a country where people speak English this could be a great way to learn some words, even for older people. This is one of those games they should use as material in schools.As for the story of this game. Well, the story is not the thing in this game that they gave extra attention.Positives: -May be helpful in educating children-Quite entertaining-Funny-Lots of content-OriginalNegatives:-Poor story-Repetitive-Boring after a while-""It is a game for kids so its not suppose to be good, right?""I would rate it 6.5/10			"

												(BARELY got a Yes) [Overall (Meh) Rating: 5/10]If you're like me, you probably got stuck into the Scribblenauts series thinking you'd actually draw stuff, save it and call it up later. Earlier on, like me, you'd be dissapointed. Now, though, you can actually make stuff and save it... but you better know what you're doing, you have to ""Hngh"" your way through ""Programming"" to make it of any use to you. So, your better off just going with the defaults.Personally, i wish they'd stop republishing the same game over and over again... -sigh-			"

												Compared to the previous titles, this installment of Scribblenauts is crippling and crushes the creative spirit.There are no actual puzzles; you never have to create elaborate setups, get creative with your summon variety, or make use of stacking/nesting/connecting. You don't even have to move, really. There are no challenges. There are only fill-in-the-blank scenarios.That's it.Even Kirby games have challenge and variety.For a game whose central theme is goodwill and charity, I'm wondering why I'm asked to arm and harm others, and break criminals out of prison. With a name like Bruiser, I'm pretty sure his incarceration was not unjust.My initial excitement by a VA appearance from Jennifer Hale was immediately snuffed when I realized she would spend the entire game in the barn while her 41 brothers explored the world and had incredible adventures. By the time I freed her from the barn, I was sick of the game and couldn't continue.As a Scribblenauts fan, this game was incredibly disappointing. The free iPhone version is leagues better, and it doesn't even have adjective mechanics.			"

												I've only played this one and the original Scribblenauts, so it's possible that this is what all the current games are like, but ...The basic idea of Scribblenauts is that you are let loose in a series of levels, each of which contains a ""Starite."" As Max, your goal is to obtain the Starite by any means necessary. Fortunately, you are armed with a magic notebook; when Max writes nouns the game understands in the notebook, whatever he's written is summoned into reality. With Scribblenauts Unlimited he gains the ability to use adjectives, as well, even adding them to existing objects.In the first Scribblenauts game, getting the Starite usually (but not always) required solving a physics puzzle. In Scribblenauts Unlimited, though, you generally just end up walking up to an NPC, being told the NPC wants something, and then writing down examples of whatever is requested.For instance, an NPC might be described as a ""Hungry Vegetarian."" Write down ""apple"" ""pancake"" ""carrot"" get Starite. (That was off the top of my head, but it might actually be in the game. That's the level of sophistication.) It's less a video game and more a vocabulary test. Oh, and since a LOT of puzzles require knowledge of English-language culture, don't even expect to be able to use it to help learn the language.It doesn't help that in the first game Max would often find himself in danger and need to find a way to protect himself. Here, the first thing you do in each level is click on Max and add adjectives like ""Immortal Flying Fireproof"" to yourself and then roam with impunity.Basically ... if the first Scribblenauts was easy, Scribblenauts Ultimate barely qualifies as an activity book. An expensive, overproduced activity book.			"

												I made a rocket launcher that fires fridges and gave it to a terrorist. This was after I'd gotten bored making suicidal kittens and assorted other cute animals, placing bombs, then watching them detonate the bombs and kill themselves. Not to mention the fact that there is an accurate sprite for the RPG compared to a simple rocket launcher.10/10 will kill again.			"

												Frankly, it was an honest effort. I'll give them that. But Scribblenauts just didn't catch my attention. Sure, I got 3 hours into it, but I have at least 10 times that in CS:GO, let alone the 60 TIMES record I have in Garry's Mod.      It's enjoyable for the begginning, and I'm sure younger audiences might play this game for months upon months, but when you suddenly turn 13 and realize there's games like Call of Duty out there for you to play, the replay value drops rediculously. Better than nothing, but I'm just not left satisfied. 4/10 stars.Auther's Note(s)     With all due respect to the hours upon hours it must of taken to make Scribblenauts, it just isn't worth the money I put into it. And I even got it on sale. It's fine if you're younger though, so if you've got a 5/6 year-old brother or sister that wants something to do, it's considerable to buy it for them. "

Please help if possible. So on top of the game not opening, when I did play the game on my old laptop, it was OK. Not all that fun, gets very repetitive and boring. So, if you want another game as well as this one, buy that other one first.			"

												7/10I know that this is supposed to be a game for younger players, because the puzzles aren't really hard when your brain has reached a certain age and knowledge, but it's the perfect opportunity to mess around with an almighty notebook that spawns nearly everything you want.Throwing stuff into a blackhole? Check.Dinosaur-riding zombies with laser guns? Check.Radioactive vampires fighting ninjas? UNDERWATER? CHECK!If only it didn't have this comicbook style...But as I said before, this is ""a game for kids"", it's supposed to teach them proper spelling, common sense and other stuff, and that's why it gets boring-to-look-at for (most) people who are older than 12.

												A cute looking problem solving sand box game that involves spawning, labeling, destroying and manipulating objects and entities with an educational angle for kids. The premise is simple with multiple objectives in each map, but the possibilities and combinations are limitless and often hilarious, with many shards and starite objects to collect once all objectives have been met.For achievement hunters, the full starite collection will require trying a huge selection of outfits, weapons, items and situations, but the process is relatively fun if, albeit, slow. Good fun for kids. 3.5/5			"

This version if more refined and polished in terms of controls, content, storytelling & gameplay but to sum them all up has given that charm that i haven't experienced in a long time since Little big planet, Locoroco and their likes. Simple and dose not stress your brain to think too much i would say.Surprisingly, one of the best games i've played this year to the point that it's going to be one of my GOTY of 2013. Yes i'm that serious! I would recommend myself to play this game with my future kids one day :).			"

												Really impressive and beautiful game, way better & bigger than the 3DS version and iOS version. It's also support Steam Workshop.Also, other than the previous Scribblenauts games, instead of beeing only puzzle based, it's adventure based. So it's way better as you have a LOT of puzzle per level so it's not annoying like the previous one as you don't have loading time between each puzzle.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is a fun game which allows for an amazing level of creativity in what the player can make. Making use of Nouns and descriptive words makes the creation of objects in the primary game rather fun, and the ability to create your own objects in the game makes it even more fun. The creation of objects is easy to use and doesn't have many issues, but it would be best to avoid altering the hit-box parts too much, as it could cause unusual problems.			"

												To sum up this review right away, I will say this is one of the funnest time-wasting pseudo-sandbox games I have ever played. Now onto the real reason why:Scribblenauts has you playing Maxwell, a little boy with the ability to make anything appear, change, shift, etc. with his handy dandy notebook. His sister Lilly is sick with some weird disease so he has to go out into the world and find little shards of star thingies called ""starites"" which will hopefully make her all better. This game is part messing around with whatever strikes your fancy (aka a sandbox), part puzzle, and part adventure. It also requires a little bit of thinking and creativity to get past some head-scratching or seemingly impossible tasks. This game is designed to tap into the ingenious little child you once were, where the possibilities to accomplish anything were endless and only limited by your imagination. You need to get a ball off an old man's lawn without touching the lawn itself? Fly yourself over the lawn in a helicopter and pick it up! Need to get past a killer robot? Dress yourself up in a suit of armor to deflect the attacks! The art is adorable, the animations seemless and what is humorous to note is to watch how the objects you've brought to life interact with other objects, creatures, and people long after you've set them free or completed a mission. I find myself accidentally unleashing less-than-friendly little beasties on the unsuspecting populace, much to their depleting heart bar and my wry schadenfreude.  The music also fits well with every place you go, perfectly setting the tone to where you are and what you're doing. I have not had the chance to mess with the object editor but from what I can tell by popping in and taking a look around it only adds to the possibilities of further customization of your little adventure.It is at times so easy to earn starite shards that I sometimes feel like I'm progressing too fast and not enjoying it for what it is, namely a pleasant time-waster, as I've said before. Personally, I find that you can tell a lot about yourself by what beings you bring into the Scribblenaut world to solve your problems. For ""man's best friend"" I always type in some breed of terrier, and when I can afford to I always use sponges to clean stuff up. Is it familiarity or my lack of thinking outside the box that makes me lean towards these choices? Who knows.This is a fun game that unlocks the imaginative kid in all of us, and for kids that know their way around a computer this is the perfect game for them to play, too.			"

												Yes, this game, the best of creativeness ever. Seeing bunch of gamers play on Youtube, no matter how they suck at creative things, it's still best of all to make me wants to buy this game much enough. Tried it and pretty impressed with it. Getting to the end of game with no regrets a bit stuck, but never mind that. If you're thinking about some of lively games, no need of good graphics, how music can makes you like playing those old lively games. What did I say? I just eman today's games are quite a bit of boring, not feeling happy when played like old day times. Try this, really. You can give 10 out of 10. Every single star shards are great too, do not keep only doing big one.			"

												A fantastically fun puzzle game. The solutions are unusually easy for the genre, but the unique mechanics give you an incredible range of creative options to work with, encouraging you to think outside the box and go crazy with all sorts of alternate solutions. Thanks to the low difficulty, this allows the game to function equally well for kids who are learning to think critically or adults who like being creative.  MechanicsWriting. Yep, that simple. You’re presented with a puzzle, you think of what object you need to solve it, you write that word, and poof! you’ve created that object. You can also add adjectives to objects to give them different traits, which is required by certain puzzles. The in-game dictionary is respectably large, with everything from generic items to everyday objects to all sorts of professions to all the major pantheons to a variety of oddly specific animals & plants. There’s a surprisingly complex system of interactions built in between different items. Scarecrows scare crows, devils are instantly killed by holy water, honey badgers kill everything, war can be defeated by a white dove, the large hadron collider can create a black hole, combining a cat & toast destroys the universe . . . the possibilities are endless and often contain hilarious references. You can tell that a ton of effort went into this. However, there are a few hard limits on what you can’t create. Namely, nothing sexual or vulgar. It’s marketed as a family game, after all. Though in typical American fashion, the game will allow you to be surprisingly violent without raising an eyebrow. Scribblenauts Unlimited will let you set packs of children on fire or get people to cannibalize each other or feed babies to raptors or any other manner of creative atrocities, but you can’t dare have exposed nipples. Think of the children!The rules for proper nouns are also somewhat confusing. For the most part, proper nouns are a no-go, but there are a few exceptions for famous people and some other random things. Not many and not very consistent, but they’re there. The lack of consistency can be annoying – only a small handful of world-famous names actually give you anything, yet the entire dev team produces valid entries. They made sure that Cthulhu is in there, so at least they got that much right.The Starite Vision mechanic makes it super easy to find the puzzles in each level, meaning that you’re never left lost and looking around for where to find more shards (which was apparently a problem in the first game). Of course, the PC version of Scribblenauts Unlimited allows modded dictionary words, which people diligently use to add their favorite celebrities or ponies or Pokémon – a treasure trove of items for the dedicated player.   The game also possesses a free-roam adventure aspect to it, as you can run around the map and just have fun. There’s a bit of a fighting system in there, so you can shoot or hit other characters . . . or light them on fire or turn them nice or set off a nuke and kill everyone or suck the world into a black hole or whatever you want.  You can spawn pretty much any item and apply whatever adjectives you want to things, meaning that the ability to express yourself as you play is endless. Everyone gets to play the game their own way, and that’s the most beautiful part about it.Level DesignVery elegant for the type of game it is.  The main quest simply requires you to go around completing puzzles until you've collected 60 starites. There’s substantial wiggle room built into the main quest, as you only need to earn just over half of all the possible 106 starites in the game. So while a completionist can explore the entire game and have fun collecting all of them, a younger or lazier player need only explore the puzzles that they can actually figure out. Thus the game remains fun and kid-friendly by letting them learn and express themselves without being punished for getting stuck on specific puzzles.Every stage has two types of challenges present in it: starites and shards. The shards are simple puzzles that usually only require you to create a single item to solve. They reward a shard – several of which combine to form a starite, giving you a slow but steady way to collect starites. The starite puzzles are larger, self-contained little scenarios that consist of several puzzles chained together. They’re more elaborate and have way more attention to detail placed into them.  They take longer and are sometimes more difficult, but completing them gets you a whole starite right away. Each stage will only have 1 or 2 starite puzzles, but a bunch of shard puzzles. This gives a really nice balance to the game, and makes the starite puzzles feel like special treats that break up the normal gameplay of steady shard collection through simple puzzles. You can also earn shards (and achievements) by performing unique & creative actions in the world, which incentivizes players to explore and have fun creating things. NarrativeMaxwell & Lily are a pair of siblings with world-famous explorers for parents. Their parents pass down a magic notebook to them – you can write anything in it and it makes it appear! Maxwell & Lily are sent out into the world to explore, but immediately abuse the power of the notebook to pull a prank on a poor old man. The old man curses Lily and encases her in a slowly-growing tomb of stone, revealing that this curse can only be broken by the power of starites. Since starites are released by happiness, Maxwell has to rush out and use the power of the notebook to make as many people happy as fast as he can, in the hopes that he can save Lily in time.It’s a pretty simple kid’s story with a strong Aesop about using your abilities to make the world a better place. It works really well, especially for the sort of educational game this is. Maxwell learns that playing dirty tricks on other people is bad, and that he should use his talent to bring joy to the world instead. For adult players, the game is absolutely FILLED with jokes. Tons and tons and tons of subtle little jokes and references to all kinds of things, in particular nerdy properties. It’s surprisingly funny. I caught myself laughing out loud all through my playthrough.  AestheticsVery pretty. The entire game has this goofy cartoonish look, like everything is made from construction paper and pinned together – the sort of thing a kid would make during playtime. It’s a super solid, cohesive art design. Reinforces the fact that the game is played with your imagination more than anything else. And the levels have a wide variety of styling, with different zones linked together by shared art to create a world that feels “real.” The only voice acting in the game is during the opening and closing cutscenes, but it’s well done. Really injects some feeling into what is otherwise a simple story.  David Franco’s music is great at reinforcing positive emotions. The level themes are relaxing, helping the art to create a soothing atmosphere for a fun puzzle game. The main menu theme is impressively upbeat, creating a joyous mood as soon as you start the game. Then there's the rewarding jingle you get for winning a starite – composed of 110% ""feel good.""Makes you just want to go collect more starites. Overall Rating:  5/5 "

												SUCH a fun game!   I'm 31 and I still enjoy it, but it's perfect for kids.  Really gets your mind going when you're solving peoples' ""problems"" throughout the game.  And riding a flying T-Rex while brandishing a missile launcher... dressed as a ninja... is always nice too LOL.  You end up in some hilarious situations.Give it a shot!  Great game!			"

												I have so much to say about this game. I got this game from a stranger on Christmas. After playing it for a while, I realized that I would be playing this game a lot. If I had not gotten it as a gift, I would never know how good it is. It is worth more than $20 as it is the best Scribblenauts yet. The game has an unlimited amount of content, as you can mix objects together and post them on the Workshop, add adjectives to items, and so much more. The game has almost every word in the english dictionary (Not sure about other languages, also copyright and profainty is not allowed) which makes sure you won't run out even after 20 hours. The puzzles are sometimes hard, and sometimes easy, unlike the other Scribblenaut games which are mostly just hard. I have already spent 23 hours and plan to spend more. 10/10			"

I have gotten plenty of things that don't work but for the most part you can write any noun to make it appear. Pretty neat mechanic! It's fun trying to come up with solutions other than the obvious ones. On the other hand, there have been a few puzzles that I couldn't figure out at all, either because my mind wasn't going in a certain direction intended, or because I missed something. Good game all around.			"

												The fun of Scribblenauts isn't in solving the puzzles. It's in solving them in the most horrible way possible that the game will let you get away with. Once I figured that out, it wasn't long before I realized that my little Scribblenaut character was not in this for the sister-saving heroics. Oh, no. Beneath that cute little hat and grin lurked the dark heart of a sociopath. A boy who dared to ask the questions that most sane people would never consider. A boy to whom even Cthulhu bows. Chaos incarnate.Some men just want to watch the world burn. And for our little Scribblenaut... A flamethrower is just a quick scribble away. God help us. God help us all.			"

												Pros- Silly, fun, creative. Definitely a different gaming experience. Gaming is enjoyable trying to puzzle through the characters problems and also just messing around with the engine typing in “evil giant mecha flaming pink zombie” and “massive good magical flying paladin” then giving them swords or guns and watching them duke it out. Lots of stuff in the workshop to download to play around with. The different zones are well thought out and visually appealing. Cons- Sometimes when you write in a solution to a problem ex. to fix a tire you need a “wrench” but the actual answer is “mechanic” it may take a couple of tries of perfectly fine answers until you get to the one the game wants. Multiplayer would have made this game even better. If I were being nit picky I would say I would like more complex problems and more combination or crafting stuff in the game.  "

It does have a lot of content in the way of puzzles, but they are not particularly stressful or challenging; don't expect a Dark Souls experience is all I'm saying. You really can create anything... as long as that something is not a proper noun or copyrighted material. But then there is the Steam Workshop and the Object Editor, which allows your imagination to go wild.If I bought this game for $10-20, then that is a good deal for what is essentially an object creation sandbox. There might be some limitations in the way the objects interact, but all in all it is a good game toy. But $60 was highway robbery. Fun while it lasted.I give it 7 out of 10 transparent zombie purple immortal starites.			"

												Great, fun puzzle game with interesting sandbox gameplay.  Solve puzzles by creating objects using words or adding whatever adjectives you can think of, and there is more than one way to solve any single puzzle!  If something doesn't exist, you can create it on the object editor!I recommend this if you like platformers, and/or love creating whatever your imagination can create.  Not as complex as gmod (that's because gmod of course, is more specialized in sandbox gameplaym than scribblenauts), but that doesn't mean Scribblenauts is limited!  Create sparkling rainbow bazookas that fire exploding panties,or flying pigs or a flying chair you can ride...whatever is on your mind!  Every object you make can have behaviors, scripting for more advanced behaviors, making anything ride-able, edible, hold-able, wearable...whatever!  And every object can be edited as well.It's quite surprising what things exist in the game you never expected to be there.  Of course, would be nice to see more things done with the game, but still a fun game nontheless, well worth the 30 bucks spent.   If it's on sale, definitely get it!			"

												You can type nearly any object or modifier (ugly, dirty, green, etc) to have it appear in-game (save for copyrighted items). But with the Steam workshop, you can download more creations that will appear when you type the in the game! That makes the number of objects you can create infinite!			"

												Very cool game, rather simple but relatively complex all at once.  The story is sweet, and the unique, colorful graphics make it pleasant to look at.  It's really amazing how nearly any word you come up with can be used in some way, and it's fun to come up with the craziest and most creative solutions possible to the puzzles you're presented with.  Very replayable considering each puzzle has hundreds of possible ways to be solved.  All around a very awesome game.			"

												Truly a spectacular game. It runs so well on my laptop (my laptop is pretty crappy). Especially the Object Editor and the Steam Workshop. You can find creations of your favorite characters from anywhere (only if someone created it already) such as Naruto, Finn, and Doctor who. But thats not all there is to offer, you can also find better weapons to use against enemies, or people whom you might not be too fond of.For all you little girls out there, fulfill your fangirl dream by getting Justin Bieber from the Workshop. You can do anything with him. ANYTHING.I recommend this game, ammensly.Good job, 5THCELL			"

												An amazing and fantastic journey into a colorful world of hilarious hijinks and crazy antics, Scribblenauts Unlimited is the first game in its series to allow players the opportunity to create their own objects to summon and play with! With the Object Editor, you can change what an object does, how it looks, how it reacts to other objects, and so much more! I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a little creativity in their diet, and hope that more people can experience Scribblenauts Unlimited.-LogCollie			"

Gameplay is quick to learn: you type the names of what you want to summon (it has a rather expansive database of words that surprisingly includes 'ginormous'), it appears.  You solve puzzles by summoning things that are appropriate to the situation...help the janitor get rid of spills by summoning a flamethrower, give the fat kid a chocolate dog, make yourself a jetpack when you get bored of walking.  Open ended and entertaining--buy this game.			"

There are so many ways to get creative and just have fun with your surroundings. Basically, you play as Maxwell and your goal is to help your fellow man with a magical notebook in order to save your sister. The different worlds and the people/creatures who inhabit them are so fun to interact with. I'm not sure about what's available in the Steam Workshop, as I have yet to try out any of the custom content. I love this game, but I do have only one complaint: the game can get repetitive at times if you decide to use the same solution for multiple puzzles.			"

												This sequel to Scribblenauts is truly a technically impressive feat, but it is very offensive to someone who is a radical Muslim such as myself. In this game, you play a boy who can create anything by writing it in his magic book, including a huge variety of living creatures - which become even more diverse with the new adjective system. The Koran says that only Allah can create life. Often times the game encourages cannabilistic activities, and this is against the word of Allah as described in the Koran, unless of course the subject in question is an enemy fighter or an adulterer. However in the case of Scribblenauts, you are prompted to feed a cannibal at a restaraunt, and the only way I could continue is by feeding him a fried baby. Truly a disgraceful game to our great creator. 2/10 would jihad again.			"

												The best in the series yet! Scribblenauts Unlimited is fun game for everyone, kids, and elders alike. If youve never  played a scribblenauts game, then this one is a great start for you. Scribblenauts can be described by one word, creative. Basically in the game, you have a magical notebook in which you can write (or type) in almost anything you want. Thats right anything, such as medusa (the greek mythology character), or another thing would be cthulhu ( the sea monster). There are also adjatives you are able to add to anything. An example of this would be creating a giant spoon, and then adding the adjetives ridable, or flying. This would then make it so you can ride the flying spoon around the world.                              Super Fun and creative!

												This game is one of my second most played games on Steam. Absolutly fantastic! The Graphics are stunning, the sound is great, the puzzles are varied ranging from simple stuff to hard as s**t. But if you can't figure out any of the puzzles, who cares! You can make a clown flying on a monkey with grapes for feet that shoots onions out it's eyballs. You can do anything at all!			"

												Scribblenauts is a game about writing words. The words you write will be created. You can use this to solve puzzles if you're lame. If you're not you will create a pile of hats, wear them all, laugh gleefully, then force a ninja hamster to fight against a samurai cactus. There will be people caught in the crossfire. Lots of people. After this, you will call forth the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse to clean up any survivors. Having experienced the greatest thing ever you will then probably die yourself.After that you can do puzzles I guess.Why are you even reading this anyway? You either love Scribblenauts or you think its a poorly executed gimmick. If you like Scribblenauts this is for you. I obviously love Scribblenauts.But even if you don't like Scribblenauts it has all the hats. All of them.And with the new Object Creator, if there's a hat that doesn't exist you can MAKE YOUR OWN HAT. Then you can upload it to the Steam Workshop so everyone can experience the glory that is YOUR HAT.10/10			"

												Okay, it's silly, but what did you expect? This game is much more addictive than I thought it would be, and I was very surprised to see how much time I've spent playing it (and usually procrastinating doing very important things at the same time). The challenges are usually very easy to complete, which may put some people off of the game, but there are also many creative ways to solve puzzles - finding new ways of solving the same puzzle can be a lot of fun! Overall, it's a fun game that is useful for burning time (so I strongly reccomend it to those who have just finished exams and have a very long holiday ahead of them!).			"

												With the power to create just about anything with wordplay, it's Scribblenauts Unlimited, a fun-filled adventure starring Maxwell on a quest to save his stoned sister. I've got to say, for being a game with the title ""Unlimited"" I couldn't help but feel this sense of unfulfillment. There were times I wanted to just screw around in the game and create all sorts of things that just weren't there. I mean, to be fair, this is a Warner Bros. game targeted to ages below and beyond mine--of course I can't just type any naughty thing here or there! Think of the children! I digress. This game, all the same, is fairly enjoyable. A charming game.Also there's a Workshop function to the game now, so you can create anything you want, set it to a word, or just download other players' creations from the Workshop. Let the creativity or immaturity flow through you.			"

												Fun little puzzle/sandbox game.  You basically control a guy who solves puzzles or solves people's problems using his magic notebook.  Whatever you write comes to life, such as ""rabbit"" or even ""evil giant purple rabbit"".  While a lot of the tasks/quests/missions given to you are pretty much straightforward, the great part about this game is being able to try something weird or unexpected to accomplish the task, usually with hilarious results.For example, for ""Give the little kid something to help him get past the bully"" I wrote ""gun.""  A pistol spawns in his hand and the bully runs away scared.Additionally, you can just goof around in each level, messing with the inhabitants, making weird things, etc...It's a game you will eventually finish and probably get bored of later, but if you want a very casual and easy game with some unexpected laughs, give this a try!  It's also good kid-friendly, and also a good game for non-gamers to try out.			"

I have gotten plenty of things that don't work but for the most part you can write any noun to make it appear. Pretty neat mechanic! It's fun trying to come up with solutions other than the obvious ones. On the other hand, there have been a few puzzles that I couldn't figure out at all, either because my mind wasn't going in a certain direction intended, or because I missed something. Good game all around.			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is a game that you use your imagination and wit to solve puzzles and problems for other people, creatures, etc. The general story is that Maxwell, the protagonist, and his sister, Lily, have been given very powerful tools, a Notebook that creates what you write and a globe that teleports you around the world, that have caused them to become somewhat rotten. Their parents sent them out to learn about the world, Maxwell pulls a rather mean trick on a beggar, and the beggar casts a spell that turns Lily slowly into stone. Maxwell learns that Starites, a product of people's happiness, can possibly return Lily to normal. Thus your quest begins.Basically restating the introduction aside, you go around the world solving people's problems using your magic Notebook. Now the real fun of the game is that your objectives can be solved in the most random of ways. Somewhere in the game, you are tasked to get something that would make noise for a Fire truck. You could go with a regular old siren, but why not use the mythological one? And it counts. As for Maxwell himself, he has a life-bar, so you do need to be careful when going around or you can die.One of the downsides to the game, however, is that you can severely cheese it sometimes. Using the notebook, you can use the adjectives invincible, fast, and flying on Maxwell to make him as such. It's nice when you're just fooling around and whatnot, but it does take away an aspect of possibly surviving.You can also create your own custom objects using an editor within the game. You're also able to try out others' creations in the Steam Workshop as well as put your own out to share with the world. I haven't played around with the editor myself, and I have tried to import items from the Workshop with no success, but it could just be on my end.There was some controversy with this game for a little while when the developers were sued by the creators of Nyan Cat and Keyboard cat for using their intellectual properties in the game without consent. Not sure how the lawsuit worked out and there was a decent amount of debate on who was right and who was wrong; none of this really effected the game itself to my knowledge.Overall, Scribblenauts Unlimited is a pretty good game that can last you as long as your imagination can. I'd advise picking it up when it's on sale.			"

												This is undoubtedly the definitive version of Scribblenauts. It’s especially well-suited to PC, with the mouse for precision item-building and placement, and the keyboard for quick, no-fuss item generation. Furthermore, the object editor adds some extra depth to the experience, offering creative folk the opportunity to create abominations that act as they deem fit.Starite collection isn’t mindless in this instalment; while fleeting, there has been an effort to give meaning to Maxwell’s journey. His life and family’s history are also delved into. The premise of Maxwell’s grand quest is odd, but charming in a way: Maxwell’s twin sister, Lily, is cursed by an old beggar whom Maxwell played a trick on. Starites, apparently, are able to stop Lily’s body from petrifying, so Maxwell sets out to do good deeds and acquire the cure for his sister. Along the way, Maxwell will run into all forty of his other siblings—that’s right, Maxwell’s folks have forty-two kids. The siblings are an eclectic bunch, and once found, may be used instead of Maxwell as the playable avatar. The other siblings don’t add depth to the plot, but they’re fun to find nonetheless. The level editor from previous games has been replaced with an object editor, which allows the player to create *virtually* anything, although they must start with a base object (Eg., “Cat”). Thereafter, the base object may be adorned with whatever suits the creator’s whim, and colours and textures offer added appeal. The editor also enables the player to alter/add/remove a wide range of behaviours and attributes, which can have hilarious or disastrous results. Usually the latter, but that only adds to the fun. The object may also be renamed, and that name need not stick to any naming conventions. 5th Cell have done away with linear progression and opted for something far more versatile; perhaps the most welcomed change to this version of Scribblenauts is the player’s ability to traverse the large overworld in an unrestrained fashion. While they will need to collect a certain number of Starites to unlock neighbouring chunks of map, the available chunk of map contains several areas the player can discover at their own leisure, in any order they choose. One can skip the trek and simply select each area from the map menu, though there seems to be greater reward in discovering each area on foot. Scribblenauts Unlimited is full of curious and sometimes head-scratching puzzles, all of which are a delight to solve. For the first time, players are able to create their own objects to solve puzzles and/or hassle NPCs—both equally fun. Players are offered a lot of freedom in this game, which is another first, and definitely a step in the right direction. My only quibble is the complete lack of multiplayer, or a level editor that can be used to create scenarios for friends to stumble through.			"

												This game is fun for a casual gamer. It's not particularly challenging, but that's what made it fun for just relaxing. The game can test the limits of your creativity, as you attempt to come up with new ways of doing simple tasks, and the game can be limiting if you don't know exactly what you're trying to do. Overall, I would recommend this game for relaxing down time.			"

												I wouldn't say that this is a bad game, far from it actually, but this is one of those games that i would rather play on a Mobile Phone or a DS, you can see that alot of work has been put into it, but i feel that it's a bit childish, and the major thing that annoys me greatly is that some logical solutions do not seem to work.

												After opening the game and playing 1 mission I thought ""Wow this is a game for 12year olds."" I got mine in the Humble Bundle and had no idea what it was btw.BUT something kept me playing... it was the plain fun and imagination in the game. Do not judge this game by just looking at it, in this game almost everything is possible, and it all depends on you! You can creat ANYTHING with your magical notbook, from a ant to sun! It is very fun a will keep you busy for hours. Only negative part is that it's not really a long game, but i can assure you, you will enjoy every second!Playground for imagination! 9/10			"

												STRONGLY recommend this game. I thought it was some girly and childish game similar to Little Big Planet series. I was so wrong! This game really gives you the feeling of being a godlike being with your magical notepad. It's a little bit like Deathnote's notepad which allows you to write out how you want someone to die and when - only that this is even more powerful, it goes beyond death and can even create things and make things change properties. For example if I met an angry man I could take out my magical notepad and write that he is a crazy happy guy, and boom he becomes that! Really really fun for those who have great imagination. Alas, this is still not a game for everyone. The graphics are still pretty cute and some serious gamers may never swallow it. Or that you are not the very creative kind and prefer hard action etc.			"

												The premise is simple:  imagine anything, and watch it come to life in the game.Scribblenauts at its core is a sandbox word game that gives its players the freedom of imagination to produce and create almost anything they can think of into the game in order to solve problems and puzzles.  Cat stuck in a tree? Write, ""ladder,"" and ""fireman"" and watch them appear in game and save the cat.  Soldier in need of a weapon?  How about typing in ""bazooka,"" or ""laser gun,"" or even ""Excalibur"" or ""Thor's Hammer"" if you want.  It's all in the game, and it'll all work towards solving puzzles.  The game really is almost limitless, with the dictionary of recognized words limited mostly by one's imagination, and it makes it a lot of fun just to aimlessly type things in, watch them come to life, and mess around.Scribblenauts is the kind of game that prides itself in creativity in addition to its undeniable charm.  It's great for any and all ages, and also is a true go-to game that I like to show off to non-gaming friends and family.			"

												Great, fun puzzle game with interesting sandbox gameplay.  Solve puzzles by creating objects using words or adding whatever adjectives you can think of, and there is more than one way to solve any single puzzle!  If something doesn't exist, you can create it on the object editor!I recommend this if you like platformers, and/or love creating whatever your imagination can create.  Not as complex as gmod (that's because gmod of course, is more specialized in sandbox gameplaym than scribblenauts), but that doesn't mean Scribblenauts is limited!  Create sparkling rainbow bazookas that fire exploding panties,or flying pigs or a flying chair you can ride...whatever is on your mind!  Every object you make can have behaviors, scripting for more advanced behaviors, making anything ride-able, edible, hold-able, wearable...whatever!  And every object can be edited as well.It's quite surprising what things exist in the game you never expected to be there.  Of course, would be nice to see more things done with the game, but still a fun game nontheless, well worth the 30 bucks spent.   If it's on sale, definitely get it!			"

I would not say that the game is super hard and challenging, but some of the puzzles do make you think. Being honest, I had to look some of them up! I think the fun in the game comes from trying to be as creative as possible and enjoying the quircky and whimsical design. I totally reccomend this game to anybody looking for some silly fun. Perhaps to destress and have some laughs. If you are into lighthearted games, this is for you!			"

												After finishing this game I can certainly say that is is worth playing. It has replay ability but its mostly about the first play through. If you are playing I'd say keep an eye on the shards in the menu, otherwise you'll end up at the end grinding for ages to get the shard pieces. Its fun to write some random stuff to solve odd puzzles that in most cases can be solved simply but why solve it simply when you can summon kathulu or a giant pink fish or a tiny tank. Games like this bring out the weird and sometimes darker parts of my personality. There are some problems where I had to look up on Wiki to find out how to complete a task but for the majority you can find some way to 100% the game.			"

												I am a very creative person, so this game is one of my favorites! It's family friendly, fun and creative. The steam workshop also lets me add copyrighted items into the game. I would recommend it.			"

												This game is a great way to spend a relaxing evening. I use it to make myself laugh when I have a bad day! It is really fun if you like exploring your options and seeing what you can and cannot do in weird situations. I personally love it, so I hope you will too!			"

												Scribblenauts Unlimited is a fun little game where you can let your crazy imagination run wild.  If you want a flying blue explosive transparent friendly sofa or a rideable polka-dotted glass bright coffee cup, then go ahead.  The only limit in this game is your imagination (or copyrighted things).  The whole purpose of this game is to help people out by spawning things in with your magic notebook and fixing their problems.  If you're ever in a bad mood and you want to feel better, this is the perfect game to play.  Probably the best feature about this game is the object editor and Steam Workshop integration.  You can easily edit any item and post it to the Steam Workshop for anyone to enjoy.  If you find an item that someone else has made, you can download it from the Workshop and put it into your game.  From a completionist standpoint, this game is really easy to complete considering the majority of the achievements are from collecting starites.  If you've ever wanted a game that was really easy to 100% complete, Scribblenauts Unlimited is your game.  I rate Scribblenauts Unlimited a 8/10.			"

												There's a moment early on in Scribblenauts when you're faced with a puzzle with an entirely easy solution. Instead of that solution, you want to do something creative and crazy. The idea is in your head, but you know it won't work: there's no way the game developers even thought of putting a <insert thing> in the game, and if they did, they wouldn't have made it a way to solve this puzzle. And then it works.That moment is different for everyone, and describing mine (giving a theremin to a homeless guy so he could start a band) wouldn't really explain what makes it so special. It's a moment everyone needs to experience for themselves.Scribblenauts is a sandbox game. Sure, there are puzzles, achievements, and even a plot, but for the most part Scribblenauts is a game where you want to put the craziest things into the world and see what happens. The puzzles facilitate this well: any adult should have no problem solving them (they are, after all, designed for young children), but if you're like me you will find yourself motivated to think of the most ludicrous solution, with the hope that maybe you can outsmart the game. Need to put out a fire? Firefighter is a boring answer; try annihilating it with some antimatter!Playing out pure sandbox fantasies is amazing too. Watching what happens is what makes the game amazing. Give God a magical squirtgun and he'll use it to turn Cthulhu into a dove—then promptly discard the weapon, pick dove Cthulhu up by the neck, and start bashing him on things. It's an inexplicably amazing experience.The game shines when your crazy ideas play themselves out, but it's not perfect at it. Finding the holes takes a little magic away each time, and reminds you that the game can't actually function without being programmed to. If something is missing in the game you might be able to find it in the Steam Workshop (or build it yourself), but it's doubtful it will be quite as epic as finding that yes, the developers did in fact think of it.My main criticism is the adjective system. While it's amazing when it works, and it can be a lot of fun to add an adjective to a random citizen and watch them change their behavior because of it, it's not without fault. Many if not most of the available adjectives seem to have minimal effects short of thought bubbles expressing them, if they even have that. Why doesn't my ""vengeful"" hunter attack people? What makes her vengeful? Further, some objects do exist in the game that are multiple words, and making these is tricky when the game assumes if you have a typo you meant to type ""Adjective Noun"" instead of a two word noun. Some of these are entirely confusing: ""flying broomstick"" is a seperate object from spawning a broomstick and adding the adjective flying to it, for instance.Still, these moments hardly detract from the rest of the game. It's an amazing and well worthwhile experience.			"

												This is the most adorable game I have played in a very long time. It's fun, it's amusing, it's addicting, and I absolutely love it. You'd have to be a heartless, soulless monster not to smile every second you're playing this game.			"

												Cute as ♥♥♥♥, and really fun. Good game to let your imagintion run free. Puzzles are easy as hell, but they pretty much let you solve them however you want. Cat stuck in a tree? Use a ladder, use a jetpack, cut the tree down, blow the tree up.			"

												The game is cute and the puzzles are fun. It's neat to come up with outlandish solutions to the puzzles though sometimes I overthought some of the puzzles and actually got stumped. Lots of costumes to make and alternate characters (siblings of the main character) to play as. The story is silly and simple, but kept me occupied. Good game for kids and adults.			"
