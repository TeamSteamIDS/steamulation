												At first the game seems easy, but its a pretty good puzzle game that revolves around the use of magical colored lanterns to open secret doors and find levers.  Not a long game, but hunting all the treasures which do nothing may be of interest?  The goal is to save Grandpa!!!  The bad part of the game is that the lanterns run out which can leave you trapped unable to complete a level, luckily their not long though so restarting isnt a big deal.  Poor instructions means going old school when getting into fights, just figuring out how to beat a boss, or an enemy, such as the last boss where you just drop a bunch of Holy hand Grenades, yep those are in the game, its fun.  Later levels are very dark testing your memory, providing a good challenge.  magical weapons in the game are a few, if you put them down they only reappear randomly once, so carry those through the whole game, except that eye of horus it appears a few times.nostalgia:  Game is based on a very old atari 2600 cartridge which was played in a console that looked like it was made of wood, everything back then had wood grain.  In the original haunted House you ran around as a set of eyes with a light, they pull off the update nicely.  To check out the old game with all its classy Atari EXPLOSION sound effects because haunted houses are hardcore check out this link:  http://www.gamesloon.com/free-arcade-3/retro-games-8/haunted-house-atari-54815.htmlRating:  8/10  Value:  $7.99			"

												My second favorite Atari 2600 game behind Adventure. Really like the updated graphics and added  gameplay elements. Would love to see a remake of Adventure in this style.			"

												This game is a time waster update of an OLD simplistic Atari Game.If you like that, buy it, if not, don't.I like it, I saw it on sale, I bought it for a song, and I got my money's worth.			"

												Disappointing despite the graphical facelift. I guess I was expecting a little more than an exact replica of the original game.			"

												I'm old enough to have owned the original for the Atari 2600. I spent some time trying to figure out how to get it to run 1080p proper. When I finally started playing, I discovered some of the most horrible controls I have ever seen. Frequently freezes you for dialogs, regardless of on-screen actions/threats.This is unplayable. Very disappointed.			"

												When the original came out, the creators took what limited technology that had and created a genuinely creepy, highly memorable game. I recently revisited this game and I was pleased to see that the original game has held up nicely throughout the years.  To me it was one of the best classic Atari games ever released.So how did the reboot hold up? Ehh, so-so; While this game wasn't terrible, it wasn't necessarily good either.  It just seems that they could have done more with it. Wait until this goes on sale for $2.99 and get it then. "

												Heyyo,Hehe, another silly little indie game that's decent enough to pass time.. you run around in a haunted house and try to not get caught by monsters as you try to solve the mystery of the haunted house. You don't get regular attacks-per-se... just stuff you can sometimes do with a torch or what-not. It's a fun little time killer. I never delved far into the game though since at the time I was playing the Ghostbusters game which is a more badass game about ghosts... but still, I'll recommend this game for the fact that it's cheap and decently challenging.

												To put things briefly:DON'T BUY IT.DON'T BUY IT.DON'T BUY IT.DON'T BUY IT.DON'T BUY IT.DON'T BUY IT.DON'T BUY IT.DON'T BUY IT.Now to the actual review.This game is not worth you time or money.  It is a barebones experience without a ghost of a chance to be entertaining.  And yes, this game is worse than those puns I just made.  I came into this game wanting to enjoy it, and I came out sorely disappointed less than an hour later.  It is a boring, samey slog through tiring, repetitive levels.  The gameplay is so minimal that it utterly fails to entertain.  A clear lack of effort is evident in the subpar level design, outdated graphics, and poor gameplay.  I am glad I got this for dirt cheap through a sale, because payng any mre than 2 US dollars for this would be highway robbery.  When Valve finally gets around to implementing that refund policy, this is the first game I'm going to make use of it with.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED AND BORED.			"
