												This game is a classic. Years after its release, it is still one of the most engrossing games, which also leaves you nostalgic. The combat is fluidic and the story in itself is solid. The game has its own problems of camera misalignment at times and the occassional glitch, but it's a must buy for any and all gamers.			"

												The game that changed my life forever. This masterpiece has it all:- Amazing Story. (The plot is just a marvel.)  10/10- Great Graphics. (I still can't believe this game was released back in 2003.)   10/10- Fantastic Music. (The whole soundtrack was stunning. Perfectly scripted for every situation and utterly magnificent. Stuart Chatwood quickly became one of my favorite music composers.)   10/10- Charming Voice Acting. (Yuri Lowenthal's voice alone was enough for the top score. The whole adventure is so beautifully narrated, so full of great ideas and outright perplexing figures of speech...)   10/10- Addicting Gameplay. (A great mix of combat, acrobatic free-running and a some tricky puzzles.)   10/10- Character Progression. (The game constantly updates the player with new powers, weapons and even clothing.)   10/10- Diverse and Unique. (This game has some of the most beautiful surroundings I ever seen. Lots of unique enemies and  locations to discover.)   10/10This game is pure gold. The characters not only look amazing but they also feel... Alive. Totally different, each with it's own moral standing and their way of thinking. There is this good feeling when playing this game. Both the Prince and Farah are behaving as natural as it could get. They are very distant at the beginning, unmoved, cold. But as they make progress, they develop this feeling of mutual respect. Later on they become good friends. Joking and taunting each other in a very loving way. Check this monologue here:""She said my love... I know she did. I didn't dream it... at least I think I didn't... It's quite natural really, her Kingdoms' conquered, she has nothing, no one to protect her. She needs me! I can see it in the way she looks at me. All I'd have to do is... Reach out and, take her hand... And she'd be mine! Why am I talking to myself ?!""I have beat the game at least 5 times. Don't mind my Steam playing time. It was before I had purchased it here. And I don't regret a thing.This game offers and unforgetable adventure. If you haven't still played it, do it. The best game in the franchise in my opinion. 10/10 "

												The Gold Egg of the trilogy.Time travel, parkour, and puzzles. This game does those 3 best. The combat is fairly simple and straightfoward, you can swing your sword, use your dagger, block, jump over enemies, and whatnot. Puzzles are fairly straightforward and challenging.And then you have several time altering powers using the Dagger of Time, you have your:Recall: Reverse time for up to several seconds, usually for saving you from heavy damage, screwing up on a jump or puzzle, or instant deaths.The Eye of the Storm: Slows down time and makes combat and some puzzles/platforming/parkouring easier.Enemy Freeze: Renders an enemy frozen in time and much easier to kill.Frozen Time Assault: Freeze time and go into a badass Omnislash-like frenzy on multiple enemies and wreak havoc.All time powers require either a sand tank, or a halfmoon depending on which power it is. You fill up sandtanks and halfmoons by finishing enemies with the Dagger of Time.One of my favorite parts in the game I remember is the bats, who always retreat in groups of 3 when you kill a bunch. My brother would always yell ""THREE RETREAT!"" and I would always laugh.Man... I wish I would of kept my Gamecube copy of the game I got back in 2003 that my dad got me for Christmas... because... them nostalgias.The PC version of this game seems to hold up pretty well (at least on XP anyway).It's a classic game and is pretty badass in general, give it a try sometime.

												Bought this game on Nov-2015 as a thank you for the good times I had playing this game long time back on Windows XP. Good story. Very engaging. Best played with a controller though. One thing I noticed while playing recently on Windows 10 64bit Home is that if FOG is turned on in game settings, then full display goes white. So had to turn off FOG and play and it worked fine. I totally recommend this game.Last played on:GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 820M DDR3CPU: Intel Core i5-5200U @ 2.20GHzRAM: 4GB DDR3Game Resolution: 1024x768, 60HzOperating System: Microsoft Windows 10 64bit HomeController: Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller for PC			"

												Do I recommend this game? No! I strongly Insist that you should try it!The ""Prince"" was one of the best titles even in 90's, but its 3D re-vision I am talking about - is definetely a mind-blowing piece of art! We've got a perfect mixture of both simple and catchy story, and a veeery enjoyable acrobatics, with tons of multi-levelled obstacles to climb, enemies to bring down...Game is perfect!Well, yeah, it's dated 11 years now, so we have visuals of PS2-era... But it was fascinating back then, and still looks pretty decent even on big screens. And it's the only dated part. Story - still fine, acrobatics (and control of it) - kicks asses, music - eternally fresh. 9/10 in my book.PS Yeah, there is ""fog"" issue you might meet, if at first start all is blue and you don't see anything... worry not, just turn off that ""fog"" feature in video options and you'll be fine.

												Honestly one of the best games I have ever played, The story line was magnificent, the atmosphere, it all drew you. However the constant changing view points have resulted in my death in the game quite a bit, nonetheless magnificent scenery and captivatng story. The gameplay was a bit shakey but very wonderful, leaping through the air from beam to beam tends to exite someone, and this game created that feeling.  The addition of the sidescroller prince of persia minigames was excelent.There were a few issues with playing on steam however, I noticed that it lacked the ability to ""shift+tab"" while in game. The ability to ""alt+tab"" still remains however it is a tedious thing to tab out of a game for the purposes of a message.I did enjoy the soundtracks but there were some moments where it would not play during a fight and then start again at random intervals. Nonetheless this did not make the fighting less intense.In summary a very well made game, it is astonishing to believe it has really been ten years since I have played it on the ps2.I recomend this game for anyone who likes a good story over graphics.

												Is there a better ""remake"" game than Sands of Time? Maybe the new Tomb Raider? This game revolutionized platforming in many ways. The controls are so fluid. You just want to make the acrobatics fast and flowing. Get it wrong? Just rewind. These mechanics were revolutionary at the time. I loved this game when I played it on the GameCube way back when. Its still a fun romp through amazing puzzle platforms. A+.			"

												""Most people think that time is like a river, that flows swift and sure in one direction. But I have seen the face of time, and I can tell you, they are *wrong.* Time, is an ocean in a storm. You may wonder who I am, and why I say this. Sit down, and I will tell you a tale like none you have ever heard.""And thus begins the game that defined my childhood. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time feels more like a playable fairy tale than just a normal, run of the mill video game. You play as the titular Prince, a young, proud, IMPOSSIBLY AGILE warrior from Persia who, with his father's army, ransacks an Indian Palace and seizes the legendary treasures within to gift to the Sultan of Azad: An hourglass filled with the (also titular) Sands of Time, a mystical substance that can affect the flow of time itself, and a crystal Dagger of Time that can capture and channel the Sands. Ever prideful, the Prince is tricked into releasing the Sands of Time unto Azad, twisting and corrupting those without the Sands' complementary artifacts into mindless abominations.It is up to him, and Princess Farah, the daughter of the Maharajah, to undo his fatal mistake.This game is packed with entertaining combat and mind-bending puzzles set to a pleasant pseudo-Persian/Arabian/Indian soundtrack composed by the talented Stuart Chatwood. In addition, this game is arguably the one that popularized the use of parkour, which you will use to navigate the crumbling and booby-trapped Sultan's palace. And that isn't even all; to this *very day,* Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time *still* has the best time-manipulation physics in gaming of all time. Voicework for the Prince is done by Yuri Lowenthal. Yes, the same man who voices Ben Tennyson (Ben 10) and Sasuke Uchiha (Naruto). It might just be bias, but that honestly makes it better in my opinion. The character development is quite solid as well. The dialogue between the Prince and Farah is witty, funny, and nuanced, and due to the poor Prince not having anyone else to talk to when he and Farah get separated, the game is also filled with deep, ponderous, or funny and meta monologues on the Prince's behalf. The love story between the Prince and Farah is also well written, and you can't help but root for the duo.If you can handle the occasionally difficult Sand Creature battle, tricky parkour, annoying as hell Sand Scarabs and Vultures, conserving your Sands, avoiding having Farah repeatedly peg your a$$ with arrows in the middle of a fight in a tight corridor, and navigate a time-consuming puzzle involving axles while being screamed at by a Persian guard with a thick Scottish accent and *NO CONCEPT OF VOLUME CONTROL* then this game is definitely for you!This game has endured for me, and if the speedrunning community is anything to go by, then we're *still* discovering new things and new ways to play the game more than a decade after its initial release. For that reason, and because of the game's mastery of time-manipulation... and because of the general theme, this game most definitely DESERVES the ""Test of Time"" Steam Award!			"

												This game is a true classic, all the way back from a time when ubisoft wasn't a ♥♥♥♥ tier studio that barfs out half-baked Assassin's Creed clones which run like a nightmare on moderately good hardware. But I digress, the reason why this game is nothing short of awesome is the insanely well executed platforming. In a word... the platforming is just thrilling, its really tight and rewarding despite the sometimes wonky camera. However what makes it a bit of a flawed gem in my opinion is the combat. In theory, and for most part in practice the combat is actually great, way more fun than AC. The main issue I have with the combat is just how when you get knocked down on the ground, which will happen a lot with later enemies that you cant vault over(but you cant help but try to because the vaulting and jumping is the same button but depends on the direction you're pointing towards) its going to be really hard to get back up and so you end dead before you know it, since you'll always have at least 4 enemies constantly hammering you while you're desperately trying to jump back up on your feet. I also wasn't a fan of how each time you kill an enemy a new one spawns out of nowhere to replace it, this padding felt really grindy to me and ended up feeling much more frustrating than challenging so I found myself wanting to get through the otherwise excellent combat to get back to that oh so sweet sweet platforming action. Other than that the gameplay is just perfect. The setting, story, music and the decade+ old graphics all still hold up really well today.Regarding the technical stuff, you'll need to patch it for high res. support and disable the in game fog option if everything looks grey. I noticed some voice overs skipping and very rarely some weird physics happening @ 144hz, it didn't really detract from the gameplay though. Also It has partial controller support only, so I recommend using xpadder fill in the missing keys that will allow you to save and toggle walk with your controller. Thats it...Play it/10			"

												Ever since I bought this game for the PS2 back when it was first released, this game is still one of the best games to play for PS2 AND PC. Fun puzzles and it is not too challenging, at the same time you have a dagger that can take you back in time, slow down enemies, and even collect sand to make you stronger. Another cool part is, it's in HD. The graphics are awesome and way better then the PS2 version. This game has it all and I recommend this game to anyone who loves adventures and puzzles.			"

Assassins Creed, the Arkham Series, Even Dark Souls to some extent; they all happened because this game showed the beginnings of what an amazing combat system should be.

												I'm writing this review just as I've nominated this game for the ""Test of time"" award. Pun intended.This game came out in 2003. 13 years later, I can:- Run the game on my Windows 7 and 10 PCs that run multicore CPUs. The max resolution is 1024x768, granted, but the game runs fine. Little or no glitches.- Enjoy graphics that, although outdated, are still gorgeous and evoke that distinct ""Arabian nights"" feeling.- Listen to an amazing soundtrack that blends oriental and heavy metal, two genres that are viewed as standing as far from one another in my home country, yet Stuart Chatwood has seemingly done the impossible.- Stand in awe as I look at the end credits and listen to ""Time Only Knows""; and can't help but feel empty as one of the most captivating stories has come to an end, and the characters I overcame so many obstacles with have to part ways.- Rewind time again and again just to see the prince's expression as he jumps out from an abyss.Looking back at this masterpiece, I can't help but wonder: Ubisoft, what the hell happened?

												A very solid and fun puzzle platformer, re-envisioning the old classic. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is one of the most successful revivals in gaming history, and it is well deserved for having done so. The game is a third-person platformer interspersed with action segments featuring melee combat. A time-rewinding mechanic is present to assist both in combat and platforming, which can be recharged by defeating enemies.The platforming is the focus of the game, and the combat serves more to break up the puzzles - the controls for combat are not as tight as those for platforming, so those sections of the gameplay can be a little less interesting/more frustrating.The puzzles themselves are rather imaginative, and require some acrobatic moves in order to complete them.While the graphics are starting to show their age, the game itself holds up. If you enjoy puzzle platformers, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game.			"

												Pros: highly addictive. Challenging but not frustrating. Acrobatics are incredibly fun. Puzzles are interesting without stopping you dead. Fighting is tight, responsive, and gives you a fine amount of attacks, dodges and the like. Good balance of how much time you spend on the different gameplay types herein: acrobatics, dodging traps, fighting, and solving puzzles. The score is cool, rock music with a Middle Eastern touch. Likeable characters. Engaging story. The graphics hold up rather well, albeit the pre-rendered cutscenes show the limitations.Cons: some find the fighting too restrictive. The camera does get in the way, albeit using Landscape Cam, letting it ""stick"" to the current area for a clear view, can help. Roll and Jump are on the same key, which does mean you'll sometimes do one intending to do the other. You'll also sometimes accidentally run up a wall when you meant to run along it, and vice versa. If you play for half an hour and you don't think it's varied enough: you *will* not find the game overall to be. No collectibles, only one difficulty setting and no way for you to affect the story means little replayability.(please ignore how little time it says I've played - I've completed it several times, just not via Steam)I recommend this to any fan of fast-paced action-adventure.

												This game truly is amazing. I was playing Assassins Creed Syndicate around the same time I was playing this, and Sands of Time kept me more engaged and interested in the gameplay then Syndicate did. The platforming is fantastic. You wall run and backflip in order to solve puzzles, not just for the sake of looking cool. But damn you look cool.It's been what, 14 years since this games original release? Because of this there are some things that haven't aged too well. At times enemies can be extremely annoying, circiling around and stabbing you every time you manage to get off the ground. It also annoyed me at first that after every battle the prince had a little cutscene of him putting away his swords. At times this became useful in knowing when all enemies were dead, but it is still a pain. Dialogue (mostly from Farah) is sometimes very faint and hard to hear. But really, other then these few things I feel like the game has aged well.To all those stating this game has no controller support and is a poor port: My Xbox 360 gamepad worked fine, I just had to bind everything and use mouse for the main menu. There are a few issues with graphics and glitches and to fix them you can find guides in the community hub. The main issue is just that you need to probably enable vsync.I would defintely recommend this game to anyone interested in the series. The ending surprised me at how good it was. Time to play Warrior Within.			"

												*Warning* possible spoilers aheadPros: +Excellent platforming based puzzles. These are usually pretty simple to work out once you realise most of them have only one path but when you consider how they work as a whole they are pretty ingenious and will challenge you're platforming skills and timing.+Great atmosphere and art direction. The Persian setting is unique and rarely done. Even in 2014 this game looks excellent. The character models haven't aged well but the environments have for sure.+Ability to rewind time and use it in battle is an excellent idea+First person view allows you to offset the terrible camera+Varied enemies force you to engage combat in different ways+The Prince. Although it happens infrequently, when the Prince does chime in it's usually something humorous and entertaining.Cons:-The camera is a pain whether you're doing platforming or you're in combat. During platforming the camera will frequently move into undesirable positions forcing you to guess what you're supposed to be doing next. In combat it does the same which quickly becomes tiresome when you're unable to see the enemy attacking you from behind. It also struggles hard when you're in tight spaces and the camera has to contend with walls :S-You're companion is kinda useless and it feels as if you're partnership is a one way deal. During platforming she will stand there and let you do all the work aside from when she has to go through a few cracks or pull a few triggers (to Ubisoft's credit they use this as a point of humour which is much appreciated). In combat she is the same. The AI refuses to move from a certain position unless you stray too far from her which means that when there are multiple enemies attacking her she is essentially a sitting duck which wouldn't be too bad but she has very low health. Oh and her arrows can harm you. She killed me once when I had one enemy left to kill and a number of times her arrow has hit me stunning me for a number of enemies to take away my remaining health. Her voice actor is also very poor.-Combat encounters take far too long on occasions. You would expect combat to last about a cpuple of minutes at the most but sometimes they take double that making those encounters tedious to go through.-Fall heights are deceptive. There are essentially 3 fall heights. Twice you're height which the prince can handle. 2-3 times you're height the Prince will lose a bit of health. Anything above 3 times you're height and the Prince will die. This becomes incredible frustrating when you have what appears to be a manageable fall and yet the prince cant take it. What would have been useful is a more lenient falling system where you took larger damage rather than outright dying for higher drops.-The story. It feels as though everything is rushed. You never get a chance at the beginning to digest what is actually going and then suddenly you're on this Grand Adventure. What's worse is that at no point aside from the end of the game is the story truly developed, which is a shame because the concept is excellent. There are points in which the subplot with you're companion is expanded but it feels so contrived especially since she is so damn unlikable.Misc thoughts:=You're companion would be far more likeable if she was controllable. Frequently during the game there are situations only she can deal with like crawl into narrow spaces etc. I stand by my point that she is still useless as you tend to do 95% of the work but being able to control her would have enabled more complex puzzles and allowed there to be more variedplatforming challenges if creative enough. In combat it would allow you to experience a different combat style and allow you to better position her to reduce damage if you were primarily going to play as the Prince. I belieev this would also help you better engage with her as a character (although thevoice acting is still terrible)=It would be nice to have a larger variety of sand based abilities to use.=Controller support on PC would have made the game much more easier to control but as it is it's still very much playable.Final thought:Get the game if you enjoy excellent platforming and puzzles but pass if you're buying it for excellent combat or story.

												I can highly recommend this game to anyone who liked the original and would like to see a more modern iteration of the same type of gameplay. The puzzles and platform sequences are great fun, though the camera can sometimes cause a bit of confusion.My only main complaint about the game is that there's just a tad too much hack and slash gameplay versus the 'sand of time zombies'. The original barely had any swordfights and mostly consisted of just evading traps etc. This game, when playing on hard such as I did, you'll sometimes be facing 5-6 enemies in a room who will also keep respawning 2-3 times. The developers should have understood they were making PoP, not a God of War game. So as it stands I give it an 8,0 out of 10 (would have been a 9,0 without the excessive combat sequences that pop up every now and then).But definitely, buy this game and enjoy its great gameplay because it's so worth it!

The fight engine is a little limited and can be frustrating to use on PC occasionally and the camera angles can be a ♥♥♥♥ but they are more only complaints and they are really minor. Esepcially as the sequals fixed these issues. But, the story itself and the complexity of the puzzles and boss  fights makes this into an absolute gem of a game that has inspired many games after it's time.			"

												The Sands of Time when it originally came out boasted some of the best graphics and fluid 3D animation in games.  By today's standard, the graphics still look great and animation is even more fluid with the advance of video card speed.  The platforming is well executed.  The levels can be massive at times and requires you to go through a maze of wall runs, jumps, and many other acrobatic maneuvers in order to reach your goal.  The game almost runs like each major room is a level and you need to reach its objective/goal in order to move on to the next level.  The action can feel rather repetitive, however, some of the enemies do require a different approach and strategy to take down and kill.  However, the game is well paced to keep the actions repetition from annoying the gameplay too much.  Overall though, the fight scenes are well choreographed and your character looks really cool in action.  The introduction of the Sands of Time and the knife that allows you to rewind time if you fall to your death or get killed in battle is a really cool gimmick that works and fits very well in this game.  The storyline is great, especially when you realize how the beginning and the end come together to completely understand the story.  This is a classic, just as much as the original 2D Prince of Persia is a classic as well.  If you've never played this game, you should do yourself a favor and pick this up and play it.			"

												I love this game so much, I can't get enough of it. It's one of my all time favorites.I wasn't used to PC controls, seeing how this is probably my first game on it, but surprisingly the controls are perfect.What I like most about it is how enchanting the settings is, and how they kept the soul of the pop classic such as regaining health while drinking water. Everything about our prince is cool from his design, to his charater,to his fighting style.The puzzle are well thought of, and if you thought platforming could get tiresome, you're wrong here.I'd recommend this game to anyone anytime.

												Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a 3D platforming game that modernizes the classic Prince of Persia game that some of us remember playing when we were kids. The music and graphics sound and look great and all fit the theme perfectly. The platforming and puzzles are not too difficult, however there are some areas that can become frustrating due to the clunky movement (so many times the Prince jumped in the wrong direction to his death...) and camera controls. Also the combat is pretty straight forward but is also pretty clunky as there is not much strategy and there are times the fights are frustrating as the enemies just mob up against you and keep attacking you in the middle of your animation and also harass your partner which can prematurely end fights because your partner has fallen. All in all, the game does a good job as a platformer and lasts about 7-8 hours long, however it does have some issues with the controls and frustrating fights. If you are willing to deal with a little bit of frustration you will find an enjoyable 3D platformer in the start of Prince of Persia Trilogy.			"

												One of the best platformers ever made. Great parkour sections, well animated and challenging to boot. The sequels never managed to top this one, neither in gameplay or story (though the sequels vastly improved the combat system, I'll give them that).Has aged relatively well, though I don't remember the game having such awful washed out colours on PS2 as it does on PC. Get a good SweetFX setting to resolve this.  Only fault of the game is the repetitive and simplistic combat, but the controls are simple and it's animated with grace well enough as to not be TOO annoying. Just figure out how to cheat the combat system so you can get to the platforming, which you'll mostly be doing anyway.			"

												The game is an old classic, and a damn good one. I mean, it does have its drawbacks. The camera, for one, is horrible and at times can really mess things up, especially during combat. And this particular version of the game has a few strange bugs, but nothing game breaking (except for one at the end of the game which forced me to reload my last save). Those things aside however, the game is really solid. The gameplay is fun and quite a bit challenging, there are lots of platforming sections and environmental puzzles which are fun to go through. The story is... all right, nothing earth shattering but engaging enough and well executed, in my opinion.If you haven't played it already, please do so, you will most likely enjoy it. Anyone interested in platforming should give this game a chance. And if you're not interested in platforming, give it a shot anyway, who knows, you might get into it!			"

												An amazing platforming experience! More than 10 years have passed since this remake of the old Prince of Persia classic came out and it still is a great game: epic story and music, cool battle system and parkour action and innovative time rewind system were what made this game unforgettable, but most of all I liked the interaction, romance and comedy moments you got with the female lead, Farah.For me it was what gave the game a ""heart"" and distinguished the protagonist from being another ""bot"", as it happens in many other games.It was also the game that set the foundations for UbiSoft's ""battle horse"" of today, Assassin's Creed.Lastly, if I had to write down some flaws, I would name the graphics, which could be considered cartoon-ish and simple (but I personally liked, since I think fitted well with the whole fairy tale atmosphere) and the repetitive battle system (though I didn't notice excessively, because the mix of action and music was really awesome), but in the end even these flaws get overshadowed by the game's sheer brilliance and innovation, so if you haven't played it yet, DO waste your time with The Sands of Time.

The stunning and addictive sountrack topped with the picturesque scenery makes this game feel like it really is set in the time of the great Persian Empire.

												A classic 6th generation platformer, it introduced many of the cinematic aspects which would later be used in the Assassin Creed's series. While boasting a better presentation than many 3D games of the time, it still retains its roots as a trial and error puzzle platformer, requiring the player to pay attention to the level design to advance successfully. Despite its stronger presentation it is still a game which looks and plays ""video gamey."" Not to its detriment, as its game mechanics are solid and the levels well designed. When Assassin's Creed goes the way of Guitar Hero people will probably still be going back to play this game.			"

At the time, its graphics amazed me; the flame seemed so realistic, the landscapes so beautiful. Its graphics are no longer impressive, but its art design is still beautiful, and what I loved about it so much has remained unparalleled in games since: Sands of Time is /beautifully/ written. Its story is moving, its characters are fleshed out with excellent arcs that are both central to and essential in the overall plot, and the unnamed Prince is a charming character.The puzzles were hard and often frustrating, and the combat was also often difficult, but to this day, Prince of Persia has the best writing I've seen in a video game, and the way the story and the gameplay intertwine is magical to behold.Buy this game, play this game, and beat this game.

PROS:+ awesome fairy tale story+ great work with narrative+ save point system+ puzzles, especially the ones with Farah+ parkour with dagger time rewind+ cutscenes+ no uPlayCONS:- graphical glitches- clunky combat- after a while the guard fighting gets repetitive- really REALLY wobbly camera- audio can go out of sync in rare occassionsComment:An epic, although sometimes clunky, introduction to the classic Sands of Time trilogy. For me also introduction to Ubisoft games. And I really liked it. The story is awesome and has that fairy tale feeling to it. This is especially due to the fact that the game is mostly played in the past and is a story told by the narrator. So if you die the commentator says that this is not what happened and starts from a checkpoint. I love this and it makes it unique. The combat is fun for a while but having to battle guards over and over can get repetitive. But this game is more about the jumping, platforming, climbing and dodging. The parkour here is only flawed by the VERY weird camera shifting that killed me more times than enemies did. Luckily there is the dagger of time so you can rewind those mistakes. However it needs to be recharged so you have a limited number of tries. Overall a very cool game that has some bugs and annoying parts which mostly fade next to the epic story telling and puzzles. Recommended!P.S.: the low game time is due to playing this game way back and just trying it out here if it works, which it mostly does although I had to disable Fog to see anything...			"

												I really wanted to enjoy this game and give it a good review. The Prince of Persia Trilogy are some of my favorite games of all time, and I enjoyed them quite a bit on both PS2 and the original Xbox. Also, PC generally tends to be the most backwards compatible platform out there, and really the place to go to in general for those of us with a bit of a nostalgia kick. I've been able to play the original Doom, the original Diablo, Quest for Glory 1, King's Quest 1 (remake), Dune 2, and countless other older games on my new computer (core i7 with SLI GTX 980s, 32 gb ram, and 5 ssds in a RAID on Windows 10) over the past year with little or no issues.There are far too many technical issues that ruin the experience here to make it worthwhile though. With having to set up resolutions outside of game to get it to even start to show up on modern monitors, a white out/fog glitch that makes it imposssible to see anything (and I mean anything, the prince, ground, walls, enemies all invisible), no real controller support, and the issues go on. Yes, most of the issues have solutions in the forums, and I probably would have been okay with one or two issues, but that there are so many. I have to go to too many different forum topics and edit ini files to get this game to the start of a playable state, makes it so I just can't recommend this version of it.If you want to play or replay this game, do yourself a favor and get the PS3 version off Playstation Network. It supports modern resolutions, widescreen, runs smoothly, and even supports active 3d if that's your thing. All with much less work than this version. I feel like if Ubisoft wants to continue selling this on steam, it needs warnigs about it's issues on the store page, or some serious patching love.			"

												OVERALL 9.6/10Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is a story rich action-adventure game. It was originally released for major platforms (at the time) in 2003. Age has only made this game more of a gem. For those who have played Prince of Persia games in the past, and even this one, I would definately reccomend this, it is worthy as one of your many games in your steam library. This game is vastly better than Prince of Persia: Forgotten Sands 2010. To all newcomers to the franchise, I believe that this is the best Prince of Persia game there is. It is perfectly priced as a cheap but reputable price: £6.99 (although I did buy this during a sale at 50% off, I would reccomend buying at its full price too).STORY 10/10The story is very immersive, you virtually become the Prince of Persia, as he parkours and fights is way through the palace. The well written story and script adds to the characters' personalities and emotions. As the Prince's emotions grew, I became more empathetic of his lonliness and suspicions. It took me approximately 7 hours and 30 mins to complete, it will keep you hooked towards the end where the story becomes more intense and close to an end. For a game of its time, this is HUGE. It definately will take many sittings to complete, as it has many save points to allow you to save and ""Continue my story from here...""GAMEPLAY 10/10Superbly varied and stylish combat, enemies become progressively harder, but base mechanics still apply. Few minor glitches do occur rarley however. Smooth mechanics of using 'The Sands' to travel through time to correct errors. Movement is fluent and fun, especially when doing parkour puzzles, and backflips during combat. The graphics are very ahead of its time, and there are some colossal areas to explore and mount during the game.PORT 9/10Runs like a dream, I had no problems running this on Win 8 and Win 10. I would drop it a point due to its lack of (1st party) Xbox One controller support, but using keyboard+mouse was seemless and after the first 30 mins of play feels natural and intended. Using keyboard does cause minor ♥♥♥♥-ups during parkour, but its nothing to ruin the experience.			"

												Before we talk about the game lets get technical.The port of this game is not great, my recent playthrough was all smooth sailing (apart from a deadzone issues with my Xbox360's left analogstick)  but other reviews note major issues. I'd recommend looking into them to see If you think its worth the possible effort of trouble shooting. Oh and no windowed mode.Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is a PS2 classic that blazed the way for the ""On-rails Platformers"" like Enslaved: OttW, while still keeping the fun of 3D platforming, the Prince is a agile sod capable of AMAZING feats of agility! Including wall running and wall jumping, while not the first game to do both it's done so well that why most people remember the prince. He can uses his AMAZING feats in combat too, using the enemies themselfs as things to vault over and cut from above, not to mention jumping from the terrain.Lucky they gave the prince a WHOLE arabian palace to run around in, and when I say whole I mean they squeezed every drop out of the setting. halls, gardens, ruins and even a smugglers cove. And dispite being released over 14 years ago it's aged better than most, Mostly do to with the really light bloom effect and the colours used. The game is either a warm orange or a soft night blue, and It does help hide the wrinkles.The palace is a silent place, nothing but the sounds of the prince, phara, the Azad's twisted defence systems or the corrupted wildlife. Unless you get into to combat, then all ambience is thrown out the window in favor of arabian metal(?). Music is very much a ""taste"" thing, but for me I love the battle soundtrack simply due it not really being done before this, also helps its good too. here have a listen to some of my picks

However the stark contrast between the platforming and combat is more than just some music, the combat is overplayed to the point of boredom. How it works is between every puzzle/platforming section sand creatures will attack. the goal is to knock them down and stab them with the dagger to ""defeat"" them, and the prince has enough tools to make it intresting...for a time. but as the game progresses the monotomy of it all starts to hapmer the fun. There is enough enemy type to give you a nice mix each time you fight, basically turning the fights into a sorta puzzle, finding out what tools to use to beat that mix of enemies. but then the waves start.In a effort to raise the difficulty or even make the game longer, after you kill the enemies in the room sometimes everything will feel like something missing, after 5-6 secounds of nothing a new identical wave of sand creatures show up, maybe even a third time who knows. All it does is slowly wittle you down bit by bit rather than having the damage be a big impact.It's still a good game, a fantastic 3D platformer with a functional combat system. Highly recommend it to anyone "

												Overall Score: 8/10Abstract: Solid 10 hours long Prince of Persia game, with well designed platforming / parkour settings, fun and challenging combat system and great aesthetic and atmosphere despite the dated graphics (launched in 2003 and reviewed in 2014). The story is quite linear but the ending is simple yet amazingly well done.Presentation: 8/10 Great aesthetic and atmosphere. Good looking levels and character motion. You're likely forget you're playing a 10+ years old game once you're in. Not a single bug was found through the entire game. Voice acting is a bit silly sometimes, but it doesn't hurt the experience. There's no native support for HD resolutions or X360 controller. The camera control got me annoyed sometimes.Gameplay:  9/10 Tight controls in both platforming and combat. Movement is fast and fluid, puzzles are simple and rewarding. The combat system is fairly simple (very similar to found in Batman: Arkham Asylum) but fights can get tough sometimes. Its combat core mechanics lacks of depth given that the player can only attack, dodge and block. Overall level design is well done.Story: 7/10 Predictable from the beggining and slow paced through the game. As the game is platforming driven with combats filling in between, the story take place mostly in background. The last hour of the game is filled with more interesting facts that lead to a very well written climax at the end of the game, that left me wishing to play the sequel.			"

												Just finished playing this game for the first time.  I was really impressed for how well it stands up today.  The combat must of been an inspiration for Batman: ArKham Asylum, as the controls and overall core mechanic are very simlar.  The game does suffer from some camera/control issues that you don't usually see in today's top games. Story is decent and for the most part the exporation and puzzles are well done.  The save system works great as a story telling device and allows the user to reload after death as though the story was just being told wrong and needed to be corrected.  The other core mechanic is the Dagger of Time and it works pretty well as a recovery tool which you need fairly often to fix some of the control issue mistakes.  Hmmm, wonder which came first?  Regardless this was an ejoyable game that I wished I had played when it first came out. Totaly hous played were around 20 as I explored everywhere I could.			"

												It only took me 8 years.  Something about this game's appearance just kept pushing me for nearly a decade; the cartoon-y style, the Ubisoft logo, &c.  I had to force myself to play it, and it only took an hour for all that charm and clever design to hook their juicy tentacles into me.  The PG, fairytale style is eerily mature when put up against its direct sequel, and for a game with such a minimal sense of  progression, the story and characters are richly layered.I only wish I never bothered to play the game's sequels.

												I grew up partially with this game, I remember when it came out on PS2 years ago and just loving this game to pieces, it's not your usual linear adventure, it actually holds an interesting story with great character development and incredible gameplay, especially for the time it came out. Words can't describe how amazing the soundtrack is by Stuart Chatwood, really immerses you in the experience with catchy music overall, even though it's all instrumental. I really recommend this game to anyone looking for a great game to play. Honestly gets a 10/10 from me. Probably an 11/10.			"

												Jordan Mechner managed to do what few franchises can do: reboot the series with a game better than the original. The Sands of TIme is a masterpiece in video game design, story telling, puzzling and a somewhat functioning combat system. If you get used to the combat of dodging, wall jumping and frog jumping over enemies to defeat them, then you shouldn't have a problem, yet the combat is the weakest part of the game. It can be frustrating and you may ask yourself, ""How many ♥♥♥♥ing sand soldiers are there?"" as they seemingly respawn for an infinite amount during the fight sequences. What is truly remarkable about the game is the character development of the Prince and his ability to grow affectionate for a sworn enemy. Now, if you do play this game on Steam, I highly recommend using a controller and binding the keys/actions in the games options, as the Keyboard and Mouse controls are clunky and extremely frustrating where I really wanted to quit playing the game, even though I was so close to beating it. Great game, terrible PC controls, use a controller.9.6/10			"

												Prince of Persia is an old game. That much is obvious. However it is more than worth it. The first to bring up the idea of rewinding time to fix your mistakes in parkouring instead of killing you instantly. Like plenty of platforming games of its' time a single mistake would normally send you to a quick death. With the time mechanics of PoP if you have the available resources you can go back and fix those mistakes. The combat is simple yet satisfying when you survive a horde of sand monsters. With a unique health recovery system of drinking water stumbling upon a basin of water or pool is like finding an oasis in the desert. While Prince of Persia is a classic game it has a few problems. The biggest one is sometimes the controls don't work too well on a mouse and keyboard. With the health system you can go a long time with low health and end up suffering a few frustrating deaths multiple times. There are also a few enemies that are lackluster (crows, scarabs) that get annoying. This is compounded by a short animation that plays of your character putting his weapons away that you can't skip. The last con is that save points have you seeing a vision of a possible future. While it is a neat way of giving you hints there are far too many that are close to each other. To sum it up Prince of Persia is the start of a good series that hit a home run despite the few problems it has. If you want a classic platformer this is the game for you with crazy contraptions and fun applications of platforming. This game is plenty of fun.			"

												Reminds me a bit of Tomb Raider, for obvious reasons, but with more combat too.The combat works quite well, but if you mess up, you can reverse time an increasing amount of times as you progress, making it less and less likely that you'll run out of reverse power. If you do manage to run out, the game is very forgiving in its checkpoints and save points.The only thing I would change about this game is the fact that you're escorting a character pretty much throughout the entire game, which can lead to a lot of annoying combat situations and deaths. All I shall say about it is ""You have a bow, stupid NPC! Learn the meaning of RANGED COMBAT!""Overall, a decent fun game, I actually want to play it again already after having only just beaten it. Just make sure you use a controller if you get this game, it's not often good for keyboards.			"

												Even after 13 years this game still looks and plays quite well. Just be sure to turn off fog and configure your controller (double click with mouse in options menu). HOWEVER, some jumping is woefully inaccurate, the camera can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ sometimes, puzzles are 90% easy, but 10% of the time you wonder just where the hell you are supposed to even go.And now my biggest bug bear - combat: It would have been better to just remove it completely, because it is SO bad. You get to fight 10-20 enemies in each encounter. They respawn if you don't kill them quickly (a dagger finishing move you have to perform on every beaten enemy). They teleport after you, they swarm you and surround you, and when you're down on the floor you're as good as dead. That being said, most enemies are cannon fodder and dispatched easily enough, but some enemies (blue ones) can't be vaulted over, and they hit hard and fast, compared to the rest of the enemies. These are insanely frustrating since they make up most of the enemies encountered after the first quarter of the game. Combat is uninspired and irritating. As if that wasn't reason enough to hate it, you also have to keep an eye out on your companion, who inexplicably is NOT AT ALL able to move out of harm's way, meaning she will not move...at all, and frequently die, because she thinks she can take on a 3 meter sand monster with her bow and arrow in close combat...*sigh*. The game would be easier without her ""help"".Apart from that it's still an entertaining, albeit quite old, game.			"

												I wonder why parents of planet Earth still haven't sue Ubisoft Montreal for such horrible camera and extremely sheety combat system due to phychological damage to their children.Movements of the Prince are attached to THAT camera; and everything would have been alright, if THIS camera had been relized not by means of crooked ♥♥♥♥ ! When you entering a room pressing ""S"", THAT camera immediately chooses such position forcing you to go back where you come from. Or even better: The Prince jumps from one wall to another, and as far as he climbs up THAT camera could change its position, and after that in 99% the Prince will never jump anymore.The combat system is terribly annoying. Because fights are long, tiresome, and not funny at all. Especialy when four guys surround you, and one of them punches you to lie on the back, and after it three guys performing a combat attack of two-three movements. Sometimes it worse than Dark Souls, but correct me if I wrong; this game is created for children ! Not for 50 shades of grey fanbase !These two things completely outweighting pluses of the game, but it has someting which cannot be corrupted: its wonderful atmosphere of fairytale, little time travels, light oriental metal music, and very very charming beautiful credit song.If you like Dark Souls franchise or you are the lucky owner of ""Hunt is my mistress"" achievement, this game created special for you.P.

												Finished this game, first time on Steam, third time ever.I judged this game both by that time period and by ours.From that point of view, the game is totally mesmerizing, different locations, amazing graphics, different game models. Also, the gameplay and the story are awesome.The only problem I encountered was bugging in mouse/keyboard. Sometimes Prince seemed to continue to ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuun in some direction as if the keyboard key is stuck. Maybe it's because of Win8, maybe because of me playing on a laptop, or some other problem. These were scarce. Didn't ruin the whole experience of that (oh, yes, AC Unity, it's a nod to you).Judging from contemporary point of view, it appears even better. Of course, now the graphics like that can be found wanting. But from the gameplay mechanics - it's even better in some aspects that some games  today. For instance, here we have different types of enemies: some block vaulting, some - sand-consuming mid-air, some cannot be hit while jumping of a wall - even though your strategy is more or less the same every battle, the actual fight sequence differs. Compare that to latest Assassin's Creed games where the difference in the enemy is that you can either kill him with a counter, or you have to disarm his first.If you haven't played the game, I strongly advise for it.

												Great game but terrible PC port with a shocking number of issues:- Gamepad controller support is terrible, doesn't even detect Xbox One diagonal inputs without using XInputPlus, even then it still feels ""off""- Have to disable fog just to see anything you're doing- Have to change the default VSync option to prevent glitches where ledges send the prince flying into the air- Cutscenes play at more than 2x speed with the dialogue lagging behind- A lot of minor control and graphical glitchesThis is truly the worst PC port I've dealt with thus far. If you want to play the original trilogy properly, you'll have to do it on console unfortunately.			"

												I used to really love this game, and thought I'd go back and play it. Man it really doesn't stand up.The camera is the games worst enemy. It seems to think where you want it as more of a suggestion than a hard and fast rule. Same with the movement. Want to dodge away from an enemy? Game thinks it's better to roll around them, right into the next enemy's swinging sword. Want to jump to that pillar? The camera will move at the last milisecond, and now you're jumping into a pit. Sure, you can rewind to undo those, but it's still annoying that you have to.Also, I don't need to see a close up of the prince putting his sword away after every little fight. The story is great, and so is the music. It's a little annoying that there's no widescreen mode, but that's to be expected from a game this old.The final straw is that the game doesn't like my Xbox controller, so I have to play with keyboard and mouse. Which I wouldn't have a problem with, except the  game is clearly made with a controller in mind.I kind of wish I never bothered, and just left this game with my nostalgia goggles on.			"

												I loved the original game that came on PS2 & then remastered on the PS3. I bought the trilogy edition on both platforms. My only complaint is that, binding the keys to an Xbox 360 controller is not user friendly & is down right frustrating. You would think that the devs would do a better job at doing better controller support, for an old classic that came on the consoles. I feel the console versions are more superior than the Steam version & its highly reccommended you play with controller than with keyboard & mouse. Despite trying everything to resolve my issue with binding the analog sticks to the camera controls, I requested a refund to show how disappointed I was with the lack of proper controller support!I recommend you buy this from else where rather than buying it from here.

												Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a 3D action puzzler that cleverly combines ingenious puzzle design with a very intuitive time control function. The one thing that completely blows my mind about this game is it’s puzzle creativity. Forget Assassin’s Creed free roaming puzzles, PoP:SOT takes a ♥♥♥♥ on AC’s creativity. The combat in PoP:SOT, while fun, isn’t very complex, you dodge, slash, repeat.The one thing that may tarnish this game’s enjoyment is the epic fail camera controls. Even at maximum sensitivity, I barely spin a whole 90 degrees with maximum mouse movement. Also the stupid cutscene that plays every single time your Prince character sheath his saber will surely annoy you by the 50th time you see it. Regardless of these few issues, PoP:SOT is still one of the better games in my steam collection, and I highly recommend it.			"

												This game is a classic, and definitely still deserves to be played... if it's free. The frustrating overabundance of short cut scenes that aren't skippable and often affect time in-game. These scenes likely take up more of the game than the actual play time and make passing milestones feel tedious. The controls would be great, but a nausiating camera that rarely feels in you control constantly wreaks havoc on the controls relative to which direction you want to go. I found that this lead to most of my frustrating failures.This game had its day, and some features are fun to look back on, but it isn't worth more than a nostalgia trip.			"

												This is a classic game that could have once been an example of innovative game design.   Unfortunately, your biggest obstacle will be the camera angles in the game.  Just moving around and getting from Point A to Point B is an annoyance when it works at its best.   The wall running and jumping was cool, but made frustrating when trying to use early on in the game.I was ready to uninstall it before I could even get the Sands of Time.  This may be a shoddy port like all of Ubisoft games these days, or this game has just aged horribly.Either way, I don't recommend it.  At least, don't buy it on Steam.  Try finding an old console system copy of the game from Gamestop or something.			"

												Omg I love this game. My fav Prince of Persia. 1 major issue, how the game reacts to the gamepad controller (360). When you use it and map your controls to what ever button you want, it forces you to walk. I've tried pretty much everything. When you want to run around and feel like you can't, it's frustrating. If they can fix this, it would get 10\10, but as of now the bad controls just takes away from the experience and I don't really want to play with a keyboard and mouse.			"

												Have only played this game for 30 minutes and have given up.  The game seems fantastic with excellent graphics and story, and i really loved giving the parkour side a run but the game is very difficult to control.  I made it to the wall jumping section for the dagger but found the control seems to almost randomly jump between mouse view and platformer view (ie: still camera view with  left, right, forwards, and backwards).  This seems to be most common when near walls and can make it near impossible to line up a wall to parkour across.  I wont even mention the button mashing to get up the chimney like walls to the dagger.  Unfortunately this has detracted greatly from the fun of playing the game and i will be giving this one a big miss for the future.			"

												The combat in this game is absolutely atrocious. Endless waves of copypasta enemies swarm the player constantly, the only way to dispose of them permanently is to knock them to zero hp and then perform a long animation in which you absorb them into your dagger (in which you're prone and anything can attack you to interrupt it). The parkour is impressive at first, but it all boils down to you looking around the room for the next ledge/pole/alclove to jump towards. It's a where's waldo of eyeballing the room, almost as bad as the recent zelda games.  "

												I really wanted to like this game. It has that wonderful Arabian Nights vibe and wall-running, so how could it go wrong? Well, it manages to, mostly due to its age. The camera gets in the way, the puzzles are dull, the combat is repetitive (and dull), the auto-aiming is horrid, and some of the basic controls are finicky (e.g., wall-running and time-control). I'm sure that if I had played this when it came out on the original Xbox, and had I been 13 at the time, I would have loved it. It's unfortunate, though, that I've played too many games that do too many of the things this game attempts - but better.			"

												One of the worst, if not THE worst, ports to PC that I've ever played. This game has so much potential but I haven't been more frustrated with a game since the N64 days when I was 12. The god-awful combat sections are enough to say you should pass this game over, but I could also add things like: The audio system is terrible; crank dialogue up to 100% and everything else to 10% to hear anything. The anti-success camera seems to intentionally do exactly the worst possible thing at any given moment, making control almost impossible. The movement controls are really buggy, in the sense that you will find yourself constantly doing the wrong thing for the buttons you pressed and the situation you were in (hold northwest to go south?). Get used to playing the same 10 minutes over and over for an hour, so you can move onto the next hour-long 10 minute chunk.This game LOOKS like it should be good, and the reviewers loved it. They're obviously not reviewing the same version of the game.			"

												I had a lot of problems with the PC port of this game.-I had slowdown because I was using a dual core. I needed to let the game run on a single core to make it run better but it still has slowdowns from time to time.- You need to configure gamepad controls yourself, there are no gamepad controls in the menu.- Changing the volume of my pc changed nothing about the volume of the game.- I kept fighting against the camera. My mouse barely moves it.EDIT: I made the game work by using an older PC and using the gamepad for controls instead of mouse + keyboard (still no gamepad controls in menu).The platforming is very enjoyable, unfortunately the environment doesn't change too much. I think the pacing is also a bit off even though the game is pretty short. You get banter between characters but there are many, many rooms between story progression that I feel could've been cut out.The combat is very simplistic and the battles took way too long to complete which made it quite tedious.I very much liked the ending, which kindof made me ignore all the negative points? I'll be checking out the sequels and see how they change.			"

												If you're planning on buying this game for the sake of understanding the Prince's timeline, be my guest.  However, be warned. The amount of rage you'll be incurring will be close to herniating. At the worst possible times, terrain restrictions will change your camera angle to one that is completely unreasonable and then leaving you to your fate of jumping off cliffs, wasting Sand, etc. Also, the number of time enemies will reject you from standing up are more than necessary, and you'll find yourself dying several times too many. I understand that this is an older game, and that these things should already be apparent, but it doesn't hurt to further your information.			"

												I played the demo for this way back in the day and decided to revisit it. Why was this considered innovative again? The combat is nonsense. When you start a fight, there's no indication how long it could go on, because enemies spawn in waves, and how many is anyone's guess. Their AI is mindless. They just crowd around and jostle you and each other while attacking every few seconds. Frequently your character will be blocked from view by this. Allegedly you can aim your strikes by using WASD while attacking but in practice it's a crapshoot, and even worse with the dagger.The platforming is pathetically easy, except for when you drop like a rock in the middle of a totally legit jump because the game has another route in mind for you to take. The environments are sprawling, homogenous and arbitrary; half of them have no apparent function but to be filled with booby traps. The puzzles look daunting but ultimately are paper tigers.Instead of playing this, why not track down the first three Harry Potter PC games? Basically the same mechanics, and they were as wretched as this one too, but there was a charming humility about them. You got to play as Harry Potter and explore Hogwarts and collect beans and magical trading cards and interact with your favorite Harry Potter characters and stuff. It was goofy and kind of cute. This game's shortcomings combined with its pomposity make it just that much worse.			"

Perhaps they added the rewind mechanic to make up for non-precise controls, but that just isn't good enough for me.Add to this resolutions that can't get anywhere close to today's standard resolutions, and you'll have serious problems if you're using your TV as your monitor. Luckily I have a computer monitor, but today's times call for 720p, or 1080p as a minimum.

And the most important aspect, platforming, is completely cut and paste. this game will remind you of the type of game you found in ""9'99 or less"" baskets in Gamestop during the 2000's.The game is insanely linear. The entire game is a rinse and repeat cycle. You go from point A to point B in a serious of platforming stunts, then you enter a room with endlessly spawing enemies where you must block or attack or dodge for about 10 minutes. There is no feeling of progression, you dont get cool weapons or armor or anything to make you want to keep playing.My advice is to stay far away from this. The entire Tomb Raider series does this type of precision platforming style so much better. Even the original 1996 Tomb Raider is so much better than this.			"

Unfortunatley like other good memories, i also found that game was now in fact awful, and reminding of being molested in the shed.The jumping puzzles r fkn stoopid 1/10			"

												After years of Tomb Raider, Ubisoft decided to take the next evolutionary step in platforming and reboot a long forgotten classic franchise into another long forgotten relic that inspired many games we have today(assassin creed, uncharted, etc.). In 2003 this game was considered a masterpiece, fast forward 10 years, and this game might no longer be recognised by the masses at all. But i stil consider it to be, to this day, one of the most amazing gaming expirience i ever had.			"

												Despite its age still fun, enjoyed the story and the Prince's random musings.  Camera felt a bit off during some of the platforming but, otherwise great.  Combat on the other hand was rather annoying having to deal with crowd control while still having to individually ""finish off"" every bloody enemy, not to mention regular combat was pretty ineffecient having to combo enemies while not getting ♥♥♥♥♥ from behind, only after learning the few 1-shot methods did the combat feel more managable.

												You like that Parkour stuff, right? Right? The combat is a bit frustrating sometimes, but all of the athletics you do more than makes up for it - the part right near the end is especially gruesome with the fact that your saving grace (ability to rewind time) is gone, and it's the perfect way to see how good you've gotten at all of that walljumping by spending at least 10-20 minutes of your life dying repeatedly. Also this game was made back in the time of the Gamecube so it runs very smoothly nowadays. Recommended to play with a USB controller offering 10 buttons and two joysticks, and an experience you might want to play twice.			"

												An oldie but still a goodie that is enjoyable for fans of platform games.The story is well told in the spirit of the mystical arabian nights with interesting twists. Although the graphics may feel a little dated now, the action is still buttery smooth and certain obstacles you encounter will challenge your puzzle solving skills.Music and sound are appropriately themed and adds alot to the feel of the game.Character animation feels very fluid and you will sometimes be amazed at the near impossible jumps and superb acrobatic skills of your character. Combat  feels a little tedious however, as the controls felt slightly repetitive.Overall Rating: 7.5 / 10Definitely worth to buy if you like an action based platform game. Don't miss it.			"

												Enter a beautifully designed representation of Ancient Persia, as you're drawn through an epic narrative beginning with a strong, sheltered prince, whom is beset upon by a tragic event, prompting him to do all in his power to set things to right. This game is entertaining, and offers challenge as it does puzzles, letting you get a fine mix of puzzling acrobatics, and dangerous combat.			"

												A beautifully executed piece of interactive art. Combat can admittedly become repetitive but generally flows well and melds with the Prince's parkour movement skills. Story is marvelously well crafted and merges with gameplay., characters are well written and above all loveable. And exploring the masterfully atmospheric arabian environments all sum up to a simply excellent, near perfect gaming experience. If you haven't yet had the pleasure to play Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, you should fix that.			"

												Prince of persia: the sands of time-первый принц в трехмерном пространстве,созданный умелыми руками ubisoft montreal под пристальным вниманием Джордана Мехнера(создатель принца),считатется самой лучшей частью из всех.С этим трудно не согласиться:графика,которая и по сей день выглядит неплохо(учитывая,что игра 2003 года),полное погружение в атмосферу восточной сказки и тот самый поцелуй принца и дочери Махараджи-Фары(необычное имя)-в конце игры.Минусы:их попросту нет.

												Game has great graphics for a 2003 game and it is the first installment of the Prince of Perisa series (Except for the one online).The game is amazing and well done not just some lousy story and really crap graphics slappped on. The Prince of Persia Series has 5 games and you can buy all of them off of steam. All of them are $10 except maybe Prince of Perisa: The Forgotten Sands.This game is worth your money and it is long enough to keep you busy for a while. This game does not need really high graphics card or a good processor. Again decent game and it is not to expensive and I recommend this game to all who are reading			"

With action, time manipulation and Arabian-Nights-inspired theme, it comes fresh and charming.

												A decade later this game is still one of the best in its genre, with fun puzzles, challenging platforming sections and beautifully cinimatic, and extremely smooth and intuitive combat. In fact, this game has been one that I have continuously compared modern games against and found them lacking in comparasson. The game also has a clever sense of humor and a reasonably good story. My only complaints are that Fera is not the most interesting character, and that the final boss was underwhelming and felt mundain compared to the rest of the game.			"

												I meant to play this back in the early 2000s, but I somehow forgot about it.  Having now played it, I can safely say that it's an extremely fun (and for its time, highly innovative) game, fully deserving of its ""classic"" status.  The graphics have aged a bit, but fortunately it's one of those ""clean"" looking early 2000s games, not one of those yucky muddy ones.  The combat is a bit sloppy and in general, astoundingly difficult for an acrobatic platformer, but you eventually come to grips with it.  On the whole, I really enjoyed the gameplay and the simple, well-told story.			"

												I mostly recommend this game as a counterpoint to its terrible sequels, PoP: Warrior Within and Two Thrones (I never bothered playing Forgotten Sands due to WW and TT). PoP 2008 as a reboot is a different thing and I do give it a proper actual recommendation.I played this game originally back when it was released a decade ago, and had a blast. The rewinding time mechanics were truly a wonderful technological and gameplay innovation. Playing through a second time recently was a bit of a challenge due to things such as terrible camera angles and changes that are barely controllable (it must not have seemed so bad then, but is nearly unforgivable now), combat is simple and a bit enjoyable but seems mostly to be a grind to refill time sand used to rewind time. The time rewinding mechanics are still fun and neat, but now just seem more and more like a limited use and poorly implemented quicksave and quickload or checkpoint system. It just seems punitive when bad camera angles, blind jumps, and controls that do not always do what you want cost you time sand over and over. Other modern issues to tackle are unsurprisingly difficult support for modern monitor aspect ratios and resolutions, but they are not horrible with a little tweaking. The story, character interactions, and wit are just about as good as ever. Though the voice audio is annoyingly quiet at times compared to the rest of the games volume.			"

												This is one hell of a game. By far the best game I have played in a while. Story is absolutely perfect, dialogs are vivid and realistic.  Acrobatic sequences aren't too hard, because you can reverse time. So, one mistake doesn't send you to the beginning. There are even some puzzles, but don't worry, they are easy and fun to solve. Fighting enemies is joy to watch, because prince is doing some incredible moves, however you must learn different combos, otherwise you are screwed. Later in the game some fights are hard, I'll say too hard. This is only major drawback I can think of - there are no difficulty settings. By far the hardest part in the game is fight in a elevator. It took me about 20 tries to beat it. I can definitely recommend this game. Oh, I forget to mention the soundtrack, it is top class. I love the music.			"

I have to warn about some bugs I encountered during the playthrough: in a couple of occasions the prince decided he would not be able to make the jump to the ledge on the other side and fall down to his doom. Only on a second or third try he had enough of dying and made the jump. The absence of subs with the VERY low voice audio at times will make you miss out on some dialouges.In the end despite its flaws if you are looking to relive the adventure of the prince you wont be disappointed but because of some annoying audio issues and clunky camera/controls I will give it a 7/10.

												The oldest Prince of Persia. Its graphics may not hold up and the story may not be its strongest point, but they're both statisfying and the whole Sands of Time experience is done perfectly. The plot, however, gets better as you venture further, so the ending is one of the most well executed sequences I've ever seen.			"

												The Sands of Time is a magnificent emulation of the Tales of the Arabian Nights, told with dated but functional tech.The story is what to come for here. It is masterfully told, and was one of the first games I remember to really embrace the unique medium of video games. Whether it's the Prince's narration during the pause screen, or the moment you realize exactly how the main menu fits into the plot. The Sands of Time stands apart as a true masterpiece of video game storytelling.The platforming, parkour gameplay, which eventually inspired Assassin's Creed, was surprisingly polished and fluid for the time. Gamers that have grown accustomed to more modern games may find it a bit simple, but gamers that remember the many headaches of 3D platforming on N64 will appreciate the ability to execute leaps and ledge grabs with precision. This game was clearly designed for analogue stick movement however; having to use WASD to move is a travisty.The combat has always been the low point of this game. At best, it's a tedious, repetive affair, forcing you to learn the exact combination of acrobatic and combat skills to bring an enemy down easiest, and repeat that over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. At worst the combat is downright broken. The camera has tremendous difficulty keeping the Prince's schitzophrenic auto targeted foes in frame while bouncing off walls and around pillars. The Prince himself seems utterly unable to avoid striking the wrong target. A noteworthy design flaw is the fact that you can only block/parry when you are focused on an enemy, but you only focus on the last enemy that hit you, and it's rare for the same enemy to attack twice in a row.Even with the poor controls, camera issues, and tedious combat, The Sands of Time is worth playing for anyone interested in pushing video games as a valid storytelling medium. It shines even among modern games as the standard for story quality while making the telling an accomplishment that couldn't be done in any other medium.			"

												As a first time player, I can understand why this game has a good reputation but if I were to sum up my feeling of it it would be this: Feels fluent yet clunky.By clunky, I mean the controls. They're minimal, sure but I keep finding myself trying to jump off a wall or dodge in a particular direction but more often then not I wind up jumping the wrong way and rolling straight into enemies. This gets amplifed by the fact the direction depends on where the camera is facing and I have to wrestle with said camera ALL THE TIME. It doesn't help that the game oftens moves the camera on you and you have to guess which direction is the one you want to go. It's unbelievably frustrating.However, if you can bare having to deal with the camera switching directions on you, the game can be quite fun. Running off walls, flipping switches, fencing with... undead sand people, etc. You'll even eventually have a companion with you that helps out along the way. Said companion will frequently comment on what the player character is doing during gameplay such as being initially scared of you using a save point and eventually learning that it's harmless.If you want to see what the fuss is about, I say get this game. Just be aware of the annoying camera issues.			"

												Just a heads up: if you're going to play any of this trilogy you need to play all three, and in order. Okay. Sands of Time is an absolute gem of a game and it is by far the best of the trilogy overall. The characters are memorable, the story is novel, if not truly unique. The gameplay is elegant and flowing, and the eponymous Sands of Time fits perfectly into it. Among other things the Sands allow you to rewind up to ten seconds to retry a jump you missed or combat you messed up, which is both constantly handy and occasionally hilarious. However, the puzzles can get frustrating, and the other games improve vastly on the combat and platforming.			"

												I love this game, it really captures the fun of PS2 action-platformers. The platforming is simple, yet incredibly fun, deceptively addictive and challenging at times. The voice-acting is excellent and the Prince is a pretty cool character to play as, the story is great as well. The visuals are low-quality compared to today, but that's because it came out a full 11 years ago. My only gripes would be the wonky camera that sometimes gives you these terrible angles when you want to jump from place to the next and trying to fight monsters, it's just annoying. The combat is not very good as well, it's rather repetitive and unspiried. You can do some cool moves like kick off walls to do a leap strike or vault over a monster, but after a while, the euphria of it all wears off. Monsters will surround you in these large mobs then knocking you down on the ground, and because the getting up animation is so long, they can just combo you to death without you even getting a chance to hit back, it's pretty rage-inducing. You can work around the combat, just be sure to use the dagger of time and don't let yourself get mobbed. These flaws, however, do not detract very much from the overall game and can be overlooked pretty easily. Prince of persia is the perfect game if you're looking to get into action platforming or hoping to revisit the good 'ol days when we used to play Mario, Jak and Dexter and ratchet and clank and the like.Recommended to anyone. Highly Recommended to those who enjoy action-platformers in particular.			"

												The first game of the new Prince of Persia trilogy, The Sands of Time is an adventure game featuring puzzle-solving and action parts in the spectacular world of Persia. You have to fight your way through a tumble-down, but royal persian castle and discover the more ancient civilizations it covers. The gameplay not as ordinary as it sounds first; you can kill your enemies in many ways, using the acrobatic skills of the prince and the environment. You can even manipulate time. And if it's not enough there is an other survivor out there: the beatiful princess, Farah.Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a game of fight, action, puzzle solving and acrobatics with a dazing storyline of love and treason. Coming with a pretty charming soundtrack, it's one of the best games of all times.			"

												Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is a classic, and the series as a whole is definitely something to check out, if you haven't.  That being said, this is the first one, meaning they hadn't necessarily caught their stride yet.  Its definitely still worth the play, but not every mechanic is well done.  Only one comes to mind, when I say this: combat.Combat feels awful: its wave after wave of the same enemies, for no real purpose.  It doesn't really make it hard, just frustrating; the idea is, eventually between the 30 baddies we throw your way, you're going to slip up and get hit.  If you're really unlucky, it will be in a cluster you can't hope to escape. Oh, and to make sure its possibly to get you in that cluster, we're going to give you someone to protect, so you better engage everyone.  Finally, that combo you just pulled may have knocked him down, but the final blow still needs to be dealt, and good luck getting that off with 3 enemies clustered around you.  If I could, I'd yank out every instance of combat and throw it away, and the game would be better for it.Platforming is really where the game shines: it basically invented modern day 3d platforming, and those mechanics still feel tight.  This is what I play the game for, and where most of the fun will come.The puzzles are nothing special, for sure.  Its your standard ""pull the switches in this order"" or ""redirect the beams of light"" puzzles; uninspiring for the modern gamer, but it gets the job done.All in all, its a classic: you should probably play it at least once.

												The Sands of Time is a game I have played several dozen times or more on my Nintendo Gamecube. It's brilliant. The time-control mechanics were (in my opinion at the time) revolutionary and I had never come across a game that could exploit and make such use of this feature. In a nutshell: this game is a must have. The story can be completed in an average of 6 hours but the characters are lifelike, the gameplay is very smooth and fast (and will remind you very much of a pre-generation Assassin's Creed), the visuals and music are fantastic while the whole experience in general being pure fun.The Sands of Time series are far better than the current iterations of the Prince of Persia series.

As for the camera, I'm using a widescreen patch and playing at 1920 x 1080, so I'm not sure if there is some bugginess with my setup; but I've found the camera to be really hard to orient, especially during fights.

												Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is one of the great classics, and it is that for a reason. Aside from the compelling plot and memorable characters, Sands of Time features some of the best puzzle-platforming you'll find in any game. Fluid acrobatics across the rafters of ornate palace rooms and along the sides of immense towers combine with the perfect safety mechanism - the ability to briefly rewind time and undo that disastrous jump or ill-timed leap into a rotating saw blade. The rewind ability is limited in use so that it doesn't become a crutch or make things too easy, but remains effective at helping to curb the frustration that would result from, for instance, a single mistake at the very end of a run of successes. Combined with the brilliant and challenging level design, intuitive controls, and enough hidden secrets to make it worth playing over again, Sands of Time is an extremely satisfying game.			"

												The first game in perhaps the best ""action adventure platformer sword combat"" trilogy ever made. The combat in this particular iteration was not as deep and satisfying as that in Warrior Within, but it has wonderful puzzles and platforming is an absolute joy. The time related mechanics keep the game from being too punishing without making it easy (the game would keep more or less the same level of difficulty if they were removed, but they keep it from becoming annoying). Also, the game is filled to the brim with charm. Everything from the visual art direction to the music makes you want to lose yourself in the game world. I highly recommend the Sands of Time trilogy to anyone that likes puzzle platformers with good combat systems and a wonderful story.P.S. It's amazing how the same team that created this also created Assassin's Creed which has extremely dumbed down combat and platforming (comparatively at least). I love the Assassin's Creed series but every time I play one of those games I can't help but think that it would have been a better game if more of the mechanics were similar to the Sands of Time trilogy.

												The game that brought back one of the best gaming heroes of early PC gaming.  I was a huge fan of the original Prince of Persia game, so I was very skepticle if a decent new game could be accomplished.  What set the original apart was its fantastic animation of the main character.  Well, they did it.  The prince's animations in this game are not only fantastic, but functional.  He has a host of awesome movement and combat moves which are brilliantly rendered.  While the combat is not too difficult to master, it is the puzzling out how to move through each area that will make playiing the game fun.  Learning how to use all of the Prince's many acrobatic moves and when is challenging but rewarding.  The story is superb and original and the way the Prince narrates, even while playing, really helps place you there.			"

												This is one of my all time favorite games. Though it suffers a bit from camera issues every now and then, the gameplay atmosphere, music and visuals are top notch. The combat is pretty simple but the platforming is amazing and fun. It's very well narrated by The Prince himself. All in all, it's an amazing game worth trying out.			"

												The Sands of Time is a game I have played several dozen times or more on my Nintendo Gamecube. It's brilliant. The time-control mechanics were (in my opinion at the time) revolutionary and I had never come across a game that could exploit and make such use of this feature. In a nutshell: this game is a must have. The story can be completed in an average of 6 hours but the characters are lifelike, the gameplay is very smooth and fast (and will remind you very much of a pre-generation Assassin's Creed), the visuals and music are fantastic while the whole experience in general being pure fun.The Sands of Time series are far better than the current iterations of the Prince of Persia series. Buy them all!			"

												As one who has played this game way back around 2003, I found it a very nostalgic experience.  After reviewing other reviews, both the good and the bad, I have come to a fair conclusion:Most people think this game is amazing, due to nostalgia, or hate it because they felt that the nostalgic audience were completely wrong.  In my opinion, I think the game good, not exellent or fantasic, but just good.  (8/10)Why is this?  Well, going over the facts, nostalgia, although present in my opinion, is not the entirity of it.  There a few glitches here and there, most of which wont be found unless you play like I do.  Nothing too game breaking either.  The camera, which many complain is very bad is actually extremely good most of the time.  If you are right in the center of combat, especially with bird enemies, it starts spinning out of control, but it is still managable.  Most jumps may have ""difficult"" camera angles until you realise that most are marked with shadows or moss.  The game, although seeming easy at first, escalates throughout the story at a decent rate.  This being an old classic, does have great graphics for its time, although some do seem a little lazy as well.  Most of the animations are smooth as well, although if you are playing for animations rather than the puzzles and combat, I would suggest a game that is made a little later than 2003.  The story may seem a little short, but is executed well and is great considering the limitations of console memory back in the day.  Lastly, the soundtrack and effects are executed quite well throughout the game.All in all, this game is overrated by most who have replayed it and underrated by the ones who chalk up hating the game because ""it is only for nostalgic people.""  I think it desires an 8/10 considering that it is relatively functional and has a great story and system of play behind it. I highly recommend a controller, since this was originally a console game.  I am guessing that some of the people who hated either didnt take the time to lay out a gamepad (controller) or didn't have one.  If you dont have one, this game may seem more of a 5 to 7/10.To finally conclude after such a long rant, it is a classic that recieves mixed ratings that are mostly bias and uncritical.  It is worth the price, and even more worth getting it on sale.  Dont drop it the second things dont go your way, that is what is suppose to happen in game in the first place!My final and official rating: 8/10			"

												A classic gaming adventure through time and back again, this game offers a decent storyline with an interesting gameplay. The gameplay mainly consists of jumping and sprinting-on-walls-puzzles and killing mobs vice versa. The puzzles were fairly straight-forward, but because of some features it felt like the difficulty of the gameplay was almost nonexistent, however throughout the game all these elements still created a nice flow to it. In conclusion if you're a hardcore player that seeks a challenge this game is probably not for you.The most frustrating parts were the camera angles, which probably worked like a charm if you knew exactly were you're going, but if not, like me sometimes it can be a nuisance. However when no camera related issues were at hand the gameplay was very enjoyable. Even after almost 15 years the aestetics of the game still looks very pleasing to the eye. Overall their were some wonkyness from time to time, but not enough to ruin the game imo. Bare in mind that it's also a fairly short game, but in the end still worth the 5 Euros I paid on the sale.

												Despite its age still fun, enjoyed the story and the Prince's random musings.  Camera felt a bit off during some of the platforming but, otherwise great.  Combat on the other hand was rather annoying having to deal with crowd control while still having to individually ""finish off"" every bloody enemy, not to mention regular combat was pretty ineffecient having to combo enemies while not getting ♥♥♥♥♥ from behind, only after learning the few 1-shot methods did the combat feel more managable.

												After years of Tomb Raider, Ubisoft decided to take the next evolutionary step in platforming and reboot a long forgotten classic franchise into another long forgotten relic that inspired many games we have today(assassin creed, uncharted, etc.). In 2003 this game was considered a masterpiece, fast forward 10 years, and this game might no longer be recognised by the masses at all. But i stil consider it to be, to this day, one of the most amazing gaming expirience i ever had.			"

												An oldie but still a goodie that is enjoyable for fans of platform games.The story is well told in the spirit of the mystical arabian nights with interesting twists. Although the graphics may feel a little dated now, the action is still buttery smooth and certain obstacles you encounter will challenge your puzzle solving skills.Music and sound are appropriately themed and adds alot to the feel of the game.Character animation feels very fluid and you will sometimes be amazed at the near impossible jumps and superb acrobatic skills of your character. Combat  feels a little tedious however, as the controls felt slightly repetitive.Overall Rating: 7.5 / 10Definitely worth to buy if you like an action based platform game. Don't miss it.			"

												You like that Parkour stuff, right? Right? The combat is a bit frustrating sometimes, but all of the athletics you do more than makes up for it - the part right near the end is especially gruesome with the fact that your saving grace (ability to rewind time) is gone, and it's the perfect way to see how good you've gotten at all of that walljumping by spending at least 10-20 minutes of your life dying repeatedly. Also this game was made back in the time of the Gamecube so it runs very smoothly nowadays. Recommended to play with a USB controller offering 10 buttons and two joysticks, and an experience you might want to play twice.			"

												The first game of the new Prince of Persia trilogy, The Sands of Time is an adventure game featuring puzzle-solving and action parts in the spectacular world of Persia. You have to fight your way through a tumble-down, but royal persian castle and discover the more ancient civilizations it covers. The gameplay not as ordinary as it sounds first; you can kill your enemies in many ways, using the acrobatic skills of the prince and the environment. You can even manipulate time. And if it's not enough there is an other survivor out there: the beatiful princess, Farah.Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a game of fight, action, puzzle solving and acrobatics with a dazing storyline of love and treason. Coming with a pretty charming soundtrack, it's one of the best games of all times.			"
